how to achieve that look pretty easily

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.880 
how to achieve that look pretty easily
and<00:00:33.390> then<00:00:33.540> how<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> smooth<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.140> over<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and then how to smooth it over so that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.069 
and then how to smooth it over so that
it<00:00:35.010> doesn't<00:00:35.309> look<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.180> giant

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it doesn't look like you have a giant

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.750 
it doesn't look like you have a giant
rat's<00:00:37.380> nest<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> back<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.309> head<00:00:38.460> okay

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
rat's nest in the back of your head okay

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.700 
rat's nest in the back of your head okay
so<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.660> look<00:00:39.960> you're<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.410> need<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
so for this look you're going to need a

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.619 
so for this look you're going to need a
fine-tooth<00:00:43.710> comb<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> one

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
fine-tooth comb and I also like the one

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.060 
fine-tooth comb and I also like the one
with<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.840> metal<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> ends<00:00:46.739> because<00:00:46.920> then

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
with the metal on the ends because then

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.520 
with the metal on the ends because then
it<00:00:47.219> doubles<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.820> using<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.570> smooth<00:00:48.899> back<00:00:49.170> over

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it doubles as using to smooth back over

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.910 
it doubles as using to smooth back over
the<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.800> combing<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:52.110> workable<00:00:52.680> hairspray

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the back combing a workable hairspray

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.139 
the back combing a workable hairspray
again<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.210> shaper<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.550> Sebastian<00:00:57.680> and

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
again I like the shaper by Sebastian and

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.220 
again I like the shaper by Sebastian and
something<00:01:00.149> else<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.780> spray<00:01:01.050> in

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
something else that you can spray in

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.450 
something else that you can spray in
your<00:01:01.379> hair<00:01:01.590> while<00:01:01.859> you're<00:01:02.039> doing<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
your hair while you're doing it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
your hair while you're doing it
depending<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.300> you've<00:01:03.480> washed<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.989> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
depending on if you've washed it that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.539 
depending on if you've washed it that
day<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.680> good<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> add<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
day it's good to add a little bit of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.719 
day it's good to add a little bit of
extra<00:01:05.820> texture<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.619> dry<00:01:08.100> shampoo<00:01:08.130> by

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
extra texture I like the dry shampoo by

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.870 
extra texture I like the dry shampoo by
Tresemme<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.510> acts<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.049> only<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.680> taking<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
Tresemme it acts not only as taking the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.270 
Tresemme it acts not only as taking the
grease<00:01:12.090> away<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.570> other<00:01:12.869> situations<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.740> in

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
grease away in other situations but in

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.310 
grease away in other situations but in
this<00:01:14.400> situation<00:01:14.939> actually<00:01:15.150> acts<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.960> coat<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
this situation actually acts to coat the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.690 
this situation actually acts to coat the
hair<00:01:16.439> shaft<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.070> give<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> bit

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
hair shaft and just give it that bit

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.130 
hair shaft and just give it that bit
more<00:01:17.880> texture<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.450> help<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> last<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.110> little

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
more texture and help it last a little

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.880 
more texture and help it last a little
bit<00:01:19.350> longer<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> first<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> section

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
bit longer so first you want to section

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.240 
bit longer so first you want to section
out<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.460> bangs<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.290> you<00:01:25.290> usually<00:01:25.920> decide

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
out your bangs and you usually decide

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.890 
out your bangs and you usually decide
where<00:01:26.490> about<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.210> poop<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.600> start

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
where about you want the poop to start

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.740 
where about you want the poop to start
so<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:29.159> kind<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.970> behind<00:01:30.509> my

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.960 
you take back
if<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:10.060> hold<00:02:10.300> up<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.629> first<00:02:10.869> section<00:02:11.319> with<00:02:11.500> it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
if you hold up the first section with it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.270 
if you hold up the first section with it
and<00:02:13.290> back<00:02:14.290> home<00:02:14.530> with<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.830> you're<00:02:14.950> actually

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and back home with it you're actually

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.150 
and back home with it you're actually
going<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.489> backcomb<00:02:15.760> them<00:02:16.239> all<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:17.160> together

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
going to backcomb them all in together

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.900 
going to backcomb them all in together
so<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:18.940> no<00:02:19.209> separation<00:02:19.810> line<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
so you have no separation line the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.610 
so you have no separation line the
higher<00:02:25.120> up<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.390> go<00:02:25.660> on<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.959> hair<00:02:26.140> shaft<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
higher up you go on the hair shaft the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
higher up you go on the hair shaft the
bigger<00:02:26.830> your<00:02:27.069> poop<00:02:27.370> will<00:02:27.610> be

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.680 

I'm<00:02:37.150> taking<00:02:37.510> about<00:02:37.630> one-inch<00:02:38.260> sections<00:02:38.770> back

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
I'm taking about one-inch sections back

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:50.250 
I'm taking about one-inch sections back
spraying<00:02:42.540> and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.050 

so<00:02:50.769> if<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:50.980> take<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:51.340> metal<00:02:51.640> end<00:02:51.819> of<00:02:51.909> your

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
so if you take the metal end of your

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:02.860 
so if you take the metal end of your
comb<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.569> just<00:02:53.230> smooth<00:02:53.650> over<00:02:53.950> that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.930 

another<00:03:03.650> thing<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:04.040> can<00:03:04.190> use<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.489> comb<00:03:04.730> for

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
another thing you can use this comb for

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.610 
another thing you can use this comb for
is<00:03:05.030> if<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.269> take<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.599> end<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.050> of<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.470> you

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
is if you take the end in it of it you

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.140 
is if you take the end in it of it you
can<00:03:06.769> actually<00:03:06.980> go<00:03:07.220> right<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.000> back

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
can actually go right in that back

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.839 
can actually go right in that back
combing<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.690> pick<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.900> up<00:03:09.250> just<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.370> emphasize

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
combing and pick it up just to emphasize

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.100 
combing and pick it up just to emphasize
it<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.090> little<00:03:11.269> bit<00:03:11.450> more<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:14.510> once<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.840> got<00:03:14.989> it

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
it a little bit more and once you got it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.240 
it a little bit more and once you got it
right<00:03:15.230> about<00:03:15.440> where<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.680> want<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.099> also

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
right about where you want it I also

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.890 
right about where you want it I also
like<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.580> put<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:17.000> sides<00:03:17.239> into<00:03:17.629> it<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.780> little

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
like to put the sides into it a little

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.420 
like to put the sides into it a little
bit<00:03:18.050> more<00:03:18.319> just<00:03:18.590> let<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.890> doesn't<00:03:19.129> look<00:03:19.280> like

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
bit more just let it doesn't look like

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.119 
bit more just let it doesn't look like
you<00:03:19.549> have<00:03:19.580> a<00:03:20.000> big<00:03:20.930> comb<00:03:21.260> right<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.830> top<00:03:22.010> of

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
you have a big comb right on the top of

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.289 
you have a big comb right on the top of
your<00:03:22.160> head<00:03:24.250> just<00:03:25.250> helps<00:03:25.519> even<00:03:25.849> it<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.120> little

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
your head just helps even it a little

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.660 
your head just helps even it a little
bit<00:03:26.450> more<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.840> then<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.110> hold<00:03:27.349> my<00:03:27.530> comb<00:03:27.769> the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
bit more and then I hold my comb the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.130 
bit more and then I hold my comb the
same<00:03:30.700> way<00:03:31.700> as<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:32.030> sections<00:03:32.420> going<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:32.870> here<00:03:33.110> I

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
same way as the sections going so here I

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.390 
same way as the sections going so here I
held<00:03:33.379> it<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:33.620> way<00:03:33.830> in<00:03:33.890> here<00:03:34.069> I'm<00:03:34.190> going<00:03:34.310> to
