00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.600
 there is 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.450
 our chicken is already ready I'm just going to 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.450

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.209

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.080

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.680

 this is sauce to season as is this 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.930
 China 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.930
 if we already empty it 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.660
 I liked doing it quite a lot, it's very, very 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.720
 that's why it's important when you go 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.630
 use a type so it's a bit strong or 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.970
 so you have then to season then 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.010
 the chicken if it must be sitting down 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.620
 so much so that here they do not know or 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.620
