challenge linking portals once the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.750 
challenge linking portals once the
portal<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:30.650> full<00:04:30.890> of<00:04:31.010> your<00:04:31.130> team's<00:04:31.340> resonators

portal is full of your team's resonators

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.670 
portal is full of your team's resonators
it<00:04:32.090> can<00:04:32.300> now<00:04:32.390> be<00:04:32.570> linked<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.990> other<00:04:33.140> portals

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
it can now be linked to other portals

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.710 
it can now be linked to other portals
linking<00:04:34.370> portals<00:04:34.760> make<00:04:34.940> them<00:04:35.120> stronger<00:04:35.450> and

linking portals make them stronger and

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.750 
linking portals make them stronger and
is<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.170> first<00:04:36.350> step<00:04:36.440> towards<00:04:37.010> capturing

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
is the first step towards capturing

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.870 
is the first step towards capturing
territory<00:04:38.300> in<00:04:39.020> order<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.860> link<00:04:40.040> to<00:04:40.280> portals

territory in order to link to portals

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.020 
territory in order to link to portals
you'll<00:04:41.450> need<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.660> portal<00:04:42.200> key<00:04:42.730> you<00:04:43.730> get<00:04:43.850> those

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
you'll need a portal key you get those

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.950 
you'll need a portal key you get those
by<00:04:44.240> hacking<00:04:44.690> portals<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.920> key<00:04:46.130> is<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.490> key

linked two portals together you have an

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.889 
linked two portals together you have an
opportunity<00:05:31.219> to<00:05:31.639> create<00:05:32.029> a<00:05:32.179> control<00:05:32.629> field

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:32.899 
opportunity to create a control field

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.109

and<00:05:33.529> how<00:05:33.649> this<00:05:33.800> is<00:05:33.979> done<00:05:34.159> is<00:05:34.369> just<00:05:34.550> by<00:05:34.909> finding

00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:35.119 
and how this is done is just by finding

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:37.179 
and how this is done is just by finding
a<00:05:35.360> third<00:05:35.569> portal<00:05:35.959> and<00:05:36.169> linking<00:05:36.709> it<00:05:36.800> to<00:05:36.979> both<00:05:37.129> of

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:37.189 
a third portal and linking it to both of

a third portal and linking it to both of
the<00:05:37.399> first<00:05:37.580> two<00:05:37.729> when<00:05:38.360> you<00:05:38.599> link<00:05:38.809> three

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
the first two when you link three

the first two when you link three
portals<00:05:39.469> together<00:05:39.919> you've<00:05:40.429> created<00:05:40.729> a

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:40.939 
portals together you've created a

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.239 
portals together you've created a
control<00:05:41.300> field<00:05:41.569> making<00:05:42.409> that<00:05:42.529> field<00:05:42.740> easy<00:05:43.009> you

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:43.249 
control field making that field easy you

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:44.769 
control field making that field easy you
control<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.699> territory<00:05:43.909> within<00:05:44.629> those
