00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.290
 Y 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.279
 in this video tutorial I will teach 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:18.890
 how to weave are you rosettes in tissue 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.730
 crochet 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.730
 They are woven with simple macramÃ© yarn 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.460
 and steel needle number 1 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.560
 They are very fast and easy to weave 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:49.210
 reverse side will place a pin 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:54.750
 to be able to place them on the flap 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 They are woven in medium high 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.510
 and now 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.510
 I'll teach you how to weave the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.259
 It starts with four chains 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 1 2 3 4 and we're going to chop in the first 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.640
 chain 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.510
 and we have a low point 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:40.500
 to form the ring inside the ring 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:44.070
 we are going to weave 12 mid-high points the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 first we will replace it with 2 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:53.210
 chains and then we're going to weave the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.210
 following 11 points 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:05.710
 here complete the 12 mid-high points 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.240
 and has closed the row with 1 flat point 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.410
 now let's weave a chain 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.410
 we slide in this way 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.830
 and through the center we will pass the ball 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.870
 so as not to cut the thread 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.870
 because then we must continue weaving 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:42.000
 the same color now let's change 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.840
 to the white color we are going to chop in one of 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.840
 points 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:57.030
 and we will knit at each point 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:03:01.910
 two medium high points the first 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.910
 we will replace it with two chains 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:15.760
 and then in the same place we chop and 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.760
 we knit the second mid-high point 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.560
 at the next point we prick and weave 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.560
 one 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.690
 and 2 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:37.380
 mid-high points let's repeat this 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:43.370
 in the whole second row in total we 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.370
 they should remain 24 mid-high points 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.780
 here complete the second row and now 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.780
 let's weave a chain 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.640
 and we are going to cut the thread because this 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:03.599
 Color we will not use more then 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.599
 we cut 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.730
 we slide the needle 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.830
 we adjust 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.350
 and we can hide 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.690
 the excess thread 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:28.830
 between the points on the reverse side 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.910
 let's go back to the celestial color 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.910
 poking at one of the points 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:46.310
 and knitting two stitches chains 1 2 for 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:50.360
 replace the first mid-high point 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.249
 now we prick in the next point and 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.930
 we weave 2 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:05:00.430
 mid-high points 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.210
 in the same place 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:08.289
 this is to make the increases 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.240
 at the next point we weave 1 point 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.349
 medium high 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.349
 and in the next 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.120
 We chop and weave 2 points in the same 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:25.150
 place 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.080
 here I have completed the 3rd row that we 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.889
 there should be a total of 36 average points 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.889
 tall 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:41.100
 we are going to weave a chain and then 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:43.880
 we can cut the thread and hide it from 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.880
 reverse side 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:53.660
 and we have made these simple ones 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.660
 and quick cockades 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:05.990
 I hope you leave them because it's always 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:05.990
 cute to wear a cockade on the lapel 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:15.240
 Argentine cockades in crochet fabric 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.200
