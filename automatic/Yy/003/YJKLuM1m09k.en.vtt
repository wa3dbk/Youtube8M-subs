the<00:00:04.259> oldest<00:00:04.740> DNA<00:00:05.100> that's<00:00:05.310> been<00:00:05.460> recovered<00:00:06.120> has

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
the oldest DNA that's been recovered has

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.799 
the oldest DNA that's been recovered has
been<00:00:06.930> from<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.710> bone<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.550> horse<00:00:08.820> bone<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.660> was

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
been from a bone a horse bone that was

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.990 
been from a bone a horse bone that was
preserved<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.469> frozen<00:00:11.070> ground<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> Arctic

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
preserved in frozen ground in the Arctic

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.940 
preserved in frozen ground in the Arctic
for<00:00:12.179> about<00:00:12.389> seven<00:00:12.809> hundred<00:00:13.019> thousand<00:00:13.740> years

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
for about seven hundred thousand years

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.430 
for about seven hundred thousand years
and<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.880> only<00:00:15.030> reason<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.660> DNA<00:00:16.049> survived

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
and the only reason that DNA survived

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.980 
and the only reason that DNA survived
for<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:16.980> long<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.640> because<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.359> ground<00:00:18.660> in

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
for this long was because the ground in

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.900 
for this long was because the ground in
which<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.380> bone<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:19.800> preserved<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:20.490> frozen

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
which that bone was preserved was frozen

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.330 
which that bone was preserved was frozen
for<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.270> entire<00:00:21.750> time

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
for the entire time

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.950 
for the entire time
we<00:00:23.340> think<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.760> DNA<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.300> only<00:00:24.480> survive<00:00:24.900> for

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
we think that DNA can only survive for

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.720 
we think that DNA can only survive for
somewhere<00:00:25.560> around<00:00:25.680> one<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> two<00:00:26.699> hundred

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
somewhere around one to two hundred

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.179 
somewhere around one to two hundred
thousand<00:00:27.570> years<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:28.500> means<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.980> things

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
thousand years this means that things

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.339 
thousand years this means that things
like<00:00:29.340> dinosaurs<00:00:30.060> which<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.660> extinct<00:00:31.140> more

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
like dinosaurs which one extinct more

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.700 
like dinosaurs which one extinct more
than<00:00:31.470> 65<00:00:32.040> million<00:00:32.399> years<00:00:32.550> ago<00:00:32.850> are<00:00:33.360> not<00:00:34.200> within

the range of surviving DNA one thing
that<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.059> would<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.960> understand

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that we would really like to understand

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.400 
that we would really like to understand
is<00:00:40.800> how<00:00:41.030> species<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.540> populations<00:00:43.200> and

happen today and in the future what we

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
can do with ancient DNA is we can watch

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
can do with ancient DNA is we can watch
species<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:54.000> mammoths<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.719> bison<00:00:55.199> and

species like mammoths and bison and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010 
species like mammoths and bison and
horses<00:00:55.739> actually<00:00:56.399> experience<00:00:57.030> past<00:00:57.449> periods

horses actually experience past periods
of<00:00:58.260> rapid<00:00:58.739> warming<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.640> could<00:00:59.820> ask<00:01:00.000> how

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
of rapid warming and we could ask how

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.689 
of rapid warming and we could ask how
they<00:01:00.719> responded<00:01:01.350> why<00:01:01.829> does<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.160> species<00:01:02.579> go

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
they responded why does some species go

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.380 
they responded why does some species go
extinct<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.510> others<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:05.489> Arctic<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.240> an

ideal place to investigate this because

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.490 
ideal place to investigate this because
there<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:08.790> thousands<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> bones<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.409> are

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
there are thousands of bones that are

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
there are thousands of bones that are

little<00:02:07.079> hope<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.099> would<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.399> able<00:02:08.459> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
little hope that we would be able to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.930 
little hope that we would be able to

next-generation<00:02:17.900> sequencing<00:02:18.830> was<00:02:19.010> invented

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
next-generation sequencing was invented

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.180 
next-generation sequencing was invented
next-generation<00:02:20.510> sequencing<00:02:21.440> allows<00:02:21.830> us<00:02:21.860> to

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
next-generation sequencing allows us to

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.640 
next-generation sequencing allows us to
extract<00:02:22.640> every<00:02:23.360> bit<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.780> DNA<00:02:23.990> that<00:02:24.530> is

way we can begin to piece together the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.300 
way we can begin to piece together the

a mammoth or in the and earth all so the

a mammoth or in the and earth all so the
genetic<00:02:40.490> information<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:41.210> we<00:02:41.330> extract<00:02:41.810> from

genetic information that we extract from
these<00:02:42.320> fossils<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.490> tell<00:02:43.760> us<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:43.910> lot<00:02:44.210> about

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
these fossils can tell us a lot about

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.260 
these fossils can tell us a lot about
the<00:02:44.990> populations<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.710> used<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.100> be<00:02:46.250> alive<00:02:46.520> we

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
the populations that used to be alive we

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.940 
the populations that used to be alive we
can<00:02:47.450> learn<00:02:47.630> when<00:02:47.900> they<00:02:48.110> were<00:02:48.170> growing<00:02:48.560> when

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
can learn when they were growing when

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.040 
can learn when they were growing when
they<00:02:49.130> were<00:02:49.280> declining<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.390> climate<00:02:50.810> change

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050

they were declining the climate change
that<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.350> happening<00:02:51.380> today<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.400> not<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.760> first
