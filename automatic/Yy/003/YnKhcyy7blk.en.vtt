end and pull him from that direction so
right<00:00:54.430> from<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.699> hood<00:00:55.019> you<00:00:56.019> simply<00:00:56.409> go<00:00:56.729> into

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
right from the hood you simply go into

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:04.109 
right from the hood you simply go into
the<00:00:58.000> hood<00:00:58.150> once<00:01:00.269> and<00:01:01.269> push<00:01:01.540> through<00:01:03.119> then

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
the hood once and push through then

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.789 
the hood once and push through then
using<00:01:04.390> your<00:01:04.420> fingernails<00:01:04.960> just<00:01:05.409> make<00:01:05.619> sure

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
using your fingernails just make sure

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.920 
using your fingernails just make sure
the<00:01:05.950> hook<00:01:06.040> goes<00:01:06.250> right<00:01:06.520> through<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.820> skin<00:01:07.060> and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
the hook goes right through the skin and

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.510 
the hook goes right through the skin and
that's<00:01:08.020> pretty<00:01:08.409> well<00:01:08.560> all<00:01:08.830> there<00:01:09.010> is<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.369> it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.160 

now<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.180> might<00:01:13.330> look<00:01:13.570> like<00:01:13.810> there's<00:01:14.020> not<00:01:14.110> a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
now that might look like there's not a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.440 
now that might look like there's not a
good<00:01:14.350> chance<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.710> getting<00:01:14.860> a<00:01:15.040> hookup<00:01:15.450> but

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
good chance of getting a hookup but

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.630 
good chance of getting a hookup but
certainly<00:01:16.810> once<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.860> get<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.130> fish<00:01:18.280> take<00:01:18.520> the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
certainly once you get the fish take the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.210 
certainly once you get the fish take the
bait<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.990> don't<00:01:20.410> have<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.620> free<00:01:20.830> spool<00:01:21.070> and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
bait you don't have to free spool and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.040 
bait you don't have to free spool and
you<00:01:21.310> just<00:01:21.460> leave<00:01:21.640> about<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.090> kilo<00:01:22.420> of<00:01:22.600> drag<00:01:22.930> on

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
you just leave about a kilo of drag on

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.110 
you just leave about a kilo of drag on
the<00:01:23.170> reel<00:01:23.380> just<00:01:24.070> let<00:01:24.220> them<00:01:24.310> take<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.610> line<00:01:24.790> and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
the reel just let them take the line and

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.490 
the reel just let them take the line and
the<00:01:25.180> hook<00:01:25.330> will<00:01:25.360> eventually<00:01:25.870> find<00:01:26.080> its<00:01:26.260> mark

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
the hook will eventually find its mark

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.870 
the hook will eventually find its mark
and<00:01:26.770> when<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.979> tighten<00:01:27.310> up<00:01:27.370> on<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.640> fish

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
and when you tighten up on the fish

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.640 
and when you tighten up on the fish
it'll<00:01:28.660> probably<00:01:28.900> end<00:01:29.140> up<00:01:29.320> getting<00:01:29.470> them

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
it'll probably end up getting them

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.410 
it'll probably end up getting them
somewhere<00:01:29.950> around<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.310> lip<00:01:30.490> or<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:31.120> corner

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
somewhere around the lip or the corner

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.030 
somewhere around the lip or the corner
of<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.540> mouth<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:32.350> know<00:01:32.470> hopefully<00:01:32.680> in<00:01:32.950> the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
of the mouth you know hopefully in the

them have got a line release system this
one's<00:02:32.560> really<00:02:32.799> easy<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.160> use<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.549> simply

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
one's really easy to use and simply

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.520 
one's really easy to use and simply
whined<00:02:34.239> backwards<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.920> release<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.370> line

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530
