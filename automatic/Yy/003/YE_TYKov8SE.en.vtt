00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello com this minute better with the 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.560
 technology mister friend tecmin man is 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.560
 Mario and today we are going to see a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.580
 application that is called avatar that 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.440
 there really has been a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.720
 controversy with regard to what 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.090
 what are 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.160
 the ability to communicate between devices 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.170
 through messaging as we used 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.210
 your whatsapp face seems to be in 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.720
 talks with jail so the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.550
 Microsoft company and if so 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.460
 logically there is the controversy that if 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.140
 is going to pay that is going to be now like 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.150
 from it they will destroy it and so on 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.950
 but I think that many times also 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.840
 happened with ping with blackberry and then 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.520
 you have to look for other alternatives in 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.140
 past videos what to the option of 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.420
 line and today we're going to see the application that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.790
 it's called art for that application 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.380
 I really liked it is for devices 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.990
 android although there is also for this is 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.760
 it marked me many mistakes then I'm 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.010
 100% sure that is what the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.510
 Android service I think they are going to 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.270
 manipulate later and they will take it out 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.520
 forward as all applications already 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.570
 which is a great application in the 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.790
 application as such 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.530
 that is the environment in which you have to 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.600
 have the application to another person is 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.130
 registered in your users so that 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.290
 she goes to the solitaire they go loading 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.180
 users as you want with whatsapp if 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.590
 we select support that is the prince 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.600
 mutal 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.520
 issues of what are the options and I think 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.109
 which it is very comprehensive as the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.240
 line that we also recommend 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.859
 much that initial friend tec leave me 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 tell them it's working very well 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.429
 I'm using it and now I'm going to 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.170
 start using what is the application 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.750
 of heart and so if someone wants 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.490
 to register, we can be playing for 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.259
 see how it is used you can perform 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.929
 calls video calls you can make a 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.789
 chat walkie-talkie voice mandar 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.859
 multimedia transfer files and 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.380
 locates really is very very very 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.150
 complete the application as such you can 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.910
 mark if they realize 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.380
 mark what is in this case a 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.280
 video conference if you would like 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.540
 to do it like that, let's give it in 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.000
 this case cancel 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.730
 they can also do what is with the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.770
 same user can call a call 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.390
 can do the option of messages from 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.730
 handles what is a chat here we are 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.100
 working and playing a little bit with the 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.950
 application you realize you can use 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.420
 what are emotive images that are 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.330
 they call 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.190
 and add to what your images are what 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.470
 what is a photo a document 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.080
 today its a location 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.750
 the message option also handles you 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.520
 the tone of how many people have 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.230
 communicated with them and you realize that 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.620
 you are creating what are text messages 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.660
 and telephony messages and they are free 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.100
 because because I'm using here 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.250

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.210
