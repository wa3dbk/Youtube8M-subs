causes<00:00:34.590> high<00:00:34.739> utilization<00:00:35.420> sometimes<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
causes high utilization sometimes it

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.390 
causes high utilization sometimes it
takes<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.870> while<00:00:36.900> to<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.620> task<00:00:37.920> manager<00:00:38.370> open

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
takes a while to get task manager open

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.540 
takes a while to get task manager open
and<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.630> you<00:00:39.780> finally<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.500> get<00:00:40.800> task<00:00:41.100> manager

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
idea what process it was you can't

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.550 
idea what process it was you can't
identify<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.060> now<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.330> can't<00:00:57.720> go<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:58.200> here

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
identify it now you can't go back here

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.070 
identify it now you can't go back here
to<00:00:58.740> the<00:00:58.800> process<00:00:59.220> tab<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> sort<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> CPU

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
to the process tab and sort the CPU

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.890 
to the process tab and sort the CPU
column<00:01:01.560> from<00:01:02.250> highest<00:01:03.060> utilization<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
column from highest utilization to

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.440 
column from highest utilization to
lowest<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.369> can't<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.790> certain<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.299> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
lowest but you can't be certain that it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.960 
lowest but you can't be certain that it
was<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.930> process<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:08.189> camp<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> cam

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
was that process here camp the cam

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.780 
was that process here camp the cam
recorder<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:10.050> caused<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.040> there's<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
recorder that caused it so there's a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.000 
recorder that caused it so there's a
better<00:01:12.150> tool<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.380> let's<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.740> rid<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
better tool for this so let's get rid of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.960 
better tool for this so let's get rid of

so you can see right off the bat from

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.280 
so you can see right off the bat from
task<00:02:39.890> manager<00:02:40.460> which<00:02:40.880> we<00:02:41.060> saw<00:02:41.240> here<00:02:41.750> to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290

process<00:02:42.770> Explorer<00:02:43.250> there's<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.880> whole<00:02:44.030> lot

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270

going<00:02:44.660> on<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:45.080> lot<00:02:45.350> better<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.610> one<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
going on a lot better so one of the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.570 
going on a lot better so one of the
things<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.660> like<00:02:47.900> about<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.830> when<00:02:49.490> you

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
things I like about it is is when you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.280 
things I like about it is is when you
minimize<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.450> tray<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.020> what<00:02:51.170> you

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
minimize it to the tray and what you

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.050 
minimize it to the tray and what you
need<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.470> do<00:02:51.710> is<00:02:51.860> go<00:02:52.040> into<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.370> options<00:02:52.520> here

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
need to do is go into the options here

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.330 
need to do is go into the options here
and<00:02:53.570> make<00:02:53.720> sure<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.320> is<00:02:54.500> checked<00:02:54.530> hide

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
and make sure that this is checked hide

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.730 
and make sure that this is checked hide
win<00:02:55.610> minimize<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.780> minimize<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.440> tray

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
win minimize you minimize to a tray

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.340 
win minimize you minimize to a tray
you'll<00:02:58.190> see<00:02:58.430> already<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.420> right<00:02:59.570> here<00:02:59.810> task

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
you'll see already it's right here task

manager and here's process Explorer and
notice<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.470> difference<00:03:03.860> here<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.520> already

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790

go<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.010> task<00:03:10.400> manager<00:03:10.810> doesn't<00:03:11.810> tell<00:03:11.990> me<00:03:12.140> that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
go to task manager doesn't tell me that

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.170 
go to task manager doesn't tell me that
all<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.560> does<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.950> just<00:03:13.160> tell<00:03:13.370> me<00:03:13.520> what<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.730> CPU

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
all it does is just tell me what the CPU

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.290 
all it does is just tell me what the CPU
usage<00:03:15.280> utilization<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.730> offers<00:03:17.120> me

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
usage utilization is so it offers me

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.130 
usage utilization is so it offers me
nothing<00:03:17.870> goodbye<00:03:18.760> now<00:03:19.760> as<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.420> said<00:03:20.660> here<00:03:20.900> this

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
let me close a little bit more

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.670 
let me close a little bit more
utilization<00:03:26.720> here<00:03:27.760> with<00:03:28.760> Firefox<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.500> we

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
utilization here with Firefox so if we

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.640 
utilization here with Firefox so if we
scroll<00:03:31.070> down<00:03:31.100> here<00:03:31.280> hopefully<00:03:32.320> can<00:03:33.320> show<00:03:33.590> you

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
scroll down here hopefully can show you

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.580 
scroll down here hopefully can show you
that<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:35.090> do<00:03:35.270> a<00:03:35.300> little<00:03:35.510> bouncing<00:03:35.990> around<00:03:36.080> here

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
that we do a little bouncing around here

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:45.340 
that we do a little bouncing around here
get<00:03:36.890> Firefox<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.760> spike<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.930> CPU<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:44.350> that's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
get Firefox to spike the CPU and that's

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.949 
get Firefox to spike the CPU and that's
why<00:03:45.560> it's<00:03:45.709> paused<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:47.150> let's<00:03:47.330> do<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:47.630> again

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
why it's paused so let's do this again

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.210 
why it's paused so let's do this again
yes<00:03:48.860> there<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.370> go<00:03:49.610> so<00:03:50.000> let's<00:03:50.030> get<00:03:50.510> him<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:51.220> if

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
yes there you go so let's get him to if

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.610 
yes there you go so let's get him to if
I<00:03:52.340> scroll<00:03:52.670> around<00:03:52.970> here<00:03:53.270> there<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.750> go<00:03:53.780> you

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
I scroll around here there you go you

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.680 
I scroll around here there you go you
can<00:03:54.740> see<00:03:54.980> Firefox<00:03:55.730> close<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.240> if<00:03:56.300> I<00:03:56.420> bounced

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
can see Firefox close that if I bounced

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.490 
can see Firefox close that if I bounced
around<00:03:56.840> any<00:03:57.290> more<00:03:57.560> let<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.490> go<00:03:58.700> by<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.500> mouse

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
around any more let that go by and mouse

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.550 
around any more let that go by and mouse
over<00:04:00.740> it<00:04:00.950> again<00:04:01.100> see<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.730> changes<00:04:02.240> so<00:04:02.990> this<00:04:03.410> is

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
over it again see it changes so this is
