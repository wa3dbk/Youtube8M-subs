00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.140
 I'm exhausted today I came from the gym 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.779
 and I think that they have come to me 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.110
 chafing on the feet my body hurts 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.890
 middle of the feet I do not know what to do crisis 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.380
 What I can do 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.810
 isabel maybe a bath and I'll 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.230
 tell me how are you going to do it? 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.930
 a coffee filter and a few leaves 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.560
 of laurel and a little bit of mint and if 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.470
 you have cocoa butter and if not then 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.450
 any bar of cocoa that you have 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.480
 you can take a little bit 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.820
 we take the fresh leaves of mint that 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.670
 you can have in your pot 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.800
 it is good to grow aromatic plants 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.020
 they serve us for many things not only 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.220
 to eat if you have it fresh you can 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.980
 use dry serves the same we 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.500
 It serves the same as the table is very refreshing 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.830
 and we split the finite leaves those of 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.400
 laurel and the mint and mint pieces 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.400
 little ones 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.440
 we add a spoonful to a trickle of 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.480
 oil you can use the oil that 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.810
 you have the very good bolivar that you have 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.710
 lots of vitamin or sunflower which 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.260
 you want a little bit 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.660
 add the teaspoon of cocoa or 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.310
 little piece of cocoa bar 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.370
 as you see a little so that it is included 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.620
 well the little leaves inside the lard and 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.290
 of faith that butter stays then like this 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.710
 it is not shortening when we lament in the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.500
 bath with warm water melts and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.410
 becomes part of the bathroom with its 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 moisturizing properties we take the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.500
 coffee filter and we empty it inside 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.409
 this must be used as soon as we do it 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:59.840
 if better when we do 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.260
 because when you split the leaves always 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.760
 lose properties 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:12.200
 It seems that the sticky and if not not 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.200
 if you speak a little and get country 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.239
 you have the bathroom with warm water what 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.730
 we add what you have 5 minutes and then 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.730
 you can enter inside and enjoy 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.220
 I'll be waiting 5 minutes and nothing to 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.319
 relax me the truth is that once done 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.340
 you will love it, if you like it 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.340
