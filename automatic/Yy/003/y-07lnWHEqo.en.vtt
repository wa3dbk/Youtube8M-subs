 the year 2008 was finished, she even finished in the Ultra Triathlon 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.500
 besides, what he is studying is industrial engineering at b2 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.550
 cottbus 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.090

 mediated 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.999
 combined with science and in the first competitive games 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.770
 In addition to the basics such as mathematics and physics, there are several specializations 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.300
 relevant technical fields of application 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.330
 this will be a wide range of business subjects 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.500
 offered 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.890
 that makes sense then in the professional life, the technicians must be with 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.290
 economic and the economy lame technical boundary conditions 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.000
 employ 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.840
 the industrial engineer with both in Cottbus is the study 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.890
 Industrial Engineering very popular well visited and the way to the very top 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 Marcel also knows why 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.080
 We are very good 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.030
 To her queasy good student faculty relations which made us naturally impossible 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.550
 stupid Teva just to get easy access to the cells and also one 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.220
 Look at studies work and prepare the surface others 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.510
 Questions to come naturally in the immediate contact 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.630
 See Rheine results 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.750

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.670
 The pilot was although I find that I fly from one competition to another 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.900
 He still managed to write his thesis, it's about 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.410
 the market analysis of innovative methods of timekeeping and endurance sports so 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.579
 a topic that you are very familiar with 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.840
 Nevertheless, is competent in technical and business terms 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.100
 necessary 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.320
 and a good care 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.020
 on Master was not just swimming thousands of kilometers here swimming 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.020
 or he also wants to run professionally 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.009
 His studies at BT Group offer the best prerequisites
