00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.470 
put a four on here and what this does
instead<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.440> bait<00:03:37.620> rising<00:03:38.480> perfectly

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
instead of the bait rising perfectly

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.350 
instead of the bait rising perfectly
horizontal<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.170> bait<00:03:40.350> Rises<00:03:40.800> like<00:03:40.830> this<00:03:41.400> what

horizontal the bait Rises like this what
is<00:03:42.450> what<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.720> what's<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.440> difference<00:03:43.560> there

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
is what is what's the difference there

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.960 
is what is what's the difference there
well<00:03:43.950> first<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.280> all<00:03:44.310> if<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.490> see<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.700> fish

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
well first of all if you see a fish

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.060 
well first of all if you see a fish
dying<00:03:45.330> in<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.630> water<00:03:45.840> or<00:03:46.350> hurting<00:03:46.710> they

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
dying in the water or hurting they

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.830 
dying in the water or hurting they
always<00:03:47.250> stick<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.550> nose<00:03:47.760> up<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.300> know<00:03:48.390> yeah

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
always stick the nose up you know yeah

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.910 
always stick the nose up you know yeah
they're<00:03:49.110> things<00:03:49.290> they<00:03:49.410> can't<00:03:49.650> get<00:03:49.770> their

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
they're things they can't get their

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.130 
they're things they can't get their
equilibrium<00:03:50.280> just<00:03:50.580> right<00:03:50.790> but<00:03:51.540> more

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
equilibrium just right but more

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.810 
equilibrium just right but more
importantly<00:03:52.680> when<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.010> bait<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.430> rising<00:03:53.790> like

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
importantly when the bait is rising like

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.960 
importantly when the bait is rising like
this<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:55.590> know<00:03:55.710> it<00:03:56.010> doesn't<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.490> just<00:03:56.730> moves

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
this you know it doesn't it just moves

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.430 
this you know it doesn't it just moves
straight<00:03:57.300> up<00:03:57.510> on<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.720> when<00:03:57.960> you<00:03:58.050> when<00:03:58.380> you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
straight up on it when you when you

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.410 
straight up on it when you when you
point<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:58.860> nose<00:03:58.980> like<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.970> bait<00:04:00.150> moves

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
point the nose like this the bait moves

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.420 
point the nose like this the bait moves
off<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.020> side<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.800> now<00:04:01.980> when<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:02.370> a

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
off to the side so now when you get a

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.730 
off to the side so now when you get a
lateral<00:04:02.790> action<00:04:03.360> on<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.600> bait<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:04.440> move<00:04:04.620> it

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
lateral action on the bait you move it

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.040 
lateral action on the bait you move it
to<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.950> side<00:04:05.130> like<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.760> pause

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
to the side like this and you pause

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.870 
to the side like this and you pause
baits<00:04:07.050> actually<00:04:07.410> going<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.650> continue<00:04:08.160> rising

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
baits actually going to continue rising

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.229 
baits actually going to continue rising
towards<00:04:09.420> us<00:04:09.540> no

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
towards us no

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.030 
towards us no
so<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.599> gets<00:04:10.840> more<00:04:11.049> distance<00:04:11.560> on<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.829> drive

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
so it gets more distance on the drive

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.920 
so it gets more distance on the drive
and<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.730> makes<00:04:12.939> it<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.269> makes<00:04:13.450> for<00:04:13.689> tele

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
and that makes it that makes for tele

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:40.650 
and that makes it that makes for tele
technique<00:04:14.379> and<00:04:14.980> that's<00:04:15.720> exactly

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660
