 yogurt ice cream and so judging from 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.870

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.609
 This product runs so where is my sharpness 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.699

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.160
 Here I have a jar of home 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.929

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.580
 add cocoa you stir 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.689
 i'm just disturbing the cocoa sugar because 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.140
 so here 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.810
 it is easier to stir and then she does not 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.920
 all can be done simply with sugar not 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.170

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.049
 ice cream so I added the ingredients 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.820
 and dick you need to stir everything up 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.550
 homogeneous gruel 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.630
 here I have all stirred up no 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.360
 lump did not work and now I 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.550
 need to stir further until completely 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.650
 sugar will not dissolve in yogurt 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.580
 after the sugar is full 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.170
 dissolved in yogurt I add there 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.850
 sour cream 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.620
 very important moment to and sour cream 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.150
 the yogurt was from the fridge that is 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.000
 cold because that way easier 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.940
 this way it is easier and faster to whip 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.220

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.570
 how everything would be so like the eye and 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.709
 further need to stir 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:54.660
