00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
spoons and a spoon I'll show you why I

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.540 
spoons and a spoon I'll show you why I
use<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> minute<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.400> you<00:00:29.400> could

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.030 
use that in a minute and you could
always<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.539> under<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.080> sink<00:00:31.289> under<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
always do this under the sink under the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.010 
always do this under the sink under the
running<00:00:32.189> water<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.640> used<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.809> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
running water I used to do that and I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.540 
running water I used to do that and I
ended<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> lot<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> mistakes<00:00:35.399> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
ended up with a lot of mistakes so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
ended up with a lot of mistakes so
that's<00:00:35.790> why<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.969> use<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.450> cup<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.780> water<00:00:36.960> now

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that's why I use this cup of water now

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.860 
that's why I use this cup of water now
so<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.070> start<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:39.000> teaspoon<00:00:39.719> of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
so just start out with a teaspoon of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.119 
so just start out with a teaspoon of
water<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.460> stir<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.390> gently<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.920> your

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
water and stir it in gently with your

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.869 
water and stir it in gently with your
rubber<00:00:44.340> spatula<00:00:45.140> make<00:00:46.140> sure<00:00:46.379> all<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:47.039> water

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
rubber spatula make sure all that water

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
rubber spatula make sure all that water
is<00:00:48.149> incorporated<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:50.059> then<00:00:51.059> do<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.199> again<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
is incorporated and then do it again and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.500 
is incorporated and then do it again and
you<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.059> keep<00:00:54.360> adding<00:00:55.460> bits<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.789> water<00:00:57.059> until

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
you just keep adding bits of water until

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.889 
you just keep adding bits of water until
you<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> consistency<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.579> want<00:00:59.899> from

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you get to the consistency you want from

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.349 
you get to the consistency you want from
here<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.309> start<00:01:02.550> using<00:01:02.699> half<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
here I'm going to start using half a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570 
here I'm going to start using half a
teaspoon<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> quarter<00:01:04.920> teaspoon<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
teaspoon then a quarter teaspoon and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
teaspoon then a quarter teaspoon and
sometimes<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.630> few<00:01:07.020> drops<00:01:07.229> make<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
sometimes just a few drops make a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.760 
sometimes just a few drops make a
difference<00:01:08.390> okay<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> why<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
difference okay this is why I have the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.670 
difference okay this is why I have the
spoon<00:01:11.570> once<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.750> start<00:01:13.020> mixing<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.530> your

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
spoon once you start mixing in your

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
spoon once you start mixing in your
water<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:14.820> icing<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
water some of your icing is going to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560 
water some of your icing is going to
stick<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.799> spatula<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
stick to that spatula and you want to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
stick to that spatula and you want to
get<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.350> don't<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> big

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
get that off so you don't have a big

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.580 
get that off so you don't have a big
blob<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.909> thick<00:01:21.240> icing<00:01:21.509> while<00:01:22.170> you're<00:01:22.320> doing

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
blob of thick icing while you're doing

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.969 
blob of thick icing while you're doing
your<00:01:22.619> filling<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.869> icing<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.500> where<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.680> want

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
your filling the icing is where I want

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.700 
your filling the icing is where I want
it<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> fall<00:01:27.869> back<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.200> itself

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
it now it's going to fall back on itself

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.499 
it now it's going to fall back on itself
and<00:01:29.009> smooth<00:01:29.369> back<00:01:29.640> into<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> rest<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and smooth back into the rest of the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.050 
and smooth back into the rest of the
icing<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.400> an<00:01:32.579> account<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
icing I like it to do this an account of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.230 
icing I like it to do this an account of
about<00:01:33.409> 1,001<00:01:34.409> 1,002<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.909> should<00:01:36.119> be

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
about 1,001 1,002 and it should be

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.020 
about 1,001 1,002 and it should be
smooth<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.710> always<00:01:38.040> better<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.670> go

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
smooth out it's always better to go

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.480 
smooth out it's always better to go
thicker<00:01:39.479> than<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.380> thin<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> same

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
thicker than to thin it's the same

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
thicker than to thin it's the same
philosophy<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:42.810> waistline

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
philosophy I have with my waistline

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.030 
philosophy I have with my waistline
better<00:01:43.710> too<00:01:43.979> thick<00:01:44.310> than<00:01:44.610> too<00:01:44.880> thin<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:46.040> once

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
better too thick than too thin so once

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.069 
better too thick than too thin so once
you<00:01:47.159> get<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:48.329> cover<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.049> a

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you get it here just cover it with a

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
you get it here just cover it with a
damp<00:01:49.200> dish<00:01:49.680> cloth<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.280> let<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.579> sit<00:01:50.790> for

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
damp dish cloth and let it sit for

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.630 
damp dish cloth and let it sit for
several<00:01:51.119> minutes<00:01:51.920> this<00:01:52.920> has<00:01:53.070> been<00:01:53.250> sitting

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
several minutes this has been sitting

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.219 
several minutes this has been sitting
for<00:01:53.670> several<00:01:54.180> minutes<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.110> that

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
