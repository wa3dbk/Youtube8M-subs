00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.609
 You guys, how's the capps atlas? 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:35.340
 Good now, I have the flute in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.820
 little empty neighborhood for him to do 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.820
 test only 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.770
 the neighborhood is much smoother not 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:08.660
 this is with the lack of a flute with 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.660
 photo a wish again 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.730
 the neighborhood is on the street thing short and 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.730
 thick as hell, huh? 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:43.570
 they look very different 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:43.570
 boot abuses were very not because we go 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.320
 show you the flute 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.110

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.820
 1 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.680
 You can see the time, right? 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.680

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:49.010
 Exactly now let's get this done. 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:49.010
 nothing in improvisation 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:31.010
 now flute people look at the difference 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.010
 snoring 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.790
 a trip just to feel the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.790
 difference 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.610
 Calm down if he or the other does not spend more 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.689

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.689

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:12.690
 petty bourgeoisie 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.490
