00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
okay here's a quick quick setup for

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.660 
okay here's a quick quick setup for
setting<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.600> argue<00:00:06.899> pilot<00:00:07.350> with<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> six

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670

setting the argue pilot with a six
position<00:00:09.090> switch<00:00:09.420> or<00:00:09.780> basically<00:00:10.590> base<00:00:10.800> any

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
position switch or basically base any

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.320 
position switch or basically base any
system<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.170> needs<00:00:13.410> six<00:00:14.009> positions<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.940> one

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330

system that needs six positions on one
output<00:00:16.109> channel<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.150> I've<00:00:18.150> got<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:19.250> blank

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
output channel and I've got a blank

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.029 
output channel and I've got a blank
model<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.970> will<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.750> I've<00:00:21.990> got<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
model that will do that in I've got a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.920 
model that will do that in I've got a
little<00:00:23.460> sticker<00:00:23.760> up<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.480> kind<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.750> nice

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
little sticker up here is kind of nice

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.259 
little sticker up here is kind of nice
of<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.740> modes<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> set<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.000> RG

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
of the modes that I set for the RG

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.910 
of the modes that I set for the RG
copter<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> RT<00:00:28.140> plane<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.830> are

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
copter and the RT plane that are

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.580 
copter and the RT plane that are
slightly<00:00:29.279> different<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.289> here's<00:00:31.289> what<00:00:31.560> I

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
slightly different and here's what I

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.319 
slightly different and here's what I
recommend<00:00:31.859> or<00:00:32.460> here<00:00:32.579> here's<00:00:32.880> what's<00:00:33.090> worked

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
recommend or here here's what's worked

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.889 
recommend or here here's what's worked
for<00:00:33.480> me<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.800> RG<00:00:35.190> copter<00:00:35.660> basically<00:00:36.660> in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
for me on the RG copter basically in

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.080 
for me on the RG copter basically in
stabilized<00:00:37.800> mode<00:00:38.100> that's<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> default<00:00:38.700> mode

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
stabilized mode that's the default mode

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
stabilized mode that's the default mode
when<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> switch<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.649> switches

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
when you switch it on all switches

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850 
when you switch it on all switches
forward<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.170> then<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.530> three

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
forward and then if you do the three

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.940 
forward and then if you do the three
position<00:00:44.309> switch<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.879> go<00:00:44.969> from<00:00:45.149> stabilized

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
position switch you go from stabilized

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.490 
position switch you go from stabilized
altitude<00:00:46.950> hold<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.879> loiter<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.230> things

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
altitude hold to loiter all the things

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.630 
altitude hold to loiter all the things
you're<00:00:49.680> doing<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.250> know<00:00:50.309> when<00:00:50.430> there's<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you're doing you know when there's a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.420 
you're doing you know when there's a
human<00:00:50.850> being<00:00:51.120> flying<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
human being flying and then with the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.959 
human being flying and then with the
switch<00:00:53.820> down<00:00:54.379> then<00:00:55.379> you've<00:00:55.590> got<00:00:55.800> auto<00:00:56.160> return

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
switch down then you've got auto return

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
switch down then you've got auto return
to<00:00:57.390> land<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.079> land<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> things

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to land and land you know all the things

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.720 
to land and land you know all the things
that<00:01:00.079> when<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.260> flying<00:01:01.620> autonomously<00:01:01.890> I've

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that when it's flying autonomously I've

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
that when it's flying autonomously I've
got<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> Landsat<00:01:03.660> never<00:01:03.899> had<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
got the Landsat never had to do it but I

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.070 
got the Landsat never had to do it but I
was<00:01:04.920> thinking<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.000> ever<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.689> panic

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
was thinking that if I ever in a panic

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.570 
was thinking that if I ever in a panic
situation<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.860> need<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.369> thing

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
situation and need to get that thing

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.300 
situation and need to get that thing
down<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:09.990> push<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.100> pull

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
down I can just push it you know pull

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.219 
down I can just push it you know pull
both<00:01:11.520> switches<00:01:11.790> toward<00:01:12.240> me<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.659> it'll<00:01:12.990> land

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
both switches toward me and it'll land

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.160 
both switches toward me and it'll land
wherever<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:15.439> so<00:01:16.439> let's<00:01:16.890> set<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.909> up

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
wherever it is so let's set this up

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.499 
wherever it is so let's set this up
basically<00:01:19.170> we're<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:19.939> using<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.210> lot

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
basically we're going to be using a lot

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.170 
basically we're going to be using a lot
of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.500> half<00:01:23.100> mixing<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:25.020> look<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.340> look

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
of the half mixing so look at the look

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
of the half mixing so look at the look
at<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> torque<00:01:27.659> I'll<00:01:27.900> link<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> tutorial

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
at the torque I'll link the tutorial

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.429 
at the torque I'll link the tutorial
that<00:01:29.070> talks<00:01:29.280> about<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> half<00:01:30.030> does<00:01:30.439> but

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that talks about what the half does but

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.670 
that talks about what the half does but
basically<00:01:32.040> when<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:34.759> are<00:01:36.140> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.439> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
basically when we are going to do that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.120 
basically when we are going to do that
we're<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> set<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> source<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.329> half

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
we're going to set the source to half

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.200 
we're going to set the source to half
we're<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> set<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.000> weight<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.820> minus

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
we're going to set the weight to minus

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.510 
we're going to set the weight to minus
96<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.549> this<00:01:47.549> would<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.970> minus<00:01:48.509> 100<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.860> I

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.350 

tested<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.610> out<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.270> 90s<00:01:54.990> -<00:01:55.290> 96<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.460> my<00:01:56.520> setup

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
tested it out and 90s - 96 on my setup

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.289 
tested it out and 90s - 96 on my setup
gave<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.590> perfect<00:01:59.100> centering<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.820> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
gave just about perfect centering of the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.539 
gave just about perfect centering of the
values<00:02:02.149> on<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.350> Rd<00:02:04.350> pilot<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.189> course<00:02:05.369> we

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
values on the Rd pilot and of course we

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.819 
values on the Rd pilot and of course we
set<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.909> switch<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.020> want<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.469> switch

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
set the switch that we want the switch

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.830 
set the switch that we want the switch
to<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.750> aileron

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
to be the aileron

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.230 
to be the aileron
so<00:02:12.840> there's<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.260> aileron<00:02:14.090> okay

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
so there's the aileron okay

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.900 
so there's the aileron okay
and<00:02:15.330> now<00:02:15.690> what<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.980> has<00:02:17.250> given<00:02:17.820> us<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
and now what this has given us now is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.700 
and now what this has given us now is
look<00:02:20.910> at<00:02:21.030> channel<00:02:21.360> 5<00:02:21.510> where<00:02:21.900> either<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.140> zero<00:02:22.590> or

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
look at channel 5 where either a zero or

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.920 
look at channel 5 where either a zero or
if<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.670> pull<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.990> switch<00:02:25.320> we're<00:02:26.280> at<00:02:26.460> minus<00:02:27.030> 96

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
if we pull the switch we're at minus 96

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.410 
if we pull the switch we're at minus 96
percent<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.650> what<00:02:29.640> we're<00:02:29.820> going<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.030> do<00:02:30.210> now

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
percent and what we're going to do now

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.510 
percent and what we're going to do now
is<00:02:30.750> we're<00:02:31.050> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.260> go<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.010> use<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
is we're going to go in and use the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.580 
is we're going to go in and use the
three<00:02:32.730> position<00:02:33.180> switch<00:02:33.360> ID<00:02:33.840> zero<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
three position switch ID zero one and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.280 
three position switch ID zero one and
two<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:35.580> add<00:02:35.760> values<00:02:36.360> back<00:02:36.600> into<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.140> so

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
two to add values back into that so

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.140 
two to add values back into that so
we'll<00:02:37.440> either<00:02:37.560> start<00:02:38.010> at<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.250> baseline<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.880> zero

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
we'll either start at a baseline of zero

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.140 
we'll either start at a baseline of zero
or<00:02:39.960> start<00:02:40.380> at<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> baseline<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.490> what's<00:02:41.940> close

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
or start at a baseline of what's close

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.380 
or start at a baseline of what's close
to<00:02:42.300> minus<00:02:42.600> 100<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.370> add<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.970> that

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
to minus 100 and add on to that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.880 
to minus 100 and add on to that
so<00:02:45.990> let's<00:02:46.230> come<00:02:46.500> down<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.470> we're<00:02:49.470> going

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
so let's come down here and we're going

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.930 
so let's come down here and we're going
to<00:02:53.030> insert<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.090> mix<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.980> what<00:02:56.520> we're<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:56.910> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
to insert a mix and what we're going to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.640 
to insert a mix and what we're going to
do<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.740> that<00:02:58.740> will<00:02:59.070> be<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.930> course<00:03:00.990> another

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
do is that will be of course another

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.510 
do is that will be of course another
half<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:03.530> it's<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.830> be<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.190> switch<00:03:06.920> ID<00:03:07.920> 0

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
half and it's going to be on switch ID 0

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.730 
half and it's going to be on switch ID 0
which<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.360> switch<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> top<00:03:10.170> position

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
which is the switch in the top position

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:27.310 
which is the switch in the top position
and<00:03:15.050> we're<00:03:16.050> going<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.590> set<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:20.070> plus<00:03:20.820> 90

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.000 

okay<00:03:28.320> so<00:03:28.530> what<00:03:28.710> that's<00:03:28.830> going<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.190> give<00:03:29.280> us<00:03:29.430> is

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
okay so what that's going to give us is

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.680 
okay so what that's going to give us is
when<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.490> switch<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:34.070> up<00:03:35.070> here<00:03:35.490> it's<00:03:36.390> either

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
when this switch is up here it's either

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.450 
when this switch is up here it's either
going<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.900> be<00:03:37.050> very<00:03:37.080> high<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:38.160> going<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.370> be

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
going to be very high it's going to be

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.330 
going to be very high it's going to be
value<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.910> 90<00:03:39.300> up<00:03:39.450> here<00:03:39.810> or<00:03:40.680> it's<00:03:41.070> going<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.250> be

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
value of 90 up here or it's going to be

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.810 
value of 90 up here or it's going to be
a<00:03:41.490> value<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.110> -6<00:03:43.110> down<00:03:43.410> here<00:03:43.800> so<00:03:44.700> basically

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
a value of -6 down here so basically

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.350 
a value of -6 down here so basically
here's<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.870> first<00:03:46.140> 2<00:03:46.710> of<00:03:47.070> our<00:03:47.490> six<00:03:47.850> positions

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
here's the first 2 of our six positions

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.590 
here's the first 2 of our six positions
that<00:03:48.570> we're<00:03:48.750> setting<00:03:49.170> we've<00:03:50.010> got<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.910> ID<00:03:51.120> 0

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
that we're setting we've got the ID 0

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.070 
that we're setting we've got the ID 0
and<00:03:51.960> we've<00:03:52.620> got<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> value<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.580> 90<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.690> value

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
and we've got a value of 90 and a value

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.540 
and we've got a value of 90 and a value
of<00:03:55.260> minus<00:03:55.680> 6<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:58.440> we're<00:03:58.890> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.040> do<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.310> same

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
of minus 6 so we're going to do the same

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.150 
of minus 6 so we're going to do the same
thing<00:04:00.200> we'll<00:04:01.200> come<00:04:01.500> back<00:04:01.740> down<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:02.340> channel<00:04:02.730> 5

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
thing we'll come back down to channel 5

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.220 
thing we'll come back down to channel 5
do<00:04:05.160> an<00:04:05.340> insert<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.910> we're<00:04:09.780> going<00:04:09.960> to<00:04:10.050> do<00:04:10.200> a

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
do an insert and we're going to do a

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.250 
do an insert and we're going to do a
half<00:04:10.620> on<00:04:12.410> ID<00:04:15.739> 1

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
half on ID 1

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.310 
half on ID 1
and<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:20.340> is<00:04:20.639> going<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.910> be<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.329> weight<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:24.320> plus

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
and that is going to be a weight of plus

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:37.100 
and that is going to be a weight of plus
45<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:35.190> we<00:04:35.370> can<00:04:35.520> see<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.210> now<00:04:36.900> what

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
45 so we can see that and now what

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.930 
45 so we can see that and now what
that's<00:04:37.260> giving<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:37.950> here's<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.700> when

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
that's giving it so here's it is when

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.850 
that's giving it so here's it is when
it's<00:04:39.090> an<00:04:39.210> ID<00:04:39.450> zero<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:40.350> see<00:04:42.169> there<00:04:43.169> it<00:04:43.350> is<00:04:43.470> at

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
it's an ID zero you see there it is at

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.690 
it's an ID zero you see there it is at
six<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.780> ninety<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:45.990> now<00:04:46.950> if<00:04:47.100> we<00:04:47.310> switch<00:04:47.669> to

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
six and ninety and now if we switch to

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.830 
six and ninety and now if we switch to
ID<00:04:48.120> 2

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
ID 2

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.150 
ID 2
now<00:04:49.680> we've<00:04:50.040> got<00:04:50.310> those<00:04:51.200> second<00:04:52.200> ranges<00:04:52.740> filled

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
now we've got those second ranges filled

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.330 
now we've got those second ranges filled
in<00:04:53.340> well<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.669> will<00:04:53.760> be<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:54.540> will<00:04:54.660> be<00:04:55.130> 0<00:04:56.130> plus

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
in well that will be that will be 0 plus

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.620 
in well that will be that will be 0 plus
90<00:04:57.000> minus<00:04:57.030> 45<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.230> a<00:04:58.260> 45<00:04:58.919> and<00:04:59.340> this<00:05:00.180> will<00:05:00.419> be

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
90 minus 45 is a 45 and this will be

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.180 
90 minus 45 is a 45 and this will be
minus<00:05:01.200> 96<00:05:02.130> plus<00:05:02.580> 90<00:05:03.210> which<00:05:03.690> is<00:05:03.720> minus<00:05:04.260> 6<00:05:04.650> minus

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
minus 96 plus 90 which is minus 6 minus

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.909 
minus 96 plus 90 which is minus 6 minus
45<00:05:05.910> so<00:05:06.270> this<00:05:06.419> will<00:05:06.540> be<00:05:06.660> minus<00:05:06.870> 51<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:09.590> now<00:05:10.590> just

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
45 so this will be minus 51 and now just

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.490 
45 so this will be minus 51 and now just
very<00:05:11.100> simply<00:05:11.580> we<00:05:12.479> go<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:14.370> do<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.450> same<00:05:15.690> thing

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
very simply we go and do the same thing

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:25.659 
very simply we go and do the same thing
once<00:05:16.860> again<00:05:17.750> we<00:05:18.750> insert<00:05:19.290> a<00:05:21.050> half<00:05:22.050> setting<00:05:23.150> for

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
once again we insert a half setting for

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:46.510 
once again we insert a half setting for
ID<00:05:28.220> 3<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:32.030> we<00:05:33.030> set<00:05:33.479> that<00:05:33.750> value<00:05:34.080> at<00:05:34.620> 8<00:05:35.160> plus<00:05:38.810> 17

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.840 

okay<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:48.030> we<00:05:48.450> see<00:05:51.950> and<00:05:52.950> we've<00:05:53.160> got<00:05:53.430> all<00:05:53.669> of

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
okay and we see and we've got all of

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.520 
okay and we see and we've got all of
that<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:55.160> if<00:05:56.160> we<00:05:56.550> look<00:05:56.820> at<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:57.479> setting<00:05:57.960> now

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
that and if we look at the setting now

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.080 
that and if we look at the setting now
that's<00:05:59.460> down<00:05:59.760> and<00:06:00.710> that's<00:06:01.710> going<00:06:01.890> to<00:06:01.950> be<00:06:02.160> at<00:06:02.400> 17

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
that's down and that's going to be at 17

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.580 
that's down and that's going to be at 17
and<00:06:04.310> that's<00:06:05.310> going<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.669> be<00:06:05.880> at<00:06:06.150> 90<00:06:06.539> so<00:06:06.750> minus<00:06:07.050> 96

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
and that's going to be at 90 so minus 96

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:15.279 
and that's going to be at 90 so minus 96
plus<00:06:07.890> 17<00:06:08.479> so<00:06:09.479> that'll<00:06:09.930> be<00:06:10.200> what<00:06:10.740> 80<00:06:13.669> let's<00:06:14.669> see

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
plus 17 so that'll be what 80 let's see

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.610 
plus 17 so that'll be what 80 let's see
86<00:06:17.240> 781<00:06:18.240> something<00:06:18.600> like<00:06:18.720> that<00:06:18.870> anyways<00:06:19.260> check

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
86 781 something like that anyways check

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.100 
86 781 something like that anyways check
my<00:06:19.800> math<00:06:19.979> is<00:06:20.310> probably<00:06:20.820> wrong<00:06:21.060> but<00:06:21.360> now<00:06:22.050> you

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
my math is probably wrong but now you

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.750 
my math is probably wrong but now you
can<00:06:22.410> see<00:06:22.590> here<00:06:22.800> we've<00:06:22.950> got<00:06:22.979> a<00:06:23.160> nice<00:06:23.400> smooth

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
can see here we've got a nice smooth

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
can see here we've got a nice smooth
transition<00:06:24.000> we<00:06:24.510> got<00:06:24.660> dot<00:06:24.870> dot<00:06:25.620> dot<00:06:26.550> now<00:06:26.849> I'm

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
transition we got dot dot dot now I'm

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.260 
transition we got dot dot dot now I'm
going<00:06:27.960> to<00:06:28.020> flip<00:06:28.229> this<00:06:28.650> down<00:06:28.950> and<00:06:29.370> this<00:06:29.490> up<00:06:29.760> and

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
going to flip this down and this up and

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.980 
going to flip this down and this up and
that's<00:06:30.720> going<00:06:30.870> to<00:06:30.930> continue

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
that's going to continue

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.480 
that's going to continue
a<00:06:32.020> dot<00:06:32.980> dot<00:06:33.730> going<00:06:34.360> the<00:06:34.510> other<00:06:34.540> way<00:06:34.750> low<00:06:35.490> but

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
a dot dot going the other way low but

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.920 
a dot dot going the other way low but
basically<00:06:36.880> one<00:06:37.390> two<00:06:38.100> three<00:06:39.150> four<00:06:40.260> five<00:06:41.490> six

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
basically one two three four five six

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.350 
basically one two three four five six
six<00:06:43.930> positions<00:06:44.830> we've<00:06:45.100> got<00:06:45.360> again

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
six positions we've got again

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.170 
six positions we've got again
experimentally<00:06:47.200> kind<00:06:47.860> of<00:06:47.950> set<00:06:48.190> these<00:06:48.460> I<00:06:48.910> did<00:06:49.150> a

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
experimentally kind of set these I did a

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.330 
experimentally kind of set these I did a
little<00:06:49.390> bit<00:06:49.540> of<00:06:49.600> math<00:06:49.930> and<00:06:50.350> calculated<00:06:51.040> what

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
little bit of math and calculated what

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.270 
little bit of math and calculated what
the<00:06:51.370> range<00:06:51.760> would<00:06:52.030> be<00:06:52.090> I<00:06:52.620> looked<00:06:53.620> at<00:06:53.830> the<00:06:54.040> at

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
the range would be I looked at the at

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.240 
the range would be I looked at the at
the<00:06:54.430> a<00:06:54.460> p.m.<00:06:54.880> on<00:06:55.210> the<00:06:55.600> radio<00:06:55.900> tuning<00:06:56.800> screen

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
the a p.m. on the radio tuning screen

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.240 
the a p.m. on the radio tuning screen
and<00:06:57.700> saw<00:06:58.270> that<00:06:58.600> those<00:06:58.870> were<00:06:59.110> pretty<00:06:59.590> well<00:06:59.800> set

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250 
and saw that those were pretty well set

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.420 
and saw that those were pretty well set
and<00:07:00.490> then<00:07:01.240> of<00:07:01.420> course<00:07:01.450> when<00:07:02.290> setting<00:07:03.040> up<00:07:03.190> the<00:07:03.400> a

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
and then of course when setting up the a

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.790 
and then of course when setting up the a
p.m.<00:07:03.820> radio<00:07:04.180> for<00:07:04.600> the<00:07:04.630> for<00:07:04.990> the<00:07:05.080> six<00:07:05.320> positions

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
p.m. radio for the for the six positions

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.070 
p.m. radio for the for the six positions
you<00:07:06.490> know<00:07:06.550> these<00:07:06.730> seem<00:07:07.270> to<00:07:07.480> be<00:07:07.600> nice<00:07:07.810> and

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
you know these seem to be nice and

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.450 
you know these seem to be nice and
centered<00:07:08.410> there<00:07:08.590> were<00:07:08.650> nice<00:07:08.800> and<00:07:09.010> centered<00:07:09.280> so

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
centered there were nice and centered so

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.710 
centered there were nice and centered so
that<00:07:09.490> there<00:07:09.850> were<00:07:09.970> none<00:07:10.090> of<00:07:10.270> them<00:07:10.420> that<00:07:10.600> were

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
that there were none of them that were

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.530 
that there were none of them that were
close<00:07:11.110> onto<00:07:11.500> the<00:07:11.770> edge<00:07:11.980> of<00:07:12.340> being<00:07:12.940> between<00:07:13.330> two

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:13.540 
close onto the edge of being between two

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.330 
close onto the edge of being between two
settings<00:07:14.140> I<00:07:14.350> didn't<00:07:14.620> want<00:07:14.800> any<00:07:14.950> kind<00:07:15.130> of

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340 
settings I didn't want any kind of

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.170 
settings I didn't want any kind of
jitter<00:07:15.640> or<00:07:16.420> anything<00:07:17.250> affecting<00:07:18.250> yeah<00:07:19.120> you

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
jitter or anything affecting yeah you

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.150 
jitter or anything affecting yeah you
know<00:07:19.360> not<00:07:20.230> that<00:07:20.380> I<00:07:20.410> think<00:07:20.560> jitter<00:07:20.830> would<00:07:21.010> be<00:07:21.130> a

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 
know not that I think jitter would be a

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.280 
know not that I think jitter would be a
problem<00:07:21.580> but<00:07:21.940> it<00:07:22.570> just<00:07:22.750> seemed<00:07:22.870> like<00:07:23.020> a<00:07:23.050> good

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 
problem but it just seemed like a good

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.140 
problem but it just seemed like a good
luck<00:07:23.470> thing<00:07:23.500> to<00:07:23.800> do<00:07:23.920> to<00:07:24.130> keep<00:07:24.250> those<00:07:24.490> nice<00:07:24.850> and

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
luck thing to do to keep those nice and

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150 
luck thing to do to keep those nice and
solid<00:07:25.690> in<00:07:26.050> the<00:07:26.590> middle<00:07:26.830> range

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 
solid in the middle range

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.060 
solid in the middle range
anyways<00:07:27.730> all<00:07:27.850> I<00:07:27.910> typed<00:07:28.330> this<00:07:28.510> in<00:07:28.570> on<00:07:29.050> the<00:07:29.080> on

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.070 
anyways all I typed this in on the on

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.470 
anyways all I typed this in on the on
the<00:07:31.000> instructional<00:07:31.870> page<00:07:32.140> but<00:07:32.740> that's<00:07:33.480> pretty

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:34.480 
the instructional page but that's pretty

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.260 
the instructional page but that's pretty
much<00:07:34.600> how<00:07:34.810> you<00:07:34.840> do<00:07:35.110> it
