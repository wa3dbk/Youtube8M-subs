hard<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:28.860> away<00:01:28.979> you're<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.970> fast<00:01:30.210> as

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
hard to get away you're not as fast as

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.920 
hard to get away you're not as fast as
other<00:01:30.540> cars<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:32.640> know<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.540> hard<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
other cars you know it's it's hard to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.929 
make up lost ground much more difficult
than<00:01:36.299> say<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> Lamborghini<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.729> use

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
than say like a Lamborghini is to use

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.499 
than say like a Lamborghini is to use
and<00:01:39.210> make<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.509> lost<00:01:40.259> ground<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.360> some<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
and make up lost ground but some of the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.440 
and make up lost ground but some of the
extreme<00:01:43.350> upsides<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.700> Land<00:01:44.909> Rover<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
extreme upsides with the Land Rover and

extreme upsides with the Land Rover and
the<00:01:45.509> other<00:01:45.750> huge<00:01:46.350> vehicles<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.030> they're

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the other huge vehicles is that they're

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.179 
the other huge vehicles is that they're
amazing<00:01:48.780> offroad<00:01:49.229> they're<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:50.040> good

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

amazing offroad they're just really good
off-road<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.790> almost<00:01:51.060> feels<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.840> go

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
off-road it almost feels like they go

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.490 
off-road it almost feels like they go
faster<00:01:52.590> when<00:01:52.829> you're<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.159> grass<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:54.119> dirt<00:01:54.930> or

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
faster when you're on grass or dirt or

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.679 
faster when you're on grass or dirt or
gravel<00:01:55.950> anything<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.820> sort<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.450> not

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
gravel anything of that sort that's not

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.260 
gravel anything of that sort that's not
a<00:01:57.719> track<00:01:58.159> it<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.430> seems<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.880> go<00:02:00.030> much

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
a track it just seems like you go much

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.230 
a track it just seems like you go much
faster<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.579> that's<00:02:02.579> pretty<00:02:03.180> awesome
