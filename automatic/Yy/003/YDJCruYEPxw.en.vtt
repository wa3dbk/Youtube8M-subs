see through which is nice they're very
translucent<00:01:36.940> so<00:01:37.840> again<00:01:38.110> it<00:01:38.320> seems<00:01:38.560> like<00:01:38.649> that

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
translucent so again it seems like that

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.130 
translucent so again it seems like that
very<00:01:39.190> like<00:01:39.670> almost<00:01:39.850> like<00:01:40.570> she<00:01:40.750> just<00:01:40.899> licked

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
very like almost like she just licked

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.550 
very like almost like she just licked
her<00:01:41.289> lips<00:01:41.320> ears<00:01:45.090> right<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.330> usually<00:01:47.200> we<00:01:47.350> see

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
her lips ears right and usually we see

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.380 
her lips ears right and usually we see
like<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:48.039> over<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:48.700> we<00:01:48.850> don't<00:01:48.880> usually<00:01:49.179> see

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
like that over so we don't usually see

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.029 
like that over so we don't usually see
the<00:01:49.690> smoky<00:01:50.170> eye<00:01:50.200> for<00:01:50.649> spring<00:01:51.009> like

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
the smoky eye for spring like

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.459 
the smoky eye for spring like
so<00:01:53.219> that's<00:01:53.429> kind<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.820> great<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.509> usually<00:01:55.350> it's

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
so that's kind of great and usually it's

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.980 
so that's kind of great and usually it's
