00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
guess in a sense it is when you go up

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.900

we've<00:02:56.440> seen<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:56.859> far<00:02:56.890> just<00:02:57.400> seem<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.640> have<00:02:57.760> a

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
the modern warfare 2 variants so we'll

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.250 
the modern warfare 2 variants so we'll
be<00:03:02.440> interesting<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.010> see<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.519> as

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
be interesting to see if it's as

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.220 
be interesting to see if it's as

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
was in mono fair - it'll also be

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.759 
was in mono fair - it'll also be
interested<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.079> see<00:03:11.170> how<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.410> fares<00:03:11.590> up

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
interested to see how it fares up

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.830

we all know that they the mp5 is due to

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.479 
we all know that they the mp5 is due to
make<00:03:19.599> a<00:03:19.660> return<00:03:20.079> so<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.769> will<00:03:20.889> be<00:03:21.010> interesting

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
make a return so it will be interesting

marathan<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.919> increase<00:03:42.280> our<00:03:42.489> sprint

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
marathan to increase our sprint

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.089 
marathan to increase our sprint
distances<00:03:43.450> or<00:03:43.900> we<00:03:44.079> could<00:03:44.230> even<00:03:44.380> go<00:03:44.590> with<00:03:44.769> bling

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
distances or we could even go with bling

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.819 
distances or we could even go with bling
to<00:03:45.430> equip<00:03:45.940> two<00:03:46.180> attachments<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.139> sometimes

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
to equip two attachments I sometimes

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.379 
to equip two attachments I sometimes
like<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.340> run<00:03:48.519> bling<00:03:48.760> along<00:03:49.090> with<00:03:49.269> the

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
like to run bling along with the

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.080 
like to run bling along with the
silencer<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.169> extended<00:03:50.620> Manx<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.549> I<00:03:51.579> get<00:03:52.060> a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
silencer and extended Manx so I get a

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.940 
silencer and extended Manx so I get a
few<00:03:52.299> more<00:03:52.450> bullets<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.930> take<00:03:52.959> out<00:03:53.349> multiple

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
few more bullets to take out multiple

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.530 
few more bullets to take out multiple
enemies<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.700> get<00:03:54.760> those<00:03:54.910> connects<00:03:55.180> multi

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
enemies to get those connects multi

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.650 
enemies to get those connects multi
kills<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:55.930> what<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.349> reload<00:03:56.680> quite<00:03:56.980> as<00:03:57.099> often

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
kills and what to reload quite as often

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.059 
kills and what to reload quite as often
so<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.690> second<00:03:59.139> note<00:03:59.260> we<00:03:59.349> usually<00:03:59.680> have<00:03:59.799> first

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
so a second note we usually have first

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.740 
so a second note we usually have first
stopping<00:04:00.310> power<00:04:00.579> in<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.849> second<00:04:01.209> tier<00:04:01.419> poke

stopping power in the second tier poke

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.110 
stopping power in the second tier poke
slot<00:04:02.109> but<00:04:02.319> because<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.799> ump45<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.849> a<00:04:03.879> very

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
slot but because the ump45 is a very

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.089 
slot but because the ump45 is a very
powerful<00:04:04.299> weapon<00:04:04.690> with<00:04:05.109> food<00:04:05.590> shots<00:04:05.799> to<00:04:05.919> kill

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
powerful weapon with food shots to kill

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.580 
powerful weapon with food shots to kill
at<00:04:06.400> long<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:06.849> short<00:04:07.329> ranges<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.169> we<00:04:08.410> don't

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
at long and short ranges and we don't

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.720 
at long and short ranges and we don't
really<00:04:08.680> need<00:04:08.859> stopping<00:04:09.280> who<00:04:09.340> are<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.579> only

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
really need stopping who are the only

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.190 
really need stopping who are the only
different<00:04:10.030> stuff<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:10.450> powered<00:04:10.720> make<00:04:10.930> is

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
different stuff and powered make is

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.460 
different stuff and powered make is
making<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.560> weapon

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
making a weapon

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.530 
making a weapon
-<00:04:12.740> shot<00:04:12.980> kill<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.640> body<00:04:13.820> at<00:04:14.000> close<00:04:14.240> range

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
- shot kill to the body at close range

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.140 
- shot kill to the body at close range
which<00:04:14.810> can<00:04:15.530> be<00:04:15.650> handy<00:04:15.950> but<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.430> think<00:04:16.820> this<00:04:16.940> is

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
which can be handy but I think this is

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.720 
which can be handy but I think this is
the<00:04:17.239> better<00:04:17.450> advantages<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.380> be<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.830> we<00:04:19.070> had<00:04:19.250> if

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
the better advantages to be it we had if

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.360 
the better advantages to be it we had if
you<00:04:20.000> were<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.330> switch<00:04:20.480> out<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.930> second<00:04:21.260> floor

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
you were to switch out the second floor

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.370 
you were to switch out the second floor
something<00:04:22.370> else<00:04:22.810> we've<00:04:23.810> got<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.050> option<00:04:24.290> of

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
something else we've got the option of

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.100 
something else we've got the option of
light<00:04:24.560> weight<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:24.950> make<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.340> ump45<00:04:26.210> class<00:04:26.840> and

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
light weight to make the ump45 class and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.090 
light weight to make the ump45 class and
it<00:04:27.200> kind<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.530> run-and-gun

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
it kind of a run-and-gun
