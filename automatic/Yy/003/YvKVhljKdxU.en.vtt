that you have good continuty this system
uses<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.350> microprocessor<00:01:41.829> circuit<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:43.329> you'll

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
uses a microprocessor circuit so you'll

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.459 
uses a microprocessor circuit so you'll
get<00:01:43.659> error<00:01:43.930> codes<00:01:44.170> as<00:01:44.350> opposed<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.710> lights<00:01:45.009> if

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
get error codes as opposed to lights if

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.039 
get error codes as opposed to lights if

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
single one of these there would be no

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.270 
single one of these there would be no
numbers<00:01:52.810> here<00:01:52.990> there<00:01:53.710> would<00:01:53.829> be<00:01:53.860> no<00:01:54.040> error

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
numbers here there would be no error

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.420 
numbers here there would be no error
code<00:01:54.520> okay<00:01:55.649> obviously<00:01:56.649> we<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.009> nothing<00:01:57.310> in

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
code okay obviously we have nothing in

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.940 
code okay obviously we have nothing in
here<00:01:57.610> so<00:01:57.790> it's<00:01:57.969> it's<00:01:58.600> reading<00:01:59.170> nothing<00:01:59.680> in

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
here so it's it's reading nothing in

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.899 
here so it's it's reading nothing in
there<00:02:00.070> being<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.490> it's<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.820> bad<00:02:01.030> e<00:02:01.060> match<00:02:02.909> now

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
there being that it's a bad e match now

program<00:04:03.850> now<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:05.470> want<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.830> change<00:04:06.130> it<00:04:06.310> to

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
program now you want to change it to

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.060 
program now you want to change it to
let's<00:04:06.940> say<00:04:07.180> all<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:07.989> all<00:04:08.170> we're<00:04:08.530> gonna<00:04:08.650> hit<00:04:08.770> OK

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
let's say all so all we're gonna hit OK

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.020 
let's say all so all we're gonna hit OK
for<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.370> program<00:04:09.610> and<00:04:10.260> then<00:04:12.030> convenient

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
for that program and then convenient

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.880 
for that program and then convenient
enough<00:04:13.150> there's<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.750> bun<00:04:13.900> that's<00:04:14.050> us<00:04:14.230> all<00:04:14.470> this

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
enough there's a bun that's us all this

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.060 
enough there's a bun that's us all this
will<00:04:15.070> fire<00:04:15.250> all<00:04:15.459> 20<00:04:15.820> at<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:15.940> same<00:04:16.150> time

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
will fire all 20 at the same time

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.099 
will fire all 20 at the same time
I'll<00:04:18.070> 20<00:04:18.400> fire<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.760> off<00:04:18.910> so<00:04:19.660> you're<00:04:19.780> done<00:04:19.959> with

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
I'll 20 fire it off so you're done with

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.780 
I'll 20 fire it off so you're done with
that<00:04:20.140> now<00:04:20.769> let's<00:04:21.040> say<00:04:21.280> that's<00:04:21.549> not<00:04:21.700> really

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
that now let's say that's not really

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.340 
that now let's say that's not really
what<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.150> want<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.450> do<00:04:22.570> I'm<00:04:22.990> gonna<00:04:23.080> go<00:04:23.230> ahead

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
what you want to do I'm gonna go ahead

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.950 
what you want to do I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:04:23.440> delete<00:04:23.590> all<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.960> can<00:04:26.080> move<00:04:26.289> it<00:04:26.410> over

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.920 

let's<00:04:29.560> say<00:04:29.820> single-fire<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.449> hit<00:04:31.600> okay

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
let's say single-fire so you hit okay

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.860 
let's say single-fire so you hit okay
and<00:04:32.160> now<00:04:34.949> if<00:04:35.949> you<00:04:36.130> hit<00:04:36.340> one<00:04:36.370> one<00:04:36.880> goes<00:04:37.090> off<00:04:37.330> via

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
and now if you hit one one goes off via

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.050 
and now if you hit one one goes off via
two<00:04:38.139> two<00:04:38.440> goes<00:04:38.650> off<00:04:38.919> three<00:04:39.400> three<00:04:39.639> goes<00:04:39.820> off

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
two two goes off three three goes off

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.779 
two two goes off three three goes off
skip<00:04:40.419> a<00:04:40.449> few<00:04:40.780> again<00:04:41.199> hit<00:04:41.380> eleven<00:04:41.800> eleven<00:04:42.610> goes

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
skip a few again hit eleven eleven goes

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.350 
skip a few again hit eleven eleven goes
off<00:04:43.000> twelve<00:04:44.009> eighteen<00:04:45.180> okay

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
off twelve eighteen okay

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:56.010 
off twelve eighteen okay
nineteen<00:04:47.199> twenty<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:49.500> so<00:04:50.500> forth<00:04:54.870> you've<00:04:55.870> done

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
nineteen twenty and so forth you've done

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.320 
nineteen twenty and so forth you've done
with<00:04:56.169> that<00:04:56.320> you're<00:04:56.560> gonna<00:04:56.620> hit<00:04:56.910> code<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.090> clear

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
with that you're gonna hit code to clear

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.219 
with that you're gonna hit code to clear
it<00:04:58.449> and<00:04:59.190> let's<00:05:00.190> go<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.460> step<00:05:01.150> fire<00:05:04.050> okay

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
it and let's go to step fire okay

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.029 
it and let's go to step fire okay
it<00:05:05.320> shows<00:05:05.740> ste<00:05:06.400> that<00:05:06.820> step<00:05:07.500> step<00:05:08.500> fire<00:05:08.770> allows

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
it shows ste that step step fire allows

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.300 
it shows ste that step step fire allows
you<00:05:09.310> to<00:05:09.430> fire<00:05:09.669> this<00:05:09.910> thing<00:05:10.560> using<00:05:11.560> one<00:05:11.770> button

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
you to fire this thing using one button

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.969 
you to fire this thing using one button
instead<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.300> all<00:05:14.020> of<00:05:14.289> them<00:05:14.410> that's<00:05:14.560> actually

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
instead of all of them that's actually

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.550 
instead of all of them that's actually
pretty<00:05:15.370> handy<00:05:16.060> considering<00:05:16.660> at<00:05:16.900> nighttime

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
pretty handy considering at nighttime
