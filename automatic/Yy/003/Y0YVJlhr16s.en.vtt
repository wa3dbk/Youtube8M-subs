lieutenant Jundland and Danish am too
decent<00:00:15.150> figures<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> best<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:17.330> they're

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
decent figures not the best but they're

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.779 
decent figures not the best but they're
not<00:00:18.449> bad<00:00:18.890> you've<00:00:19.890> probably<00:00:20.130> already<00:00:20.400> guessed

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
not bad you've probably already guessed

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.820 
not bad you've probably already guessed
the<00:00:21.119> Danish<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.020> figure<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:24.560> pre<00:00:25.560> pen

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the Danish and figure is just a pre pen

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.620 
the Danish and figure is just a pre pen
of<00:00:27.019> junior<00:00:28.019> clips<00:00:28.289> from<00:00:28.500> force<00:00:28.769> unleashed<00:00:29.070> I'm

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
of junior clips from force unleashed I'm

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.669 
of junior clips from force unleashed I'm
saying<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> pre<00:00:31.019> paint<00:00:31.260> because<00:00:31.380> this

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
saying it's a pre paint because this

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.760 
saying it's a pre paint because this
figure<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.730> released<00:00:33.180> before<00:00:34.170> Juna<00:00:36.590> but<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
figure was released before Juna but it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.090 
figure was released before Juna but it
uses<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> same<00:00:38.460> body<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:39.980> that<00:00:40.980> figure<00:00:43.100> so

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
uses the same body as that figure so

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.889 
uses the same body as that figure so
I've<00:00:44.460> done<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> review<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.239> Juno<00:00:45.539> eclipse

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
previous lifestyle does not really need

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.869 
previous lifestyle does not really need
to<00:00:48.390> go<00:00:48.539> into<00:00:48.660> any<00:00:48.980> detail<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.219> articulation

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
to go into any detail about articulation

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.680 
to go into any detail about articulation
and<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.449> about<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.809> figure<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:53.059> was<00:00:54.059> run

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and what not about this figure I was run

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.170 
and what not about this figure I was run

the<00:01:14.040> uniform<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.640> doing<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> real<00:01:15.270> difference

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the uniform is doing the real difference

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.730 
the uniform is doing the real difference
between<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.070> figure<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.549> junior<00:01:18.150> clips<00:01:18.740> she

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
between this figure and junior clips she

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.340 
between this figure and junior clips she
was<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> same<00:01:20.400> weapon<00:01:20.790> 11<00:01:21.750> imperial

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
was going to the same weapon 11 imperial

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.370 
was going to the same weapon 11 imperial
blaster<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.689> she's<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> decent<00:01:24.960> figure<00:01:25.350> I

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
blaster and she's a decent figure I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.890 
blaster and she's a decent figure I
guess<00:01:25.670> she<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:27.000> comic<00:01:27.299> pack<00:01:27.540> shop<00:01:27.720> at

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
guess she was on my comic pack shop at

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.120 
guess she was on my comic pack shop at
the<00:01:27.960> minute<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.320> I'm<00:01:28.380> using<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the minute and I'm using one of the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.880 
the minute and I'm using one of the
cyber<00:01:29.369> 2006<00:01:30.299> dance<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:33.110> problem<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.409> peg

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
cyber 2006 dance for problem is the peg

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.010 
cyber 2006 dance for problem is the peg
on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> stand<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> little<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:35.970> too<00:01:36.150> big<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
on the stand is a little bit too big so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.770 
on the stand is a little bit too big so
it<00:01:37.049> doesn't<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.470> go<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.570> stand<00:01:39.570> very

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it doesn't really go on the stand very

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.399 
it doesn't really go on the stand very
well<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:43.430> Lieutenant<00:01:44.430> Jundland<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.420> slightly

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
well and Lieutenant Jundland is slightly

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.219 
well and Lieutenant Jundland is slightly
better<00:01:46.770> mainly<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.229> newish

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
better mainly because it's a newish

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.069 
better mainly because it's a newish
figure<00:01:49.939> this<00:01:50.939> figure<00:01:51.180> actually<00:01:51.360> uses<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
figure this figure actually uses the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.460 
figure this figure actually uses the
same<00:01:52.320> body<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.860> Admiral<00:01:53.729> Ozzel<00:01:54.259> just<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
same body as Admiral Ozzel just with a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.130 
same body as Admiral Ozzel just with a
different<00:01:55.530> head

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.350 

and<00:01:58.370> articulation<00:01:59.370> wise<00:01:59.550> this<00:01:59.940> one<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
and articulation wise this one is a

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.160 
and articulation wise this one is a
quite<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> bit<00:02:03.600> poorer<00:02:03.990> than<00:02:04.170> Juno<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.400> danisha

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
quite a bit poorer than Juno and danisha

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.120 
quite a bit poorer than Juno and danisha
mainly<00:02:07.170> because<00:02:07.320> all<00:02:07.619> these<00:02:07.740> guys<00:02:07.950> are

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
mainly because all these guys are

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.110 
mainly because all these guys are
bulging<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.580> neck<00:02:09.200> swivel<00:02:10.200> elbows<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.160> civil

shoulders swivel waist swivel hips and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.810 
shoulders swivel waist swivel hips and
that's<00:02:16.920> about<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.610> swivel<00:02:18.180> rest<00:02:19.820> so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
that's about it and swivel rest so

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.660 
that's about it and swivel rest so
there's<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.300> not<00:02:21.630> much<00:02:21.810> articulation<00:02:22.200> all

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670

fussed about the lack of articulation on
this<00:02:34.260> figure<00:02:34.530> mainly<00:02:34.980> because<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.370> detail

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
this figure mainly because the detail

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.570 
this figure mainly because the detail
makes<00:02:35.880> up<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.510> my<00:02:37.500> opinion<00:02:37.769> if<00:02:38.010> details

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
makes up for it in my opinion if details

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.860 
makes up for it in my opinion if details
good<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> figure<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:39.510> there's<00:02:39.630> not<00:02:39.750> much

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
good on a figure but there's not much

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
good on a figure but there's not much
articulation<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.860> kind<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.790> bounces<00:02:42.120> out<00:02:42.330> for

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
articulation and kind of bounces out for
