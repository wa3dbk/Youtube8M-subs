00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
in this one there's no question in my

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.359

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
mind about that however I think this is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.880 
mind about that however I think this is
about<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.700> frustration<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.380> Sounders

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
about a frustration that the Sounders

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.580 
about a frustration that the Sounders
had<00:01:11.159> throughout<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.760> course<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> game

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
had throughout the course of the game

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.960 
had throughout the course of the game
particularly<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> treatment<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> Clint

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
particularly in the treatment that Clint

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.420 
particularly in the treatment that Clint
Dempsey<00:01:15.390> got<00:01:15.650> starting<00:01:16.650> early<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> game

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
Dempsey got starting early in the game

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.890 
Dempsey got starting early in the game
when<00:01:17.640> he<00:01:17.670> picked<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.210> injury<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> his

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
when he picked up that injury to his

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.690 
when he picked up that injury to his
shoulder<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> tackle<00:01:19.950> from<00:01:20.040> Diego<00:01:20.460> Chara

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
shoulder on a tackle from Diego Chara

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.670 
shoulder on a tackle from Diego Chara
Darlington<00:01:21.600> Nagbe<00:01:21.630> also<00:01:22.200> took<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.530> hits

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
Darlington Nagbe also took some hits

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.499 
Darlington Nagbe also took some hits
from<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> Sounders<00:01:23.369> side<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:24.090> fair<00:01:24.119> was

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
from the Sounders side so to be fair was

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
from the Sounders side so to be fair was
coming<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.840> both<00:01:24.990> sides<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.400> that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
coming on both sides but I think that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.399 
coming on both sides but I think that
that<00:01:26.549> frustration<00:01:27.119> boiled<00:01:27.659> over<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:28.140> Alonzo

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that frustration boiled over when Alonzo

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.200 
that frustration boiled over when Alonzo
through<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> elbow<00:01:29.310> into<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:29.759> johnson

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
through the elbow into will johnson

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.390 
through the elbow into will johnson
space<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:31.200> well<00:01:31.350> Johnson<00:01:31.590> instigating<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
space was well Johnson instigating a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.740 
space was well Johnson instigating a
little<00:01:32.579> bit<00:01:32.670> by<00:01:32.790> sort<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> bumping<00:01:33.420> into<00:01:33.600> him

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
little bit by sort of bumping into him

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.260 
little bit by sort of bumping into him

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
down on mass confrontation I think

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
down on mass confrontation I think

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
after the rest yeah and right after it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.800 
after the rest yeah and right after it
all<00:01:50.520> happened<00:01:50.970> mean<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> Sounders<00:01:51.540> going

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
all happened mean the Sounders going

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.330 
all happened mean the Sounders going
after<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> assistant<00:01:52.590> referee<00:01:52.619> who<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
after the assistant referee who was the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
after the assistant referee who was the
one<00:01:53.460> who<00:01:53.640> ultimately<00:01:53.820> made<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> call<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.049> think

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
one who ultimately made the call I think

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.039 
one who ultimately made the call I think
saying<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> elbow<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.820> thrown<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.899> they

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
saying that the elbow was thrown so they

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.149 
saying that the elbow was thrown so they

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
were going after him I think there's

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.920 
were going after him I think there's
mass<00:01:59.369> confrontation<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:00.840> was

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
mass confrontation I think there was

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
it for when we throw a Montreal in there

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.430 
it for when we throw a Montreal in there
I'm<00:03:01.150> not<00:03:01.300> convinced<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.840> Montreal<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.320> going

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
I'm not convinced in Montreal is going

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.510 
I'm not convinced in Montreal is going
to<00:03:02.500> be<00:03:02.560> able<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.770> pull<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:02.950> one<00:03:03.250> through

to be able to pull this one through
either<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.910> think<00:03:04.300> ultimately<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.750> these<00:03:04.930> three

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
huge however it comes with a caveat sigh
