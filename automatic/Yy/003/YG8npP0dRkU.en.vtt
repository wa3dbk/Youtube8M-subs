00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.870
 so here is the carton 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.660
 that's what the whole playstation looks like when 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.929
 you got it now or you got it 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.090
 somehow got hold of in the shop 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.730
 the carton in itself so I find very 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.000
 beautiful blue white on the front see it 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.260
 you again what the console looks like 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.929
 with it on the controller she has 500 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.989
 gigabyte 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.469
 I'll even show you that for the first time 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.840
 so the whole now looks back 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.239
 On it is then again advertising too 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.210
 killzone shadow fully is indeed a 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.210
 really cool game is now too 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.489
 already outside and costs if you can 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.120
 now so in the shop buys 69 99 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:01.109
 and that's how the whole carton looks 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 if you see him that way I do 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.489
 Now open and then you will see how that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.830
 Whole inside looks like when I die 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.860
 unpacked has the playstation 4 so 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.990
 that too in the carton and then I take 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.520
 just get out and have you here 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.540
 of white cardboard 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.970
 one always means the whole and so on 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.780
 see the whole from the inside so the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.509
 weighs neatly in the whole carton 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.640
 Here you still have 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.790
 user manual is also the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.540
 controller in it 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.630
 manual and then we have 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.630
 down here the cable in it 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.720
 and here you see the playstation the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.610
 I immediately unpacked but show 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.460
 that's what the whole thing looks like now 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.369
 if you have opened the carton so 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.770
 There I am again after the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.100
 unboxing you see the sony now 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.130
 Playstation 4 and I see it now 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.590
 also the first time really live 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.670
 and she looks really great 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.019
 So here you see the ps4 of his 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.350
 side is sony and the left side of the 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.160
 Sony Playstation 4 is right with it 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.989
 piano lacquer 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.720
 as well as the first playstation 3 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.940
 was that was also so piano after 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.090
 moderate and you look pretty like that 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.579
 I think it looks very noble 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.190
 and from here you have that 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.090
 drive once next to it two usb 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.120
 connections 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.400
 that's what the playstations year and all have 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.130
 besides , I have for you now 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.260
 my super slim the playstation 3 because 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.049
 a lot has written to me mobile phone 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 how can you not show it for a moment? 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.709
 how the two look next to each other 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.780
 What a difference this is and there 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.890
 you see it is already of a size 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.560
 that already distinguished in any case 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.450
 because the ps4 is bigger and of course 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.840
 also heavier 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.579
 but I think she is really chic 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.579
 and you'll see each other like that 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.190
 it looks like this 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.019
 and when i started the ps4 of course 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.100
 I also show you how 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.680
 the menu looks like it looks like this 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:36.440
 whole when I started it now 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:38.460
 have and above the small symbols 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.670
 Of course you have to be username 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.350
 later log in these profiles 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.250
 which one can collect when playing game 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.590
 plays and so sees the whole menu now 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.460
 you can already see that from software 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.520
 update is already required and 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.890
 yes, I'm looking forward to the first game 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.710
 what I will play then and I hope 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.420
