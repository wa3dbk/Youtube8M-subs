00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.160
 let's make some croquettes 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.440
 advantage if you do not want to lose yourself 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.849
 none of my videos subscribe to 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.849
 channel we start 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.420
 for the dough of the croquettes 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.360
 we will need 5 tablespoons of flour 50 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.330
 grams of butter a little nut 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.820
 moscada some chicken that you already have 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.510
 and boiled broth that admits and stops 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.570
 flirting we will need them 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.579
 two eggs and a bit of breadcrumbs what 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.879
 first thing we're going to do is cut the 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.829
 very tiny chicken as you know these 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.930
 croquettes are of use this is 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.469
 a piece of chicken that I'm leaving 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 Cooked 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.339
 As you can see we have left quite a lot 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.969
 little boy now let's make the dough 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.070
 let's put a case to everything strong and 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.770
 we will throw the butter 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.310
 then we throw the flour and the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.610
 we are moving so that it is cold 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.140
 once we read everything is a little 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.580
 we started to pour the broth 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.580
 we are throwing little by little 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.170
 we will lower the fire a little 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:37.030
 There is like at medium heat 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.030
 and we continue pouring the broth 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.409
 I'm going to grate you some nutmeg 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.409
 that this gives a lot of flavor 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.409
 and now we put the chicken 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 and we move everything well 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.869
 so that everything is mixed at this point and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.569
 is finished as you see we have been 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.479
 a little broth of half a liter but 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.640
 this is not exact measurements we have thrown 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.879
 what admitted now we will leave it 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.200
 cool so it does not cool the 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.480
 we will throw in a bowl 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.940
 and then we'll cover it up as you see 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.620
 we have put salt to the dough because the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.560
 ingredients that we have already thrown 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.010
 they had salt is the stew broth and the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.290
 chicken then we have not done anything of 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.410
 salt because it's okay now we'll cover it 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.450
 with a film we will lower the paper 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.670
 down to avoid crusting 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.610
 we will leave the room temperature 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.500
 because it is very hot if it runs 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.299
 Hurry when it is already templadito yes that 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.799
 you can put it in the fridge once 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.920
 it has not cooled the mass of the 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.569
 croquettes we are going to roll and fry good 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.590
 let's go 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.650
 taking portions of dough from croquettes 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.440
 and we put them in bread crumbs 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.170
 to go forming the croquettes 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.300
 there are people who spend them first 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.700
 flour and then bread crumbs but I 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.250
 I go through the bread crumbs 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.060
 and then the egg and again breadcrumbs 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.060
 and they are fried 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.730
 and we went through the egg 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.000
 and we return them to the screen and now 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.670
 we return them to 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.420
 to put the bread crumbs and they are left 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.360
 ready to fry 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.110
 as you see now is we are putting in 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.390
 a dish 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.180
 once we have finished linking the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.120
 croquettes we are going to fry it and for that 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.630
 we put a pan on the fire and put 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.630
 oil 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.810
 We put it over high heat 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.439
 and I put olive oil 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.629
 but that this lesson can you put 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.939
 also sunflower oil we will look if 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.520
 the oil is already hot, casting a 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.100
 croquette 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.070
 as we see it is already hot we are going to go 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.840
 throwing we give it back already for this 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.570
 side are golden we turn it around 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.850
 to brown on the other side a 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.500
 Once they are ready we take them out to a 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.500
 dish with absorbent paper 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.030
 so that it absorbs the surplus oil 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.940
 Well, we already have our very rich 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.550
 ready-made croquettes for 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.590
