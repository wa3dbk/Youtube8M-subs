depressed before as I said a lot of a
lot<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.330> is<00:05:10.420> chemical<00:05:10.810> stuff<00:05:11.640> neural

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
lot of it is chemical stuff neural

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.490 
lot of it is chemical stuff neural
Anatomy<00:05:13.510> and<00:05:13.630> such<00:05:13.840> that<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.050> won't<00:05:14.230> get<00:05:14.380> into

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
tears if I do but um anyway I I probably

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.930 
tears if I do but um anyway I I probably
should<00:05:20.770> have<00:05:20.830> picked<00:05:21.040> a<00:05:21.130> longer<00:05:21.490> gameplay

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
should have picked a longer gameplay

should have picked a longer gameplay
this<00:05:22.150> is<00:05:22.300> kind<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:22.840> wrapping<00:05:23.110> up<00:05:23.200> a<00:05:23.320> lot<00:05:23.440> sooner

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
this is kind of wrapping up a lot sooner

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.890 
this is kind of wrapping up a lot sooner
than<00:05:23.860> I<00:05:23.890> thought<00:05:24.100> but<00:05:24.370> uh<00:05:24.430> I'll<00:05:25.240> just<00:05:25.450> I<00:05:25.660> guess

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
I'll just keep talking over it or maybe

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.010 
I'll just keep talking over it or maybe
put<00:05:27.280> another<00:05:27.460> gameplay<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.090> after<00:05:28.390> but<00:05:28.990> uh

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
put another gameplay and after but uh

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.450
