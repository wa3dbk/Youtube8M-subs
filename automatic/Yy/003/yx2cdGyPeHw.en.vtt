00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.539 
back to normal so that's one thing
that's<00:01:47.430> very<00:01:47.610> bad<00:01:48.149> about<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.630> glitch<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
that's very bad about the glitch and

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.300 
that's very bad about the glitch and
yeah<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> yeah<00:01:52.409> that's<00:01:52.560> all<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> glitch<00:01:53.130> is

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
yeah so yeah that's all the glitch is

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.249 
yeah so yeah that's all the glitch is
you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.060> with<00:01:54.119> other<00:01:54.509> things<00:01:54.899> too
