 Hello 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.830
 hello I did not become true again 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.089

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.270

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.320

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.320

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.730
 the subject of conversation of all the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.300
 mysterious new school boy 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.530

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.790
 wrapped in that sadness 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.600

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.660

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.269
 we met in a cemetery 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.570
 if it was not technically in the bathroom 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.570

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.630
 parties 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.290
 I have never been good for 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.290

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.659

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.040
 the car of my parents that helps a 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.040
 bridge to the lake 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.609
 I arrived with them and I survived but 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.500

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.619

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 nothing are friends from childhood but 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:05.390

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.390

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.580
