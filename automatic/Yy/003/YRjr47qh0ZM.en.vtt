00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.830 

maison<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.299> way<00:02:02.450> put<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.110> bass<00:02:03.290> back<00:02:04.840> about

maison the way put the bass back about

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.309 
maison the way put the bass back about
up<00:02:06.229> at<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:06.530> base<00:02:06.680> about<00:02:07.009> one<00:02:07.070> o'clock<00:02:07.750> tone<00:02:08.750> is

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
up at the base about one o'clock tone is

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.040 
up at the base about one o'clock tone is
about<00:02:09.679> at<00:02:09.830> 11<00:02:10.250> right<00:02:10.280> now

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
about at 11 right now

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:22.600 
about at 11 right now
so<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> tolling<00:02:12.920> all<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.130> way<00:02:13.190> down<00:02:13.370> at<00:02:13.550> zero

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:36.150 

Oh

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:46.009 

all<00:02:37.160> way<00:02:37.550> down

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.830 

I<00:02:47.129> think<00:02:48.129> this<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.400> more<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.849> it's<00:02:49.420> more<00:02:49.659> for

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
I think this is more of a it's more for

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.559 
I think this is more of a it's more for
rhythm<00:02:50.230> stuff<00:02:50.530> far<00:02:51.340> as<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.610> can<00:02:51.819> tell<00:02:51.879> I<00:02:52.329> mean<00:02:52.540> a

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
rhythm stuff far as I can tell I mean a

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.240 
rhythm stuff far as I can tell I mean a
different<00:02:52.840> it's<00:02:53.439> a<00:02:53.560> little<00:02:53.709> bit<00:02:53.890> different

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
different it's a little bit different

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.180 
different it's a little bit different
sounding<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.730> saturator<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.659> fact<00:02:55.900> that

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
sounding the saturator to the fact that

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.350 
sounding the saturator to the fact that
it's<00:02:57.190> got<00:02:57.310> more<00:02:57.730> eq<00:02:58.329> qualities<00:02:59.260> bass<00:02:59.739> tone

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it's got more eq qualities bass tone

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.210 
it's got more eq qualities bass tone
volume<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.349> serves<00:03:02.560> as<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.769> nice<00:03:02.980> little

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
volume and it serves as a nice little

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.170 
volume and it serves as a nice little
boost<00:03:03.459> on<00:03:03.819> solos<00:03:04.680> but<00:03:05.680> honestly<00:03:05.950> when<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.370> flip

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
boost on solos but honestly when I flip

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.599 
boost on solos but honestly when I flip
this<00:03:07.329> in<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:08.109> rig<00:03:08.379> I<00:03:08.590> use<00:03:08.769> this<00:03:08.950> multi<00:03:09.400> for

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
this in my rig I use this multi for

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.819 
this in my rig I use this multi for
rhythm<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.120> my<00:03:10.510> solos<00:03:10.959> then<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.319> just<00:03:11.500> kick<00:03:11.680> in

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
rhythm and my solos then I just kick in

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.979 
rhythm and my solos then I just kick in
the<00:03:11.950> saturator<00:03:12.489> benzine<00:03:13.359> I<00:03:13.390> guess<00:03:13.659> what<00:03:13.870> you

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
the saturator benzine I guess what you

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.599 
the saturator benzine I guess what you
use<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:15.519> can<00:03:15.640> get<00:03:15.790> some<00:03:16.000> good<00:03:16.150> mid

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
use it for you can get some good mid

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.920 
use it for you can get some good mid
distortion<00:03:18.609> tones<00:03:18.819> here<00:03:19.060> again<00:03:19.269> I'm<00:03:19.420> not<00:03:19.659> I'm

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
distortion tones here again I'm not I'm

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.229 
distortion tones here again I'm not I'm
not<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.530> wish<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.430> had<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.609> little<00:03:21.700> more<00:03:21.970> game

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
not I wish it had a little more game

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.819 
not I wish it had a little more game
than<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.569> did<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:23.049> doesn't<00:03:23.349> really<00:03:23.590> have

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
than it did it doesn't really have

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.800 
than it did it doesn't really have
nothing<00:03:23.950> even<00:03:24.430> with<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.790> Morse<00:03:25.030> which<00:03:25.269> in<00:03:25.569> my

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
nothing even with the Morse which in my

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.720 
nothing even with the Morse which in my
opinion<00:03:25.930> there's<00:03:26.349> just<00:03:26.560> not<00:03:26.709> enough<00:03:26.769> gain

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
opinion there's just not enough gain

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.899 
opinion there's just not enough gain
with<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.150> um<00:03:28.409> I<00:03:29.409> think<00:03:30.129> it's<00:03:30.250> these<00:03:30.519> are<00:03:30.700> built

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
with it um I think it's these are built

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.000 
with it um I think it's these are built
basically<00:03:31.180> for<00:03:31.599> lead<00:03:31.780> guitar<00:03:32.139> players<00:03:32.409> not<00:03:32.769> so

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
basically for lead guitar players not so

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.080 
basically for lead guitar players not so

you're<00:03:37.329> into<00:03:37.540> metal<00:03:37.840> you're<00:03:38.049> not<00:03:38.230> going<00:03:38.470> to

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
you're into metal you're not going to

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.170 
you're into metal you're not going to
want<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:38.920> get<00:03:39.069> these<00:03:39.190> pedals<00:03:39.609> it's<00:03:39.790> more<00:03:39.970> for
