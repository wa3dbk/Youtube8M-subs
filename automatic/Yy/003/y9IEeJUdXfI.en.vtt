and it says go ahead there's no problem

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.570 
and it says go ahead there's no problem
just<00:00:24.539> tell<00:00:24.720> me<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.550> know

just tell me what you do and you know

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.859 
just tell me what you do and you know
and<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:26.970> worked<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.269> from<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.840> I

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and you have worked it from here so I

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.480 
and you have worked it from here so I
feel<00:00:28.320> very<00:00:28.439> comfortable<00:00:28.710> saying<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
feel very comfortable saying with the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.959 
feel very comfortable saying with the
fight<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.849> would<00:00:30.090> rather<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.439> both<00:00:31.800> places

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
fight I would rather be in both places

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.970 
fight I would rather be in both places
but<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.469> gonna<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.800> awkward

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
but I think it's gonna be awkward

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.400 
but I think it's gonna be awkward
situation<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.730> me<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.989> happened

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
situation for me but it's happened

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.729 
situation for me but it's happened
before

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
before

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.770 
before
and<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.640> feel<00:00:38.820> comfortable<00:00:39.000> at<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> end<00:00:39.540> we'll

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and I feel comfortable at the end we'll

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.750 
and I feel comfortable at the end we'll
be<00:00:39.809> able<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> perform<00:00:40.410> good<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.219> would<00:00:41.640> be

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
be able to perform good and I would be

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
be able to perform good and I would be
with<00:00:41.910> Miguel<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:43.079> hopefully<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> don't<00:00:43.920> have

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
with Miguel but hopefully I don't have

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.029 
with Miguel but hopefully I don't have
to<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.670> again<00:00:45.440> do<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> change

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
to do this again do you think the change

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.380 
to do this again do you think the change
of<00:00:47.160> opponents<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> big

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
of opponents is going to be a big

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.299 
of opponents is going to be a big
problem<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.780> him

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
problem for him

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.270 
problem for him
no<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.870> delayed<00:00:52.289> boxes<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:52.710> well<00:00:53.070> with

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
no and delayed boxes very well with

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.420 
no and delayed boxes very well with
South<00:00:53.730> Falls<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.840> his<00:00:55.079> best<00:00:55.649> victory<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.250> date

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
South Falls and his best victory to date

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.150 
South Falls and his best victory to date
in<00:00:56.579> his<00:00:56.699> career<00:00:57.050> was<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.590> he<00:00:58.710> fought<00:00:58.890> called

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
in his career was when he fought called

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160 
in his career was when he fought called
Daniels<00:00:59.609> which<00:00:59.850> was<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> South<00:01:00.329> Pole<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
Daniels which was a South Pole and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.900 
Daniels which was a South Pole and
coincidentally<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> night<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.699> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
coincidentally it was a night that I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
coincidentally it was a night that I
could<00:01:03.149> not<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.660> him<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.439> only<00:01:04.589> because

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
could not be with him the only because

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
could not be with him the only because
at<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.460> time<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> big<00:01:06.150> snowstorm<00:01:06.720> or

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
at that time it was a big snowstorm or

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.960 
at that time it was a big snowstorm or
something<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.070> doing<00:01:08.310> HBO<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.909> I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
something and I was doing HBO and I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.450 
something and I was doing HBO and I
couldn't<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.330> away<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.350> he<00:01:10.770> had<00:01:11.100> his<00:01:11.250> greatest

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
couldn't get away so he had his greatest

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.480 
couldn't get away so he had his greatest
victory<00:01:11.869> without<00:01:12.869> me<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:14.070> similar

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
victory without me so it's a similar

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.770 
victory without me so it's a similar
situation<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.040> McEwen<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
situation we think and McEwen is a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.170 
situation we think and McEwen is a
gangly<00:01:18.780> tight<00:01:19.049> by<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> moves<00:01:20.430> throws<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> lot

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
gangly tight by the moves throws a lot

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
gangly tight by the moves throws a lot
of<00:01:21.240> punches<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.979> stage<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.430> Andy<00:01:23.759> Lee

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
of punches but at this stage of Andy Lee

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700 
of punches but at this stage of Andy Lee
story<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.299> can't<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.869> him<00:01:25.020> having<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> problem

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
story I can't see him having a problem

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
story I can't see him having a problem
with<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> type<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.580> fighter<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.210> Andy

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
with that type of a fighter I think Andy

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.160 
with that type of a fighter I think Andy
first<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.530> he's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.280> little<00:01:29.670> bit<00:01:29.790> taller

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
first of all he's a little bit taller

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.510 
first of all he's a little bit taller
then<00:01:31.170> make<00:01:31.740> urine<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.310> something

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
then make urine which is something

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.880 
then make urine which is something
McHugh<00:01:32.939> Anderson<00:01:33.240> abuser<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
McHugh Anderson abuser I think and is

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.880 
McHugh Anderson abuser I think and is
much<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.390> how<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> puncher<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.259> his

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
much more of how a puncher and his

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.100 
much more of how a puncher and his
beautiful<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.520> jab<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:39.509> make<00:01:39.990> him

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
beautiful right jab would make him

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.760 
beautiful right jab would make him
systemic<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.070> breakdown<00:01:41.520> mercurial<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
systemic I think breakdown mercurial and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.539 
systemic I think breakdown mercurial and
systematically<00:01:43.770> break<00:01:44.040> him<00:01:44.159> down<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
systematically break him down and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.910

fight crazy here suggest short accurate
punches<00:04:56.600> because<00:04:56.930> my<00:04:57.590> yoga<00:04:57.890> cannot<00:04:58.220> for

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
punches because my yoga cannot for

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.790 
punches because my yoga cannot for
accurate<00:04:59.060> combinations<00:04:59.750> because<00:04:59.930> he's<00:05:00.110> he's

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
accurate combinations because he's he's

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.800 
accurate combinations because he's he's
just<00:05:00.830> not<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.760> type<00:05:02.000> of<00:05:02.030> a<00:05:02.240> fighter<00:05:02.479> and<00:05:02.690> I

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
just not that type of a fighter and I

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.070 
just not that type of a fighter and I
think<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.229> Miguel's<00:05:04.240> short<00:05:05.240> power<00:05:05.630> punches

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
think that Miguel's short power punches

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.200 
think that Miguel's short power punches
would<00:05:06.229> be<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.350> big<00:05:06.560> factor<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.190> I<00:05:07.520> think<00:05:08.090> the

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
would be a big factor and I think the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.420 
would be a big factor and I think the
fight<00:05:08.419> could<00:05:08.840> be<00:05:08.990> very<00:05:09.380> exciting<00:05:09.800> very

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
fight could be very exciting very

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.760

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.160 
or whichever and I don't think anyone
and<00:06:53.910> I<00:06:53.970> talked<00:06:54.210> to<00:06:54.360> later<00:06:54.540> be<00:06:54.690> on<00:06:54.780> a<00:06:54.810> regular

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.170 
and I talked to later be on a regular

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.070 
and I talked to later be on a regular
basis<00:06:55.530> anyone<00:06:56.310> knows<00:06:56.490> I<00:06:56.670> think<00:06:56.700> the<00:06:57.210> plan<00:06:58.020> is

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
basis anyone knows I think the plan is

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.950 
basis anyone knows I think the plan is
right<00:06:58.890> now<00:06:59.100> to<00:06:59.160> fight<00:06:59.640> Dereck<00:07:00.300> Chisora<00:07:00.330> which

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
right now to fight Dereck Chisora which

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.360 
right now to fight Dereck Chisora which
I<00:07:01.170> think<00:07:01.590> it's<00:07:01.710> a<00:07:01.770> much<00:07:01.980> more<00:07:02.190> dangerous

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
I think it's a much more dangerous

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.460 
I think it's a much more dangerous
opponent<00:07:03.000> and<00:07:03.090> everyone<00:07:03.450> thinks<00:07:03.690> including

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
opponent and everyone thinks including

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.950 
opponent and everyone thinks including
the<00:07:05.370> General<00:07:05.700> Affairs<00:07:05.760> I'd<00:07:06.270> let<00:07:06.600> him<00:07:06.690> I<00:07:06.840> think

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
the General Affairs I'd let him I think

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.060 
the General Affairs I'd let him I think
no<00:07:07.170> one<00:07:07.310> has<00:07:08.570> more<00:07:09.570> respect<00:07:09.900> for<00:07:10.200> just<00:07:10.920> over

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
no one has more respect for just over

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.390 
no one has more respect for just over
than<00:07:11.310> I<00:07:11.400> do<00:07:11.460> and<00:07:11.880> the<00:07:12.870> things<00:07:13.140> go<00:07:13.350> well<00:07:13.560> it

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 
than I do and the things go well it

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.100 
than I do and the things go well it
looks<00:07:14.730> as<00:07:14.880> if<00:07:14.910> it's<00:07:15.180> a<00:07:15.240> possibility<00:07:15.870> that<00:07:15.900> he

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
looks as if it's a possibility that he

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.200 
looks as if it's a possibility that he
may<00:07:16.290> fight<00:07:16.590> without<00:07:17.160> America<00:07:17.700> maybe<00:07:18.060> in

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210
