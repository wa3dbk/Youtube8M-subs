00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:24.090
 yes, simply 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.449
 but there 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.640
 I finally got him because 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.989
 that I did not have and then I did not have the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.269
 last to spend with us and all that 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.420
 so I'm very happy I started again 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.260
 my courses of the past years 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.839
 when I was rodez and at a 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.030
 teacher who really helped my 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.019
 past all the courses I have to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.239
 informs the ashes and not what is 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.059
 possible even informed for example for 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.490
 which is just for their training or 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.320
 whether to enter an entrance examination to 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.569
 school or at home and if it is possible 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.569
 with the crazy always summer 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.300
 it's my first competition with 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.040
 seniors I have done that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.200
 competitions with young teams 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.979
 so that's my first one we'll say and 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.490
 it's important and I have a lot of 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.100
 things to see 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.940
 I will be at the service of the team during 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.280
 trainings 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.910
 and after that I will also observe my 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.440
 comrades 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.320
 finally the other babysitters could 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.230
 evolve to learn yet to be 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.690
 mess 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.690
 one day in another class
