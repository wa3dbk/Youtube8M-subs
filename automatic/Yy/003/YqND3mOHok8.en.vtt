that<00:02:26.670> got<00:02:26.880> my<00:02:27.060> attention<00:02:27.210> because<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.780> was

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that got my attention because that was

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.040 
that got my attention because that was
the<00:02:28.050> first<00:02:28.380> time<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.250> had<00:02:30.180> any<00:02:30.330> clue<00:02:30.780> or

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
the first time I had any clue or

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.120 
the first time I had any clue or
reference<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:32.340> what<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.700> number<00:02:32.910> could<00:02:33.270> mean

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
reference to what this number could mean

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.470 
reference to what this number could mean
so<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.160> jumped<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.640> internet<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.240> tried

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
so I jumped on the internet and I tried

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.920 
so I jumped on the internet and I tried
to<00:02:36.570> do<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> search<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.380> was<00:02:37.470> looking<00:02:37.830> for<00:02:38.930> Jesus's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
to do a search I was looking for Jesus's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.580 
to do a search I was looking for Jesus's
number<00:02:40.910> Jesus's<00:02:41.910> three<00:02:42.720> three<00:02:42.930> three<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:43.290> was

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
number Jesus's three three three I was

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.740 
number Jesus's three three three I was
just<00:02:43.890> looking<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.850> couldn't<00:02:45.270> find<00:02:45.420> anything

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
just looking and couldn't find anything

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.190 
just looking and couldn't find anything
in<00:02:46.670> about<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> year<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.290> later<00:02:49.590> after<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:50.250> I

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
in about a year so later after that I

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.460 
in about a year so later after that I
guess<00:02:52.200> God<00:02:52.860> felt<00:02:53.190> sorry<00:02:53.490> for<00:02:53.640> me<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:55.080> just<00:02:55.320> came

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
guess God felt sorry for me it just came

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.760 
guess God felt sorry for me it just came
to<00:02:55.680> me<00:02:55.800> one<00:02:55.950> night<00:02:55.980> says<00:02:56.540> dummy<00:02:57.540> do<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.380> search

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
to me one night says dummy do a search

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.180 
to me one night says dummy do a search
for<00:02:59.130> God's<00:02:59.520> number<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:01.680> did<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> search<00:03:02.130> for

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
for God's number and I did a search for

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.940 
for God's number and I did a search for
that<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.720> was<00:03:03.840> all<00:03:03.990> kind<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.380> stuff<00:03:04.620> under

basically<00:03:08.540> people<00:03:09.540> who<00:03:09.600> study<00:03:09.900> numbers<00:03:10.350> in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
basically people who study numbers in

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.400 
basically people who study numbers in
the<00:03:10.620> Bible<00:03:11.060> they<00:03:12.060> believe<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.960> is<00:03:13.020> God's

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
the Bible they believe this is God's

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.340 
the Bible they believe this is God's
number<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.970> Trinity<00:03:15.510> Jesus<00:03:15.960> was<00:03:16.080> thirty

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
number the Trinity Jesus was thirty

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.490 
number the Trinity Jesus was thirty
three<00:03:16.440> died<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.130> raised<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.640> three<00:03:17.850> days<00:03:21.500> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
three died and raised in three days the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.610 
three died and raised in three days the
plagues<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.370> what<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:24.210> lot<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.720> things<00:03:25.110> happens

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
plagues and what a lot of things happens

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.560 
plagues and what a lot of things happens
in<00:03:25.740> three<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.430> it's<00:03:26.580> real<00:03:26.760> significant<00:03:27.420> with

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
in three so it's real significant with

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.970 
in three so it's real significant with
God<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:28.170> threes<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:30.290> devil<00:03:31.290> says<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.800> he

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
God in threes and the devil says that he

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.290 
God in threes and the devil says that he
goes<00:03:32.850> by<00:03:33.090> 666<00:03:33.480> he<00:03:33.960> says<00:03:34.170> he's<00:03:34.380> twice<00:03:34.680> God<00:03:35.300> so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
goes by 666 he says he's twice God so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.050 
goes by 666 he says he's twice God so
that's<00:03:36.720> where<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.960> get<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.170> 666<00:03:37.710> now<00:03:38.520> I'm<00:03:38.880> not

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
that's where you get to 666 now I'm not

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.840 
that's where you get to 666 now I'm not
a<00:03:39.320> numerologists<00:03:40.320> or<00:03:40.500> don't<00:03:41.190> study<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.550> just

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
a numerologists or don't study I just

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.420 
a numerologists or don't study I just
thought<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.120> was<00:03:42.180> interesting<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.950> because

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
thought it was interesting and because

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.630 
thought it was interesting and because
this<00:03:44.820> number<00:03:45.350> chased<00:03:46.350> me<00:03:46.650> for<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:47.010> long<00:03:47.040> I

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
this number chased me for so long I

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.720 
this number chased me for so long I
decided<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.420> get<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.660> chain<00:03:48.900> made<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.730> honor

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
decided to get the chain made in honor

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.960 
decided to get the chain made in honor
of<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.890> freida<00:03:52.890> thing<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.340> each<00:03:53.550> three

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
of that and freida thing is each three

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.860 
of that and freida thing is each three
has<00:03:54.210> seven<00:03:54.900> diamonds<00:03:55.410> in<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:56.150> which<00:03:57.150> seven

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
has seven diamonds in it which seven

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.450 
has seven diamonds in it which seven
goes<00:03:58.020> into<00:03:58.050> three<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.830> know<00:03:58.920> back<00:03:59.130> into<00:03:59.370> the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
goes into three you know back into the

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.530 
goes into three you know back into the
numerology<00:04:00.150> thing<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:02.030> then<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.150> found<00:04:03.330> out

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
numerology thing so then I found out

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.450 
numerology thing so then I found out
later<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.020> year<00:04:04.320> that<00:04:04.380> there's<00:04:04.890> something
