 well made a proponent of 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.390
 this is the mode of the bbc the second module c explains of course of the low baby 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.820
 this way bauru suárez

 between selection on the side in this white area and on the big screen that escape 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.810
 in European tests equivocal and here 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.799
 we have three search buttons são paulo min 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.760
 search button is what opens the search window shows for example that e 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.879
 recreation

 and going to search for a rock song 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.129
 how many times in the life in which it was found 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.719
 the word is visible in rock 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.139
 before departure 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.869
 I already told you that 53 incidents were found when you read who God 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.539
 verse separately 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:33.729
 do not go here 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:37.029
 if you want to add something comment 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.029
 and you have the possibility to comment 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:45.369
 just so that this commentary looks after it is important that it 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.180
 saves 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.049
 then that little button will save because on the bottom 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.260
 is to save some additional comment that was entered by the search 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.059
 and that saves us 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:59.799
 and neither first time at 41min here is not what was given in the research 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.369
 published first 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:03.329
 it generates a print file 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.329
 here appears in the first moment the serial comment 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.420
 a third mode can now be explained by the dictionary bid 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.879

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.299
 the arrangement of tens or say hundreds of words 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.149
 with their respective meaning, for example here 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.249
 Anna, I got it. 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:25.849

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:34.469
 from Babylon 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.749
 so the explanation comes 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.799
 with biblical references, right? 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.519
 in this word to users and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.549
 if you do not want to move with the mouse you have the possibility to quickly edit the 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.889
 word said with the word bacterial example

 cave where the work of zagreb and weak camilo was buried 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.759

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.029
 on the opening line of a bilingual dictionary showing an explanation 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.720
 word explanations found on the skin 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.019
 our fourth module which is the world of comments here we have 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.529
 commented 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.199
 sorted by ip 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.029
 we have here 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.099
 each book with its respective comments 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.400

 with them the network of the book of lisbon being the complaint of the book to solve this 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.610
 warning 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.599
 so there is a whole story unfolding 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.499
 in the book of jeremiah 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.370
 and below in the end yes we have here a classified neem book 

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.990
 per 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.960
 steps for example the so-called guideline 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.349
 kostenko chapter whistle first

 message from the tents of several kings bar from chapter 2 to 25 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.639

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.900
 of each liter 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.910

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.310
 we have here the comment 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.809
 lower 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.569
 we have here 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.960
 the big time line lisbon only 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.669
 a mustache 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.009
 first is yours then there yes in all these comments biblical user has 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.660
 the possibility of quickly searching me dedicating with some craques he will 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.009

 it's the special forces mode here we have dozens of photos 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.909
 from israel 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:57.180
 all of them separately by text here and the respective photo akira right 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.889
 so the displacement is also super convenient to move with the bar 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:02.020
 departures 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.339
 As a user you can type what you would like to search 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.479
 I'm going to put for example river jordan 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.389
 lincon quickly even not ours 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.949

 the same way that happens in that game happens in the company in March the opposite 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.069
 tandara that through the button create as by clicking on mars 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:35.619
 dublin to year 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:38.150
 user then check 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.680
 the problematic and also retired print weeks 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.180
 in this first place in the world 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.030
 you can zoom in or out of that image 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.680
 and this we see was a butler special forces are dozens of outbreaks already 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.770
 we were born that boy photo 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.509
