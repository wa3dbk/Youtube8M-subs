00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.420 
the site thankfully I was able to get it
sitting<00:03:32.110> there<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.470> my<00:03:32.500> web<00:03:32.800> browser<00:03:32.830> before

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
sitting there on my web browser before

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.810 
sitting there on my web browser before
it<00:03:33.730> blew<00:03:33.850> up<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.120> guess<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:35.530> pretty<00:03:36.220> cool<00:03:36.490> and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
it blew up I guess so pretty cool and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.670 
it blew up I guess so pretty cool and
then<00:03:36.910> there's<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.209> post<00:03:37.750> of<00:03:37.959> just<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.290> picture

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
then there's a post of just the picture

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.910 
then there's a post of just the picture
which<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.160> also<00:03:39.459> pretty<00:03:39.760> cool<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.590> what's

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
which is also pretty cool so and what's

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.170 
which is also pretty cool so and what's
going<00:03:42.130> on<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.340> foreground<00:03:42.670> here<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:43.000> just

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
going on the foreground here it just

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.520 
going on the foreground here it just
looks<00:03:43.330> like<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.540> fence<00:03:43.840> trashcan<00:03:44.680> wires<00:03:45.310> I

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
looks like a fence trashcan wires I

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.720 
looks like a fence trashcan wires I
wonder<00:03:47.530> if<00:03:47.590> these<00:03:47.680> are<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.890> same<00:03:48.010> damn<00:03:48.430> wires

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
wonder if these are the same damn wires

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.699 
wonder if these are the same damn wires
that<00:03:49.060> we've<00:03:49.240> had<00:03:49.450> from<00:03:49.690> devmode<00:03:49.990> and<00:03:50.410> Super

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
that we've had from devmode and Super

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.460 
that we've had from devmode and Super
Meat<00:03:50.860> Boy<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:51.600> know<00:03:52.600> how<00:03:52.810> much<00:03:52.990> they<00:03:53.170> like<00:03:53.320> to

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
Meat Boy I know how much they like to

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.380 
Meat Boy I know how much they like to
reuse<00:03:53.770> their<00:03:53.980> assets<00:03:54.400> but<00:03:54.520> now<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.030> kind<00:03:55.330> of

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
reuse their assets but now I kind of

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.560 
reuse their assets but now I kind of
doubt<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.780> considering<00:03:56.320> this<00:03:56.440> all<00:03:56.620> looks

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
doubt it considering this all looks

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.810 
doubt it considering this all looks
thicker<00:03:58.570> everything<00:03:59.290> has<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.470> big<00:04:00.220> stroke<00:04:00.580> on

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
thicker everything has a big stroke on

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.570 
thicker everything has a big stroke on
it<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:01.350> mean<00:04:02.350> there's<00:04:02.500> still<00:04:02.620> be<00:04:02.740> using<00:04:03.280> flash

why not

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.740 
why not
so<00:04:26.080> will<00:04:26.260> we<00:04:26.440> be<00:04:26.470> like<00:04:26.770> breeding<00:04:27.430> cats<00:04:27.750> or

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
so will we be like breeding cats or

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.840 
so will we be like breeding cats or
something<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.470> don't<00:04:29.680> know<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.889> really<00:04:30.100> have<00:04:30.669> no

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
something I don't know I really have no

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.530 
something I don't know I really have no
idea<00:04:30.880> how<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.330> even<00:04:31.419> speculate<00:04:32.110> on<00:04:32.139> this<00:04:33.540> you

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
idea how to even speculate on this you

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.659 
idea how to even speculate on this you
know<00:04:34.690> it's<00:04:34.840> random<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:35.530> it'll<00:04:36.070> be<00:04:36.190> I'm<00:04:36.460> sure

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
know it's random so it'll be I'm sure

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.190 
know it's random so it'll be I'm sure
very<00:04:36.880> addictive<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.389> it's<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.630> team<00:04:37.810> me<00:04:37.990> game

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
very addictive and it's a team me game

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.780 
very addictive and it's a team me game
and<00:04:38.440> it's<00:04:38.530> weird<00:04:38.770> so<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:39.100> mean<00:04:39.370> those<00:04:39.490> are<00:04:39.669> all

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
and it's weird so I mean those are all

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.420 
and it's weird so I mean those are all
the<00:04:39.940> fundamentals<00:04:40.600> that<00:04:40.780> we<00:04:40.870> really<00:04:41.139> require

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
the fundamentals that we really require

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.180 
the fundamentals that we really require
to<00:04:42.430> have<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.550> good<00:04:42.730> time<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.680> guess<00:04:45.010> I'll

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
to have a good time so I guess I'll

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.530 
to have a good time so I guess I'll
leave<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.490> with<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:45.790> I<00:04:45.850> just<00:04:46.000> wanted<00:04:46.389> to

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
share this exciting moment I'm pretty

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.730 
share this exciting moment I'm pretty
sure<00:04:49.480> a<00:04:49.510> lot<00:04:49.780> of<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:50.020> guys<00:04:50.139> that<00:04:50.410> watch<00:04:50.530> my
