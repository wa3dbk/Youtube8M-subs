00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
rip currents work and what you do if you

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.460 
rip currents work and what you do if you
end<00:01:01.229> up<00:01:01.739> being<00:01:01.979> stuck<00:01:02.339> in<00:01:02.549> one<00:01:02.960> how<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> prevent

end up being stuck in one how to prevent
getting<00:01:04.680> into<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> situation<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.790> first

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
getting into that situation the first

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.500 
getting into that situation the first
place<00:01:06.270> trip<00:01:07.049> currents<00:01:07.560> caused<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.270> many

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
place trip currents caused so many

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
place trip currents caused so many
drownings<00:01:09.930> every<00:01:10.680> single<00:01:11.010> year<00:01:11.220> along<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
drownings every single year along this

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.580 
drownings every single year along this
coastline<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.630> along<00:01:12.960> South<00:01:13.200> Africa's

coastline and along South Africa's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.789 
coastline and along South Africa's
coastline<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.030> worth<00:01:15.240> noting<00:01:15.840> are<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
coastline so it's worth noting are to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.819 
coastline so it's worth noting are to
read<00:01:17.039> rip<00:01:17.310> currents<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> identify<00:01:19.140> them

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
read rip currents how to identify them

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.120 
read rip currents how to identify them
in<00:01:20.070> order<00:01:20.609> to<00:01:20.759> steer<00:01:21.000> clear<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.299> them<00:01:21.890> if<00:01:22.890> we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
in order to steer clear of them if we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.459 
in order to steer clear of them if we
look<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> stretch<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.969> coast<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
look at a stretch of coast like this and

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.020 
look at a stretch of coast like this and
a<00:01:25.530> stretch<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> beach<00:01:26.539> you'll<00:01:27.539> see<00:01:28.579> sand<00:01:29.579> banks

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
a stretch of beach you'll see sand banks

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.999 
a stretch of beach you'll see sand banks
they<00:01:30.210> are<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> most<00:01:30.630> obvious<00:01:30.869> thing<00:01:31.859> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
they are the most obvious thing to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.620 
they are the most obvious thing to
identify<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.929> you<00:01:34.079> see<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> line<00:01:35.070> of

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
identify and what you see is a line of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.770 
identify and what you see is a line of
broken<00:01:36.630> wave<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.859> foamy<00:01:38.520> white<00:01:38.759> water<00:01:39.119> using<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
broken wave of foamy white water using a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.830 
broken wave of foamy white water using a
straight<00:01:40.079> line<00:01:40.380> coming<00:01:40.799> towards<00:01:41.249> the<00:01:41.399> beach

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
straight line coming towards the beach

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
straight line coming towards the beach
so<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> birth<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.409> wave<00:01:43.590> breaks<00:01:43.979> far<00:01:44.640> out

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
so the birth of the wave breaks far out

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.669 
so the birth of the wave breaks far out
and<00:01:45.179> then<00:01:45.359> it<00:01:45.479> starts<00:01:45.840> moving<00:01:46.020> towards<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
and then it starts moving towards the

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.649 
and then it starts moving towards the
beach<00:01:46.859> and<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.249> that's<00:01:47.579> over<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> sand<00:01:48.420> bank

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
beach and that's that's over a sand bank

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.120 
beach and that's that's over a sand bank
and<00:01:49.700> then<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> side<00:01:52.289> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> sand<00:01:52.890> bank

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and then to the side of the sand bank

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.599 
and then to the side of the sand bank
quite<00:01:53.490> often<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.569> channel<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.770> then

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
quite often you see a channel and then

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.459 
quite often you see a channel and then
there's<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.969> next<00:01:57.270> sandbag<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.229> channel

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
there's a next sandbag so the channel

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.300 
there's a next sandbag so the channel
sits<00:01:58.829> between<00:01:59.009> two<00:01:59.429> sand<00:01:59.700> banks<00:01:59.999> typic

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
sits between two sand banks typic

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.840 
sits between two sand banks typic
what<00:02:02.310> happens<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.720> sea<00:02:03.990> brings<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.619> water

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
what happens is the sea brings the water

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.240 
what happens is the sea brings the water
by<00:02:05.850> way<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.210> waves<00:02:06.509> onto<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.470> beach<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.039> then

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
by way of waves onto the beach and then

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.949 
by way of waves onto the beach and then
that<00:02:08.399> water<00:02:08.580> needs<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.119> get<00:02:09.270> back<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> sea

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
that water needs to get back to the sea

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.050 
that water needs to get back to the sea
and<00:02:10.370> it<00:02:11.370> runs<00:02:11.610> sideways<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.660> forms<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:14.060> deep

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and it runs sideways and forms a deep

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.150 
and it runs sideways and forms a deep
furrow<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.319> in<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.590> bottom<00:02:17.010> of

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
furrow in the in the in the bottom of

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.900 
furrow in the in the in the bottom of
the<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.940> sand<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.860> as<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.370> water<00:02:20.550> runs

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
the of the sand and as the water runs

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.670 
the of the sand and as the water runs
through<00:02:21.060> back<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.690> sea<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.140> fire<00:02:22.380> gets

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
through back to the sea that fire gets

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.090 
through back to the sea that fire gets
deeper<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.130> deeper<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:25.560> channel<00:02:26.069> that

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
deeper and deeper and that channel that

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.410 
deeper and deeper and that channel that
water<00:02:26.519> that's<00:02:26.819> running<00:02:26.970> through<00:02:27.300> that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
water that's running through that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.670 
water that's running through that
channel<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.989> what's<00:02:28.200> called<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.530> rip

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
channel is what's called the rip

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.030 
channel is what's called the rip
currents<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:30.150> rip<00:02:30.390> current<00:02:30.810> will<00:02:31.140> run

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
currents and that rip current will run

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.009 
currents and that rip current will run
all<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.459> way<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.120> back<00:02:33.269> line<00:02:33.540> slightly

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
all the way to the back line slightly

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.900 
all the way to the back line slightly
beyond<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> back<00:02:34.769> line<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.250> then<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.550> Peters

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
beyond the back line and then it Peters

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.490 
beyond the back line and then it Peters
out<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.560> what<00:02:37.830> if<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:39.540> do<00:02:39.780> get<00:02:39.959> caught<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.410> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
out so what if you do get caught in the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.940 
out so what if you do get caught in the
current

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
current

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.789 
current
it<00:02:41.700> can<00:02:42.060> happen<00:02:42.269> easily<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.530> Seas

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
it can happen easily the Seas

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.920 
it can happen easily the Seas
unpredictable<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.700> big<00:02:44.880> wave<00:02:45.090> may<00:02:45.420> push<00:02:45.720> you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
unpredictable a big wave may push you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.500 
unpredictable a big wave may push you
into<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.350> channel<00:02:46.799> so<00:02:47.700> what<00:02:47.880> happens<00:02:48.269> is

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
into that channel so what happens is

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.300 
into that channel so what happens is
typically<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.260> quite<00:02:49.500> deep<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.950> lose<00:02:50.130> your

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
some point it will stop pulling you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.960 
some point it will stop pulling you
