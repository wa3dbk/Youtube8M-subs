00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.039 

so<00:00:07.549> let's<00:00:07.729> go<00:00:07.819> to<00:00:07.879> overclock<00:00:08.330> the<00:00:08.360> processor

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
so let's go to overclock the processor

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.900 
so let's go to overclock the processor
using<00:00:09.379> this<00:00:09.500> gigabyte<00:00:09.980> motherboard<00:00:10.519> now<00:00:10.670> each

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
using this gigabyte motherboard now each

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.299 
using this gigabyte motherboard now each
motherboard<00:00:11.209> is<00:00:11.539> different<00:00:12.019> so<00:00:12.230> you're<00:00:12.889> the

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
motherboard is different so you're the

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.039 
motherboard is different so you're the
weightless<00:00:13.639> on<00:00:13.760> yours<00:00:13.969> it<00:00:14.449> may<00:00:14.570> be<00:00:14.629> different

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
weightless on yours it may be different

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.330 
weightless on yours it may be different
from<00:00:15.109> what<00:00:15.289> it<00:00:15.379> looks<00:00:15.529> like<00:00:15.680> online<00:00:15.889> but

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
from what it looks like online but

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.400 
from what it looks like online but
basically<00:00:17.060> there's<00:00:17.330> a<00:00:17.420> slider<00:00:17.660> bar<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.260> a

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
basically there's a slider bar and a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.080 
basically there's a slider bar and a
drop-down<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:18.980> change<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.279> speed<00:00:19.550> of<00:00:19.730> the

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
drop-down to change the speed of the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.450 
drop-down to change the speed of the
processor<00:00:20.810> all<00:00:21.199> you<00:00:21.410> just<00:00:21.529> just<00:00:21.800> go<00:00:21.949> ahead<00:00:22.099> and

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
processor all you just just go ahead and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.839 
processor all you just just go ahead and
change<00:00:23.359> it<00:00:23.539> save<00:00:24.380> and<00:00:24.560> exit<00:00:24.859> this<00:00:25.490> is<00:00:25.550> just

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
change it save and exit this is just

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.210 
change it save and exit this is just

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
some problems with with the game

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.390 
some problems with with the game
crashing<00:01:36.020> on<00:01:36.110> them<00:01:36.260> for<00:01:36.650> different<00:01:36.830> reasons

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
crashing on them for different reasons

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.700 
crashing on them for different reasons
so<00:01:38.330> with<00:01:38.510> this<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:38.960> kind<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.229> helped<00:01:39.500> me<00:01:39.590> you

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
so with this it kind of helped me you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.530 
so with this it kind of helped me you
know<00:01:40.870> say<00:01:41.870> okay<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.890> might<00:01:43.040> not<00:01:43.220> be<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.549> the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
know say okay it might not be the the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.910 
know say okay it might not be the the
actual<00:01:44.870> processor<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.440> might<00:01:45.560> not<00:01:45.680> be<00:01:45.799> the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
actual processor it might not be the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.789 
actual processor it might not be the
motherboard<00:01:46.460> it's<00:01:46.940> most<00:01:47.210> likely<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.659> game<00:01:47.840> so

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
motherboard it's most likely the game so

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.580 
motherboard it's most likely the game so
I<00:01:49.130> went<00:01:49.729> ahead<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:49.970> did<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.360> quick<00:01:50.570> test<00:01:50.930> i<00:01:51.110> IE

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
I went ahead and did a quick test i IE

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.340 
I went ahead and did a quick test i IE
overclocked<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:52.369> believe<00:01:53.030> up<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:53.330> 4.2<00:01:54.110> or

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
overclocked it I believe up to 4.2 or

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.030 
overclocked it I believe up to 4.2 or
4.3<00:01:55.040> I<00:01:55.940> did<00:01:56.600> run<00:01:56.780> shadows<00:01:57.229> of<00:01:57.380> Mordor<00:01:57.740> the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
4.3 I did run shadows of Mordor the

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.960 
4.3 I did run shadows of Mordor the
benchmark<00:01:58.520> test<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.750> went<00:02:00.170> through

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
benchmark test and it went through

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.760 
benchmark test and it went through
all<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.420> way<00:02:01.540> without<00:02:01.840> any<00:02:02.020> problems<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:02.590> ran

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
all the way without any problems I ran

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.100 
all the way without any problems I ran
it<00:02:02.890> twice<00:02:03.040> no<00:02:03.940> crashes<00:02:04.540> at<00:02:04.660> all<00:02:04.750> whatsoever

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
it twice no crashes at all whatsoever

you'll<00:04:08.569> get<00:04:08.780> better<00:04:09.019> results<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.370> here<00:04:10.880> we<00:04:11.000> go

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
you'll get better results so here we go

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.000 
you'll get better results so here we go
we<00:04:11.300> got<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.630> we<00:04:11.959> got<00:04:11.989> prime95<00:04:12.440> running

temperatures are climbing up though I

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.710 
temperatures are climbing up though I
didn't<00:04:15.410> notice<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:15.860> it<00:04:16.669> got<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.120> mid-70s

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
didn't notice that it got to the mid-70s

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.430 
didn't notice that it got to the mid-70s
on<00:04:18.049> average<00:04:18.790> I<00:04:19.790> started<00:04:20.630> getting<00:04:20.870> worried<00:04:21.229> I

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
on average I started getting worried I

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.670 
on average I started getting worried I
was<00:04:22.040> about<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.490> stop<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.940> test<00:04:23.270> but<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.350> let<00:04:24.560> it

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
was about to stop the test but I let it

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.290 
was about to stop the test but I let it
go<00:04:24.830> for<00:04:25.040> another<00:04:25.160> one<00:04:25.460> or<00:04:25.520> two<00:04:25.639> minutes<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.150> see

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
go for another one or two minutes to see

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.500 
go for another one or two minutes to see
how<00:04:26.450> how<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.080> high<00:04:27.260> goes<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:28.120> surprisingly<00:04:29.120> it

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
how how it high goes and surprisingly it

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.780 
how how it high goes and surprisingly it
it<00:04:29.750> leveled<00:04:30.260> off<00:04:30.380> in<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.680> mid<00:04:30.860> 70s<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.520> didn't

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
it leveled off in the mid 70s it didn't

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.430 
it leveled off in the mid 70s it didn't
really<00:04:32.000> go<00:04:32.150> above<00:04:32.360> that<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:32.870> then<00:04:33.080> there<00:04:33.380> were

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
really go above that and then there were

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.980 
really go above that and then there were
some<00:04:33.620> parts<00:04:33.919> were<00:04:34.010> starting<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.400> go<00:04:34.610> down<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.960> I

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
some parts were starting to go down so I

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.650 
some parts were starting to go down so I
am<00:04:36.440> extremely<00:04:37.070> happy<00:04:37.280> with<00:04:37.729> these<00:04:37.940> results<00:04:38.000> in

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
am extremely happy with these results in

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.800 
am extremely happy with these results in
I'm<00:04:38.840> glad<00:04:39.200> that<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.740> know<00:04:40.389> then<00:04:41.389> I<00:04:41.419> didn't

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
I'm glad that a you know then I didn't

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.390 
I'm glad that a you know then I didn't
give<00:04:41.930> up<00:04:41.960> in<00:04:42.229> regards<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.650> overclocking<00:04:43.280> this

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
give up in regards to overclocking this

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.480 
give up in regards to overclocking this
processor<00:04:44.030> on<00:04:44.330> this<00:04:44.900> h-series<00:04:45.770> motherboard

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
processor on this h-series motherboard

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.050 
processor on this h-series motherboard
now<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:47.690> processor<00:04:48.470> itself<00:04:48.590> is<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.490> port<00:04:50.000> of

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
now the processor itself is the port of

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.540 
now the processor itself is the port of
the<00:04:50.120> ops<00:04:50.450> or<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.810> costa<00:04:51.260> rica<00:04:51.590> chip<00:04:51.860> not<00:04:52.340> the

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
the ops or the costa rica chip not the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.159 
the ops or the costa rica chip not the
relationship<00:04:53.180> which<00:04:53.390> i've<00:04:53.539> heard<00:04:53.810> on<00:04:53.960> line

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
relationship which i've heard on line

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.890 
relationship which i've heard on line
that<00:04:54.380> it<00:04:54.650> does<00:04:54.890> tend<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.400> overclock<00:04:55.789> better<00:04:56.150> so

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
that it does tend to overclock better so

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.890 
that it does tend to overclock better so
again<00:04:57.110> this<00:04:57.200> is<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.440> costa<00:04:57.800> rica<00:04:58.070> chip<00:04:58.660> so<00:04:59.660> far

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
again this is the costa rica chip so far

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.170 
again this is the costa rica chip so far
I'm<00:05:00.560> happy<00:05:00.950> with<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.280> ran<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:01.580> for<00:05:01.669> about<00:05:01.789> six

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
I'm happy with it I ran it for about six

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.150 
I'm happy with it I ran it for about six
minutes<00:05:02.390> I<00:05:02.720> believe<00:05:03.020> or<00:05:03.200> so<00:05:03.380> live<00:05:03.560> five<00:05:03.860> or<00:05:03.979> six

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
minutes I believe or so live five or six

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.320 
minutes I believe or so live five or six
minutes<00:05:04.520> Sun<00:05:04.760> prime95<00:05:05.590> temperatures<00:05:06.590> were

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
minutes Sun prime95 temperatures were

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.140 
minutes Sun prime95 temperatures were
not<00:05:08.330> bad<00:05:08.690> on<00:05:09.020> stock<00:05:09.530> cooler<00:05:09.830> and<00:05:10.160> with<00:05:10.370> you
