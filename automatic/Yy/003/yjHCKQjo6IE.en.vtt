call this growing up kind of watery milk
which<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.580> predominantly<00:00:24.420> water<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.990> lactose

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
which is predominantly water and lactose

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.950 
which is predominantly water and lactose
once<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.460> put<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> baby<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.000> breast<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.689> start

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.390 
once you put a baby to breast or start

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
pumping then your breath starts

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.060 
pumping then your breath starts
synthesizing<00:00:29.810> fat<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> fat<00:00:31.320> starts<00:00:31.920> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
synthesizing fat and the fat starts to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.819 
synthesizing fat and the fat starts to
move<00:00:32.189> through<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> milk<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> baby

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
move through so the milk that the baby

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.010 
move through so the milk that the baby
is<00:00:34.980> getting<00:00:35.130> into<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> feeding<00:00:35.940> has<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.630> fat

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
is getting into the feeding has more fat

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
is getting into the feeding has more fat
has<00:00:37.350> cinnamon<00:00:37.590> lactose<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.550> has<00:00:38.670> more<00:00:38.850> fat

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
has cinnamon lactose but it has more fat

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.900 
has cinnamon lactose but it has more fat
and<00:00:39.660> that's<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.500> milk<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.950> seems<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.550> stay

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and that's the milk that seems to stay

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.209 
and that's the milk that seems to stay
