00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
little thing that we have put in place

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.030 
little thing that we have put in place
here<00:03:53.799> is<00:03:53.950> important<00:03:54.959> now<00:03:55.959> what<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:56.739> brought

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
here is important now what that brought

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.430 
here is important now what that brought
me<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.280> was<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:58.120> would<00:03:58.690> normally<00:03:59.049> not<00:03:59.200> make<00:03:59.410> a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
me to was I would normally not make a

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.350 
me to was I would normally not make a
video<00:03:59.590> about<00:03:59.890> something<00:04:00.340> like<00:04:00.549> this<00:04:00.850> because

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
video about something like this because

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.539 
video about something like this because
it<00:04:02.170> may<00:04:02.410> seem<00:04:02.680> silly<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.489> just

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
it may seem silly to you and I just

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.190 
it may seem silly to you and I just
don't<00:04:03.760> think<00:04:03.940> generally<00:04:04.540> it's<00:04:04.660> worthy<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:04.989> a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
don't think generally it's worthy of a

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.570 
don't think generally it's worthy of a
video<00:04:05.470> but<00:04:05.530> I'm<00:04:05.799> thinking<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.250> know<00:04:06.370> what<00:04:06.549> I

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
video but I'm thinking you know what I

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.960 
video but I'm thinking you know what I
need<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.000> share<00:04:07.209> more<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.570> what<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.049> do<00:04:08.940> that

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
need to share more of what I do that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.910 
need to share more of what I do that
that<00:04:10.480> maybe<00:04:10.720> doesn't<00:04:11.110> seem<00:04:11.260> like<00:04:11.440> traditional

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
that maybe doesn't seem like traditional

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.060 
that maybe doesn't seem like traditional

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
to boil them I never put excess I just

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.820 
to boil them I never put excess I just
cover<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.289> wall

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
cover the wall

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.980 
cover the wall
cover<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.400> potatoes<00:04:27.790> with<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.090> water<00:04:28.300> well

cover the potatoes with the water well
here<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.200> was<00:04:29.350> about<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.680> drain<00:04:29.919> them<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:30.280> I

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
here I was about to drain them so I

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.860 
here I was about to drain them so I
could<00:04:30.550> fix<00:04:30.730> them<00:04:30.970> for<00:04:31.180> supper<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:31.690> thought

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
could fix them for supper and I thought

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.110 
could fix them for supper and I thought
you<00:04:32.080> know<00:04:32.200> what<00:04:32.350> I'm<00:04:32.530> going<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.770> show<00:04:33.040> you<00:04:33.120> what

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
you know what I'm going to show you what

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.260 
you know what I'm going to show you what
I<00:04:34.389> do<00:04:34.450> so<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.230> will<00:04:35.380> know<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:35.950> am<00:04:36.669> in<00:04:37.000> the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
I do so that you will know I am in the

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.770 
I do so that you will know I am in the
habit<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:37.960> not<00:04:38.440> wasting<00:04:39.190> anything<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:40.060> think

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
habit of not wasting anything I think

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.560 
habit of not wasting anything I think
it's<00:04:41.139> good<00:04:41.470> practice<00:04:42.100> not<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.639> waste<00:04:43.150> because

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
it's good practice not to waste because

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.379 
it's good practice not to waste because
if<00:04:44.290> I<00:04:44.889> were<00:04:45.010> in<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.250> long-term<00:04:45.490> crisis

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
if I were in a long-term crisis

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.440 
if I were in a long-term crisis
situation<00:04:46.960> I<00:04:47.080> would<00:04:47.380> not<00:04:47.530> waste<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:48.100> single

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
situation I would not waste a single

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.240 
situation I would not waste a single
resource<00:04:49.450> now<00:04:50.139> this<00:04:50.350> just<00:04:50.530> looks<00:04:50.770> like<00:04:50.860> water

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
resource now this just looks like water

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.820 
resource now this just looks like water
coming<00:04:51.639> off<00:04:51.850> potatoes<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.750> you<00:04:52.900> maybe<00:04:53.200> but

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
coming off potatoes to you maybe but

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.140 
coming off potatoes to you maybe but
it's<00:04:54.010> five<00:04:54.430> things<00:04:55.030> in<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.570> jar<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:56.110> me<00:04:56.320> if<00:04:57.150> I

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
it's five things in that jar to me if I

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.050 
it's five things in that jar to me if I
was<00:04:58.450> if<00:04:59.020> I<00:04:59.440> was<00:04:59.470> restricted<00:05:00.310> on<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.610> amount<00:05:00.910> of

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
was if I was restricted on the amount of

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.080 
was if I was restricted on the amount of
water<00:05:01.360> I<00:05:01.540> could<00:05:01.870> use<00:05:02.139> I<00:05:02.380> would<00:05:02.919> never<00:05:03.550> pour

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
water I could use I would never pour

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.000 
water I could use I would never pour
that<00:05:04.270> water<00:05:04.450> down<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:04.960> sink<00:05:05.229> I<00:05:05.410> would<00:05:05.680> save

that water down the sink I would save

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.520 
that water down the sink I would save
that<00:05:06.280> water<00:05:06.490> but<00:05:07.270> there's<00:05:07.479> more<00:05:07.780> in<00:05:08.050> that<00:05:08.290> than

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
to be and that would all could all be

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.080 
to be and that would all could all be
used<00:05:34.660> again<00:05:34.960> in<00:05:34.990> a<00:05:35.260> soup<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:36.340> salt<00:05:36.669> is<00:05:36.850> there<00:05:37.060> I

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
used again in a soup the salt is there I

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.210 
used again in a soup the salt is there I
wouldn't<00:05:37.450> have<00:05:37.600> to<00:05:37.750> result<00:05:38.200> it<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.680> water<00:05:38.919> is

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
wouldn't have to result it the water is

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.480 
wouldn't have to result it the water is
there<00:05:39.550> for<00:05:40.229> adding<00:05:41.229> the<00:05:41.380> liquid<00:05:41.560> minerals<00:05:42.280> and

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
there for adding the liquid minerals and

there for adding the liquid minerals and
vitamins<00:05:42.640> are<00:05:43.120> in<00:05:43.150> there<00:05:43.479> and<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.720> potato

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
vitamins are in there and the potato

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.290 
vitamins are in there and the potato
starts<00:05:44.530> with<00:05:44.710> thicken<00:05:45.100> it<00:05:45.250> all<00:05:45.820> I<00:05:45.850> do<00:05:46.000> is<00:05:46.270> just
