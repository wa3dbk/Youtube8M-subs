this time especially for summer so just

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.960 
this time especially for summer so just
right<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> corner<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.460> am<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.790> using

right here in the corner I am just using

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.580 
right here in the corner I am just using
this<00:01:54.329> glass<00:01:54.930> pyrex<00:01:55.560> baking<00:01:56.360> pan<00:01:57.360> um<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590

lot cheaper than the chinchilla fan and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.950 
lot cheaper than the chinchilla fan and
of<00:02:19.530> course<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.010> sand<00:02:20.310> had<00:02:20.910> been<00:02:21.240> sterilized

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.700
