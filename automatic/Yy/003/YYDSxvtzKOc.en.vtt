00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
texturing cloth and we put that directly

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.580 
texturing cloth and we put that directly
on<00:04:01.610> top<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.330> amount<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.720> wet<00:04:02.930> fibers<00:04:03.380> like

it can be felt attested that is being

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
delivered to that very wet surface and

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.490 
delivered to that very wet surface and
we<00:04:21.169> leave<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:22.479> texturing<00:04:23.479> sheet<00:04:23.810> on<00:04:24.050> there

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
we leave that texturing sheet on there

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.770 
we leave that texturing sheet on there
right<00:04:24.860> through<00:04:25.160> to<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.490> end<00:04:25.820> until<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.540> sheet

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
right through to the end until the sheet

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.680 
right through to the end until the sheet
is<00:04:27.260> bone-dry<00:04:28.040> then<00:04:28.669> you<00:04:28.850> take<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.150> off<00:04:29.450> and

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
is bone-dry then you take it off and

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.010 
is bone-dry then you take it off and
that<00:04:30.229> is<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.890> way<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.490> deliver<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.450> texture

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
that is the way to deliver the texture

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.580 
that is the way to deliver the texture
most<00:04:33.410> effectively<00:04:34.100> now<00:04:34.430> again<00:04:34.910> we<00:04:35.630> go<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:36.350> the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
most effectively now again we go to the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.469 
most effectively now again we go to the
directions<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.400> we'll<00:04:37.550> just<00:04:37.729> take<00:04:37.940> these<00:04:38.180> and

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
directions and we'll just take these and

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.700 
directions and we'll just take these and
move<00:04:38.630> these<00:04:38.870> back<00:04:39.229> here<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.720> we<00:04:41.720> put<00:04:42.140> a<00:04:42.380> cut

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
move these back here and we put a cut

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.110 
move these back here and we put a cut
sheet<00:04:43.040> on<00:04:43.310> top<00:04:43.640> of<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:45.130> turn<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.310> over<00:04:46.700> and

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
sheet on top of that turn it over and

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.330 
sheet on top of that turn it over and
couch<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.900> sheet<00:04:48.110> off<00:04:48.320> just<00:04:48.650> as<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:48.830> direction

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
couch the sheet off just as a direction

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.230 
couch the sheet off just as a direction
set<00:04:49.640> lean<00:04:50.419> on<00:04:50.660> it<00:04:50.810> like<00:04:50.990> that<00:04:51.020> with<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.800> sponge

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
set lean on it like that with the sponge

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.640 
set lean on it like that with the sponge
now<00:04:53.240> notice<00:04:53.630> we're<00:04:53.810> putting<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.200> wet<00:04:54.350> sponge

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
now notice we're putting the wet sponge

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.270 
now notice we're putting the wet sponge
on<00:04:54.950> the<00:04:55.100> screen<00:04:55.400> not<00:04:55.669> on<00:04:55.850> anything<00:04:56.120> else<00:04:56.419> and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
on the screen not on anything else and

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.180 
on the screen not on anything else and
lift<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.550> screen<00:04:58.820> and<00:04:59.450> that<00:04:59.720> takes<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.919> sheet

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
lift the screen and that takes the sheet

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.180 
lift the screen and that takes the sheet
off<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.910> we<00:05:02.060> have<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.419> on<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:03.190> texturing

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
off and we have it on the texturing

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.420 
off and we have it on the texturing
sheet<00:05:04.520> now<00:05:04.910> we<00:05:05.270> put<00:05:05.510> this<00:05:05.690> on<00:05:05.960> top<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.860> we

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
sheet now we put this on top and we

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.990 
sheet now we put this on top and we
press<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:08.960> probably<00:05:09.500> obvious<00:05:10.160> is<00:05:10.430> that<00:05:10.460> the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
press it is probably obvious is that the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.090 
press it is probably obvious is that the
more<00:05:11.180> pressure<00:05:11.479> you<00:05:11.720> get<00:05:11.930> here<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:12.470> more<00:05:12.710> that

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
more pressure you get here the more that

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.360 
more pressure you get here the more that
texture<00:05:13.640> is<00:05:13.850> going<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.210> be<00:05:14.330> in<00:05:14.479> pin<00:05:14.750> put<00:05:15.740> on<00:05:15.979> and

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
texture is going to be in pin put on and

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.840 
texture is going to be in pin put on and
put<00:05:16.940> against<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.890> mark<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.190> sheet<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.700> that

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
put against and mark the sheet and that

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.390 
put against and mark the sheet and that
we're<00:05:20.090> making<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:21.080> it's<00:05:21.440> much<00:05:21.680> better<00:05:21.950> than

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
we're making so it's much better than

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.040 
we're making so it's much better than
doing<00:05:22.430> it<00:05:22.849> this<00:05:23.030> way

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
doing it this way

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.110 
doing it this way
is<00:05:24.169> to<00:05:24.409> put<00:05:24.590> it<00:05:24.740> in<00:05:24.949> this<00:05:25.129> press<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:25.520> get<00:05:25.879> to

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
is to put it in this press and get to

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.760 
is to put it in this press and get to
tons<00:05:26.419> of<00:05:26.599> pressure<00:05:26.840> that<00:05:27.259> will<00:05:27.530> really

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
tons of pressure that will really

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.089 
tons of pressure that will really
deliver<00:05:28.220> that<00:05:28.460> texture<00:05:29.090> if<00:05:29.690> you<00:05:29.830> don't<00:05:30.830> have

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
deliver that texture if you don't have

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.640 
deliver that texture if you don't have
that<00:05:31.460> get<00:05:31.819> a<00:05:31.849> stack<00:05:32.210> of<00:05:32.240> books<00:05:32.659> get<00:05:33.080> a<00:05:33.110> cinder

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
that get a stack of books get a cinder

that we're doing so we bring it over to
a<00:05:56.840> board<00:05:57.349> upon<00:05:58.310> which<00:05:58.580> we<00:05:58.849> have<00:05:59.240> put<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:01.400> layer

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
a board upon which we have put a layer

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.790 
a board upon which we have put a layer
of<00:06:02.150> cloth<00:06:03.080> and<00:06:03.680> we<00:06:04.610> apply<00:06:05.030> the<00:06:05.060> iron<00:06:05.800> now

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
of cloth and we apply the iron now

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.100 
of cloth and we apply the iron now
you're<00:06:07.729> going<00:06:07.940> to<00:06:08.030> take<00:06:08.210> a<00:06:08.270> little<00:06:08.599> bit<00:06:08.810> more

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
you're going to take a little bit more

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.230 
you're going to take a little bit more
time<00:06:09.500> a<00:06:09.530> little<00:06:09.860> bit<00:06:10.039> longer<00:06:10.460> to<00:06:10.789> do<00:06:10.969> this

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
time a little bit longer to do this

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.110 
time a little bit longer to do this
because<00:06:11.659> you're<00:06:11.900> drying<00:06:12.289> not<00:06:13.129> only<00:06:13.699> if<00:06:13.909> the

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
because you're drying not only if the

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.969 
because you're drying not only if the
sheet<00:06:14.509> of<00:06:14.659> paper<00:06:14.690> you<00:06:15.169> are<00:06:15.349> drying<00:06:15.710> the

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
sheet of paper you are drying the

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.430 
sheet of paper you are drying the
texturing<00:06:16.550> cloth<00:06:16.849> but<00:06:17.419> it's<00:06:17.569> important<00:06:18.199> to

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
texturing cloth but it's important to

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.520 
texturing cloth but it's important to
leave<00:06:18.590> that<00:06:18.889> cloth<00:06:19.190> on<00:06:19.520> that<00:06:19.879> because<00:06:20.780> as<00:06:21.289> the

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
leave that cloth on that because as the

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.909 
leave that cloth on that because as the
paper<00:06:21.770> dries<00:06:22.219> the<00:06:23.150> texturing<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:24.050> shrinks

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
paper dries the texturing and shrinks

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.610 
paper dries the texturing and shrinks
the<00:06:25.250> texturing<00:06:25.940> cloth<00:06:26.259> shrinks<00:06:27.259> and<00:06:27.379> dries

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
the texturing cloth shrinks and dries

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.159 
the texturing cloth shrinks and dries
with<00:06:28.009> it<00:06:28.190> and<00:06:28.400> that's<00:06:28.550> where<00:06:28.849> you've<00:06:29.000> got<00:06:29.270> that

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
with it and that's where you've got that

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.730 
with it and that's where you've got that
texture<00:06:31.009> firmly<00:06:31.610> set<00:06:32.180> upon<00:06:32.779> the<00:06:33.169> surface<00:06:33.380> of

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
texture firmly set upon the surface of

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.279 
texture firmly set upon the surface of
your<00:06:33.919> sheet<00:06:34.219> of<00:06:34.340> paper<00:06:34.599> so<00:06:35.599> don't<00:06:35.870> move<00:06:36.080> the

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
your sheet of paper so don't move the

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.409 
your sheet of paper so don't move the
iron<00:06:36.620> too<00:06:36.860> fast<00:06:37.250> so<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:37.580> you<00:06:37.849> get<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:38.210> heat

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
iron too fast so that you get the heat

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.510 
iron too fast so that you get the heat
down<00:06:38.690> there<00:06:39.050> you<00:06:39.229> see<00:06:39.440> the<00:06:39.590> steam<00:06:39.860> coming<00:06:40.219> up

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
down there you see the steam coming up

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.170 
down there you see the steam coming up
and<00:06:40.819> I<00:06:41.719> think<00:06:41.810> we<00:06:42.319> are<00:06:42.590> approaching<00:06:42.949> zero<00:06:43.759> dry

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
and I think we are approaching zero dry

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.480 
and I think we are approaching zero dry
here<00:06:44.750> and<00:06:45.639> we<00:06:46.639> will<00:06:46.940> remove<00:06:47.419> the<00:06:47.779> sheet<00:06:48.080> and

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
here and we will remove the sheet and

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.580 
here and we will remove the sheet and
show<00:06:49.490> you<00:06:49.550> that<00:06:50.000> on<00:06:50.300> one<00:06:50.599> side<00:06:50.930> we<00:06:51.289> have<00:06:51.319> the

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
show you that on one side we have the

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.269 
show you that on one side we have the
beautiful<00:06:52.310> texture<00:06:52.879> of<00:06:53.240> the<00:06:53.509> cotton<00:06:54.469> sheet<00:06:54.800> on

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:55.279 
beautiful texture of the cotton sheet on

beautiful texture of the cotton sheet on
the<00:06:55.580> side<00:06:55.879> you're<00:06:56.150> going<00:06:56.300> to<00:06:56.449> have<00:06:56.629> more<00:06:56.990> of<00:06:57.050> a

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
the side you're going to have more of a

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.080 
the side you're going to have more of a
smooth<00:06:57.529> texture<00:06:58.009> because<00:06:58.400> you're<00:06:58.580> leaning<00:06:58.940> on

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
smooth texture because you're leaning on

which is your iron and let's just take

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.670 
which is your iron and let's just take
it<00:07:04.639> off<00:07:04.909> here<00:07:06.550> and<00:07:07.550> there<00:07:08.180> it<00:07:08.419> is<00:07:08.599> indeed<00:07:09.050> and<00:07:09.379> I

can see it from where I am and I can

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:13.300 
can see it from where I am and I can
feel<00:07:11.810> it<00:07:11.960> I<00:07:12.080> don't<00:07:12.259> know<00:07:12.379> whether<00:07:12.529> you<00:07:12.770> can<00:07:13.009> or

really be able to tell hey let's take a

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.559 
really be able to tell hey let's take a
look<00:07:20.360> at<00:07:20.419> some<00:07:20.599> other<00:07:20.690> samples<00:07:22.389> these<00:07:23.389> two

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:23.569 
look at some other samples these two

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.839 
look at some other samples these two
examples<00:07:24.020> are<00:07:24.620> prominent<00:07:25.250> enough<00:07:25.520> to<00:07:25.729> be

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:25.849 
examples are prominent enough to be

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:27.850 
examples are prominent enough to be
picked<00:07:26.150> up<00:07:26.300> by<00:07:26.539> the<00:07:26.599> camera<00:07:27.139> here<00:07:27.469> is<00:07:27.650> the

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:27.860 
picked up by the camera here is the

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.700 
picked up by the camera here is the
ribbed<00:07:28.099> cloth<00:07:28.520> and<00:07:28.909> the<00:07:29.599> texture<00:07:30.050> repeated

here

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:31.480 
here

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.520

is a linen cloth the texture repeated
more<00:07:36.310> subtle<00:07:36.760> surfaces<00:07:37.360> are<00:07:37.540> hard<00:07:37.750> for<00:07:37.990> the

more subtle surfaces are hard for the
camera<00:07:38.380> to<00:07:38.470> pick<00:07:38.680> up<00:07:38.860> but<00:07:39.040> they<00:07:39.190> are<00:07:39.220> just<00:07:39.610> as

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:39.820 
camera to pick up but they are just as

here<00:07:43.750> is<00:07:43.900> a<00:07:43.930> very<00:07:44.440> fine<00:07:44.830> texture<00:07:45.280> we'll<00:07:45.700> let

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.030 
here is a very fine texture we'll let

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.390 
here is a very fine texture we'll let
the<00:07:46.150> camera<00:07:46.480> show<00:07:46.660> you<00:07:46.720> what<00:07:47.140> it<00:07:47.290> can<00:07:47.620> over

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 
the camera show you what it can over

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.790 
the camera show you what it can over
here<00:07:48.640> notice<00:07:48.940> what<00:07:49.120> the<00:07:49.570> burlap<00:07:49.990> did<00:07:50.350> as<00:07:50.620> an

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 
here notice what the burlap did as an

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.730 
here notice what the burlap did as an
accent<00:07:51.280> stripe<00:07:51.640> on<00:07:52.090> another<00:07:52.420> sheet<00:07:52.750> so<00:07:53.410> really

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:53.740 
accent stripe on another sheet so really

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.690 
accent stripe on another sheet so really
the<00:07:54.190> only<00:07:54.240> limiter<00:07:55.240> the<00:07:55.510> number<00:07:55.930> of<00:07:56.700> textures

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:57.700 
the only limiter the number of textures

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.000 
the only limiter the number of textures
you<00:07:57.820> can<00:07:57.970> put<00:07:58.180> on<00:07:58.270> your<00:07:58.300> paper<00:07:58.750> is<00:07:59.140> how<00:07:59.830> many

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.010 
you can put on your paper is how many
