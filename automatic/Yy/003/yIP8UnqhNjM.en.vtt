00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
how so of course let's check out his

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.139 
how so of course let's check out his
moves<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> falcon<00:00:43.890> he<00:00:43.980> he<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.250> fly<00:00:44.460> he

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
moves we got a falcon he he can fly he

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
moves we got a falcon he he can fly he
doesn't<00:00:45.539> flap<00:00:45.809> his<00:00:46.079> wings<00:00:46.129> when<00:00:47.129> he's<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
doesn't flap his wings when he's in the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
doesn't flap his wings when he's in the
air<00:00:47.670> he<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.210> floats<00:00:48.539> makes<00:00:49.200> sense

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
air he just kind of floats makes sense

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.229 
air he just kind of floats makes sense
that<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.129> let's<00:00:50.940> check<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that I don't know let's check out a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.860 
that I don't know let's check out a
skill<00:00:51.570> tree

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
skill tree

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.020 
skill tree
best<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.500> they've<00:00:53.190> got<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> level<00:00:53.489> 16

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
best of all they've got a level 16

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.729 
best of all they've got a level 16
Falcon<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:54.989> don't<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> skills

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
Falcon so we don't have all the skills

Falcon so we don't have all the skills
that<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.370> would<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.539> get<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.020> we've<00:00:58.140> got

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that we would like to get but we've got

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.560 
that we would like to get but we've got
enough<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.739> show<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> basics<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
enough to show off the basics here so of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.299 
enough to show off the basics here so of
course<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.870> were<00:01:00.930> ignored<00:01:01.289> health<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.980> foot

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
course we were ignored health and foot

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.979 
course we were ignored health and foot

into the class whose speed he'll fly

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.359 
into the class whose speed he'll fly
around<00:01:12.810> faster<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.619> then<00:01:13.710> we've<00:01:13.799> got<00:01:13.890> super

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
around faster and then we've got super

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.859 
around faster and then we've got super
speed<00:01:14.490> pretty<00:01:14.850> much<00:01:14.970> into<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> clouds<00:01:15.509> level

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
speed pretty much into the clouds level

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.830 
speed pretty much into the clouds level
two<00:01:16.020> increases<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> speed<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> Falcons<00:01:17.430> flat

feathers<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.990> people<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:32.070> course<00:01:32.100> we've

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
feathers at people and of course we've

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.390 
feathers at people and of course we've
got<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:34.110> charge<00:01:34.380> rate<00:01:34.650> increased<00:01:35.189> two

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
got the the charge rate increased two

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.969 
got the the charge rate increased two
times<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.110> fire<00:01:37.710> more

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
times and then we can fire more

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.560 
times and then we can fire more
projectiles<00:01:38.520> increases<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> number<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> high

that's a block breaker as you can see
you<00:03:57.299> hold<00:03:57.510> down<00:03:57.630> why<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.200> if<00:03:58.620> we<00:03:58.709> tap<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.100> again

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
you hold down why and if we tap it again

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.069 
you hold down why and if we tap it again
you<00:03:59.790> get<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> extra<00:04:00.390> move<00:04:00.600> which<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.840> that

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
you get the extra move which is that

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.440 
you get the extra move which is that
little<00:04:01.380> kind<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.430> volleyball<00:04:02.640> spike<00:04:03.209> that
