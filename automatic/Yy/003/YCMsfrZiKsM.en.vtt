00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.110
 the picture quality 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.360
 for taking pictures is samsung 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.550
 wb 200f 1 1/2 3 inch big ccd sensor 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.410
 with a resolution of 14 megapixels and 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.619
 a sense sensitivity of iso 80 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.930
 to iso 3,200 responsible at the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.119
 Image quality is provided by the samsung wb 200f 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.219
 no convincing result from only at 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.350
 iso 80 and iso 100 will be finer 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.540
 details already resolved at iso 200 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.030
 sets a stronger blur 1 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.100
 at iso 400 it continues to increase 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.140
 iso 800 is already working hard on the textures 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.850
 washed out the detail reproduction falls 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.829
 as expected, clearly from models 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.449
 with si mos sensor ab at even higher 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.379
 iso values then become almost none 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.379
 details resolved more 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.060
 a similar picture emerges 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.410
 less light only with iso 80 holds itself 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.360
 the blur in borders 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.940
 about that the picture is climbed heavily 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.080
 from iso 400 are the real resolving 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.870
 Pictures then very strong 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.490
 more than 200 iso should be at the b 211 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.450
 not altogether better 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.310
 be set 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.410
 a good detail rendering will be 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.000
 but only with iso 80 and iso 100 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.620
 reached a pity 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.690
 samsung has too strong here 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.490
 in-camera blur and ccd 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.490
 sensor leave a lot of potential 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.819
 an interactive comparison of here 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:32.630
 you can find the picture sections shown here 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.759
 the camera point de 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.320
 in this b quality comparison you have 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.850
 the possibility the shown 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.600
 cropping interactive too 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.670
 to compare 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.770
 here you can compare the cameras 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.600
 specify if available an objective 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.510
 choose and the pictures in different 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.790
 compare situations 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.950
 These include the daylight conditions 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.380
 night or lightning the image format jpeg 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.850
 or if available as well as the iso 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.710
 sensitivity 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.600
 in addition to different camera models 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.920
 You can also do a certain 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.890
 model with different 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.690
 compare settings 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.290
 In this example we show the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.290
 Cutouts of a camera at iso 800 iso 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.290
 6400 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.980
 in the second comparison we present the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.980
 Recordings by day and night
