normal<00:01:05.990> houses<00:01:06.440> bed<00:01:06.590> games<00:01:06.860> but<00:01:07.610> something<00:01:07.940> we

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
normal houses bed games but something we

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.840 
normal houses bed games but something we
haven't<00:01:08.240> seen<00:01:08.420> before<00:01:09.490> when<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.550> played<00:01:10.730> this

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
haven't seen before when I played this

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.820 
haven't seen before when I played this
the<00:01:10.910> first<00:01:11.210> time<00:01:11.420> immediately<00:01:12.230> thought<00:01:12.530> at

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
the first time immediately thought at

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.500 
the first time immediately thought at
the<00:01:12.980> game<00:01:13.160> fear<00:01:13.400> was<00:01:13.520> very<00:01:13.730> similar<00:01:14.120> to<00:01:14.180> baton

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
the game fear was very similar to baton

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.570 
the game fear was very similar to baton
force<00:01:14.690> which<00:01:15.230> was<00:01:15.470> what<00:01:15.680> it's<00:01:15.920> due<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.190> age<00:01:16.340> for

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
force which was what it's due to age for

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.390 
force which was what it's due to age for
so<00:01:17.330> this<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:17.780> essentially<00:01:18.470> just<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.950> squirrel

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
so this is essentially just a squirrel

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.070 
so this is essentially just a squirrel
and<00:01:19.520> beetle<00:01:22.300> some<00:01:23.300> of<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.450> key<00:01:23.600> elements<00:01:23.990> from

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
and beetle some of the key elements from

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.390 
and beetle some of the key elements from
those<00:01:24.290> beat<00:01:24.530> them<00:01:24.650> up<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:24.890> here<00:01:25.070> as<00:01:25.220> well

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
those beat them up to here as well

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.800 

but<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.519> thought<00:02:57.849> not<00:02:58.030> long<00:02:58.180> afterwards<00:02:58.569> so<00:02:58.780> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
but I thought not long afterwards so I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.850 
but I thought not long afterwards so I
couldn't<00:02:59.109> enjoy<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.409> for<00:02:59.560> long

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:15.440 

game<00:03:05.860> over

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.490 

the<00:03:16.450> only<00:03:16.570> thing<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:16.930> really<00:03:17.080> lets<00:03:17.410> this

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
the only thing that really lets this

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.080 
the only thing that really lets this
game<00:03:17.740> down<00:03:17.980> in<00:03:18.160> my<00:03:18.340> opinion<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.000> controls

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
game down in my opinion is the controls

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.460 
game down in my opinion is the controls
take<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.120> lot<00:03:22.330> of<00:03:22.360> getting<00:03:22.540> used<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.960> sort<00:03:23.410> of

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
take a lot of getting used to sort of

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.140 
take a lot of getting used to sort of
probably<00:03:23.800> take<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.130> few<00:03:24.160> playthroughs<00:03:24.640> to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
probably take you a few playthroughs to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.150 
probably take you a few playthroughs to
really<00:03:25.420> get<00:03:25.600> anywhere<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:25.990> the<00:03:26.110> game<00:03:29.160> saying

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
really get anywhere in the game saying

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.440 
really get anywhere in the game saying
that<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:30.550> is<00:03:30.640> probably<00:03:30.790> only<00:03:31.120> my<00:03:31.240> third

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
that this is probably only my third

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.880 
that this is probably only my third
playthrough<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.350> think<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.590> got<00:03:32.710> pretty

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
playthrough and I think I got pretty

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:45.350 
playthrough and I think I got pretty
much<00:03:33.130> near<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.460> end

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.160 

the<00:03:46.360> shootin<00:03:46.630> system<00:03:46.930> could<00:03:47.050> have<00:03:47.140> been

the shootin system could have been

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.350 
the shootin system could have been
improved<00:03:47.530> on<00:03:47.680> there's<00:03:48.340> no<00:03:48.490> manual<00:03:48.910> aim<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.270> you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
improved on there's no manual aim so you

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.790 
improved on there's no manual aim so you
have<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.600> obey<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:49.810> Bassam<00:03:50.170> bees<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.410> get<00:03:50.500> close

have to obey it Bassam bees to get close

appear behind you and I probably trying

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.080 
appear behind you and I probably trying
to<00:03:57.610> munch<00:03:57.880> on<00:03:58.030> your<00:03:58.150> head<00:04:02.550> because<00:04:03.550> of<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:03.880> I

to munch on your head because of this I

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.700 
to munch on your head because of this I
painted<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.570> hell<00:04:04.780> of<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.960> lot<00:04:05.080> easier<00:04:05.470> just<00:04:05.500> to

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
painted a hell of a lot easier just to

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.960 
painted a hell of a lot easier just to
run<00:04:05.920> up<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.190> punch<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.580> crap<00:04:06.700> out<00:04:06.940> of

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
run up and punch the crap out of

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.190 
run up and punch the crap out of
everyone<00:04:09.720> don't<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.750> may<00:04:10.870> be<00:04:10.930> more

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
everyone don't you may be more

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.300 
everyone don't you may be more
vulnerable<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.770> were<00:04:11.860> attacked<00:04:12.130> we

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
vulnerable that were attacked we

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.740 
vulnerable that were attacked we
probably<00:04:12.520> get<00:04:12.700> rid<00:04:12.880> of<00:04:12.940> enemies<00:04:13.270> quicker<00:04:14.280> a

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
probably get rid of enemies quicker a

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.000 
probably get rid of enemies quicker a
bit<00:04:16.750> of<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.900> pain<00:04:17.049> at<00:04:17.200> times<00:04:17.440> too<00:04:17.709> when<00:04:17.919> you

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
bit of a pain at times too when you

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.560 
bit of a pain at times too when you
train<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.400> run<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:18.850> think<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.269> trick<00:04:19.450> is<00:04:19.480> to

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
train and run I think the trick is to

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.670 
train and run I think the trick is to
make<00:04:19.660> sure<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:20.049> press<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.350> run<00:04:20.530> and

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
make sure you press the run and

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.230 
make sure you press the run and
Direction<00:04:21.160> buttons<00:04:21.430> at<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.640> same<00:04:21.940> time

Direction buttons at the same time

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.300 
Direction buttons at the same time
doesn't<00:04:22.990> really<00:04:23.140> work<00:04:23.350> too<00:04:23.590> well<00:04:23.830> if<00:04:24.130> you're

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
doesn't really work too well if you're

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.750 
doesn't really work too well if you're
trying<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.580> run<00:04:24.730> Wales<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.210> Balkan<00:04:26.760> the
