20 watt circular ball preheat adapter

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.009 
20 watt circular ball preheat adapter
will<00:00:10.620> look<00:00:10.740> at<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> top<00:00:11.160> first

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
will look at the top first

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.890 
will look at the top first
now<00:00:13.019> these<00:00:13.349> clamps<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> bulbs<00:00:14.610> came<00:00:15.480> from

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
now these clamps for the bulbs came from

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.460 
now these clamps for the bulbs came from
a<00:00:16.199> old<00:00:18.050> 22<00:00:19.050> watt<00:00:19.320> circular<00:00:20.130> bulb<00:00:20.430> adapter<00:00:21.470> same

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
a old 22 watt circular bulb adapter same

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.120 
a old 22 watt circular bulb adapter same
with<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.990> plug<00:00:24.990> right<00:00:25.080> here<00:00:25.320> which<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.830> made

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
with this plug right here which is made

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.540 
with this plug right here which is made
by<00:00:26.189> GE<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.480> plug<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> circular<00:00:29.070> bulb<00:00:29.279> is

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
by GE this plug for the circular bulb is

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.100 
by GE this plug for the circular bulb is
made<00:00:29.730> by<00:00:29.849> GE<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:32.630> socket<00:00:33.630> or<00:00:33.840> base<00:00:34.219> is

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
made by GE and this socket or base is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.510 
made by GE and this socket or base is
also<00:00:37.110> came<00:00:37.770> off<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.370> 22<00:00:39.239> watt<00:00:39.390> circular

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
also came off of the 22 watt circular

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.389 
also came off of the 22 watt circular
bulb<00:00:41.520> adapter<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.930> these<00:00:43.379> clamps<00:00:43.800> came<00:00:44.219> off

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
bulb adapter that these clamps came off

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:53.689 
bulb adapter that these clamps came off
of<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:46.070> this<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:50.000> we'll<00:00:51.000> put<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.699> our

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
of and this so we'll put this on our

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.470 
of and this so we'll put this on our
base<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.989> socket<00:00:55.440> here<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:58.699> we'll<00:00:59.699> open<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.170> up

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
base or socket here and we'll open it up

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:18.380 
base or socket here and we'll open it up
oops<00:01:03.480> which<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.500> around<00:01:04.970> there<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.090> go

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.749 

there<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.570> goes<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:19.990> opens<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:21.430> as<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.640> can

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
there it goes it opens now as you can

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.810 
there it goes it opens now as you can
see<00:01:21.820> there<00:01:22.659> is<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:23.130> ballast<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.340> here<00:01:24.579> obviously

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
see there is a ballast in here obviously

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.510 
see there is a ballast in here obviously
and<00:01:25.829> this<00:01:26.829> ballast<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.430> made<00:01:27.610> by<00:01:27.789> advanced<00:01:28.270> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and this ballast is made by advanced and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.560 
and this ballast is made by advanced and
it<00:01:30.520> is<00:01:30.939> 413<00:01:31.929> watt<00:01:32.170> PL<00:01:32.799> bulbs<00:01:33.340> all<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:34.270> way<00:01:34.390> up

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
it is 413 watt PL bulbs all the way up

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.800 
it is 413 watt PL bulbs all the way up
to<00:01:34.869> 22<00:01:35.380> watt<00:01:35.740> circular<00:01:36.399> bulbs<00:01:36.820> so<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.539> can<00:01:37.689> be

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
to 22 watt circular bulbs so it can be

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.450 
to 22 watt circular bulbs so it can be
any<00:01:38.020> wattage<00:01:38.590> in<00:01:38.890> between<00:01:39.310> 13<00:01:39.880> or<00:01:40.119> 22<00:01:40.630> watt<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
any wattage in between 13 or 22 watt and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.880 
any wattage in between 13 or 22 watt and
instead<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.509> using<00:01:43.689> wire<00:01:43.960> nuts<00:01:44.079> I<00:01:44.409> use<00:01:44.619> these

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
instead of using wire nuts I use these

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.660 
instead of using wire nuts I use these
crimpers<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:46.869> they're<00:01:47.049> safer<00:01:47.500> than<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
crimpers I think they're safer than the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:02:09.310 
crimpers I think they're safer than the
wire<00:01:49.240> nuts<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.270> we'll<00:01:52.600> close<00:01:52.780> this<00:01:53.080> back<00:01:53.319> up

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.470 

there<00:02:10.320> we<00:02:10.470> go

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
there we go

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.060 
there we go
and<00:02:12.480> obviously<00:02:12.930> here's<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.380> starter<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:13.980> the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
and obviously here's the starter in the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.140 
and obviously here's the starter in the
middle<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:15.209> sturdier<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.750> made<00:02:15.959> by<00:02:16.110> Leviton

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.199 

and<00:02:21.150> will<00:02:21.600> turn<00:02:22.020> off<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.380> light<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.910> will

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
and will turn off this light and will

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.420 
and will turn off this light and will
turn<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.900> thing<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.290> couple<00:02:25.650> times<00:02:25.860> here

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430

and that is my homemade 20 watt circular

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.810 
and that is my homemade 20 watt circular
bulb<00:02:48.599> adapter<00:02:49.599> that<00:02:50.109> is<00:02:50.250> preheat<00:02:51.569> thank<00:02:52.569> you
