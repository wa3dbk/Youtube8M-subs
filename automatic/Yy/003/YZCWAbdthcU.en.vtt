00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
basically you have to kind of drive as

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.870 
basically you have to kind of drive as
close<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> other<00:00:28.830> cars<00:00:29.160> which

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
close as you can to other cars which

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.540 
close as you can to other cars which
makes<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> close<00:00:31.529> call<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.890> guess<00:00:32.130> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
makes you have a close call I guess and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it makes even more dangerous when you go

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.690 
it makes even more dangerous when you go
past<00:00:36.719> cars<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.380> get<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.219> speed<00:00:38.670> and

match the colors what lame but really
it's<00:00:57.360> somehow<00:00:57.719> really<00:00:58.260> addictive<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's somehow really addictive and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.979 
it's somehow really addictive and
awesome<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.489> know<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.600> match<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
awesome I know so you have to match the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.689 
awesome I know so you have to match the
colors<00:01:01.260> together<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.859> fill<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> grid<00:01:02.520> but

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
colors together and fill up the grid but

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.009 
colors together and fill up the grid but
there's<00:01:02.820> only<00:01:02.940> one<00:01:03.239> way<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
there's only one way to do this and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.500 
there's only one way to do this and
sometimes<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:05.010> difficult<00:01:05.330> anyway<00:01:06.330> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
sometimes it can get difficult anyway I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510 
sometimes it can get difficult anyway I
really<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.140> no<00:01:07.290> ideas<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:08.010> else<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.369> say

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
really have no ideas what else to say

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
really have no ideas what else to say
about<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.880> application<00:01:09.510> except<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
about this application except for the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.050 
about this application except for the
sound<00:01:10.619> effects<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.040> think<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.340> stupid<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.880> we

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
sound effects I think are stupid and we

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
sound effects I think are stupid and we
in<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> usually<00:01:13.200> play<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.500> no<00:01:13.619> sound<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.010> I

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
in so I usually play with no sound but I

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.530 
in so I usually play with no sound but I
think<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.610> definitely<00:01:14.700> worth<00:01:15.060> checking<00:01:15.119> out

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
think it's definitely worth checking out

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.660 
think it's definitely worth checking out
it's<00:01:15.810> somehow<00:01:16.080> fun<00:01:16.439> addictive<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> has<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
it's somehow fun addictive and it has a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.990 
it's somehow fun addictive and it has a
fair<00:01:17.880> amount<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.150> levels<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> free<00:01:18.990> app

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
fair amount of levels for a free app

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.789 
fair amount of levels for a free app
