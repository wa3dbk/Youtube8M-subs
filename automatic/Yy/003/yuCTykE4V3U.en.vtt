00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
dynamic behavior like fire-breathing

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.700

dragons<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.630> create<00:00:30.840> static<00:00:31.200> scenery

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
dragons we can create static scenery

like<00:00:31.919> a<00:00:31.980> street<00:00:32.400> I<00:00:32.610> mean<00:00:32.880> lego<00:00:33.300> house<00:00:33.570> down

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
like a street I mean lego house down

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380

there's<00:00:34.739> no<00:00:34.980> electronics<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.940> any<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.270> these

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
there's no electronics in any of these

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
there's no electronics in any of these
Legos<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.140> these<00:00:37.470> are<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.680> regular<00:00:37.980> building

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
Legos so these are just regular building

if I move in our fire engine it always

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.610 
if I move in our fire engine it always

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
touch surface for me it will just move

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.800 
touch surface for me it will just move
it<00:01:17.490> over<00:01:17.550> there<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.150> reach<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.660> little

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it over there so I can reach it a little

better<00:01:19.310> what<00:01:20.310> we're<00:01:20.430> doing<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.730> dragging<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
better what we're doing is dragging and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
better what we're doing is dragging and
drawing<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> track<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.860> then<00:01:22.980> I<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.250> drag

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
drawing the track and then I can drag

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.120 
drawing the track and then I can drag
and<00:01:23.670> drop<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:24.150> train<00:01:24.990> station<00:01:25.620> anywhere<00:01:25.980> on

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and drop the train station anywhere on

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.160 
and drop the train station anywhere on
