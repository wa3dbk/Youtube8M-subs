expected to be released so here is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.440 
expected to be released so here is
Ironhide<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.879> his<00:00:45.059> alt<00:00:45.329> mode

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
Ironhide and as we can see his alt mode

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.450 
Ironhide and as we can see his alt mode
is<00:00:45.660> obviously<00:00:46.230> based<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> movie<00:00:47.280> version

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
is obviously based on the movie version

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.700 
is obviously based on the movie version
of<00:00:47.760> Ironhide<00:00:48.239> more<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.020> classic<00:00:49.530> version

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
of Ironhide more so the classic version

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.369 
of Ironhide more so the classic version
um<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.579> that's<00:00:50.879> okay<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.020> robot

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
um and that's okay because the robot

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.139 
um and that's okay because the robot
mode<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.920> does<00:00:53.129> throwback<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
mode really does throwback to the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.139 
mode really does throwback to the
classics<00:00:54.719> Ironhide<00:00:55.350> he's<00:00:55.920> got<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.489> red<00:00:57.030> and

let's take a look at his robot mode and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.199 
let's take a look at his robot mode and
see<00:02:28.260> how<00:02:28.410> he<00:02:28.470> compares<00:02:28.709> there<00:02:29.190> now<00:02:29.879> iron

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
see how he compares there now iron

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.809 
see how he compares there now iron

so here is Ironhide in his robot mode
and<00:04:09.870> now<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.410> g1<00:04:10.980> influences<00:04:11.609> are<00:04:11.819> more

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
and now the g1 influences are more

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.390 
and now the g1 influences are more
evident<00:04:12.660> as<00:04:12.810> we<00:04:13.079> can<00:04:13.260> see<00:04:13.440> he's<00:04:13.650> got<00:04:13.889> the

throughout<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.849> overall<00:04:46.569> this<00:04:46.960> is<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.500> very

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
throughout it overall this is a very

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.100 
throughout it overall this is a very
cool<00:04:48.490> design<00:04:48.849> i<00:04:48.880> really<00:04:49.360> wish<00:04:49.539> i<00:04:49.660> could<00:04:49.870> get<00:04:50.050> a

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
cool design i really wish i could get a

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.800 
cool design i really wish i could get a
more<00:04:50.380> detailed<00:04:50.410> look<00:04:50.949> at<00:04:51.130> like<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.910> CGI<00:04:52.449> render

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
more detailed look at like a CGI render

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.510 
more detailed look at like a CGI render
or<00:04:53.229> something<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.710> character<00:04:54.220> because

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
or something of the character because

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.159 
or something of the character because
this<00:04:54.669> toy<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:55.180> don't<00:04:55.360> think<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.810> toy<00:04:55.990> does

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
this toy I don't think the toy does

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.649 
this toy I don't think the toy does
justice<00:04:56.620> in<00:04:56.800> showcasing<00:04:57.310> this<00:04:57.610> character<00:04:58.150> um

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
justice in showcasing this character um

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.110 
justice in showcasing this character um
but<00:04:59.110> with<00:04:59.289> that<00:04:59.530> aside<00:05:00.039> let's<00:05:00.460> take<00:05:00.669> some<00:05:00.940> more

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
but with that aside let's take some more

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.029 
but with that aside let's take some more
looks<00:05:01.360> at<00:05:01.509> this<00:05:01.630> figure<00:05:01.810> again<00:05:02.409> on<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.830> bank

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
looks at this figure again on the bank

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.100 
looks at this figure again on the bank
he's<00:05:03.310> just<00:05:03.520> mostly<00:05:03.819> hollowed<00:05:04.300> out<00:05:04.449> you<00:05:04.930> know

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
he's just mostly hollowed out you know

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.159 
he's just mostly hollowed out you know
with<00:05:05.319> very<00:05:05.650> little<00:05:05.919> detail<00:05:06.400> yeah<00:05:07.300> his<00:05:07.599> hands

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
with very little detail yeah his hands

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.290 
with very little detail yeah his hands
are<00:05:08.319> very<00:05:08.380> poorly<00:05:09.099> done<00:05:09.400> in<00:05:09.580> my<00:05:09.729> opinion<00:05:10.000> as

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
are very poorly done in my opinion as

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.649 
are very poorly done in my opinion as
you<00:05:10.930> can<00:05:11.050> see<00:05:11.669> that's<00:05:12.669> pretty<00:05:12.970> much<00:05:13.120> what<00:05:13.509> they

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
you can see that's pretty much what they

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.740 
you can see that's pretty much what they
are<00:05:14.669> they're<00:05:15.669> not<00:05:16.000> even<00:05:16.240> really<00:05:16.360> hands

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
are they're not even really hands

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.629 
are they're not even really hands
they're<00:05:17.050> more<00:05:17.229> just<00:05:17.409> holes<00:05:17.650> basically<00:05:18.340> and

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
they're more just holes basically and

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.510 
they're more just holes basically and
you<00:05:19.090> can<00:05:19.240> go<00:05:19.389> ahead<00:05:19.509> and<00:05:19.630> take<00:05:19.930> his<00:05:20.139> cannon<00:05:20.560> and

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
you can go ahead and take his cannon and

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.110 
you can go ahead and take his cannon and
they<00:05:22.150> peg<00:05:22.419> right<00:05:22.750> into<00:05:23.020> his<00:05:23.110> hands<00:05:23.380> like<00:05:23.530> so<00:05:24.120> or

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
they peg right into his hands like so or

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.439 
they peg right into his hands like so or
if<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:25.780> want<00:05:26.110> you<00:05:27.180> can<00:05:28.180> also<00:05:28.240> peg<00:05:30.120> right<00:05:31.120> there

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
if you want you can also peg right there

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.010 
if you want you can also peg right there
or<00:05:32.229> his<00:05:32.469> side<00:05:32.770> door<00:05:33.039> peg<00:05:33.280> is<00:05:33.630> it<00:05:34.630> doesn't

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
or his side door peg is it doesn't

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.360 
or his side door peg is it doesn't
really<00:05:35.139> matter<00:05:35.320> which<00:05:35.620> one<00:05:35.830> you<00:05:35.860> use<00:05:35.979> they

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
really matter which one you use they

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.310 
really matter which one you use they
both<00:05:36.550> pretty<00:05:36.820> much<00:05:37.030> do<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.300> exact<00:05:37.780> same<00:05:37.810> thing

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
both pretty much do the exact same thing

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.950 
both pretty much do the exact same thing
I<00:05:38.860> prefer<00:05:39.520> this<00:05:39.729> way<00:05:39.909> because<00:05:40.180> you<00:05:40.750> can't

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
I prefer this way because you can't

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.110 
I prefer this way because you can't
really<00:05:41.020> see<00:05:41.199> his<00:05:41.409> hands<00:05:41.770> and<00:05:42.099> you<00:05:42.820> know<00:05:42.940> this

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
really see his hands and you know this

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.800 
really see his hands and you know this
just<00:05:43.360> looks<00:05:43.570> nicer<00:05:44.110> so<00:05:44.789> yeah<00:05:45.789> now<00:05:46.539> for

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
just looks nicer so yeah now for

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.040 
just looks nicer so yeah now for
articulation<00:05:48.240> his<00:05:49.240> arms<00:05:49.719> rotate<00:05:50.380> 360<00:05:51.159> degrees

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
articulation his arms rotate 360 degrees

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.899 
articulation his arms rotate 360 degrees
bend<00:05:53.050> at<00:05:53.199> the<00:05:53.229> elbow<00:05:53.650> they're<00:05:54.490> on<00:05:54.639> a<00:05:54.669> ball

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
bend at the elbow they're on a ball

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.879 
bend at the elbow they're on a ball
joint<00:05:54.960> so<00:05:55.960> you<00:05:56.050> do<00:05:56.169> get<00:05:56.289> a<00:05:56.349> nice<00:05:56.530> range<00:05:56.740> of

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
joint so you do get a nice range of

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.640 
joint so you do get a nice range of
motion<00:05:57.190> move<00:05:58.090> in<00:05:58.240> and<00:05:58.389> out<00:05:58.509> on<00:05:58.780> no<00:05:59.469> head

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
motion move in and out on no head

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.649 
motion move in and out on no head
articulation<00:06:00.430> his<00:06:00.759> legs<00:06:01.030> are<00:06:01.150> also<00:06:01.270> on<00:06:01.449> ball

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
articulation his legs are also on ball

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.990 
articulation his legs are also on ball
