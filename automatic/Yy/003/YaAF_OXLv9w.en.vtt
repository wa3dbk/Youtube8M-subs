00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.510
 see 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.740
 don Vicente how good that gives me that 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.170
 question is that I appreciate very much 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.719
 because please do not see it all 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.820
 less hope the press wants us 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.100
 present a world upside down code 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.050
 monetary financial the government that 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.580
 wants to take the money from the 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.400
 depositors and bankers are those who 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.170
 defends it and we forgot the year 1999 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.570
 a match throws stones loses its 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.090
 accreditation now turns out to be the 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.730
 the anthology of the virtues 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.550
 Republicans and they are poor persecuted 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.579
 already enough is enough 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.150
 distortion of so much manipulation that 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.430
 happened with the 4x4 what our government created 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.230
 four kilos up to 400 dollars worth 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.960
 so that our migrants can 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.120
 send their things without taxes to their 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.520
 relatives but that was made immediately the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.850
 Zapata criolla is no longer what sends 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.940
 Juan Perez of New York to his cousin 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.450
 Carmen Sanchez in search of her blouse 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.469
 his shoes and so on but he himself 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.469
 let's name wig 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:16.409
 let's put carlos gonzález already in miami 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.130
 buy the perfume recontra clear what 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.590
 be in Miami already send a box 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.060
 but to us shopping back from amazon what 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.369
 send in a box in Miami where there is 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.290
 an intermediary company to send 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.080
 the same was said by Gonzalez no longer of the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.360
 person to migrant to the person sees his 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.160
 family in Ecuador is the person 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.170
 person is in Ecuador importing 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.180
 illegitimately because it is to those packages 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.910
 they come without taxes without tariffs without 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.130
 VAT payment and it was not breaking the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.899
 textile industry the horns industry 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.970
 we are for the common good 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.710
 please ecuadorian people when you 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.470
 we have failed when we have searched for something 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.460
 for us now the gravediggers of 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.920
 this country pretend to be their 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.929
 resuscitators and the world upside down we are 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.490
 we who want to persecute 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.770
 poor, migrant citizens who 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.690
 They are importing their little thing is fake 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.820
 in fact migrants will be able to 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.040
 keep sending your things without taxes 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.170
 because they send it by mail 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.489
 correct united the ecuador mail 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.680
 but that has to be then the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.269
 person to the person sees who are what 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.310
 that beats that for the 42 dollars 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.650
 taxes the same person as here 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.299
 is buying your things in the USA and that 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.010
 unfair competition for production 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.019
 Ecuadorian which can generate 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.110
 unemployment loss value added 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.780
 etcetera and look at the value of 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.130
 packages for up to $ 400 42 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.049
 dollars around 10 percent 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.700
 when in other circumstances they had 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.709
 have to pay 12 percent of the VAT still 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.810
 this way they will be winning above all the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.560
 shipments of the maximum value of a standard 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.050
 correct 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.160
 in front of the criollo zapada because we 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.200
 they made us grow 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.510
 imports in this way if I 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.709
 find out my advisor but hundreds of 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.750
 millions of dollars were no longer the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.300
 migrants who sent their little things their 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.459
 relatives but pelucones that bought to 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.650
 through miami the sumptuary things without 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.540
 pay taxes and that we're not going to 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.099
 allow Ecuadorian people to trust 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.050
 its president trusts in his government 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.090
 when we have failed him instead 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.220
 How many times has the press deceived us? 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.150
 and his cronies of always certain 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.549
 press 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.470
 with the exceptions said many of 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.090
 societies that the president I speak 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.310
 especially from national media that is 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.450
 in a permanent campaign to try to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.850
 wear down the government and earn more 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.319
 incentives now it turns out that we are is 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.720
 a resource for excessive public spending 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.760
 because the state is broken absurd 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.239
 We are trying to avoid practices 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.900
 illegitimate not the criollo sap that is 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.860
 breaking important sectors 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.599
 Ecuadorian producers with the sector 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.459
 textile sector the leather sector and I have 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.290
 because rarely lacking 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.910
 beneficiaries come out like this if I'm from 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.320
 agreement with the measure and there he sees and a 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.340
 representative of the eros textile guild 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.410
 he has been very brave 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.670
 say yes sir this is correct because 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.349
 We have legal competence 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.450
 those people do not pay tariffs do not pay VAT 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.580
 also the migrants but the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.470
 Pelucón that with his box in Miami with 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.060
 intermediary companies are receiving 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.450
 luxury goods exempt from 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.450
 taxes
