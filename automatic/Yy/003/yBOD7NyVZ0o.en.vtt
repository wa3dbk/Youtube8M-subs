00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.460
 often looked like they had those fruits for 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:06.560
 that are possible you already know that you have to 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.299
 avoid pests in crops that are 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.849
 can do with pesticides with 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.280
 pesticides or with care breeding 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.870
 bumblebees and ladybirds let's see 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.789
 together like the ladybugs that we 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.279
 they look so sweet they are authentic 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.279
 terminators with aphid pests 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.660
 Y 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.939
 they look like cages but this is the most 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.400
 away a condemnation here the bees 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.180
 queen find her soul mate and 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.180
 they begin to procreate 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.649
 here what it is about is to recreate 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.070
 as if we were in nature 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.429
 with the light we simulate the sun with 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.979
 temperature and humidity we recreate the 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.820
 temperature that would make in autumn and 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:55.890
 we introduce 400 queens and one male and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.530
 medium runs more at the time it 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.850
 it's dizzy, let's shake hands and 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.850
 we take out the couple 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.340
 once founded what we do is that 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.100
 we pass them to hibernation once past 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.830
 the hibernation because we already put them 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.330
 production for 5 weeks up 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.640
 get it to have a minimum of 4 or 5 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.110
 workers with their young and then the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.110
 we would go to the next phase 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.530
 and I know what has grown in a week 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.320
 this would be two weeks later here 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.330
 we have three weeks later and you're 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.330
 it would be four weeks later 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.800
 because this would already be a commercial hive 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.630
 multicolored country 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.060
 and in bumblebees to pollinate the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.640
 plants and also other insects 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.750
 predators that with their appetite finish 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.700
 with pests 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.860
 with this what we avoid is using 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.390
 those insects and mites avoid in the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.560
 use of pesticides that can 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.350
 then affect the fruit and then 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.140
 can be toxic to the consumer 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.420
 hello sergio good we bring the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.420
 insects to fight pests 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.420
 sister 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.340
 sergio let's make the release of the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.739
 Ladybugs are predators of aphids 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.739
 she eat them directly they go to 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.140
 locate the focus and go find the 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.510
 aphids, now let's open the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.269
 beehives you know that inside you 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.430
 find the whole colony this is your 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.650
 home and what we are going to do is 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.930
 open them so they can pollinate the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.489
 pepper and collect the pollen and then 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.489
 come to feed the young 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.170
 They are one of the 20,000 species of bees 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.659
 what's in the world today after seven 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.540
 months they leave their hive to meet 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.540
 the mission for which they were raised 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.540
 pollinate 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.230
 maybe after this report and 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.390
 you do not see such a sweet way to 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.870
 tender ladybugs but we have to see the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.870
 Photographs
