00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.660
 at the little bornand high savoy 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.980
 I was talking about the regulation of 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.880
 plantations the rule is this 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.529
 for the plants that will develop 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.450
 at less than two meters high one must 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.340
 plants and 50 cm from the limit of 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.509
 the property for the plants that are going 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.130
 grow to more than two meters from 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.759
 high you need the plants and at more than 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.759
 two meters from the limit 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.610

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.560
 it complies with the regulations 50 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.120
 cm compared to the limit and she does 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.320
 less than two meters high the rules 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.800
 that I do not lay out are those of the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.180
 civil Code 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.920
 however you must inquire 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.350
 with your municipality for the rules 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.670
 the local urban plan or 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.520
 possibly rules of co-ownership 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.620
 who can regulate the subdivision 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.550
 in which you live now we 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.270
 let's go to the distance of 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.270
 tree planting 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.660

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.720
 delimited by the fence the massive which 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.040
 belongs to me and my neighbor's garden 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.960
 in this case we have a subject that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.000
 is relatively old who respect 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.960
 distance from my limit for 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.250
 a tree that is more than two meters 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.630
 top 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.700
 we also note that the branches 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.390
 of this tree exceeds the plumb of the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.500

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.750

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.340
 home access by cons I'm in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.020
 right to ask my neighbor to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.360
 maintain the development of his tree 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.220
 in line with a property book in 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.110
 no case I have the right to do it myself 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.300
 even without asking permission 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.460
