00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.000
(Tommy) I'm here to do something I've always wanted to do I think. (salesman) What's that? 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.050
(Tommy) Try and buy a car. 
 (Salesman) Fantastic!

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.230
(bumper music)

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.410
(Tommy) It's not every day that a blind guy comes into a car dealership wanting to buy a car.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.080
(salesman) Hello, gentleman! 
(Tommy) Hey, how are you? 
 (Salesman) Good.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.170
(Tommy) Maybe I'll get a nice, pushy salesman - (in a deep voice) "Nice day to buy a car, isnt it sir?"

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.350
(Salesman) We have a nice BMW Z-4 convertible. (Tommy) That might be a little steep. Is it used?

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.530
(Salesman) $29,000. 
 (Tommy) And I said, well, can we go have a look at it, can I go sit in it? He said, "yeah, absolutely."

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.980
(Tommy) We'll let's have a look at it then. Can I just come with you? Do you mind if I just hang on to you a little bit? 
 (Salesman) Oh, I'm sorry. Come on.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.290
(Tommy) And then he splits. He walks away from me. 
(Tommy to Salesman) Here, I'll just hold on to your arm right just like this.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.330
(Tommy) I don't think he really realized that I was blind. (Salesman) Now, are you going to be the primary driver?

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.480
(Tommy) Well, I wondering, yeah, I mean, will you let me drive it?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.690
(Salesman) Can you see? (Tommy) Well, no. (Salesman) How do you drive a car?

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.690
(Tommy) I beg your pardon. (Salesman) How do you drive the car then? (Tommy) Details, details! (both laugh) What are you worried about these details for?

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.040
(Tommy) But he was still absolutely eager to sell me a car. There was nothing standing in his way. He was ready to do it.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.210
(Tommy) This is it right here? Oh, look a nice little rag-top on her there. (Salesman) You look good. You look good. Your shirt matches the interior. (Tommy) Nice!

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.480
(Tommy) He was a little awkward about the fact that I'm blind. You know, I think that sort of surprised him a little bit.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.190
(Tommy) A Z-4. (Salesman) Yeah, very nice color. 
(Tommy) What color is it? (Salesman) It's like the platinum beige color.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.190
It's almost like a dark hint of grey with a platinum touch in it.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.370
(Tommy) I don't think he knew quite how to deal with it.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.550
(Tommy) What does that mean? I don't know what grey means. 
 (Saleman) It's like a... ah...

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.080
(Tommy) Like what in nature is grey... that maybe I can compare it to, that I might now.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.740
(Saleman) Grey skies. (Tommy) Grey skies.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.980
(Tommy) At first, but I think he caught on very quickly. (Salesman) With a tint of sand, like the beach.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.180
(Tommy) Sand like the beach. Okay, now you're getting it. There you go, Ron. Although he would not let me test drive it.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.930
(Tommy) Is this the kind of car, like after my first marriage, maybe I'd get if I was in my mid-40s.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.930
(Salesman) (laughs) I guess you could say that. (Tommy) It's a nice car. too. I would have bought that.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.110
(Tommy) And I really can buy a car! (Salesman) Of course you could! 
 (Tommy) That is unbelievable. (Salesman) You can do anything you want in this world!

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.150
(bumper music)

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.270
(Tommy) Oh, boy. So you won't let me take it for a little spin, huh?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.674
(Salesman) If you think you can drive it, god bless you, you can drive it! (laughs)
