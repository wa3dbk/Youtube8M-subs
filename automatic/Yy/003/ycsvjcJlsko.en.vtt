00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.770
 Beckenbauer and 9 further 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.000
 and equate them to the most attractive senses of the people in the first half 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 at the start 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.380
 Fallbackzieher of Wulf AG, however, from the excellent 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.929
 ceded 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.999
 as a result, the Bavarian game rather moderate 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.269
 like us 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.200
 against the early attacking Brümmer 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.200
 They found the game 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 it was missing 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.800
 a director 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
 the lips go 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.050
 Udo Lattek was far from satisfied at these times 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.580
 the guests at which 25 min 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 Matthias 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.060
 already based 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.560
 from 5 0 million 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.560
 had as a storm point 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.480
 the recipe 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.480
 also center forward 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.620
 hardly any effort often to the basket 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 we have flank 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 once again can 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.840
 certainly not a good game of Bayern 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.690
 but then the 45 votes 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.630
 Nachtwei 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.670
 Matti 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670
 Augenthaler 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.900
 the h1 10 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.910
 that will not be the goal of the month 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.910
 expect for the future 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.810
 after the break our game much better 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.290
 now she was hoping 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.290
 what is it for 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.049
 Ruppertshofen 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.049
 the second 45 minutes 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.149
 like the mass flank 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.849
 welfare 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.849
 we do not have a cold 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.239
 Bill Gilligan has 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.239
 Celesio 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.689
 on 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.830
 the evening sound picture 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.989
 then made the decision 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.989
 succeed the 2 1 0 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.979
 Prochnow 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.209
 but after a true 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.049
 after the game Günter Peter Kloo spoke 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.049
 with the scorer 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.309
 I 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.610
 we are worried about her now 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.160
 the players of the day and the scorers of the day a two to zero 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.790
 against Rome is still a Bayern satisfied I think so we can 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.129
 we are satisfied 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.679
 about the second girl out of man, I think good game is delivered 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.219
 percent 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.759
 the 60,000 meters and have gone home satisfied 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.019
 I think they are also satisfied they have suffered a lot already at 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.069
 FC Bayern 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.599
 and at the moment they have a pretty good stage between Melissa so far that the 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.479
 bavarian fans they also call again ZyLAB times only ever called when it 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.550
 suffered so much outside 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.689
 Year is not quite sure that is only one called out like me 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.030
 I scored a lot of goals from Esteban Vigo and still in the evening 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.559
 of course also written by a man but 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.559
 a after a short time Apple has let up again 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.559
 Of course a late satisfaction on the one hand on the other hand 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:53.279
 a confirmation that it's worth dancing to Waldmann next to Murray 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.219
 to be her 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.479
 their current Volkan to See at which they still bring »two more MSC 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.729
 Bavaria to high levels one obviously considered whether one would give him one too 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.599
 Six-month contract 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.930
 first time there 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.560
 I think that I have to think that over very well 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.870
 Percent not for sport reasons but quite simply from professional 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.059
 Reasons protection 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:17.180
 percent at Adidas 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.449
 It will be necessary that I thought Bornemann with the company Adidas 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.240
 or I agree with the company Albers in this respect 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.400
 that would perhaps be given as a percentage 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.919
 Myself, I could do that with my dedication to discussing something beyond itself 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.889
 imagine that's normal blood licked you can say you want to like 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.419
 still above blue 30 because of the financial burden 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.759
 Euro from the through I do not have to do anything 4 I feel fine here 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.389
 becomes 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.689
 that Bechert spent the last two years each in Bender's percent ankle 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.030
 to have the mushrooms and through Nahles videos it includes fancy 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:52.429
 and that's why Bild de is still very big this winter is back 

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:54.129
 to the game about Steam 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.659
 not only that we pockelt our games makes such policy too 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.719
 20 thousand participants who additionally provide for mood 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.719
 also a good opponent and percent great players 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.639
 that's fun 2 10 clock for Bayern is enough for the second leg 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.110
 I believe APA 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.589
 we know now 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:16.109
 At the latest since this game we have to play as we need to play 

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.059
 playing forward we also can not play on result that is not 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:21.460
 our Steigerwald Lehmann most of his ranks 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.419
 Percent we have to play forward 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.520
 Schießler mostly on the 4th 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.900
 and then the opponent must come back% our game 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.969
 against it comes 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.459
 Udo Lattek had said before the game about the wings play violence 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:36.449
 Shots and double passes what you saw were all alone 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.710
 actually violence shots the 1 0 also resulted from it 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.870
 why was it that the tactics of Bavaria not so received Mr. the Romans 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.509
 Percent e10 of course a strong team attacking the percent in 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.360
 Midfield very much 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.759
 very early 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.759
 they play one before the check-in in midfield 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:58.529
 and go to the ball leading censorship to the big of the yes it must feel so 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:00.550
 to build a combination game 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.069
 my mom clock had so double pass% situation but it is very very difficult 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.759
 and a comrade switched to long balls on not their attempt to one 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:13.499
 To put on a headscarf and then if just before the Stork penalty the others 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:16.499
 somehow use and then of course the long distance shots the 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:21.360
 what will be shown as long as 1 art but already sector cabin 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.249
 i was i had not had enough opportunity yet 

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:27.619
 Percent I would be percent we also have a very heavy on Saturday 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:31.249
 Game against Cologne times so Dreyer train we play dancing moment to three 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:33.139
 Weddings and actually want too 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:34.379
 Your wedding 

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:37.379
 Percent so profitable 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.309
 Do not refrain from standing on your feet, thank you 

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:42.659
 good leadership, yes, thank you
