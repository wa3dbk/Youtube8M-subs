00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
something that's important you know if

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.389 
something that's important you know if
you<00:00:36.300> look<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> production's<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:38.070> varied

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you look at the production's they varied

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.729 
you look at the production's they varied
in<00:00:38.520> indifference<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> quality<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
in indifference and quality what the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.139 
in indifference and quality what the
thing<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> same<00:00:41.579> about<00:00:41.760> him<00:00:42.030> was

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
thing that was the same about him was

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
thing that was the same about him was
the<00:00:42.300> message<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.170> very<00:00:43.410> important<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the message it's very important the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.680 
the message it's very important the
message<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> safety<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.850> probably<00:00:45.000> more

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
message of safety is probably more

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.270 
message of safety is probably more
important<00:00:46.110> than<00:00:46.260> anything<00:00:46.469> else<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:46.950> this

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
important than anything else about this

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.430 
important than anything else about this
video<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.690> came<00:00:48.960> through<00:00:49.140> loud<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
video so and that came through loud and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
video so and that came through loud and
clear<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.280> also<00:00:50.579> came<00:00:50.879> through<00:00:51.120> today<00:00:51.300> in

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
clear and it also came through today in

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:03.529 
clear and it also came through today in
the<00:00:51.600> assembly<00:01:00.530> well<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> think<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:03.120> project

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the assembly well I think the project

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.170 
the assembly well I think the project
was<00:01:03.660> about<00:01:03.960> safety<00:01:04.920> basically<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> for

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
was about safety basically for the for

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
was about safety basically for the for
the<00:01:06.270> public<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.290> more<00:01:07.890> importantly

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the public and for the more importantly

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.359 
the public and for the more importantly
you<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> youth<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:10.710> community<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
you know the youth of the community and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.649 
you know the youth of the community and
I<00:01:11.460> think<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.850> was<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.479> bring<00:01:12.570> awareness

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I think it was just to bring awareness

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.810 
I think it was just to bring awareness
for<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.650> youth<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.430> think<00:01:14.700> that's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
for the for the youth and I think that's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.340 
for the for the youth and I think that's
pretty<00:01:14.909> much<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.420> main<00:01:15.780> message<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.259> were

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
pretty much the main message we were

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:26.190 
pretty much the main message we were
trying<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> pass<00:01:16.710> on

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.010 

it's<00:01:26.860> been<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.009> great<00:01:27.189> experience<00:01:27.369> and<00:01:28.150> it<00:01:28.240> it's

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
it's been a great experience and it it's

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.100 
it's been a great experience and it it's
taught<00:01:29.320> me<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.979> can<00:01:30.400> really<00:01:30.700> shine<00:01:31.540> at

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
taught me that you can really shine at

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:40.550 
taught me that you can really shine at
such<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.409> young<00:01:32.500> age

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.590 

the<00:01:41.560> kids<00:01:41.800> really<00:01:42.160> deserve<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:43.210> award<00:01:43.300> they

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
the kids really deserve the award they

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.280 
the kids really deserve the award they
put<00:01:43.840> in<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:44.170> lot<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.500> time<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.700> workload<00:01:46.290> adding
