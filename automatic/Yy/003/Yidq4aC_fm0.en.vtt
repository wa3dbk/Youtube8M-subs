for about a month so I think that I can
give<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.640> review<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> hair<00:00:39.750> more

originally the shedding wasn't that much
but<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.820> seems<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.630> war<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.650> older<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
expected it to shed a little when I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.530 
expected it to shed a little when I
first<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.460> new<00:01:29.939> hair<00:01:30.240> and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
video so that you can see the styling

00:02:18.820 --> 00:03:03.570 
video so that you can see the styling
that<00:02:19.120> I'm<00:02:19.240> talking<00:02:19.660> about

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.770 

as<00:03:03.930> odd<00:03:04.930> as<00:03:04.990> it<00:03:05.620> sounds<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:06.730> could<00:03:07.330> curl<00:03:07.540> his

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
as odd as it sounds I could curl his

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.640 
as odd as it sounds I could curl his
hair<00:03:08.080> with<00:03:08.530> no<00:03:09.280> problems<00:03:09.990> whatsoever<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.560> it

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
hair with no problems whatsoever and it

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.090 
hair with no problems whatsoever and it
comes<00:03:11.920> out<00:03:12.100> gorgeous<00:03:12.700> but<00:03:13.570> whenever<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.770> try<00:03:14.800> to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
comes out gorgeous but whenever I try to

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.040 
comes out gorgeous but whenever I try to
straighten<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:16.000> it's<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.660> completely

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
straighten it it's a completely

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.130 
straighten it it's a completely
different<00:03:17.350> story<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:18.250> don't<00:03:18.820> know<00:03:18.940> what<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.960> is

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
different story I don't know what it is

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.220 
different story I don't know what it is
I<00:03:20.440> don't<00:03:21.250> know<00:03:21.430> if<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.910> hair<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.480> necessarily

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
I don't know if the hair is necessarily

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.630 
I don't know if the hair is necessarily
to<00:03:23.620> blame<00:03:23.860> because<00:03:24.610> my<00:03:25.150> flat<00:03:25.540> irons<00:03:26.080> are<00:03:26.650> crap

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
to blame because my flat irons are crap

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.480 
to blame because my flat irons are crap
and<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:29.020> have<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.560> hard<00:03:29.830> time<00:03:30.040> just

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
and I have a hard time just

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.520 
and I have a hard time just
straightening<00:03:30.940> my<00:03:31.180> hair<00:03:31.210> with<00:03:31.750> them<00:03:32.020> so<00:03:32.260> let

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
straightening my hair with them so let

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.420 
straightening my hair with them so let
alone<00:03:33.120> extensions<00:03:34.120> but<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.860> also<00:03:36.070> has<00:03:36.370> a

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
alone extensions but it also has a

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.000 
alone extensions but it also has a
shortage<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.270> so<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.840> could<00:03:38.320> have<00:03:38.710> been

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
shortage in it so I could have been

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.490 
shortage in it so I could have been
curling<00:03:39.430> like<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.790> same<00:03:40.030> piece<00:03:40.390> for<00:03:41.290> what

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
curling like the same piece for what

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.290 
curling like the same piece for what
felt<00:03:41.770> like<00:03:41.860> forever<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:45.580> setting<00:03:46.090> is

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
felt like forever and this setting is

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.990 
felt like forever and this setting is
saying<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.350> it's<00:03:47.620> off<00:03:47.770> basically<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:48.910> it

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
saying that it's off basically but it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.480 
saying that it's off basically but it
still<00:03:49.180> plugged<00:03:49.480> into<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.780> wall<00:03:49.990> so<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:51.250> could

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
still plugged into the wall so it could

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.100 
still plugged into the wall so it could
be<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.790> hair<00:03:51.970> but<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.330> could<00:03:52.540> also<00:03:52.570> mean<00:03:52.900> that

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
be the hair but it could also mean that

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.280 
be the hair but it could also mean that
I<00:03:53.290> just<00:03:53.440> need<00:03:53.800> new<00:03:53.950> flat<00:03:54.220> irons<00:03:55.050> last<00:03:56.050> thing

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
I just need new flat irons last thing

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.199 
I just need new flat irons last thing
that<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.530> would<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:56.800> to<00:03:56.950> say<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.340> even

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
that I would have to say is that even

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.630 
that I would have to say is that even
with<00:03:58.450> all<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.900> heat<00:03:59.140> styling<00:03:59.830> and<00:04:00.130> things

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
with all the heat styling and things

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.230 
with all the heat styling and things
like<00:04:00.820> that<00:04:00.880> I've<00:04:01.300> done<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:03.240> curling

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
like that I've done a curling

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.660 
like that I've done a curling
straightening<00:04:04.840> blow-drying<00:04:05.350> all<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:06.520> no

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
straightening blow-drying all of that no

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.110 
straightening blow-drying all of that no
matter<00:04:06.820> what<00:04:07.030> I've<00:04:07.180> done<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.810> hair

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
matter what I've done to the hair

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.259 
matter what I've done to the hair
whenever<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:11.170> wet<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.610> air<00:04:12.940> drying

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
whenever it's wet and it is air drying

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.050 
whenever it's wet and it is air drying
or<00:04:13.570> anything<00:04:13.959> like<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:15.400> goes<00:04:15.640> right<00:04:15.820> back

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
or anything like that it goes right back

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.020 
or anything like that it goes right back
to<00:04:16.120> its<00:04:16.419> current<00:04:16.600> path<00:04:16.900> at<00:04:17.739> first<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:18.669> curls

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
to its current path at first the curls

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.810 
to its current path at first the curls
were<00:04:19.239> really<00:04:19.570> big<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.859> almost<00:04:21.070> as<00:04:21.430> if<00:04:21.609> it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
were really big and it almost as if it

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.280 
were really big and it almost as if it
was<00:04:22.200> like<00:04:23.200> if<00:04:23.350> you<00:04:23.380> did<00:04:23.710> with<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.990> curling<00:04:25.990> wand

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
was like if you did with a curling wand

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.360 
was like if you did with a curling wand
like<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.770> was<00:04:26.890> very<00:04:27.160> defined<00:04:27.669> but<00:04:28.600> now<00:04:29.500> once

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
like it was very defined but now once

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.240 
like it was very defined but now once
once<00:04:30.700> I<00:04:31.000> watched<00:04:31.360> their<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:32.020> air<00:04:32.260> dries<00:04:32.620> it

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
once I watched their and air dries it

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.820 
once I watched their and air dries it
looks<00:04:33.550> more<00:04:33.790> like<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.090> beach<00:04:34.450> wave<00:04:35.710> up

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
looks more like a beach wave up

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.340 
looks more like a beach wave up
in<00:04:36.010> nature<00:04:36.160> think<00:04:36.580> when<00:04:37.150> wavy<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.169> looks

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
in nature think when wavy and it looks

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.600 
in nature think when wavy and it looks
like<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:38.950> love<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.250> i<00:04:39.310> think<00:04:39.370> is

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
like that in I love it i think is

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.570 
like that in I love it i think is
gorgeous<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.300> i<00:04:41.169> actually<00:04:41.890> weren't<00:04:42.340> like

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
gorgeous and i actually weren't like

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.860 
gorgeous and i actually weren't like
that<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.940> lot<00:04:43.120> as<00:04:43.300> well<00:04:43.330> but<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:46.000> twist<00:04:46.300> outs<00:04:46.540> i

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
that a lot as well but the twist outs i

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.390 
that a lot as well but the twist outs i
really<00:04:47.440> like<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.740> way<00:04:47.770> that's<00:04:47.979> where<00:04:48.130> styles

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
really like the way that's where styles

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.340 
really like the way that's where styles
come<00:04:48.580> out<00:04:48.760> with<00:04:49.450> his<00:04:49.630> hair<00:04:50.280> um<00:04:51.930> overall<00:04:52.930> I

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
come out with his hair um overall I

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.440 
come out with his hair um overall I
would<00:04:53.520> probably<00:04:54.520> purchase<00:04:54.940> from<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.150> side

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
would probably purchase from the side

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.100 
would probably purchase from the side
again<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:56.290> will<00:04:56.500> probably<00:04:57.070> just<00:04:57.340> be<00:04:58.110> straight

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
again it will probably just be straight

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.629 
again it will probably just be straight
hair<00:04:59.350> just<00:05:00.070> because<00:05:02.160> is

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
hair just because is

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.330 
hair just because is
I<00:05:03.759> feel<00:05:04.240> like<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:04.719> was<00:05:04.870> shared<00:05:05.199> list<00:05:05.469> because

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
I feel like it was shared list because

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.339 
I feel like it was shared list because
anything<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:06.789> has<00:05:07.060> like<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.300> curl<00:05:07.659> to<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:07.990> when

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
anything that has like a curl to it when

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.499 
anything that has like a curl to it when
you're<00:05:08.499> coming<00:05:08.889> to<00:05:08.949> brushing<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.430> out<00:05:09.550> it

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
you're coming to brushing it out it

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.450 
you're coming to brushing it out it
could<00:05:10.719> get<00:05:10.840> stuck<00:05:11.199> in<00:05:11.409> the<00:05:11.560> coils<00:05:11.979> which<00:05:12.189> kind

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
could get stuck in the coils which kind

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.929 
could get stuck in the coils which kind

of can help with the shedding if I hope

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.529 
of can help with the shedding if I hope
I<00:05:16.029> making<00:05:16.270> sense<00:05:16.599> to<00:05:16.779> you<00:05:16.930> but<00:05:17.550> anyway<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:18.789> don't

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
I making sense to you but anyway I don't

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.649 
I making sense to you but anyway I don't
think<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.930> hair<00:05:20.199> was<00:05:20.849> was<00:05:21.849> bad<00:05:22.090> enough<00:05:22.360> to<00:05:22.569> the

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
think the hair was was bad enough to the

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.659 
think the hair was was bad enough to the
point<00:05:22.689> where<00:05:23.169> I<00:05:23.349> wouldn't<00:05:23.800> purchase<00:05:24.069> it<00:05:24.370> again

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
point where I wouldn't purchase it again

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.360 
point where I wouldn't purchase it again
it<00:05:24.909> was<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.150> lot<00:05:25.479> of<00:05:25.509> shitty<00:05:25.870> but<00:05:26.229> if<00:05:27.009> it<00:05:27.219> does

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
it was a lot of shitty but if it does

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.339 
it was a lot of shitty but if it does
the<00:05:27.550> same<00:05:27.580> thing<00:05:28.120> with<00:05:28.449> a<00:05:28.479> straight<00:05:28.900> hair<00:05:29.139> that

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
the same thing with a straight hair that

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.429 
the same thing with a straight hair that
I<00:05:29.469> won't<00:05:29.650> buy<00:05:29.949> anything<00:05:30.749> else<00:05:31.749> but<00:05:32.139> I<00:05:32.259> don't

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:32.439 
I won't buy anything else but I don't

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.989 
I won't buy anything else but I don't
think<00:05:32.560> it<00:05:32.710> would<00:05:32.860> be<00:05:32.979> that<00:05:33.009> bad<00:05:33.340> it<00:05:33.699> would<00:05:33.879> be

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:33.999 
think it would be that bad it would be

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:39.300 
think it would be that bad it would be

more so of my laziness when I need
install<00:06:14.529> just<00:06:14.860> because<00:06:15.159> I<00:06:15.279> wanted<00:06:15.610> to<00:06:15.729> hear

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469 
you up and get done so it's not very

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:25.769 
you up and get done so it's not very
neat<00:06:18.000> but<00:06:19.439> yeah<00:06:20.439> um<00:06:23.969> but<00:06:24.969> split<00:06:25.330> the<00:06:25.479> tracks

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
neat but yeah um but split the tracks

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.769 
neat but yeah um but split the tracks
that's<00:06:26.050> definitely<00:06:26.469> not<00:06:26.710> an<00:06:26.889> option<00:06:27.310> anymore

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
that's definitely not an option anymore

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.899 
that's definitely not an option anymore
because<00:06:28.779> of<00:06:29.259> the<00:06:29.919> shed<00:06:30.219> the<00:06:30.550> amount<00:06:30.759> of

because of the shed the amount of
shedding<00:06:31.149> that<00:06:31.300> I<00:06:31.449> get<00:06:32.819> in<00:06:33.819> splitting<00:06:34.569> the

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:34.659 
shedding that I get in splitting the

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.570 
shedding that I get in splitting the
track<00:06:34.960> will<00:06:35.169> only<00:06:35.349> double<00:06:35.860> bit<00:06:36.039> and<00:06:36.339> I<00:06:36.550> haven't

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
track will only double bit and I haven't

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.639 
track will only double bit and I haven't
sealed<00:06:37.029> the<00:06:37.180> whips<00:06:37.419> so<00:06:37.990> that's<00:06:38.830> that<00:06:40.469> once<00:06:41.469> i

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:41.649 
sealed the whips so that's that once i

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
hopefully I think I'm thinking about

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:48.409 
hopefully I think I'm thinking about
doing<00:06:46.689> towards<00:06:47.349> the<00:06:47.439> end<00:06:47.620> of<00:06:47.800> the<00:06:47.860> week<00:06:48.129> i'm
