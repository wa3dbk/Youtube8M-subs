a Phillips screwdriver now that we have
our<00:01:06.000> tools<00:01:06.270> let's<00:01:06.780> begin<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
our tools let's begin with the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.480 
our tools let's begin with the
installation<00:01:09.530> first<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.860> need<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> remove<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
installation first we need to remove the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.179 
installation first we need to remove the
cover<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> rfid<00:01:12.659> reader<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.950> done

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
cover from the rfid reader this is done

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.609 
cover from the rfid reader this is done
by<00:01:14.400> unscrewing<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.090> single<00:01:15.479> screw<00:01:15.810> found<00:01:16.439> on

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
by unscrewing the single screw found on

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.740 
by unscrewing the single screw found on
the<00:01:16.740> bottom<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> reader<00:01:17.520> once<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the bottom of the reader once this is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510 
the bottom of the reader once this is
done<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.439> clearly<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> two<00:01:20.490> holes

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
done you can clearly see the two holes

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.020 
done you can clearly see the two holes
for<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> screws<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.780> placed<00:01:22.759> now<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.939> we

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
for the screws to be placed now that we

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.880 
for the screws to be placed now that we
have<00:01:24.150> removed<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> front<00:01:24.720> panel<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.619> need<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
have removed the front panel we need to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.440 
have removed the front panel we need to
mark<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> screw<00:01:26.460> holes<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> wall<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
mark the screw holes on the wall with a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 
mark the screw holes on the wall with a
pencil<00:01:27.720> however<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:28.950> notice<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
pencil however you will notice that the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
pencil however you will notice that the
wire<00:01:29.850> protruding<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:30.930> prevents

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
wire protruding from the back prevents

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.920 
wire protruding from the back prevents
this<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.220> let's<00:01:32.430> deal<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.030> caper<00:01:33.240> first

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
this so let's deal with the caper first

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.960 
this so let's deal with the caper first
find<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.740> area<00:01:35.890> in<00:01:36.250> which<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.430> would<00:01:36.670> like<00:01:36.790> to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
find the area in which you would like to

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.240 
find the area in which you would like to
mount<00:01:37.090> your<00:01:37.300> RFID<00:01:37.840> reader<00:01:38.230> in<00:01:38.590> this<00:01:39.010> case

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
mount your RFID reader in this case

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.680 
mount your RFID reader in this case
we're<00:01:39.520> going<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.790> be<00:01:39.850> mounting<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.390> device

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
we're going to be mounting the device

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.590 
we're going to be mounting the device
next<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.560> doorframe<00:01:41.940> using<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.060> pencil<00:01:43.270> I

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
next to the doorframe using the pencil I

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.510 
next to the doorframe using the pencil I
will<00:01:43.870> roughly<00:01:44.140> draw<00:01:44.410> around<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.770> device<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.490> I

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
will roughly draw around the device so I

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.960 
will roughly draw around the device so I
can<00:01:45.610> see<00:01:45.970> where<00:01:46.120> it<00:01:46.210> will<00:01:46.300> fit<00:01:46.540> on<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.810> wall

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
can see where it will fit on the wall

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.030 
can see where it will fit on the wall
after<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.330> is<00:01:49.510> done<00:01:49.540> turn<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.500> device<00:01:50.770> over

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
after this is done turn the device over

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.680 
after this is done turn the device over
so<00:01:51.370> you<00:01:51.430> can<00:01:51.640> match<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.030> position<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.600> the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
so you can match the position of the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.690 
so you can match the position of the
wire<00:01:52.900> on<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.200> device<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:54.100> outline<00:01:54.550> that

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
wire on the device to the outline that

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.609
