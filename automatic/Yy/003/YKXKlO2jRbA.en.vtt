hose<00:00:18.060> pumps<00:00:18.540> are<00:00:19.640> used<00:00:20.640> primarily<00:00:21.120> to<00:00:21.570> pump

hose pumps are used primarily to pump
thick<00:00:22.560> viscous<00:00:23.840> abrasives<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.080> slurries<00:00:25.860> and

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
thick viscous abrasives and slurries and

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.200 
thick viscous abrasives and slurries and
they<00:00:27.360> operate<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:27.840> principle<00:00:28.440> of<00:00:28.910> pushing<00:00:29.910> the

they operate on principle of pushing the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.740 
they operate on principle of pushing the
flow<00:00:31.279> capturing<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> flow<00:00:32.550> between<00:00:32.970> rollers

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
flow capturing the flow between rollers

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.460 
flow capturing the flow between rollers
inside<00:00:34.740> the<00:00:35.040> hose<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.900> pushing<00:00:36.900> that<00:00:37.079> flow

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
inside the hose and pushing that flow

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.130 
inside the hose and pushing that flow
out<00:00:37.829> through<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.550> discharge<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:40.079> do

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
out through the discharge as they do

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.430 
out through the discharge as they do
that<00:00:41.239> when<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> roller<00:00:42.630> passes<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that when the roller passes the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.950 
that when the roller passes the
discharge<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.250> passes<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.910> inlet<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> flow

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
discharge and passes the inlet the flow

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.889 
discharge and passes the inlet the flow
momentarily<00:00:46.560> stops<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.570> type

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
momentarily stops so you get this type

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.100 
momentarily stops so you get this type
of<00:00:48.930> stop<00:00:49.380> start<00:00:49.770> flow<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.809> wide

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
of stop start flow and you get a wide

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.889 
of stop start flow and you get a wide
swing<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.829> pressure<00:00:53.100> variation<00:00:53.880> both<00:00:54.630> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
swing and pressure variation both of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.340 
swing and pressure variation both of
which<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.380> be<00:00:55.790> harmful<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.390> system<00:00:57.989> because

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
which can be harmful to a system because

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.889 
which can be harmful to a system because
of<00:00:58.530> vibration<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.790> because<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of vibration and because of the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.610 
of vibration and because of the
inability<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.730> smoothly<00:01:02.730> flow<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.660> product

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
inability to smoothly flow a product

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.649 
inability to smoothly flow a product
into<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.400> system<00:01:06.120> or<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.229> final<00:01:07.799> operation<00:01:08.659> yeah

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
into a system or a final operation yeah

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
into a system or a final operation yeah
when<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:11.659> take<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.870> isolation<00:01:13.530> valve<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
when we take the isolation valve and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.140 
when we take the isolation valve and
open<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.960> dampener<00:01:17.000> immediately<00:01:18.000> we

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
open it to the dampener immediately we

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.870 
open it to the dampener immediately we
see<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.590> significant<00:01:19.590> reduction<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> pulse

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
see a significant reduction in the pulse

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.200 
see a significant reduction in the pulse
and<00:01:21.180> an<00:01:21.900> almost<00:01:22.500> near<00:01:23.070> steady-state<00:01:23.700> flow

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and an almost near steady-state flow

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.020 
and an almost near steady-state flow
this<00:01:25.110> eliminates<00:01:25.740> vibration<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.520> system

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
this eliminates vibration in the system

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.460 
this eliminates vibration in the system
protects<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> piping<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.740> components<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
protects the piping and components and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.520 
protects the piping and components and
ensures<00:01:31.670> longer<00:01:32.670> hose<00:01:33.150> life<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:34.200> there

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
ensures longer hose life because there

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.060 
ensures longer hose life because there
isn't<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.010> backflow<00:01:36.170> pressure<00:01:37.170> surge<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.860> both

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
isn't a backflow pressure surge in both

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.210 
isn't a backflow pressure surge in both
directions<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.479> roller<00:01:39.750> passes<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
directions as the roller passes the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.990 
directions as the roller passes the
discharge<00:01:41.729> port
