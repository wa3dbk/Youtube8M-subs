00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.150
 video project play as 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.380
 go to youtube score a cool goal or 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.600
 awesome whale and you will be shown very 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.700
 a lot of cool videos and common in these 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.160
 videos the fact that they do not perform 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.020
 robots and real football players from anyone 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.800
 unknown african to the very 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.800
 lionel messi 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.760
 everyone remembers dollars a corr low collected 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.920
 more than half a million views on y tube 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.680
 why do n't our players repeat 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.050
 some tricks of the first member of our 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.970
 the project will be midfielder Alexander 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.129
 why is he preparing now in the locker room 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.019
 and do not know what 's waiting for him, let's 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.019
 let's go to him we do business 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.480
 See very difficult task 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.870
 probably remember about chronic 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.410
 develop torpedo belaz 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:12.290
 Yes, you now need to repeat the goal 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.240
 three equal conditions but a little bit 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.660
 conditions will change even at the gate thick 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.900
 and Vladimir drink and more worth come on 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.900
 we'll see 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.970
 Well, I'll try the monster toresa but all 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.970
 then beat angry at the background 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.480
 Pages spoke where Russia is 10 meters 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.480
 maybe she also 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.850
 if there is a vein seeding from a goal for 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.420
 I therefore considered myself normal 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.430
 I love the result 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.430
 five heads 5 assists 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.890
 I have it in almost every season 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.220
 i.e 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.440
 we show memorabilia such goals was not 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.020
 to tie then won some 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.780
 the title is probably memorable here 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.390
 Nothing to remember the most beautiful 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.180
 Mainly long shots such 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.660
 from large distances there were many heads 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.060
 some particular I will not be recorded 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.850
 on houses let it be not about the first 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.860
 the goal of a sarin dinar to cats has hammered that with 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.490
 you repeat was the cornice of the official 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.190
 the game should be a lot of factors I am now 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.770
 I tried to know to beat this ball 170 meters 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.050
 a lot and on weather conditions influence and a 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.270
 talked with the guys there that is well 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.120
 then the wind was good enough 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.740
 you know who helped and when 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.540
 such a stadium as in Gomel here on 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.880
 closed very hard you know to score 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.510
 so that such a goal to repeat it is necessary that 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.000
 you know like a fraction of a second thought 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.610
 ie th you will not be targeted 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.960
 think well you know the whole game run and then 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.300
 I will be terrible 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.220
 any time 70 meters I will crush 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.080
 it is necessary that is, as factors you know how 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.670
 I wanted to break it, so it turned out 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.240
 Yet we finished I was very aware of 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.340
 tired 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.920
 under runs I want to wash myself to eat 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.880
 rest fully exercise our 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.040
 midfielder 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.140
 alexander kegs turned out with 5 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.720
 attempts and it turned out and there I will say very 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.580
 not bad 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.750
