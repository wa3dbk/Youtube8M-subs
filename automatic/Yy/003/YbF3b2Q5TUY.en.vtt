00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
here's my floating raft had a product

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.320 
here's my floating raft had a product
system<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.680> was<00:00:04.799> telling<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.250> about<00:00:06.680> this<00:00:07.680> is

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
system I was telling you about this is

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.209 
system I was telling you about this is
made<00:00:09.330> out<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.570> two<00:00:10.019> bytes<00:00:11.540> and<00:00:12.799> the<00:00:13.799> inside

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
made out of two bytes and the inside

dimensions<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.990> about<00:00:16.289> two<00:00:16.560> by<00:00:16.740> E<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.160> I

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
dimensions this is about two by E so I

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.060 
dimensions this is about two by E so I
could<00:00:17.460> get<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> half<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.300> sheet<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:19.070> inch
