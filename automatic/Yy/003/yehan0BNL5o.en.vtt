 that there I am in a session on 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.350
 invitation but the most practical and the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.520
 Funniest to do alone fast in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.320
 to really go in public session 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.010
 So here I am going to get ready from 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.010
 amounts that she sings vehicle 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 the next you're going out 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.649
 your phone and you're going to have to 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.110
 you go on the internet then has it 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.490
 will go in money and services there you 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.539
 go go on the bank mass and you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.579
 you have to put all your money 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.119
 on your bank account so nothing 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.340
 in the pocket 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.530
 there you go in pouring you pour 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.270
 any menu you then validate you 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.369
 go out your phone and you 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.439
 go go to kontakt that's next 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.360
 you are going to call brucy so that is 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.470
 just here that's where you call it so 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.819
 brucy him normally he will you 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.539
 ask if you want the 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.850
 testosterone 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.259
 then you go validated in 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 going back into the tank and actually it's okay 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.679
 do you or albrecht the time you 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.849
 will reappear inside you 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.380
 see that I missed must really taken 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.759
 at the right time so there you press 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.009
 triangle there you quickly press the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 cross key to confess that I missed I 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.069
 got into the tank so I'm going 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.239
 and I emphasize again how the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.080
 you see it's not patched it's 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.390
 just that it's a bit of a hassle 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.590
 there I validated and you see I am 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.970
 got into the tank so there you can 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.310
 really go inside and you 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.660
 hide below and there actually what 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.070
 will really be funny it's for example 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.690
 you put your tank and if you 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.950
 go inside you say to a 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.510
 mate to you to put a premium on 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.010
 the head or something like that every 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.970
 players will come to you they will 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.350
 not see you or so they will you 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.819
 believe that you are in the time that 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.069
 they will see that you are not moving 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.940
 and will try to steal the tank and so 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.950
 when they go inside 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.750
 you will be able to kill them as I 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.950
 showed you so here's what I'm going 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.299
 to do is to avoid inviting a friend 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.459
 story of still showing you 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.069
 how can you troll them and that's it 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.840
 I lived invitation invitation in progress 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.519
 So that's where I have a friend who joy 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.019
 in the session he will want to go back 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.400
 in time for the pane actually I 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.260
 will be able to troll and since the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.819
 balls go through the wall 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.079
 transparent and he will be able to die 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.000
 so I think it's still 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.530
 pretty cool man it's fun you go 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.569
 to be able to find as many people as possible 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.970
 online thanks to this little glitch and more 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.049
 it's not so bad so it goes 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.370
 and that's me I'll leave you on 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.049
 these images anyway I hope it 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.340
 you will have liked do not hesitate to let go 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.109
