has a boil this water next tea tree oil
in<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.190> let's<00:01:01.089> see<00:01:01.269> that<00:01:01.510> I<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:03.129> sprinkle<00:01:03.549> a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580

little<00:01:03.729> tea<00:01:03.970> tree<00:01:04.210> oil<00:01:04.420> here<00:01:04.720> I<00:01:04.750> think<00:01:05.080> it

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
little tea tree oil here I think it

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.859

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
dry for a little longer so this is what

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.320 
dry for a little longer so this is what
that<00:06:52.430> looks<00:06:52.669> like<00:06:52.759> when<00:06:53.000> they're<00:06:53.150> not

that looks like when they're not
separating<00:06:53.990> now<00:06:54.440> is<00:06:55.300> take<00:06:56.949> the<00:06:57.949> curls<00:06:58.490> that

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250 
separating now is take the curls that

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:09.959 
separating now is take the curls that
we're<00:07:01.250> at<00:07:02.090> the<00:07:02.300> ends<00:07:02.660> of<00:07:02.720> the<00:07:02.780> braid
