00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.040

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.380
 I leave all the information is not 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.190
 forget to check if you are interested 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.560
 and now if we go to the tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.060
 Begin by applying heat shield in 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.700
 all my hair 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.910
 here I am using my favorite that is the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.340
 the need of l'orÃ©al 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.800
 after that the brush my hair 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.430
 to distribute the product better and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.070
 make sure I do not have any knots 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.830
 Now I'm going to divide my hair into two 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.860
 parts and I'll start taking tufts 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.740
 from the back and rolling the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.370
 hair from medium to pointed direction 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.630
 contrary to my face or backwards 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.630
 thus 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.409
 as well 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.530
 I wait about 8 to 10 seconds and then 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.450
 she retired the golden laugh trying to hold 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.229
 the curl in my hand for a couple of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.170
 seconds as I go forward I pass the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.750
 tufts curled back so you do not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.750
 get confused with the hair without curling 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.860
 and so I repeat the same process until 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.860
 reach the opposite 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.860
 when we reach the front lock 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.630
 let's try to put the curler in 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.630
 a much more vertical position 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.220
 and that's how our curls look once 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.350
 we have finished the first part 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.500
 now let's let feel a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.930
 little and cool down and let's repeat the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.260
 same process in the second half of the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.260
 hair 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.620
 i 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.890
 now to give some volume to 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.920
 the roots I take some locks of 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.400
 hair and curls from above to 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.400
 half 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.620
 Y 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.200
 all right 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.590
 finally he applied a little oil 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.020
 of argan concentrating on the tips and 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.660
 what is left over, what is left over in the rest of 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.660
 my hair for more shine and silkiness 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.830
 and ready 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.190
 and this is all enjoyable as you could see 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.830
 it's a super easy and fast process and it's not 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.840
 I really like the result and 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.970
 I talk a lot, it will take me about 10 minutes 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.150
 more or less in doing it and that I have 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.940
 the hair then long and more or less 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.590
 abundant so it does not look like 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.410
 a super practical hairstyle looks very 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.420
 feminine and therefore nothing I hope that has 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.940
 liked the results that have been 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.040
