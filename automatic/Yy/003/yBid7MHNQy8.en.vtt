shift<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.899> main<00:01:25.080> gear<00:01:25.290> shift<00:01:25.590> comes<00:01:26.250> with

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
shift and the main gear shift comes with

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.080 
shift and the main gear shift comes with
these<00:01:26.610> beautiful<00:01:26.820> EVGA<00:01:27.780> gtx<00:01:28.619> 580<00:01:29.220> video<00:01:29.610> cards

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
these beautiful EVGA gtx 580 video cards

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.120 
these beautiful EVGA gtx 580 video cards
and<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.600> video<00:01:30.840> cards<00:01:31.320> are<00:01:31.440> very<00:01:31.649> important

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and the video cards are very important

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
and the video cards are very important
because<00:01:32.190> that's<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:33.060> renders<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.780> scene

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
because that's what renders the scene

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.350 
because that's what renders the scene
and<00:01:34.200> offloads<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.310> cpu<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.000> central

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and offloads the cpu the central

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.359 
and offloads the cpu the central
processing<00:01:36.780> unit<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.590> graphic<00:01:38.100> cards

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
processing unit to the graphic cards

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.730 
processing unit to the graphic cards
which<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> graphic<00:01:39.750> processing<00:01:40.229> unit<00:01:40.619> oh

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
which is the graphic processing unit oh

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.410 
which is the graphic processing unit oh
yeah<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.430> called<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.759> shift<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.300> if

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
yeah it's called the shift because if

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.300 
yeah it's called the shift because if
you<00:01:42.509> look<00:01:42.660> on<00:01:42.840> top<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.619> motherboard<00:01:44.160> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you look on top the motherboard is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.730 
you look on top the motherboard is
shifted<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.910> rotated<00:01:45.390> 90<00:01:45.780> degrees<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:46.440> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
shifted and rotated 90 degrees all the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.529 
shifted and rotated 90 degrees all the
heat<00:01:46.920> comes<00:01:47.160> from<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.459> top<00:01:47.670> you'll<00:01:48.119> notice<00:01:48.300> on

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
heat comes from the top you'll notice on

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.090 
heat comes from the top you'll notice on
the<00:01:48.660> sides<00:01:48.899> there's<00:01:49.200> no<00:01:49.380> connection<00:01:49.679> right

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
the sides there's no connection right

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.490 
the sides there's no connection right
really<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.240> kinds<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> awards<00:01:51.750> main

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
gears at a New Jersey they started about

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.359 
gears at a New Jersey they started about
two<00:01:54.509> grand<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.929> go<00:01:55.050> up<00:01:55.229> phenomenal<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.190> this

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
two grand and go up phenomenal and this

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.130 
two grand and go up phenomenal and this
keeps<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.789> cool<00:01:56.970> by<00:01:57.420> having<00:01:57.660> this<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.959> top

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
keeps it cool by having this on the top

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.540 
keeps it cool by having this on the top
so<00:01:58.410> it<00:01:58.470> doesn't<00:01:58.679> overheat<00:01:58.709> which<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.250> nice<00:01:59.399> and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550
