00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.850
 very well here we have the printer ml 21 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.850
 65 w 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.410
 we are going to do the phrasing 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.410
 so you can put toners recharged 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.670
 this is the original cartridge that 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.580
 will use the client after we 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.100
 sent to the load this other that we have 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.140
 here that is already loaded but that 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.830
 obviously by itself it's not going to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.230
 recognize the equipment this toner was 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.780
 recharged and we proceed to do what is 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.809
 the player 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.320
 of manufactured with this was with which 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.020
 we take the following data 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 the firmware data 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.730
 what fun 3.000 1.14 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:06.200
 and whose krumm is 13 06 15 0 54 10 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.190
 is the information 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.630
 seventh with this toner then 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.630
 we arrived on the computer 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.850
 It is the only printer to Samsung ML 2160 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.770
 installed 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.869
 in fact I do not have anything else 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.869
 connected more than the keyboard and the mouse 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.540
 we proceed to do what is the placeo 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.540
 with the pix sent for it 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.890
 we put the toner 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.390
 in any kind of tape on the chip 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.080
 still 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.080
 yes 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.009
 we place 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.510
 we light 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.290
 and once it turns 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.759
 we go to the part of the fix where you have to 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.759
 run 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.410
 elton the one sent 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.020
 and we are seeing that a light 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.020
 red 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.069
 he no longer marked the two red lights because 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.930
 the fix 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.299
 because for some reason it has not 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.480
 worked maybe I have not installed it 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.480
 correctly then we proceed 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.170
 execute the download I executed it as 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.579
 administrator 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.890
 automatically the window appears in 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.760
 ms-dos tells me to press a key 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.760
 to continue 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.390
 and whatever you're already doing the 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.390
 process 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.060
 there you have to make a robot 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.750
 literally says that it takes approximately 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.650
 10 minutes though 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.560
 in this case 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.560
 download a little less is an approximate 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.459
 what he does is change English 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.620
 a green color 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.660
 we can take out the toner and put 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.770
 a little 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.850
 masquin tape in the part of the chip 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.850
 theoretically it should be 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.370
 and it is assumed that the robot already did 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.480
 changed to green it 's time to 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.480
 put the tape 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.980
 for it in tepito 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.800
 I know that for them to be so although very 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.710
 all right 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:46.100
 then we put what is 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.100
 a tape to cover the chip well 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:07.599
 place again and that's how it is 

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:07.599
 remains 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.990
 the funny thing is that 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.910
 I have already done this procedure 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.910
 previously 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.910
 s 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.570
 only this time 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.570
 a market
