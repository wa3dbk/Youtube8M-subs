00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.630
 the x1 and the little suv of bmw alongside 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.190
 of his big brothers the x3 x5 and x6 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.990
 appeared in 2009 he was restyled to 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.730
 autumn 2012 with minor alterations 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.529
 most obvious exterior to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.119
 recognize coming from the appearance of the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.189
 flashing repeaters on the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.480
 exterior mirrors mechanically 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.279
 several changes have been 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.710
 brought with more power and 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.000
 less domestic consumption was 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.009
 one of the most criticized points about 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.630
 the x1 before restyling for its quality of 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.410
 non- standard presentation 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.090
 of the brand 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.469
 so this is one of the points that has the most 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.570
 evolved especially on the center console 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 now from one block 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.870
 the perceived quality is progressing well and truly 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.460
 but we are not there yet despite 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 materials is progressing we are not at 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.780
 level of a series 1 for example the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.730
 strong point of x 1c the road 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.370
 he shows himself dynamic agile very far 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.930
 suv our version 25d only 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.579
 available in 4 wheel drive uses 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.949
 a 4 cylinders 2 liters diesel double 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.260
 turbo is the succession of 23 from 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.030
 that they go from 204 to 218 choices with 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.949
 a more efficient report auto box 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.540
 the performances are very good but 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.970
 we regret the sound too present 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.320
 diesel at the rear the space offered to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.119
 passengers is quite generous seen 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.500
 the clutter of the car 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.000
 the side passengers are well 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.220
 installed but the middle one will be 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.049
 truly punished he must at once 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.790
 to have a seat and a very hard back 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.540
 and a cumbersome transmission tunnel 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.369
 it is a place of repair the chest 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.590
 displays a capacity of 426 meters 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.030
 correct cubes but well below 463 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.610
 cubic decimetres of his rival the most 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.170
 live the audi q3 all dipped a few 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.549
 small storage spaces are available 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.110
 rear seat is foldable not 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.930
 in two- thirds-one-third but in 40 20 40 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.460
 on an increase of modularity 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.909
 the central part is equivalent to a hatch 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.710
 on skis with its slight restyling the x1 has 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.810
 progressed on its main flaw the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.640
 presentation quality but it remains 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.439
 criticize on this point a little guan 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.310
 hervÃ© steel not having much to 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.470
 envy him 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.850
 where x1 products are undeniable 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.820
 and on the rise in performance and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.200
 lower consumption our x 1,25 10 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.630
 at 14 euros more than its predecessor 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.930
 but rejects 22 grams per km of CO2 in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.470
 less 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.470
 Bravo
