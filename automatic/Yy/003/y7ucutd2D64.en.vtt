 hello to all welcome be fair and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
 cooking so today I 'm going to you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.099
 show how to achieve in a few 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.489
 minutes of beautiful rose with dough 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:23.460
 on it so first of all to start 

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:25.880
 you will need a nylon sheet of 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.809
 parchment paper and paw on it 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.309
 so then formed this little ball 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.949
 more or less of this dimension is 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.489
 willing appeared together on your sheet 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.489
 of nylon 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.090
 so fold your nylon sheet into 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.880
 two like these and flatten your 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.820
 balls of dough with the palm of your 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.620
 hand 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.490
 so once you've realized your 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.690
 petals have them on your paper 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.880
