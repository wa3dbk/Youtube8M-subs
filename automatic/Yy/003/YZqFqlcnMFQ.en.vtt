00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
that's basically going to start up on

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.680 
that's basically going to start up on
the<00:00:36.040> fifth<00:00:36.220> fret<00:00:36.490> i'm<00:00:37.030> going<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.270> drop<00:00:37.480> be

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
the fifth fret i'm going to drop be

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:56.970 
the fifth fret i'm going to drop be
tuning<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.320> it<00:00:39.250> goes<00:00:39.370> something<00:00:39.460> like<00:00:39.610> this

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.980 

and<00:00:57.980> that's<00:00:58.250> essentially<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.060> first<00:00:59.480> opening

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
and that's essentially the first opening

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.830 
and that's essentially the first opening
part<00:01:00.560> of<00:01:00.770> dead<00:01:00.980> memories<00:01:01.450> yeah<00:01:02.450> I<00:01:02.480> mean<00:01:02.780> it's

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
part of dead memories yeah I mean it's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.840 
part of dead memories yeah I mean it's
pretty<00:01:03.230> slow<00:01:03.470> neos<00:01:03.710> basically<00:01:04.220> what<00:01:04.400> it<00:01:04.430> is<00:01:04.519> is

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
pretty slow neos basically what it is is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.790 
pretty slow neos basically what it is is
in<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.479> drop<00:01:05.690> tuning<00:01:06.140> you're<00:01:06.470> going<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.650> have

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
in the drop tuning you're going to have

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.420 
in the drop tuning you're going to have
a<00:01:06.830> fifth<00:01:07.100> chord<00:01:07.370> here<00:01:07.550> on<00:01:07.700> this<00:01:07.850> red

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.260 

so<00:01:10.910> you're<00:01:11.030> going<00:01:11.120> to<00:01:11.180> have<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.930> know

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
so you're going to have you know

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:25.160 
so you're going to have you know
up<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.140> 8th<00:01:14.259> fret<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.659> street

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.140 

and<00:01:39.740> that's<00:01:39.920> essentially<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.460> intro<00:01:40.850> for

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
and that's essentially the intro for

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.940 
and that's essentially the intro for
dead<00:01:41.360> memories<00:01:42.970> solo<00:01:43.970> time<00:01:47.500> delay<00:01:48.500> i<00:01:48.530> approach

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
dead memories solo time delay i approach

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
soloing is a little bit strange i'm not

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.640 
soloing is a little bit strange i'm not
really<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.670> learned<00:01:52.970> guitar<00:01:53.300> player<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:54.080> didn't

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
really a learned guitar player I didn't

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.460 
really a learned guitar player I didn't
I<00:01:54.890> don't<00:01:55.640> really<00:01:55.730> know<00:01:55.940> much<00:01:56.120> about<00:01:56.330> theory<00:01:56.900> I

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
I don't really know much about theory I

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.800 
I don't really know much about theory I
learned<00:01:57.980> a<00:01:58.160> few<00:01:58.430> scales<00:01:58.970> up<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.570> down<00:01:59.690> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
learned a few scales up and down the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.680 
learned a few scales up and down the
fretboard<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:02.210> know<00:02:02.300> I'm<00:02:02.390> just<00:02:02.540> now

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
fretboard and you know I'm just now

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.790 
fretboard and you know I'm just now
starting<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:03.110> kind<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.350> figure<00:02:03.500> out<00:02:03.650> how<00:02:03.740> to

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
starting to kind of figure out how to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.290 
starting to kind of figure out how to
move<00:02:04.010> those<00:02:04.160> scales<00:02:04.430> around<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:04.910> put<00:02:05.090> them<00:02:05.180> in

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
move those scales around to put them in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.190 
move those scales around to put them in
the<00:02:05.690> right<00:02:05.840> key<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.290> things<00:02:06.500> like<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.770> so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the right key and things like that so

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.630 
the right key and things like that so
when<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.230> play<00:02:09.470> solos<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.220> studio<00:02:10.580> I

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
when I play solos in the studio I

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.160 
when I play solos in the studio I
basically<00:02:10.910> do<00:02:11.300> them<00:02:11.450> off<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.720> top<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.930> my<00:02:12.080> head

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
basically do them off the top of my head

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.710 
basically do them off the top of my head
and<00:02:12.650> then<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.640> go<00:02:13.790> back<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.240> relearn<00:02:14.600> them

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
and then I go back and I relearn them

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.040 
and then I go back and I relearn them
later<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.760> never<00:02:16.970> really<00:02:17.300> playing<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
later and I never really playing the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.760 
later and I never really playing the
same<00:02:18.260> way<00:02:18.440> twice<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:20.030> you'll<00:02:20.870> get<00:02:21.200> kind<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.710> the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
same way twice so you'll get kind of the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.310 
same way twice so you'll get kind of the
gist<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.610> what<00:02:23.390> I'm<00:02:23.420> doing<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.020> solo<00:02:24.410> and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
gist of what I'm doing in the solo and

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.690 
gist of what I'm doing in the solo and
some<00:02:27.320> extra<00:02:27.650> stuff<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.680> anyways<00:02:30.980> when<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
some extra stuff so anyways when the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:56.900 
some extra stuff so anyways when the
solo<00:02:31.970> kicks<00:02:32.240> in<00:02:32.450> that's<00:02:32.690> something<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.050> this

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.260 

you

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.020 

and<00:03:06.270> that's<00:03:06.870> basically<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.740> solo<00:03:08.190> for<00:03:08.520> dead

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and that's basically the solo for dead

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.710 
and that's basically the solo for dead
memories<00:03:10.190> basically<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.790> slower<00:03:12.450> version

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
memories basically a slower version

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:34.460 
memories basically a slower version
would<00:03:13.080> be

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.650 

I<00:03:35.070> don't<00:03:35.640> know<00:03:35.700> how<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.850> close<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.210> was<00:03:36.540> to

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
I don't know how that close that was to

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.530 
I don't know how that close that was to
the<00:03:36.750> first<00:03:36.990> time<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.200> played<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.710> but

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
the first time I played it but

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.310 
the first time I played it but
essentially<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.660> out<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.810> these<00:03:40.080> shapes

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
essentially it's out of these shapes

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.870 
essentially it's out of these shapes
i'll<00:03:40.620> give<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.950> shapes<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.490> then<00:03:41.610> maybe

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
i'll give you the shapes and then maybe

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.220 
i'll give you the shapes and then maybe
that<00:03:42.090> way<00:03:42.210> it'll<00:03:42.360> be<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.540> little<00:03:42.720> bit<00:03:42.900> easier<00:03:43.020> to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
that way it'll be a little bit easier to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:56.790 
that way it'll be a little bit easier to
figure<00:03:43.500> out

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.550 

hey

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
hey

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.320 
hey
so<00:03:59.560> basically<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.129> whole<00:04:00.519> solos<00:04:00.970> kind<00:04:01.239> of

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
so basically the whole solos kind of

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.530 
so basically the whole solos kind of
around<00:04:01.799> that<00:04:02.799> area<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.579> I<00:04:03.939> don't<00:04:04.090> know<00:04:04.209> if<00:04:04.360> I'm

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
around that area and I don't know if I'm

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.920 
around that area and I don't know if I'm
in<00:04:04.689> Gideon<00:04:05.379> or<00:04:05.590> mixolydian<00:04:06.040> or<00:04:06.629> whatever<00:04:07.629> mode

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
in Gideon or mixolydian or whatever mode

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.170 
in Gideon or mixolydian or whatever mode
it<00:04:08.110> is<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.560> know<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:09.340> sounds<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.879> little<00:04:10.060> bit

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
it is you know that sounds a little bit

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.699 
it is you know that sounds a little bit
tricky<00:04:10.540> because<00:04:10.629> live<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.260> goes<00:04:11.409> into<00:04:11.620> that

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
tricky because live it goes into that

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.069 
tricky because live it goes into that
clean<00:04:12.129> break<00:04:12.459> down<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:13.450> instead<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.870> letting

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
clean break down so instead of letting

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.050 
clean break down so instead of letting
that<00:04:14.230> note<00:04:14.439> wring<00:04:14.739> out<00:04:14.890> I'm<00:04:15.190> going<00:04:15.579> directly

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
that note wring out I'm going directly

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.430 
that note wring out I'm going directly
into

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.480 

Oh

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.530 

peace

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.180 

e

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.510 

hmm<00:04:30.670> before<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.390> forget<00:04:31.800> Mick<00:04:32.800> actually<00:04:33.190> starts

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
hmm before I forget Mick actually starts

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.670 
hmm before I forget Mick actually starts
this<00:04:33.700> song<00:04:33.910> but<00:04:34.270> for<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.990> sake<00:04:35.170> of<00:04:35.200> Nick<00:04:35.500> not

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
this song but for the sake of Nick not

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.020 
this song but for the sake of Nick not
being<00:04:35.920> here<00:04:36.070> right<00:04:36.190> now<00:04:36.250> i'll<00:04:36.490> start<00:04:36.790> it<00:04:36.850> just

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
being here right now i'll start it just

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.330 
being here right now i'll start it just
to<00:04:37.090> show<00:04:37.210> you<00:04:37.270> how<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.450> opening<00:04:37.810> riff<00:04:37.930> goes

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
to show you how the opening riff goes

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.610 
to show you how the opening riff goes
drop<00:04:39.340> be<00:04:39.520> tuning<00:04:39.910> once<00:04:40.060> again<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.630> something

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
drop be tuning once again and something

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:50.480 
drop be tuning once again and something
like<00:04:41.710> this

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.550 

and<00:04:51.540> slow<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.810> would<00:04:52.930> be<00:04:53.080> something<00:04:53.410> a

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
and slow that would be something a

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:07.369 
and slow that would be something a
little<00:04:53.650> like<00:04:53.860> this

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.710 

that's<00:05:08.379> all<00:05:08.560> down<00:05:08.740> picking<00:05:09.129> so<00:05:09.849> it<00:05:10.389> would<00:05:10.569> be

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
that's all down picking so it would be

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.290 
that's all down picking so it would be
just<00:05:10.990> you<00:05:11.199> know<00:05:11.729> straight<00:05:12.729> down<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:13.180> then

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
just you know straight down and then

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.210 
just you know straight down and then
you've<00:05:13.509> got<00:05:13.539> a<00:05:13.750> little<00:05:14.199> not<00:05:14.530> really<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.740> gallop

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
you've got a little not really a gallop

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.740 
you've got a little not really a gallop
in<00:05:15.370> it<00:05:15.520> but<00:05:15.639> there's<00:05:15.849> open<00:05:16.180> notes<00:05:16.419> there's

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
in it but there's open notes there's

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.629 
in it but there's open notes there's
open<00:05:17.050> notes<00:05:17.259> in<00:05:17.440> between<00:05:17.470> each<00:05:17.740> pic<00:05:18.220> so<00:05:18.490> it's

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
open notes in between each pic so it's

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:29.270 
open notes in between each pic so it's
like

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:41.640 

you<00:05:30.280> know<00:05:30.430> so<00:05:30.670> that<00:05:30.700> gives<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.090> that

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.530 

and<00:05:42.650> that's<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.400> gist<00:05:43.790> of<00:05:43.910> that<00:05:44.060> song<00:05:44.330> there's

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
and that's the gist of that song there's

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.999 
and that's the gist of that song there's
a<00:05:44.600> little<00:05:44.780> break<00:05:45.020> down<00:05:45.229> in<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.440> middle<00:05:45.530> that

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
a little break down in the middle that

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.150 
a little break down in the middle that
some<00:05:46.340> I<00:05:47.590> suppose<00:05:48.590> you<00:05:48.710> could<00:05:48.830> call<00:05:48.860> it<00:05:49.130> a

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
some I suppose you could call it a

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.620 
some I suppose you could call it a
guitar<00:05:49.280> solo<00:05:49.880> but<00:05:50.030> it's<00:05:50.150> kind<00:05:50.330> of<00:05:50.389> more<00:05:50.570> of

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
guitar solo but it's kind of more of

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.120 
guitar solo but it's kind of more of
them<00:05:50.810> a<00:05:50.870> lot<00:05:51.020> of<00:05:51.050> breakdown<00:05:51.620> and<00:05:51.830> that's<00:05:51.949> just

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
them a lot of breakdown and that's just

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.840 
them a lot of breakdown and that's just
kind<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.430> running<00:05:52.820> along<00:05:53.509> the<00:05:53.889> the<00:05:54.889> fourth<00:05:55.580> B

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
kind of running along the the fourth B

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.719 
kind of running along the the fourth B
string<00:05:56.650> with<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.770> open<00:05:58.190> string<00:05:58.430> underneath

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
string with the open string underneath

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:42.740 
string with the open string underneath
it<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.270> little<00:05:59.870> mulatto<00:06:00.259> ground<00:06:00.590> like

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.090 

you

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.000 

II<00:06:46.130> and<00:06:47.090> that's<00:06:47.690> uh<00:06:47.780> that's<00:06:48.170> how<00:06:48.440> its<00:06:48.710> kind<00:06:48.860> of

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
II and that's uh that's how its kind of

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.380 
II and that's uh that's how its kind of
played<00:06:49.190> in<00:06:49.280> the<00:06:49.340> studio<00:06:49.700> but<00:06:49.880> live<00:06:50.120> I<00:06:50.330> do

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
played in the studio but live I do

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.660 
played in the studio but live I do
something<00:06:50.810> a<00:06:50.870> little<00:06:50.900> bit<00:06:51.080> different<00:06:51.560> why<00:06:52.460> if

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
something a little bit different why if

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.270 
something a little bit different why if
I<00:06:52.820> kind<00:06:53.060> of<00:06:53.120> go
