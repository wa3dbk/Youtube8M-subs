00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.190 

um<00:01:05.650> yeah<00:01:06.610> it<00:01:06.820> was<00:01:07.000> probably<00:01:07.420> stupid<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:08.080> do

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
um yeah it was probably stupid to do

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.690 
um yeah it was probably stupid to do
until<00:01:08.620> I<00:01:08.740> get<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:10.050> blades<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.410> scissors<00:01:11.800> put

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
until I get the blades the scissors put

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.060 
until I get the blades the scissors put
them<00:01:12.910> around<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.600> bell<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.050> like<00:01:14.380> literally

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
them around the bell and like literally

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.160 
them around the bell and like literally
hold<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.880> tight<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:16.810> then<00:01:18.930> what's<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.050> way

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
hold that tight and then what's the way

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.480 
hold that tight and then what's the way
that<00:01:21.040> pull<00:01:21.490> it<00:01:21.610> off<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:24.040> for<00:01:24.340> some<00:01:24.460> reason

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
that pull it off because for some reason

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.130 
that pull it off because for some reason
for<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.030> past<00:01:25.180> couple<00:01:25.300> days<00:01:25.510> it<00:01:25.840> was<00:01:26.110> not

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
for the past couple days it was not

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.940 
for the past couple days it was not
coming<00:01:26.800> off<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:28.060> think<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.140> was<00:01:29.260> a<00:01:29.320> buildup<00:01:29.830> of

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
coming off I think it was a buildup of

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.460 
coming off I think it was a buildup of
some<00:01:30.250> stuff<00:01:30.550> on<00:01:30.760> it<00:01:30.880> but<00:01:31.030> anyway<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.810> finally

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
some stuff on it but anyway I finally

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.680 
some stuff on it but anyway I finally
got<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.680> out<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:33.280> realized<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.480> probably

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
got that out I realized that probably

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.160 
got that out I realized that probably
