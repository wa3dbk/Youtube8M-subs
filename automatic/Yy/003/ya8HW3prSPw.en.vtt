00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.240
 the number of victims does not stop growing 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.640
 already go 932 nigeria the most populous country 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.889
 of the black continent confirmed the second 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.990
 death by infection the bad news 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.240
 they made the heads of 13 states 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 Africans meet in South Africa in 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 look for a solution to this great 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.390
 problem insisted on the need for 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.670
 inform the community about the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.210
 risk of infection especially in 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.210
 burials 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.010
 we have to respect what they want 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.720
 cultures and societies at the same 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.700
 time we have to provide a 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.860
 safe burial for those who are 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.720
 driving the remains for example what 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.700
 we are recommending is that people 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.470
 trained to handle the corpses 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.540
 infected carry out the process of 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.340
 burial while families observe 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.980
 instead of them taking over the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.140
 process the concern has made 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.489
 even South Korea take measures to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.489
 prevent the spread of the virus 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.160
 and we verify subsidiaryly the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.170
 body temperature of passengers 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.180
 but for the people who come from 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.160
 affected regions we require the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.050
 health certificates if someone 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.690
 It presents related symptoms 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.270
 Ebola virus he or she can not get out 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.729
 from the airport to complete the exam 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.040
 physical and if the examination turns out that the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 person can have the virus 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.950
 We will immediately send it to the hospital 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.020
 to be quarantined and a group 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.119
 of expert virologists from the UK- 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 also try to find solutions to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.500
 the epidemic but because the disease 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.479
 it spreads so fast 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.910
 that it seems we really do not know 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.740
 but the virus seems to expand because 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.600
 to fear because people are being 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.300
 moving away from doctors instead of 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.580
 accept advice from doctors the virus 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.520
 It is certainly very strong but also 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.800
 is avoidable if the disease spreads 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.540
 so fast is there any possibility of 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.910
 than a carrier of the virus that 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.830
 example is traveling by plane contagia 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.540
 to the person sitting next to him 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.700
 Ebola is very unlikely 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.190
 infect by contact with the skin of a 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.200
 infected person the virus does not reach the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.500
 skin until the final stages of the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.470
 infection could go outside only 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.950
 if the person is a day or two away from the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.970
 death to that virus likes to live in the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.700
 blood and usually does not come out although the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.280
 virus kills 90% of people at 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.680
 that infects its nature is weak by 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.900
 that needs the bodily fluids or the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.780
 blood a simple wound to enter 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.030
 the organism once inside causes 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.740
 vomiting fever and diarrhea but what 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.620
 kill the infected comes after 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.030
 internal hemorrhages unstoppable bleeding 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.030
 from the mouth and rectum 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.349
