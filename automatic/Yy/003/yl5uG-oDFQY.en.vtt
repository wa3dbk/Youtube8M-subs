coverage<00:03:56.979> it's<00:03:57.639> not<00:03:57.879> the<00:03:58.090> best<00:03:58.479> coverage<00:03:59.169> but

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
coverage it's not the best coverage but

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.599 
coverage it's not the best coverage but
I<00:03:59.500> don't<00:03:59.829> like<00:03:59.949> heavy<00:04:00.250> makeup<00:04:00.549> anyways<00:04:02.609> so

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
I don't like heavy makeup anyways so

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.670 
I don't like heavy makeup anyways so
that's<00:04:03.879> what<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.269> looks<00:04:04.299> like<00:04:04.840> blending<00:04:05.530> and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
that's what it looks like blending and

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.189 
that's what it looks like blending and
this<00:04:05.889> is<00:04:06.069> point<00:04:06.340> five<00:04:06.659> when<00:04:07.659> you<00:04:07.689> first<00:04:07.959> apply

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
this is point five when you first apply

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.099 
this is point five when you first apply
this<00:04:08.319> product<00:04:08.889> on<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.519> finish<00:04:09.819> is<00:04:10.120> pretty

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
this product on the finish is pretty

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.259 
this product on the finish is pretty
shiny<00:04:11.379> it's<00:04:11.919> definitely<00:04:12.430> not<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.639> matte<00:04:12.909> finish

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
shiny it's definitely not a matte finish

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.360 
shiny it's definitely not a matte finish
and<00:04:13.449> it's<00:04:13.629> not<00:04:13.810> really<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.530> satin<00:04:14.949> finish<00:04:15.099> it's

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
and it's not really a satin finish it's

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.800 
and it's not really a satin finish it's
definitely<00:04:15.879> like<00:04:16.030> very<00:04:16.299> shiny

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
definitely like very shiny

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.680 
definitely like very shiny

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.390 
my face and I really don't like it but
for<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.780> good<00:04:35.990> two<00:04:36.290> hours<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.890> looks<00:04:37.070> really

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
for a good two hours it looks really

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.950 
for a good two hours it looks really
nice<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.610> after<00:04:38.030> that<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.360> foundation<00:04:38.810> just

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
nice and after that the foundation just

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.350 
nice and after that the foundation just
starts<00:04:39.260> wearing<00:04:39.650> away<00:04:39.770> it's<00:04:40.490> definitely<00:04:41.150> not

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
starts wearing away it's definitely not

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.270 
starts wearing away it's definitely not
a<00:04:41.420> long-lasting<00:04:41.870> foundation<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:42.920> even

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
a long-lasting foundation and I even

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.790 
a long-lasting foundation and I even
used<00:04:43.550> like<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:44.120> long<00:04:44.420> wearing<00:04:44.780> primer<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.650> it

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
used like a long wearing primer and it

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.760 
used like a long wearing primer and it
just<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:48.470> forgot<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.310> mention<00:04:49.400> so<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:49.790> have<00:04:50.090> more

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770

dry<00:04:51.770> skin<00:04:52.610> it<00:04:52.940> definitely<00:04:53.450> leans<00:04:53.690> way<00:04:54.140> dry<00:04:54.650> so

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
dry skin it definitely leans way dry so

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.440 
dry skin it definitely leans way dry so
I<00:04:57.250> don't<00:04:58.250> know<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.580> just<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:59.030> didn't<00:04:59.330> really

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
work that well for me it worked really

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.010 
work that well for me it worked really
well<00:05:01.040> for<00:05:01.220> a<00:05:01.490> while<00:05:01.700> but<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.630> know<00:05:02.660> for<00:05:02.930> the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
well for a while but you know for the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.660

amount<00:05:03.260> of<00:05:03.380> products<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.860> have<00:05:04.040> to<00:05:04.220> use<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.550> get

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
amount of products I have to use to get

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.960 
amount of products I have to use to get
this<00:05:04.880> one<00:05:05.090> product<00:05:05.510> to<00:05:05.630> work<00:05:05.780> I<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:07.310> don't<00:05:07.760> feel

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
this one product to work I I don't feel

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.550 
this one product to work I I don't feel
that<00:05:08.150> it's<00:05:08.330> necessarily<00:05:08.840> worth<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.410> money

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
that it's necessarily worth the money

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.990 
that it's necessarily worth the money
but<00:05:09.740> if<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:09.980> can<00:05:10.130> get<00:05:10.220> it<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.460> work<00:05:10.610> well<00:05:10.820> on

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
but if you can get it to work well on

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.390 
but if you can get it to work well on
its<00:05:11.180> own<00:05:11.330> then<00:05:11.810> it's<00:05:12.140> a<00:05:12.290> great<00:05:12.620> foundation<00:05:13.010> and

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
its own then it's a great foundation and

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.700 
its own then it's a great foundation and
it<00:05:13.520> matches<00:05:13.760> perfectly<00:05:14.360> so<00:05:14.750> as<00:05:15.080> I<00:05:15.260> said<00:05:15.530> I

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
it matches perfectly so as I said I

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.370 
it matches perfectly so as I said I
repurchase<00:05:16.490> this<00:05:16.730> once<00:05:17.330> so<00:05:17.660> I<00:05:17.690> have<00:05:17.960> two

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
repurchase this once so I have two

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.950 
repurchase this once so I have two
bottles<00:05:19.010> left<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:19.640> I<00:05:19.730> have<00:05:19.910> quite<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.750> lot<00:05:20.930> of

foundation<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:21.680> bottle<00:05:22.330> my<00:05:23.330> last<00:05:23.540> purchase

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
foundation this bottle my last purchase

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.440 
foundation this bottle my last purchase
lasted<00:05:24.560> me<00:05:24.680> probably<00:05:25.100> two<00:05:25.490> months<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.240> used

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
it everyday for working all of that so

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.790 
it everyday for working all of that so
it<00:05:29.240> lasts<00:05:29.660> a<00:05:29.750> long<00:05:29.900> time<00:05:30.200> in<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:30.440> bottle<00:05:30.770> just

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
it lasts a long time in the bottle just

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.430 
it lasts a long time in the bottle just
now<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:32.150> it's<00:05:32.300> a<00:05:32.390> little<00:05:32.540> bit<00:05:32.660> older<00:05:33.200> and

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
now that it's a little bit older and

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.460 
now that it's a little bit older and
like<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.920> said<00:05:33.980> did<00:05:34.370> oxidize<00:05:34.880> a<00:05:34.910> little<00:05:35.270> bit<00:05:35.470> but

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
like I said did oxidize a little bit but

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.290 
like I said did oxidize a little bit but
you<00:05:36.770> know<00:05:36.800> that's<00:05:37.130> true<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.700> almost<00:05:37.910> every

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
you know that's true of almost every

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.540 
you know that's true of almost every
foundation<00:05:38.630> if<00:05:38.930> you<00:05:39.080> let<00:05:39.350> it<00:05:39.500> say<00:05:40.310> it<00:05:40.370> in<00:05:40.460> the

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
foundation if you let it say it in the

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.700 
foundation if you let it say it in the
bottle<00:05:40.820> too<00:05:41.000> long<00:05:41.300> so<00:05:41.720> that's<00:05:42.230> actually

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
bottle too long so that's actually

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.130 
bottle too long so that's actually
pretty<00:05:42.860> good<00:05:42.980> and<00:05:43.280> it's<00:05:43.430> a<00:05:43.730> good<00:05:44.360> amount<00:05:44.990> of

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
a third time and that's just because I

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.520

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.159 
and I believe that all urban decay
products<00:06:31.940> are<00:06:34.180> not<00:06:35.180> tested<00:06:35.720> on<00:06:35.810> animals

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.569 
I'll have the box anymore but I'm pretty
sure<00:06:40.969> that<00:06:41.149> urban<00:06:41.929> decay<00:06:42.169> is<00:06:42.229> an<00:06:42.579> animal-free

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:43.579
