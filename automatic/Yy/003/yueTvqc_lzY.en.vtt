take us through that honestly I didn't

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.130

saw<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> work<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.539> when<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.930> did

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
saw the work going on it but when I did

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.980 
saw the work going on it but when I did
when<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.650> hear<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> crowd<00:01:05.580> screaming<00:01:05.990> then

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
when I hear the crowd screaming then

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.600 
when I hear the crowd screaming then
it's<00:01:07.619> easy<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.070> guess<00:01:08.460> will<00:01:08.610> happen

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
it's easy to guess will happen

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.480 
it's easy to guess will happen
so<00:01:10.230> it<00:01:11.230> was<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> good<00:01:11.560> go<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:11.980> was<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.100> good<00:01:12.280> go<00:01:12.460> for

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
so it was a good go it was a good go for

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.610 
so it was a good go it was a good go for
me<00:01:12.850> it's<00:01:13.030> like<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.720> boys<00:01:13.870> in<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.200> net

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
me it's like the boys in the net

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.860 
me it's like the boys in the net
it<00:01:15.190> doesn't<00:01:15.460> matter<00:01:15.550> if<00:01:15.730> it's<00:01:15.940> overhead<00:01:16.660> kick

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
it doesn't matter if it's overhead kick

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.950 
it doesn't matter if it's overhead kick
or<00:01:17.170> just<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.130> tapping<00:01:18.430> go<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.760> go<00:01:19.000> we<00:01:19.630> worried

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
or just a tapping go to go we worried

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.110 
or just a tapping go to go we worried
that<00:01:20.140> after<00:01:21.010> everything<00:01:21.250> last<00:01:21.550> week<00:01:21.760> again

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
that after everything last week again

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.700 
that after everything last week again
you're<00:01:22.420> gonna<00:01:22.570> throw<00:01:23.020> away<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.230> two<00:01:23.470> goal<00:01:23.650> lead

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
you're gonna throw away a two goal lead

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.000 
you're gonna throw away a two goal lead
for<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.220> second<00:01:24.550> week<00:01:24.670> running<00:01:25.620> this<00:01:26.620> was
