00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:05.859 
Med 25 template that I created and that

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.250 
Med 25 template that I created and that

like will be in the description and once
you<00:00:08.350> have<00:00:08.440> it<00:00:08.560> downloaded<00:00:08.710> this<00:00:09.280> is<00:00:09.460> what

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:09.640 
you have it downloaded this is what

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.160 
you have it downloaded this is what
you're<00:00:09.730> going<00:00:09.850> to<00:00:09.910> get<00:00:10.060> this<00:00:10.390> is<00:00:10.540> the<00:00:10.780> template

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
you're going to get this is the template

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.160 
you're going to get this is the template
I<00:00:11.380> have<00:00:11.620> open<00:00:11.860> right<00:00:11.980> now<00:00:12.010> and<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:13.570> is<00:00:13.630> scale

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
I have open right now and this is scale

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.140 
I have open right now and this is scale
to<00:00:14.350> print<00:00:14.590> size<00:00:14.770> so<00:00:15.490> this<00:00:15.580> is<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:15.790> maximum

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
to print size so this is the maximum

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.390 
to print size so this is the maximum
size<00:00:16.330> discover<00:00:16.720> can<00:00:16.900> go<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:18.160> strange

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
size discover can go it's strange

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.880 
size discover can go it's strange
resolution<00:00:19.090> so<00:00:19.360> the<00:00:19.720> print<00:00:20.410> quality<00:00:20.500> will<00:00:20.860> be

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
resolution so the print quality will be

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.910 
resolution so the print quality will be
good<00:00:21.210> but<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:22.450> thing<00:00:22.630> is<00:00:22.660> with<00:00:22.930> this<00:00:23.110> is<00:00:23.470> since

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
good but the thing is with this is since

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.990 
good but the thing is with this is since
it's<00:00:24.070> so<00:00:24.190> large<00:00:24.369> you're<00:00:24.670> going<00:00:24.789> to<00:00:24.850> need<00:00:24.970> a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
it's so large you're going to need a

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.420 
it's so large you're going to need a
really<00:00:25.300> good<00:00:25.390> quality<00:00:25.869> picture<00:00:26.199> of<00:00:26.949> your

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
really good quality picture of your

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.330 
really good quality picture of your
player<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.930> just<00:00:29.230> for<00:00:29.350> example<00:00:29.740> here<00:00:29.890> like

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
player so just for example here like

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.660 
player so just for example here like
this<00:00:30.550> calvin<00:00:30.940> johnson<00:00:31.360> as<00:00:31.589> you<00:00:32.589> can<00:00:32.739> seize<00:00:32.890> 21

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
this calvin johnson as you can seize 21

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.829 
this calvin johnson as you can seize 21
27<00:00:34.089> x<00:00:34.329> 36<00:00:34.809> 16<00:00:35.199> and<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:37.030> i<00:00:37.089> were<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.300> drag<00:00:37.510> this<00:00:37.690> in

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
27 x 36 16 and if i were to drag this in

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.540 
27 x 36 16 and if i were to drag this in
here<00:00:38.079> it<00:00:38.589> fits<00:00:39.519> decently<00:00:39.940> well<00:00:40.289> so<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:42.370> is

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
here it fits decently well so this is

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.930 
here it fits decently well so this is
anything<00:00:42.999> around<00:00:43.839> the<00:00:44.379> 2,000<00:00:45.010> 3,000<00:00:45.550> pixels

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
anything around the 2,000 3,000 pixels

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.059 
anything around the 2,000 3,000 pixels
that<00:00:46.210> should<00:00:47.079> be<00:00:47.199> fine<00:00:47.319> for<00:00:47.379> this<00:00:47.649> cover<00:00:47.859> and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.069 
that should be fine for this cover and

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:49.559 
that should be fine for this cover and
you<00:00:48.609> should<00:00:48.789> be<00:00:48.819> able<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:49.059> print<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:49.359> out<00:00:49.420> in

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:49.569 
you should be able to print it out in

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:52.229 
you should be able to print it out in
good<00:00:49.809> quality<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:51.579> if<00:00:51.789> you're<00:00:51.909> not<00:00:51.999> going<00:00:52.179> to

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
good quality now if you're not going to

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.520 
good quality now if you're not going to
print<00:00:52.449> it<00:00:52.539> put<00:00:52.809> it<00:00:52.870> in<00:00:52.929> your<00:00:53.019> case<00:00:53.199> you're<00:00:53.499> just

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
print it put it in your case you're just

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.989 
print it put it in your case you're just
going<00:00:53.769> to<00:00:53.829> use<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.069> for<00:00:54.100> online<00:00:54.579> digital

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
going to use it for online digital

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.450 
going to use it for online digital
websites<00:00:55.569> whatever<00:00:55.870> you<00:00:56.739> can<00:00:56.949> scale<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.309> down

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
websites whatever you can scale it down

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.279 
websites whatever you can scale it down
there's<00:00:58.149> no<00:00:58.299> need<00:00:58.449> to<00:00:58.510> have<00:00:58.719> it<00:00:58.839> this<00:00:58.989> big

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
there's no need to have it this big

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.529 
there's no need to have it this big
because<00:00:59.649> that'll<00:01:00.010> blow<00:01:00.609> up<00:01:00.789> any<00:01:01.030> webpage<00:01:01.239> you

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
because that'll blow up any webpage you

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.959 
because that'll blow up any webpage you
put<00:01:01.719> you<00:01:01.929> paste<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.289> on<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.489> what<00:01:03.760> I<00:01:03.789> usually

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
put you paste that on so what I usually

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.120 
put you paste that on so what I usually
do<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.479> from<00:01:05.019> my<00:01:05.110> videos<00:01:05.439> I<00:01:05.560> scale<00:01:05.979> it<00:01:06.009> down

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
do is I from my videos I scale it down

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.420 
do is I from my videos I scale it down
to<00:01:06.399> about<00:01:06.430> fifteen<00:01:07.210> hundred<00:01:07.270> pixels<00:01:07.719> and<00:01:08.430> even

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
to about fifteen hundred pixels and even

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.469 
to about fifteen hundred pixels and even
that's<00:01:09.640> pretty<00:01:10.270> big<00:01:10.539> I<00:01:10.750> mean<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:13.240> way<00:01:13.420> you

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
that's pretty big I mean this way you

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.719 
that's pretty big I mean this way you
can<00:01:13.570> fit<00:01:13.899> smaller<00:01:14.289> pictures<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:15.430> as<00:01:15.549> you<00:01:15.640> can

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
can fit smaller pictures so as you can

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.099 
can fit smaller pictures so as you can
see<00:01:15.850> this<00:01:15.939> julio<00:01:16.180> jones<00:01:16.270> is<00:01:16.600> pretty<00:01:16.840> small

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
see this julio jones is pretty small

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.130 
see this julio jones is pretty small
it's<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.560> small<00:01:17.920> picture<00:01:18.159> and<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.840> can<00:01:19.960> fit

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
it's a small picture and you can fit

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.420 
it's a small picture and you can fit
that<00:01:20.259> in<00:01:20.380> pretty<00:01:20.619> well<00:01:20.799> they're<00:01:21.039> all<00:01:21.189> right

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
that in pretty well they're all right

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.740 
that in pretty well they're all right
even<00:01:21.609> that's<00:01:21.850> actually<00:01:22.149> smell<00:01:22.329> for<00:01:22.509> this<00:01:22.600> one

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
even that's actually smell for this one

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.050 
even that's actually smell for this one
actually<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:24.100> yeah<00:01:24.250> anyway<00:01:24.549> anywhere

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
actually but yeah anyway anywhere

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.510 
actually but yeah anyway anywhere
between<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.570> like<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:26.109> 1200<00:01:26.649> pixel<00:01:26.979> 2000

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
between the like the 1200 pixel 2000

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.450 
between the like the 1200 pixel 2000
pixel<00:01:27.820> mark<00:01:28.000> should<00:01:28.240> be<00:01:28.359> good<00:01:28.570> for<00:01:28.780> this<00:01:28.869> size

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
pixel mark should be good for this size

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.520 
pixel mark should be good for this size
but<00:01:30.460> like<00:01:31.119> for<00:01:31.750> example<00:01:31.810> if<00:01:32.140> i<00:01:32.259> were<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.439> want

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
but like for example if i were to want

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.169 
but like for example if i were to want
to<00:01:32.649> if<00:01:32.679> i<00:01:32.920> wanted<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.250> use<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.490> Kaleo<00:01:33.759> Jones<00:01:34.000> I'd

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
to if i wanted to use I Kaleo Jones I'd

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.880 
to if i wanted to use I Kaleo Jones I'd
probably<00:01:34.390> scale<00:01:34.719> it<00:01:34.840> down<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:35.109> it<00:01:35.170> was<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.409> 700

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
probably scale it down to it was to 700

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.980 
probably scale it down to it was to 700
pixels<00:01:36.039> and<00:01:36.579> that's<00:01:37.030> definitely<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.600> minimum

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
pixels and that's definitely the minimum

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.330 
pixels and that's definitely the minimum
of<00:01:38.109> scaled<00:01:38.350> down<00:01:38.439> to<00:01:38.560> otherwise<00:01:39.070> it's<00:01:39.250> going

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340
