00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.460
 opera 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.400
 Almost this time 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:29.640
 This Christmas is not much left to simply beaten the Christmas season 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.099
 We will try to be art once the sticker before using the entire pool 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.880
 Knife with coat 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.880
 Please apply. 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:46.970
 So at this time, this color is winter, as the season is winter. 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:49.760
 You can make a better presentation by applying the color of feeling 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:56.090
 Who gives all the colors I apply twice 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:01:01.870
 He bit the Walker Barr then please apply again after a bit Court 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.870
 You can express the color of the original color well 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.640
 The sticker shown 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:18.760
 You can cut your nails and use them for free . 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:21.700
 3 When you use it, you have to go to the bottom of the glass or cut it in the plate. 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.110
 There is no bottom. 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:31.290
 Now that I received the gray color in the super- wave window, 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.290
 Let's put the design in red. 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:44.750
 At this time, it is difficult to remove the sticker once attached, 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:49.220
 The most important thing is to catch and attach it at once 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.420
 I would like to use the Nordic pattern once it is supposed to be typed in this month. 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.650
 I'm calling. 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:59.750
 Drawing by hand is a very difficult design, but this sticker 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.350
 If you use it very comfortably, simply nail a beautiful design alone 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.350
 I can upload it. 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:28.270
 Now a deer is finished. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.270
 If you put up one snowflake at a point 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.400
 Without difficulty 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.400
 Beautiful design has been completed 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:45.700
 If you do all ten fingers, you might look a bit uncomfortable 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:49.980
 Point and you can put different designs on each finger. 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.980
 We can do it, but we can do it in Iraq. 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:04.920
 This is the last time you're wearing a top coat. 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:08.239
 Do not press the coat a lot and do as thinly as possible. 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.239
 It's a trick to paint. 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:21.850
 Thank you. 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.320
