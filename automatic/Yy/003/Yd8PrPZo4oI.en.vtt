00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.960
 in artificial ones in ports the use of Bolognese with the 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.959
 float is the most suitable for fishing says 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.569
 on this occasion marco uses a 6 7 meter rod 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:29.689
 the choice of length depends on the depth of the area where you are fishing 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.860
 fishing closer 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.610
 from the rocks 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 we have less current because I am absent

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.600
 la tortilla 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.000
 it is the best and most linear system 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.100
 and makes the line work optimally 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.880
 it deals with 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.100
 it is pollen in particular they are not i 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.340
 usual dots 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.410
 that have been around for a long time

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.800
 the lead shot 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.729
 Euroleague 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.660
 there is practically lead 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.950
 and others and other materials 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.670
 that make the cue 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.120
 rather soft 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.169
 in addition 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.459
 it is painted as a special paint 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.429
 this allows us 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:15.659
 to put them on the line 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.609
 springery 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.329
 since we want to move them 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.899
 the ball 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.119
 it moves easily 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:25.459
 as you see 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.239
 rh 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.159
 no rent damage 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.620
 now the dots used by our sample are at the forefront use it 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.819
 extreme utility allows moving along the terminal 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.819
 without hurting ever known 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.259
 now we realize 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.259
 the end 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.509
 let's go to a twelve, face 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.939
 transfer only one cable 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.799
 the thread o 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.799
 invisible I will be able to conceive it 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.529
 is 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.699
 resistant also to 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.699
 fish palaces 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.829
 for the realization of the terminal 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.150
 marco uses a piece of mono nylon thread of ten to ten of about 120 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.189
 centimeters at the ends of which binds two years of the 14th we have medium-long 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.239
 then pair 2 years leaving about 10 centimeters between one and the other 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.809
 on the opposite side it finally creates a slot that will set another web through a 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.809
 knot of wolf's mouth 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.499
 we have two in the sun 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.979
 let's put his of the ending 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.879
 inside your of the beam 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.859
 slaved 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.949
 the two endings 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.949
 and let's have friends inside the room 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.409
 in this way we realize 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.509
 a node called 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.819
 at the wolf's mouth 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.449
 that we will finish 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.819
 ecosystem 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.409
 allows us 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.889
 if we tear 2 finals or we want bills 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.240
 for choices deriving from fishing 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.979
 to replace them 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.050
 in a very short time 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.360
 the mullet is a fish that is very well in posture 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.419
 and for this we must make the bait work 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.809
 bau 20 30 centimeters above the posture 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:52.809
 this being from catalina on the bottom 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.360
 for police ray our baits in that area is finished 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.680
 we use 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.900
 a lead 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.009
 which is called orson 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.319
 here I call it on the hook + flight 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.909
 longer than an arm, 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.069
 so you can calibrate float 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.550
 height. 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.789
 fund probing operations require a lot of patience 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.059
 the number of final catches is also determined by the perfect 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:28.080
 location of the air where the fish concentrate attracted by the posture 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.599
 this case for example 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.599
 we will spend 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.409
 low to pass a little photo 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.909
 shuttle 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.169
 to get work done 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.020
 Ranking 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.020
 23% 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.400
 just simone 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.430
 respective boxers 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.319
 cut out friends 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.559
 goal of 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.559
 we will certainly appreciate - missing 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.479
 with probe 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.430
 mail courier 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.659
 and we are ready for the shopping
