00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.130 

the<00:00:01.920> meaning<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.610> that<00:00:02.669> that<00:00:03.300> air<00:00:03.659> will<00:00:03.899> go

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
the meaning is that that air will go

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.000 
the meaning is that that air will go
through<00:00:04.470> it<00:00:04.560> rather<00:00:04.859> smoothly<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.910> this

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
through it rather smoothly and this

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.370 
through it rather smoothly and this
aluminium<00:00:08.010> mass<00:00:08.280> will<00:00:09.150> accumulate<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.170> heat

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
aluminium mass will accumulate the heat

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.370 
aluminium mass will accumulate the heat
and<00:00:11.250> when<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.610> burning<00:00:12.269> then<00:00:12.900> there<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.230> an

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
and when it's burning then there is an

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.010 
and when it's burning then there is an
air<00:00:13.530> flow<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.070> an<00:00:14.250> other<00:00:14.610> direction<00:00:15.210> which

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
air flow in an other direction which

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.279 
air flow in an other direction which
will<00:00:16.350> then<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.730> its<00:00:17.910> turn<00:00:18.289> accumulate

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
will then in in in its turn accumulate

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.840 
will then in in in its turn accumulate
the<00:00:19.439> heat<00:00:19.680> which<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.100> charged<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
the heat which is charged in the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.840 
the heat which is charged in the
aluminum<00:00:21.390> now<00:00:22.050> there's<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.500> shaft<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.460> put

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
aluminum now there's a shaft that is put

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.660 
aluminum now there's a shaft that is put
over<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.539> there's<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.170> small<00:00:25.289> extra<00:00:26.130> motor<00:00:26.430> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
over here there's a small extra motor of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.599 
over here there's a small extra motor of
five<00:00:26.970> watts<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.510> will<00:00:28.080> rotate<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.070> then

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
five watts that will rotate it and then

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.569 
five watts that will rotate it and then
it<00:00:29.730> will<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.090> put<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.920> cassette<00:00:31.920> which

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
it will be put into a cassette which

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.810 
it will be put into a cassette which
also<00:00:32.850> has<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.020> seal<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.340> divided

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
also has the seal so that it is divided

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.710 
also has the seal so that it is divided
into<00:00:36.180> two<00:00:36.390> different<00:00:37.020> parts

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.350 

this<00:00:45.720> is<00:00:45.990> for<00:00:46.290> a<00:00:46.320> relatively<00:00:47.040> high<00:00:47.430> airflow<00:00:47.850> if

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
this is for a relatively high airflow if

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.710 
this is for a relatively high airflow if
I<00:00:48.570> were<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.990> do<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> very<00:00:51.390> small

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
I were to do this for a very small

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.400 
I were to do this for a very small
apartment<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.500> studio<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.970> would<00:00:54.660> reduce<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
apartment the studio I would reduce the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.250 
apartment the studio I would reduce the
height<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:57.629> increase<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:04.140> I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
height of the way and increase and I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.670 
height of the way and increase and I
would<00:01:04.500> go<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.040> higher<00:01:05.400> efficiency<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
would go for a higher efficiency and

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.230 
would go for a higher efficiency and
recover<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.740> house<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.340> four<00:01:11.550> bedrooms<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
recover in a house or four bedrooms I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.570 
recover in a house or four bedrooms I
would<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.840> same<00:01:12.869> thing<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.369> would

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
would do the same thing then we would

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
would do the same thing then we would
use<00:01:14.820> more<00:01:15.509> electricity<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.440> ventilation

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
use more electricity for the ventilation

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.590 
use more electricity for the ventilation
fan<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.710> why<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.330> find

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
fan so that's why you you have to find

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.830 
fan so that's why you you have to find
the<00:01:21.840> optimum<00:01:22.619> point<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> heat<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> heat

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the optimum point so heat but a heat

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
the optimum point so heat but a heat
recovery<00:01:25.140> maximum<00:01:25.740> heat<00:01:25.920> recovery<00:01:26.369> would<00:01:26.520> be

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
recovery maximum heat recovery would be

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.180 
recovery maximum heat recovery would be
expanding<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> size<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.600> wheel<00:01:28.190> yes<00:01:29.190> but

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
expanding the size of the wheel yes but

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.060 
expanding the size of the wheel yes but
you<00:01:32.190> have<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.360> face<00:01:33.899> velocity<00:01:34.710> across

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
you have to have a face velocity across

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.460 
you have to have a face velocity across
over<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.790> which<00:01:36.030> goes<00:01:36.660> over<00:01:36.899> a<00:01:37.170> certain

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
over here which goes over a certain

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.990 
over here which goes over a certain
threshold<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.780> recovery

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
threshold so that the recovery

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.560 
threshold so that the recovery
efficiency<00:01:42.000> goes<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.570> then

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
efficiency goes up like this and then

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.010 
efficiency goes up like this and then
slowly<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.350> down<00:01:46.830> but<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.810> too

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
slowly go down but if you have too

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.109 
slowly go down but if you have too
little<00:01:49.290> air<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.369> through<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.640> big<00:01:50.880> wheel

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
little air or going through a big wheel

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.270 
little air or going through a big wheel
you<00:01:51.900> are<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.560> optimal<00:01:53.010> efficiency<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> so

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
you are not at optimal efficiency so so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.050 
you are not at optimal efficiency so so
if<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:58.080> don't<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.740> enough<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.460> we're<00:01:59.700> going

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
if you don't have enough or we're going

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.330 
if you don't have enough or we're going
over<00:02:00.210> there<00:02:00.510> you<00:02:00.720> are<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.340> optimal

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
over there you are not that optimal

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
over there you are not that optimal
efficiency<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.479> increase<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
efficiency if you increase the to the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.880 
efficiency if you increase the to the
tightness<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.310> later<00:02:05.580> as<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.530> speed<00:02:07.860> of

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.390 

before<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.080> have<00:02:17.349> an<00:02:17.530> extra<00:02:17.950> pair<00:02:17.980> that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
before this I have an extra pair that

before this I have an extra pair that
technology<00:02:19.120> probably<00:02:19.659> know<00:02:20.170> more<00:02:20.409> about<00:02:20.470> that
