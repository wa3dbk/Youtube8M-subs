I've done something that I do
intentionally<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.500> break<00:00:59.719> the<00:01:00.719> single<00:01:01.320> station

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
intentionally I break the single station

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.280 
intentionally I break the single station
point<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> want<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.660> free<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
Renaissance painting in the video you

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.800 
Renaissance painting in the video you
give<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> feature<00:01:14.939> not<00:01:15.090> supposed<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> do

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
give you a feature not supposed to do

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.289 
give you a feature not supposed to do
that<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.500> point<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that you're in one point you see but the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.039 
that you're in one point you see but the
orthogonals<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:21.479> all

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
orthogonals here will not be that's all

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.770 
orthogonals here will not be that's all
of<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:22.320> diagonals<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> board<00:01:23.509> will<00:01:24.509> not

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
of these diagonals of the board will not

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
of these diagonals of the board will not
meet<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.259> point<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.890> they're<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.700> meant<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
meet at a point and they're not meant to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.480 
meet at a point and they're not meant to
meet<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> point<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:28.829> open<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
meet at a point so they open up the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.830 
meet at a point so they open up the
space<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.369> give<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.780> terms

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
space and I think they give you in terms

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.730 
space and I think they give you in terms
of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> drawing<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.990> perhaps<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.170> more<00:01:37.380> acute

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
of the drawing a perhaps a more acute

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.950 
of the drawing a perhaps a more acute
sense<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.310> space<00:01:38.640> than<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.150> would<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> if

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
sense of space than one would have it if

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.179 
sense of space than one would have it if
you<00:01:40.049> wouldn't<00:01:40.170> had<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> perspective<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you wouldn't had a perspective of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.800 
you wouldn't had a perspective of
checkerboard<00:01:42.500> Aikens<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.740> laid<00:01:44.009> out<00:01:44.040> space

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
checkerboard Aikens like laid out space

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.170 
checkerboard Aikens like laid out space
the<00:01:45.810> sense<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.200> space<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.890> actual<00:01:47.430> tangible

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the sense of space of actual tangible

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.160 
the sense of space of actual tangible
sensation<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> space<00:01:50.750> then<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.899> had<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
sensation of space then you had the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.620 
sensation of space then you had the
color<00:01:52.380> aspect<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> working<00:01:53.909> too<00:01:54.270> because

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
color aspect of it working too because

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.679 
color aspect of it working too because
this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.259> observed<00:01:55.890> color<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.540> might

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
this is all observed color and you might

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.090 
this is all observed color and you might
say<00:01:57.719> there's<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.200> difference<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.680> point<00:01:58.979> of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
say there's a difference in point of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.130 
say there's a difference in point of
view<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.670> between<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.329> i<00:02:00.750> would<00:02:00.960> say

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
view here between this and i would say

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.200 
view here between this and i would say
classical<00:02:03.110> painting<00:02:04.579> which<00:02:05.579> starts<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.090> the

classical painting which starts with the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
the whole big idea and you would say oh

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.890 
the whole big idea and you would say oh
you<00:03:07.280> mean<00:03:07.579> you<00:03:07.730> don't<00:03:07.879> have<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.329> whole<00:03:08.569> idea

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
you mean you don't have the whole idea

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.080 
you mean you don't have the whole idea
at<00:03:09.439> hand<00:03:09.769> from<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.099> very<00:03:10.310> start<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
at hand from the very start and the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.430 
at hand from the very start and the
answer<00:03:11.419> is<00:03:11.480> no<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:11.840> don't<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.769> don't<00:03:12.799> think

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
answer is no you don't and I don't think

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.349 
answer is no you don't and I don't think
artists<00:03:15.440> do<00:03:15.949> for<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> most<00:03:16.579> part<00:03:16.849> you<00:03:17.150> are

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
artists do for the most part you are

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.949 
artists do for the most part you are
working<00:03:18.319> like<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.280> tennis<00:03:19.609> player<00:03:19.879> with<00:03:20.359> or<00:03:20.900> a

juggler with balls in the air so many

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.539 
juggler with balls in the air so many
different<00:03:23.599> things<00:03:24.139> going<00:03:24.409> on<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.190> they<00:03:25.370> are

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
different things going on and they are

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.270 
different things going on and they are
put<00:03:25.819> together<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.629> end<00:03:26.840> not<00:03:27.560> conceptually

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
put together in the end not conceptually

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.689 
put together in the end not conceptually
as<00:03:28.909> an<00:03:29.090> idea<00:03:29.569> a<00:03:29.629> set<00:03:30.079> of<00:03:30.169> ideas<00:03:30.650> not<00:03:31.430> as<00:03:31.669> a

as an idea a set of ideas not as a

as an idea a set of ideas not as a
verbalize<00:03:32.449> statement<00:03:33.199> but<00:03:33.500> as<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.739> painting

and<00:03:34.639> finishing<00:03:35.449> a<00:03:35.810> painting<00:03:36.109> is<00:03:36.470> like<00:03:37.150> it's

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
and finishing a painting is like it's

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.819 
and finishing a painting is like it's
like<00:03:38.419> a<00:03:38.449> work<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.900> dance<00:03:39.199> it's<00:03:39.470> a<00:03:39.560> case<00:03:39.799> of

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
like a work of dance it's a case of

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.949 
like a work of dance it's a case of
balance<00:03:41.019> what<00:03:42.019> happened<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.590> here<00:03:42.620> is<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:44.720> I

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
balance what happened in here is that I

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.589 
balance what happened in here is that I
had<00:03:45.349> all<00:03:45.680> summer<00:03:46.129> long<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.940> anetta<00:03:47.389> you

the<00:03:59.329> studio<00:03:59.750> setting<00:04:00.109> here<00:04:00.409> because<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.859> all

of the grays and the Browns I needed

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.499 
of the grays and the Browns I needed
something<00:04:03.889> really<00:04:04.400> jarring<00:04:04.790> something<00:04:05.389> that

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:05.509 
something really jarring something that

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.990 
something really jarring something that
was<00:04:05.659> just<00:04:05.870> powerful<00:04:06.500> but<00:04:07.250> when<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:07.609> came<00:04:07.819> to

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
was just powerful but when it came to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.860 
was just powerful but when it came to
the<00:04:08.120> painting<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.720> had<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.709> drawn<00:04:10.099> in<00:04:10.370> here<00:04:10.870> first

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
the painting I had a drawn in here first

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.719 
the painting I had a drawn in here first
I<00:04:12.019> thought<00:04:12.259> it<00:04:12.319> was<00:04:12.439> too<00:04:12.739> big<00:04:13.009> and<00:04:13.280> i<00:04:13.489> took<00:04:13.699> a

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:13.729 
I thought it was too big and i took a

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.729 
I thought it was too big and i took a
razor<00:04:13.970> blade<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.359> i<00:04:14.599> trimmed<00:04:15.049> off<00:04:15.169> some<00:04:15.409> paint

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
razor blade and i trimmed off some paint

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.159 
razor blade and i trimmed off some paint
and<00:04:16.430> made<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.150> smaller<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.659> then<00:04:17.840> i<00:04:17.930> saw<00:04:18.139> know

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
and made it smaller and then i saw know

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.370 
and made it smaller and then i saw know
it<00:04:18.440> all<00:04:18.769> had<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.039> go

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
it all had to go

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.490 
it all had to go
out<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.620> was<00:04:19.739> too<00:04:19.980> intense<00:04:20.400> for<00:04:20.550> the<00:04:20.760> painting

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
out it was too intense for the painting

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.300 
out it was too intense for the painting
and<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.680> didn't<00:04:22.920> belong<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.760> went<00:04:23.940> out<00:04:24.150> and

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
and it didn't belong so it went out and

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.490 
and it didn't belong so it went out and
over<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.430> last<00:04:26.700> week<00:04:27.660> or<00:04:27.810> 2<00:04:28.050> i've<00:04:28.290> been

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
over the last week or 2 i've been

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.290 
over the last week or 2 i've been
working<00:04:28.860> with<00:04:28.890> chalk<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.490> charcoal<00:04:29.910> making

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
working with chalk and charcoal making

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300 
working with chalk and charcoal making
little<00:04:30.510> adjustments<00:04:30.900> which<00:04:31.740> have<00:04:31.890> just<00:04:32.130> been

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
little adjustments which have just been

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.000 
little adjustments which have just been
carried<00:04:32.700> out<00:04:32.850> in<00:04:33.060> pain<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.600> had<00:04:34.560> this<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.770> little

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
carried out in pain I had this a little

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.740 
carried out in pain I had this a little
too<00:04:35.130> dark<00:04:35.550> in<00:04:35.910> here<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.510> was<00:04:37.050> too<00:04:37.260> powerful<00:04:37.560> a

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
too dark in here it was too powerful a

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.570 
too dark in here it was too powerful a
contrast<00:04:40.250> it's<00:04:41.250> like<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.550> an<00:04:42.950> extra<00:04:43.950> ultra<00:04:44.370> Shaw

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
contrast it's like a an extra ultra Shaw

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.610 
contrast it's like a an extra ultra Shaw
beat<00:04:45.270> or<00:04:45.510> something<00:04:45.900> that<00:04:46.050> had<00:04:46.200> to<00:04:46.230> come<00:04:46.590> out

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
beat or something that had to come out

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.060 
beat or something that had to come out
so<00:04:47.160> i<00:04:47.190> lightened<00:04:47.700> a<00:04:47.820> little<00:04:48.090> in<00:04:48.510> here<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.680> had<00:04:50.040> a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
so i lightened a little in here I had a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.160 
so i lightened a little in here I had a
little<00:04:50.400> static<00:04:51.000> in<00:04:51.150> here<00:04:51.450> it<00:04:51.540> was<00:04:51.660> light<00:04:51.930> in

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
little static in here it was light in

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.800 
little static in here it was light in
there<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:53.040> speed<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.790> orthogonal<00:04:54.330> in

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
there the speed of the orthogonal in

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.860 
there the speed of the orthogonal in
here<00:04:55.230> how<00:04:55.740> strong<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.520> was<00:04:56.550> again<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.450> like<00:04:57.840> a

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
here how strong it was again it like a

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.900 
here how strong it was again it like a
case<00:04:58.170> of<00:04:58.200> balance<00:04:58.800> so<00:04:58.890> that<00:04:58.920> was<00:04:59.280> strengthened

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
case of balance so that was strengthened

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.450 
case of balance so that was strengthened
over<00:05:00.120> in<00:05:00.990> here<00:05:01.320> I<00:05:01.350> had<00:05:01.620> particular<00:05:01.980> set<00:05:02.430> of

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
over in here I had particular set of

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.330 
over in here I had particular set of
problems<00:05:02.850> because<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:04.650> light<00:05:04.860> is<00:05:04.890> coming

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
problems because the light is coming

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.060 
problems because the light is coming
from<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.730> left<00:05:05.960> from<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.020> window<00:05:07.380> in<00:05:07.560> here<00:05:07.890> and

from the left from a window in here and

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.010 
from the left from a window in here and
this<00:05:08.160> is<00:05:08.340> all<00:05:08.580> more<00:05:09.000> or<00:05:09.030> less<00:05:09.240> an<00:05:09.420> obscurity

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
this is all more or less an obscurity

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.960 
this is all more or less an obscurity
these<00:05:10.290> are<00:05:10.470> actually<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:11.250> stools<00:05:13.190> Tom<00:05:14.190> Peavy's

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
things of that sort in there which are

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.010 
things of that sort in there which are
not<00:05:17.310> brought<00:05:17.640> out<00:05:17.910> thinking<00:05:18.570> they're<00:05:18.750> in<00:05:18.870> the

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.190 
not brought out thinking they're in the
shadow<00:05:19.320> but<00:05:19.890> I<00:05:19.920> had<00:05:20.130> too<00:05:20.340> much<00:05:20.490> shadow<00:05:21.050> so<00:05:22.050> that

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
shadow but I had too much shadow so that

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.740 
shadow but I had too much shadow so that
you<00:05:22.290> didn't<00:05:22.590> read<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.950> space<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.670> I<00:05:24.450> felt

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
you didn't read the space and I felt

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.960 
you didn't read the space and I felt
that<00:05:24.840> you<00:05:25.050> fell<00:05:25.770> off<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:26.400> i<00:05:26.460> had<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.730> work<00:05:26.940> with

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
that you fell off and i had to work with

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.110 
that you fell off and i had to work with
it<00:05:27.270> back<00:05:27.480> and<00:05:27.690> forth<00:05:27.960> work<00:05:28.230> with<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.850> too<00:05:29.850> how

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
it back and forth work with it too how

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.950 
it back and forth work with it too how
exactly<00:05:30.840> how<00:05:31.050> strong<00:05:31.470> this<00:05:31.710> was<00:05:31.920> to<00:05:32.130> be<00:05:32.160> or<00:05:32.490> not

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
exactly how strong this was to be or not

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.080 
exactly how strong this was to be or not
small<00:05:33.960> touches<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:34.800> in<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.490> crucifix

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
small touches and in the crucifix

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.040 
small touches and in the crucifix
because<00:05:36.480> a<00:05:36.510> crucifix<00:05:37.140> is<00:05:37.290> very<00:05:37.560> powerful

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
because a crucifix is very powerful

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.660 
because a crucifix is very powerful
symbolic<00:05:40.050> it<00:05:40.890> could<00:05:41.070> have<00:05:41.160> been<00:05:41.250> a<00:05:41.310> star<00:05:41.640> of

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
symbolic it could have been a star of

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:42.830 
symbolic it could have been a star of
david<00:05:41.820> i<00:05:42.210> mean<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.450> could<00:05:42.600> have<00:05:42.690> been

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
david i mean it could have been

david i mean it could have been
something<00:05:43.440> else<00:05:43.710> but<00:05:44.040> i<00:05:44.100> kind<00:05:44.640> of<00:05:44.730> kind<00:05:45.000> of

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
something else but i kind of kind of

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.140 
something else but i kind of kind of
think<00:05:45.450> of<00:05:45.540> that<00:05:45.720> sort<00:05:46.140> how<00:05:47.070> strong<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.730> make<00:05:47.940> it

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
think of that sort how strong to make it

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.510 
think of that sort how strong to make it
and<00:05:48.360> having<00:05:48.720> done<00:05:49.080> some<00:05:49.350> crucifixes<00:05:50.040> his<00:05:50.250> kind

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
and having done some crucifixes his kind

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.120 
and having done some crucifixes his kind
of<00:05:50.610> centerpieces<00:05:51.090> of<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.540> painting<00:05:51.930> i<00:05:52.130> wanted

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
of centerpieces of the painting i wanted

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.370 
of centerpieces of the painting i wanted
to<00:05:53.280> keep<00:05:53.490> this<00:05:53.700> back<00:05:54.060> this<00:05:54.540> is<00:05:54.690> actually<00:05:55.260> in

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
to keep this back this is actually in

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.040 
to keep this back this is actually in
the<00:05:55.470> literal<00:05:55.830> center<00:05:56.220> this<00:05:57.180> is<00:05:57.360> back<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:57.930> when

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
the literal center this is back and when

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.260 
the literal center this is back and when
my<00:05:58.170> wife<00:05:58.440> first<00:05:59.040> saw<00:05:59.340> this<00:05:59.580> painting<00:05:59.940> near

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
my wife first saw this painting near

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.090 
my wife first saw this painting near
near<00:06:00.810> completion<00:06:01.230> she<00:06:01.470> didn't<00:06:01.680> even<00:06:01.740> notice

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
near completion she didn't even notice

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.120 
near completion she didn't even notice
it<00:06:02.250> was<00:06:02.370> a<00:06:02.400> crucifix<00:06:03.060> in<00:06:03.240> it<00:06:03.410> but<00:06:04.410> I<00:06:04.650> had<00:06:04.950> to

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
it was a crucifix in it but I had to

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.890 
it was a crucifix in it but I had to
strengthen<00:06:05.640> a<00:06:05.730> little<00:06:05.970> bit<00:06:06.120> of<00:06:06.240> shadow<00:06:06.450> under

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
strengthen a little bit of shadow under

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.830 
strengthen a little bit of shadow under
here<00:06:07.350> again<00:06:08.280> a<00:06:08.460> case<00:06:08.790> of<00:06:08.820> balance<00:06:09.390> like<00:06:09.630> these

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
here again a case of balance like these

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.270 
here again a case of balance like these
