00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
never put one sheet pile no 1 seed by

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.090 
never put one sheet pile no 1 seed by
one<00:02:02.210> seed<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:02.630> too<00:02:02.899> much<00:02:03.140> right<00:02:03.410> so<00:02:03.920> what

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
one seed it's too much right so what

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.510 
one seed it's too much right so what
we'll<00:02:04.280> do<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.490> just<00:02:05.479> take<00:02:05.720> few<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.520> sprinkle

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
we'll do is just take few and sprinkle

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.210 
we'll do is just take few and sprinkle
it<00:02:07.610> around<00:02:07.690> okay<00:02:09.280> just<00:02:10.280> sprinkle<00:02:10.489> yeah<00:02:10.940> enough

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
it around okay just sprinkle yeah enough

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.550 
it around okay just sprinkle yeah enough
so<00:02:13.220> i<00:02:13.250> think<00:02:13.400> that's<00:02:13.670> that's<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:14.989> one<00:02:15.140> has

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
so i think that's that's it so one has

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.890 
so i think that's that's it so one has
tomatoes<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.850> other<00:02:16.970> one<00:02:17.180> has<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.480> cuttings

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
tomatoes the other one has the cuttings

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.530 
tomatoes the other one has the cuttings
so<00:02:18.709> i<00:02:18.770> think<00:02:18.860> it's<00:02:19.100> fun<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.060> know<00:02:20.090> see<00:02:20.360> them

so i think it's fun to you know see them

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.080 
so i think it's fun to you know see them
grow<00:02:20.780> right<00:02:21.050> yet<00:02:21.890> watch<00:02:22.280> them<00:02:22.550> grow<00:02:22.730> every<00:02:23.060> day

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090
