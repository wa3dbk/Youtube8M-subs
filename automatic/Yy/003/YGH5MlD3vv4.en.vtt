when<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.370> breeder<00:02:13.760> will<00:02:14.060> come<00:02:14.300> back<00:02:14.510> down<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
when the breeder will come back down and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.360 
when the breeder will come back down and
you<00:02:15.020> have<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.200> try<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.410> finish<00:02:15.650> him<00:02:15.920> off<00:02:16.070> but

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
you have to try to finish him off but

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.740 
you have to try to finish him off but
now<00:02:16.490> you<00:02:16.550> have<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.910> worry<00:02:17.090> about<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.480> pods

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
now you have to worry about the pods

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.840 
now you have to worry about the pods
there<00:02:18.380> are<00:02:18.500> three<00:02:18.740> pods<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.280> spawn<00:02:19.580> up<00:02:19.730> out

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
there are three pods that spawn up out

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.760 
there are three pods that spawn up out
of<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.030> ground<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.720> these<00:02:20.870> pods<00:02:21.170> are<00:02:21.350> used<00:02:21.620> to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
of the ground and these pods are used to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.500 
of the ground and these pods are used to
regenerate<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.460> breeders<00:02:22.820> health<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.480> you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
regenerate the breeders health so you

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.450 
regenerate the breeders health so you
have<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.810> try<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.050> destroy<00:02:24.560> these<00:02:24.830> pods<00:02:25.190> as

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
have to try to destroy these pods as

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.340 
have to try to destroy these pods as
soon<00:02:25.760> as<00:02:25.910> they<00:02:26.060> pop<00:02:26.300> up<00:02:26.480> out<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.780> ground<00:02:27.050> so

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
soon as they pop up out of the ground so

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.500 
soon as they pop up out of the ground so
the<00:02:28.040> breeder<00:02:28.280> doesn't<00:02:28.730> regenerate<00:02:29.360> his

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
the breeder doesn't regenerate his

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.690 
the breeder doesn't regenerate his
health<00:02:29.750> if<00:02:30.290> he<00:02:30.590> regenerates<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.310> out<00:02:31.460> it's

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
health if he regenerates this out it's

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.370 
health if he regenerates this out it's
just<00:02:31.760> gonna<00:02:31.910> take<00:02:32.270> longer<00:02:32.660> for<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.170> kill

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
just gonna take longer for you to kill

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.830 
just gonna take longer for you to kill
him<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.830> as<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.700> can<00:02:34.820> see<00:02:35.000> here's<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.330> clip<00:02:35.540> of

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
him so as you can see here's a clip of

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.690 
him so as you can see here's a clip of
me<00:02:35.959> on<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.380> mini<00:02:36.560> gun<00:02:36.709> turret<00:02:37.070> destroying<00:02:37.550> all

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
me on the mini gun turret destroying all

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.370 
me on the mini gun turret destroying all
the<00:02:37.730> pods<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.660> have<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.840> clear<00:02:39.110> line<00:02:39.140> of

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
the pods and I have a clear line of

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.380 
the pods and I have a clear line of
sights<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:39.980> all<00:02:40.100> three<00:02:40.459> pods<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.060> I'm<00:02:41.150> able<00:02:41.270> to

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
sights to all three pods and I'm able to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.820 
sights to all three pods and I'm able to
destroy<00:02:41.810> them<00:02:41.959> all<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.320> just<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.620> couple

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
destroy them all in just a couple

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.440 
destroy them all in just a couple
seconds<00:02:43.310> on<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.640> minigun<00:02:43.970> turrets<00:02:44.360> and

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
seconds on the minigun turrets and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.510 
seconds on the minigun turrets and
that's<00:02:44.600> why<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:45.500> really<00:02:45.800> important<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.310> camp

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
that's why it's really important to camp

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.910 
that's why it's really important to camp
this<00:02:46.730> corner<00:02:47.120> because<00:02:47.270> not<00:02:48.170> only<00:02:48.500> can<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.770> lay

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
this corner because not only can you lay

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.949 
this corner because not only can you lay
down<00:02:49.100> cover<00:02:49.400> fire<00:02:49.490> really<00:02:49.970> well

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
down cover fire really well

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.600 
down cover fire really well
and<00:02:51.140> kill<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.590> Rhinos<00:02:51.950> really<00:02:52.280> well<00:02:52.459> at

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
and kill the Rhinos really well at

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.690 
and kill the Rhinos really well at
halftime<00:02:52.820> but<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.660> can<00:02:54.470> destroy<00:02:55.130> all<00:02:55.430> three

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
halftime but you can destroy all three

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.430 
halftime but you can destroy all three
pods<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.270> just<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.570> couple<00:02:56.750> seconds<00:02:57.170> with<00:02:57.350> the

pods in just a couple seconds with the
mini<00:02:57.620> gun<00:02:57.739> turrets<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:59.330> if<00:02:59.600> you<00:02:59.750> don't<00:02:59.959> know

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
mini gun turrets so if you don't know

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.840 
mini gun turrets so if you don't know
how<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.320> kill<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.739> breeder<00:03:01.010> properly<00:03:01.610> this<00:03:01.790> is

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
how to kill the breeder properly this is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.280 
how to kill the breeder properly this is
where<00:03:02.120> I'm<00:03:02.209> gonna<00:03:02.270> explain<00:03:02.780> how<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.050> actually

where I'm gonna explain how to actually

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.240 
where I'm gonna explain how to actually
get<00:03:03.739> his<00:03:03.890> health<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.700> drop<00:03:05.030> really<00:03:05.420> fast<00:03:06.250> what

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250

the breeder is throwing that red mist
into<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.690> air<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.140> then<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:12.950> want<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.190> run<00:03:13.400> in

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
into the air and then you want to run in

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.750 
into the air and then you want to run in
and<00:03:13.910> shoot<00:03:14.360> venom<00:03:14.900> ex<00:03:15.110> Adam<00:03:15.650> when<00:03:16.549> he's

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
throwing that red mist into the air I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.470 
throwing that red mist into the air I
usually<00:03:19.250> have<00:03:19.370> two<00:03:19.580> people<00:03:19.820> doing<00:03:20.269> this

people laying down cover fire for us

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.960

aliens that try to kill us when we do
this<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.890> that's<00:03:28.220> why<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.519> need<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.790> mini

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
under five minutes doing this if he

doesn't regenerate his health so you

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.960
