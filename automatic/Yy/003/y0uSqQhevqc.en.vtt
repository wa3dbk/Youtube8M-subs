multiple plants and we'll place them

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.300 
multiple plants and we'll place them
into<00:00:25.920> ash<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.300> regular<00:00:27.510> wood<00:00:27.869> ash

to prevent diseases we're going to dig a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.639 
to prevent diseases we're going to dig a
hole<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> hole<00:00:35.930> big<00:00:36.930> enough<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.440> cover

throughout its growth we're gonna plant
the<00:00:50.039> potato<00:00:50.370> now<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.270> eye<00:00:51.300> facing<00:00:52.050> up

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210

and cover it and step on it with your

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:14.380 
and cover it and step on it with your
foot<00:01:12.010> we're<00:01:13.010> going<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.310> drop<00:01:13.610> some<00:01:13.880> wood<00:01:14.180> ash

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
foot we're going to drop some wood ash

foot we're going to drop some wood ash
on<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.350> potato<00:01:15.800> because<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:16.820> free<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.390> it's

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
on the potato because it's free and it's

on the potato because it's free and it's
a<00:01:18.320> good<00:01:18.560> fertilizer<00:01:18.800> to<00:01:19.550> get<00:01:19.729> them<00:01:19.970> started

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.700 

we<00:01:27.549> will<00:01:27.759> need<00:01:27.939> to<00:01:28.240> do<00:01:28.750> some<00:01:29.020> chippings<00:01:29.500> I'm

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
we will need to do some chippings I'm

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.550 
we will need to do some chippings I'm
reading<00:01:30.100> between<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.640> potatoes<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:31.600> it's

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
reading between the potatoes and it's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.889 
reading between the potatoes and it's
based<00:01:32.890> on<00:01:33.159> by<00:01:33.430> hiding<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.909> home<00:01:34.090> at<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.600> slight

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
based on by hiding the home at a slight

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.039 
based on by hiding the home at a slight
angle<00:01:34.930> as<00:01:35.380> we<00:01:35.500> use<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:36.009> chisel<00:01:36.880> actions<00:01:37.420> rather

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
angle as we use a chisel actions rather

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.459 
angle as we use a chisel actions rather
than<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.380> flat<00:01:39.060> ho<00:01:40.060> action<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:41.200> it's<00:01:41.320> not<00:01:41.439> a

than a flat ho action and it's not a
