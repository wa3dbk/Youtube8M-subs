00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 history of the computer keyboard 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.630
 the computer keyboard has its 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.700
 origins in the old machines of 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.250
 write whose invention can not 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.320
 attributed to a single person due to 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.150
 that several people contributed to 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.099
 that a machine can be obtained 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.099
 write marketed successfully 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.170
 the first successful typewriter 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:38.400
 real commercial was invented in 1868 by 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 christopher tools in 1872 sold the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.540
 patent of 79,200 65 of your machine by 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.400
 12 thousand dollars a dins moore in jost that 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.190
 he reached an agreement with er emington 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.190
 emerson then machine manufacturers 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.320
 of sewing for marketing 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.630
 remington company started production 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.660
 of your first typewriter on 1 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.660
 May 1873 in New York ' 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.710
 the operation of the machine 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.140
 writing was purely mechanical where 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.210
 pressing a letter on the keyboard was moving 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.640
 a small mechanical hammer that 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.660
 hit the paper through a tape 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.660
 impregnated in ink 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.740
 but there was a problem that the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.110
 movement of the keys pushed by the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.510
 pressure of the fingers caused frequent 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 shocks of the levers with which the 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.790
 first machines were worked with 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.790
 very often 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.409
 in the guard distribution and competed for 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 several years with others that appeared in 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.580
 the market but it became a standard 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.100
 when remington and his main rival 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.600
 underwood became leaders in 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.759
 sales of typewriters 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.759
 using the qwerty format 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.290
 after this the distribution appeared 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.720
 of borax that is a provision of the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.790
 Patented borax keypad which 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.490
 I was looking to become the standard in 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.590
 place of qwerty the goal of this 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.810
 distribution was to reduce the time of 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.810
 Write and reduce jam errors 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.410
 in its beginnings the rivalry between borac 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.340
 and qwerty focused on ergonomics and 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.610
 the speed but when in 1930 they arise 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.020
 electronic typewriters 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.390
 boosting writing speed 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.990
 this argument lost strength and body and 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.990
 it took hold 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.140
 the qwerty keyboard is still the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.690
 standard has versions for different 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.910
 languages being the French thirty and the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.910
 German quartz the most important 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.580
 the first keyboards used to be a 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.260
 computer terminal that 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:00.489
 communicated by serial port with it 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.060
 rs232 with the arrival of and bmps in 1981 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:08.310
 appeared the 83-key ps xt keyboard 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.310
 a connector 5 pin PikolÃ­n 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.700
 later with the appearance of the ibm 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.770
 psc introduced by IBM in 1983 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.990
 introduced a new keyboard that added 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.360
 a key and some additional hardware 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.880
 respect exists so that both 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.880
 keyboards were not directly 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.880
 interchangeable 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.520
 finally the so-called keyboard appears 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.750
 extended 101 keys is introduced 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.760
 by ibm along with model bs 2 in 1987 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.980
 and adopts the provision that has been 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.350
 maintained virtually unchanged 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.860
 until our days but used a 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.640
 mini dyn ps2 connector to connect it to 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.640
 Computer 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.560
 there have been some variants like the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.150
 called windows keyboard with 104 keys 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.210
 introduced by microsoft from the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.550
 appearance of windows 98 presents three 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.740
 new specific keys named 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.370
 windows left windows right and 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.370
 application 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.540
 with the appearance of the usb port 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.880
 Universal serial bus in 1996 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.910
 keyboards continued using the connector 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.130
 ps2 and they started using the usb 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.350
 some years after the appearance of 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.410
 this port is also in the market 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.420
 wireless keyboards whose communication 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.180
 with the computer is done through 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.900
 infrared rays radio waves 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.900
 using bluetooth 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.800
 in recent years appeared the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.570
 called multimedia keyboards that 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.060
 they added new keys to see 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.100
 movies or listen to music in addition to 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.100
 facilitate navigation on the internet 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.960
 another new keyboard is the flexible one is 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.360
 soft plastic or silicone that can be 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.360
 bending over itself is very portable 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.360
 the latest news regarding the 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.539
 keyboards are the so-called keyboards
