00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello everyone i'm still under 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.780
 impressed by my last video there 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 where I tested 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.330
 drawing his homemade knife from 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.340
 fast cut he just killed me 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.640
 disappointed did not even suspect that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.449
 this is probably decided to do more 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.269
 one test 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.029
 but I got another knife 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.710
 let's say so almost free then this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.540
 big chef from zepter 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.340
 steel i don't know what kind of here because 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.860
 different sources say different 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.629
 I do not know here is the release of such there 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.980
 varied depending on the year 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.030
 but what can I say then I dove 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.280
 worked about three months at 1 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.500
 sharpening only got into his hands 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.960
 tasks at 30 degrees with a micro supply 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.449
 at 30 it's 34 degrees and two months I 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.120
 did not touch him in any way 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.210
 except perhaps 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.580
 enough quality musat which 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.680
 not that they don't shoot there he just 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.020
 rules here were 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.020
 replacing the cutting edge after working 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:24.720
 having gone through the garden, it was restored 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.890
 and, again, cut very very frisky but 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:34.910
 get down to business means tell him more 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:38.160
 about a knife this knife is in my opinion 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.890
 fairly correct proportions he 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.539
 quite weighty in the butt of him 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.399
 a thickness of about four millimeters what 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.530
 I did not like him so much 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.619
 downhill down here as usual 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.610
 swimsuit of course I would like to 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.300
 descend were from the butt 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.039
 but these are such minor flaws 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.470
 so here it is quite interesting and here 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:09.690
 now I want to test her all that 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:14.190
 same zdorovskiy rope itself unknown 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.110
 the manufacturer and the year seems to be 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.310
 as it were used earlier as 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.459
 tow rope 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.270
 Well, we will test this knife 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.270
 so let's go 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.540
 the author 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:55.989
 for the first times the camera actually fell 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.209
 low trouble so let's go let's go 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:04.200
 further the first times of course he eats 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.640
 very borzo 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.470
 then begins to sit down slowly 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:18.519
 of course well, it's basically with every knife 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:23.230
 this therefore continue to cut but already 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:26.340
 I see that much more than mine 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.340
 homemade cut 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:35.349
 But of course they do such a cut 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.359
 quite uncomfortable because no 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:43.319
 normal emphasis he of course for such 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.319
 difficult work it is not provided 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.880
 here 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.150
 camera stand if you saw this system 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:13.240
 which secured 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:16.600
 oh my camera so now there is a tight Vlasic 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.600
 but he goes 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.120
 already started drinking they 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.680
 no such a c'mon don't go 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:13.160
 In all, you can finish the principle yourself 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.160
 we went principle across the cutting edge 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.990
 lesson I don't know how he focuses here 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:24.110
 or not but no my focus 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.060
 camera 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.280
 good good you can take my word for it 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:39.840
 replacements went that they did not go and 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:45.420
 seriously try the tests for everything just 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:50.460
 paper let us now some shaped 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:06:04.160
 end up how much we cut two times 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:06:15.090
 three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:21.200
 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.200
 31 32 33 33 cuts 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:30.530
 Here is such a test well compared to 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.060
 my previous test on my 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.970
 homemade this of course 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.000
 and it goes back all my results I thought 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.380
 that quickly the weight is still stronger that is 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.340
 whether that is on this 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.530
 swimwear 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:48.310
 well I woke him to shuffle thanks for 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.500
 attention subscribe to my channel 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.130
 there will be many more very interesting to all 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.130
 thank you bye
