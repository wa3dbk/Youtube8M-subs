 Translator: Elona Shatri Reviewer: Alba Xhani 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.300
 I would like to tell you a story about death and architecture. 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.107
 One hundred years ago, we threatened to die from contagious diseases like pneumonia, 

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:24.642
 which, if kept for long, could take us very quickly. 

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:28.584
 Death found us at home, in our own beds, supervised by families, 

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.472
 since this was the only choice, 

00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:33.480
 because many people did not have access to health care. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.796
 And then in the 20th century many things changed. 

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:38.519
 We developed new medications like penicillin 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.774
 so that we could treat these contagious diseases. 

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.964
 New medications like X-ray technology were discovered 

00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:46.524
 And since they were so big and expensive, 

00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:49.300
 we needed large central buildings, where to keep them, 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.603
 and so our modern hospitals were created. 

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:53.269
 After the Second World War, 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.423
 many countries established universal healthcare systems 

00:00:55.423 --> 00:00:58.450
 so that everyone could get the necessary treatment. 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.450
 The result was the extension of human life from 45 to the beginning of the century 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.220
 up to its double these days. 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.832
 With the development of science, the 20th century was a very hopeful century, 

00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:12.509
 but with all this attention on life, death was forgotten, 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.516
 even our approach to death changed drastically. 

00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:17.284
 I am an architect, 

00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:19.354
 and for a year and a half I am looking for these changes 

00:01:19.354 --> 00:01:23.263
 and the understanding they have of architecture about death and the dead 

00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:26.548
 We can now die of cancer or heart disease, 

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:29.357
 which means that many of us will face a long period of time 

00:01:29.357 --> 00:01:32.278
 with chronic illness at the end of life. 

00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:33.436
 During this period, 

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:38.350
 most likely, we will spend a lot of time in hospitals and asylum. 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.726
 We've all been in modern hospitals. 

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:44.143
 You know those floureshente lights in the endless long corridors 

00:01:44.143 --> 00:01:46.865
 and those rows with uncomfortable chairs. 

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:50.685
 Architecture of hospitals has earned a bad name. 

00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:53.936
 But surprisingly it has not always been so. 

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:58.709
 This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti, built in the year 1419 by Brunelleschi, 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.033
 who was one of the most famous and most influential architects at that time. 

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:05.800
 And when I look at this building and think about hospitals today, 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.378
 what amazes me, is the purpose of this building. 

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.401
 It's really a wonderful building. 

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:12.180
 There are three yards in the middle 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.748
 so that all the rooms are full of light and fresh air, 

00:02:14.748 --> 00:02:17.160
 and the rooms are large with high ceilings, 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.312
 and make you feel more comfortable when you are inside. 

00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:21.445
 And it also looks nice. 

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:24.930
 We have forgotten somehow that this is possible for a hospital. 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.355
 Now, if we want better buildings to die then we have to discuss, 

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:31.680
 but because we do not feel comfortable talking about death 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.280
 we do not talk about it, 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.398
 and we do not question how we as a society approach death. 

00:02:36.398 --> 00:02:39.405
 One of the things that surprises me most in my research, 

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:42.330
 is how attitudes actually change. 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.907
 This is the first crematorium in the United Kingdom, 

00:02:44.907 --> 00:02:47.650
 which was built in Woking in the 1870s. 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.652
 And when it was built for the first time, there were protests in the village. 

00:02:50.652 --> 00:02:55.710
 Burning the body was not accepted by society and 99.8% of people were buried. 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.641
 Even now, only 100 years later, three out of four of our bodies are burned. 

00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:02.119
 People are very open to accept these changes. 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:04.497
 if they are given the opportunity to talk about them. 

00:03:04.497 --> 00:03:07.402
 So this talk about death and architecture 

00:03:07.402 --> 00:03:10.874
 it was what I wanted to start when I made my first exhibition on it 

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:13.985
 in Venice in June, which was renamed "Death in Venice." 

00:03:15.554 --> 00:03:17.845
 It was designed to be quite fun 

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:19.633
 so that people really pay attention. 

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.904
 This is one of our exhibits, which is an interactive map of London 

00:03:22.904 --> 00:03:25.381
 which shows how much of real estate in this city 

00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:27.149
 used for death and the dead. 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:29.913
 and when you move your hand across the map, 

00:03:29.913 --> 00:03:33.752
 the name of that real estate, of the building or of the cemetery appears, 

00:03:33.752 --> 00:03:37.348
 Another exhibition of ours was a series of postcards 

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:38.973
 that people could take with them. 

00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:41.472
 And they showed homes and hospitals 

00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:43.965
 cemetery and morgue, 

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:46.520
 and each of them showed stories of different spaces 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.786
 through which we will pass, on the other side of death. 

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:51.648
 We wanted to show that the place where we live 

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.736
 is the main part of how we die. 

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:59.636
 Now, the strangest thing was how visitors reacted to the exhibition, 

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:02.130
 especially to the audio-visual effect. 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.954
 There were people who danced, ran or jumped up 

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.474
 trying to activate the effects in different ways, 

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:10.973
 and for a moment they would stop 

00:04:10.973 --> 00:04:14.244
 and it would be remembered that the exhibition had to do with death, 

00:04:14.244 --> 00:04:16.457
 and maybe that was not the way we supposed to behave. 

00:04:16.617 --> 00:04:19.466
 But in fact, I will question if there is a way 

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:21.599
 how to behave about death, 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.786
 and if it is not, I would like you to think how it would be a good death, 

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:29.648
 and think about how architecture could make a good death 

00:04:29.648 --> 00:04:34.671
 and would not it be less like this and a bit more like this? 

00:04:34.671 --> 00:04:36.361
 Thank you. 

00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:38.733
 (Applause)
