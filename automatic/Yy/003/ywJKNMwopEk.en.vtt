 launch new devices as early as 2014 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.230

 Aluminum rear side of 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.190
 polycarbonate 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.969
 it also has a wide space for the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.160
 camera 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.890
 a signal that the sensor may be above 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.070
 of the average still physical buttons on the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.530
 below the screen and since the subject is 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.329
 leaked on the internet were disclosed 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.940
 also unofficially 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.210
 the alleged sony specs 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.570
 xperia z3 and also c3 kompakt the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.810
 xv od user to forums claims that

 the z3 will have 801 snapdragon processor 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.009
 greno adreno 330 screen with resolution of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.040
 1920's by 1080 pixels but size 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.240
 Still Unknown 20 Rear Camera 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.380
 thousand to 7 megapixels and android 4.4 point 4 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.650
 or maybe up to 15,003 with part would have 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.360
 practically the same specifications 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.360
 only with a smaller screen and less 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.540
 both devices can be 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.939
 presented in the ifa 2014 that happens in 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.159
 September there are also those who believe that 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.740
 presentation can happen in August 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.720
 but something very strange these rumors of the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.659
 c3 is that the specifications are 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.369
 virtually identical to the then z2 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.259
 it does not make sense 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.530
 ok let's wait for the information 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.689
 official nÃ© the subject is now android l 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.579
 more specifically the function that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.619
 promises to increase battery life 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.950
 of the devices that will use this system 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.540
 the site the techniques did some tests and 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.230
 concluded that the battery of a 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.730
 5 lasted 36 percent more with the version 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.159
 Prior android l 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.140
 that means two and a half hours more 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.120
 on this image 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.730
 Are you comparing duration 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.450
 in minutes in two different versions of the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.579
 android 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.930
 the detail is that android l is still 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.459
 in its previous version for 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.470
 developers 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.810
 so it should get even better 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.519
 as it is being stabilized 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.349
 still talking google the company 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.689

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.980
 quarterfinals of the championship 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.349
 google has been using data with 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.989
 information and reviews of recent years 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.090

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.659
 this cup 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.669
 then the company analyzes the data 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.799
 performance of each player 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:07.439
