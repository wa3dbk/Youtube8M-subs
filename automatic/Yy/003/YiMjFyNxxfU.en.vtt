00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:12.580
 if it's snowing and it's already coming 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.860
 evening time and therefore darkens 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.530
 Opportunities refuse to travel 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.680
 but if after all you manage 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.680
 by car 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.080
 must be observed 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.280
 distance between cars as well 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.910
 speed limit especially when maneuvering 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.910
 turning 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.150
 on the roadway is very slippery now 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.150
 because it 's snowing 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.770
 falls on the asphalt 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.560
 and mixed 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.610
 with oil lubricants as well 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.750
 liquids 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.750
 here are the cars 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.280
 the mass becomes very slippery 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.120
 and with any sharp turn maneuver 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.120
 car loses control 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.119
 drivers must remember that while 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.310
 the car is moving and driven it's not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.580
 It means that he confidently goes on the carriageway 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.750
 parts need only produce 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.130
 wrong action 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:28.100
 how can the car be caught 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.909
 it starts on a slippery road to throw 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.909
 right left 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.950
 but at this time we do not see where they are turned 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:40.970
 wheels and no longer have time to react 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.290
 Now we look at two 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.260
 important types of cars 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.530
 this is a rear wheel drive 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.150
 and front drive 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.110
 how to act 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.110
 during car skidding 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.430
 if for some reason the car 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.430
 starts 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.660
 throw from side to side 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:13.010
 rear wheel drive must be reset 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.379
 gas and very 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.689
 carefully and correctly produce 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:22.310
 braking is desirable to perform this 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:23.060
 gently and periodically pressing into it 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.370
 time 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.370
 we try the steering wheel 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.570
 twist off 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.410
 under the skidding side means if we 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.410
 consider front-wheel drive 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.330
 means in a similar situation to us 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.049
 is necessary 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.049
 vice versa 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.040
 add gas 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.330
 oddly enough many drivers 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.240
 try to press the brake 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.290
 because many reaction work 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.640
 just so accustom yourself to what you 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.770
 need to get away from obstacles and 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.770
 add the opposite gas in this way 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.220
 we can align the car 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.870
 then we won't drift now 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:25.220
 consider a very interesting example 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:29.240
 suppose we put a pencil on the table 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.200
 let's start pushing his back like 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.200
 rear wheel drive car 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.410
 if he leaves the center 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:45.460
 and we will click on it or rather 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.620
 push the pencil even more 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:53.019
 will turn in that direction 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.019
 to which he originally left the center 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.420
 if the pencil is dragging along 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.210
 then we can 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:12.620
 him create a uniform motion because 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.620
 that we drag him the same thing and females 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.190
 which we are pulling the rope 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.560
 means 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.700
 if we have 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.700
 all-wheel drive car 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.500
 This does not mean that we should relax 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.000
 the fact is that a lot 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.650
 traffic accidents and with 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.590
 these cars 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.550
 So we must remember to keep 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.550
 speed mode 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.940
 moving straight as well as during maneuvers 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.820
 specifically for cars 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.820
