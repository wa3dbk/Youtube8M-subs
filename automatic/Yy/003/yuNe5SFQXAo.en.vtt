 clear story and love at first sight 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.260

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.720
 comic review on your screens 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.880
 Let's start with the fact that with comics for 1 copy 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.620
 not very familiar and maybe it will be 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.530
 slightly wrong to judge them by 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.610
 by some rumor and other things not very 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.800
 intelligible information 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.450
 but I know them no less than that 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.030
 love to get acquainted exclusively 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.489
 busty and get and interest girls a 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.100
 a hundred most often bear such stories 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.140
 want to know and I will answer you a little something 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.350
 original and long time collins did not become 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.540
 except the story came out in 2007 and 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.440
 is a spin-off from boeing from all those 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.410
 for splitting 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.660
 called fairytale makeup if you 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.239
 I think that you are waiting for a rainbow fairy 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.460
 story then no comic greets us 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.790
 the scene of how young and of course 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.500
 sexy mommy named alice i 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.630
 meant not some kind of perverted ska 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.780
 and the concept of mommy and just for example 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.850
 mother of two children in general olesya take 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.550
 bath and for all we do not understand reasons 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.149
 hide your veins but luckily her daughter 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.280
 kelly 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.190
 comes home on time and mother stays 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.530
 living new after such circumstances 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.110
 Alice slowly goes to the roof and so I do not 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.420
 became very bad doctor and there is 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.860
 have a pet it becomes 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.680
 white fluffy rabbit 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.200
 passes a couple of years Alice fooled her 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.170
 husband is a pervert, like everything here 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.729
 son in general is sick in the head because 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.490
 promises its kilka under pictures with 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.130
 dead people. or become so 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.259
 typical closed gothic girl 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.689
 now she has a boyfriend with whom she 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.600
 actively has sex and eats 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.950
 hallucinogenic mushrooms and no boys and 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.630
 girls gender no you confused 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.179
 one day, daughter 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.579
 returns home and the mother is all tears 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.040
 easier to find and a rabbit who is suddenly 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.230
 ran off the body goes down to the basement and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.690
 reaching for a rabbit falls 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.820
 somewhere down after some time climbs 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.190
 understands more precisely does not understand where she is 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.220
 is located and is it in some kind 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.470
 the magic country is all that's literally all 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.040
 plot of the first issue and if not a damn 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.989
 did not understand that know that I, too, did not 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.790
 I understand how you understand the plot I do not 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.400
 I liked it though maybe it's stupid 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.989
 judge all by one number 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.540
 drawing, too, can hardly be called not 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.879
 really cool sure he is good but not 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.610
 more here who is really well done so 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.950
 colorist in some places very juicy 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.500
 pleasing to my eyes like comics on 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.750
 Russian printing shop or rather now 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:02.150
 publishing house orange store 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:04.190
 orange paper and print quality is quite 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.860
 imagine good smoothness their page 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.629
 I personally like density 200 times two 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.629
 Thousands of copies pleases with the fact that comics 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.170
 enough 7 fonts design also on 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.950
 height 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.360
 but there is one thing but right on the cover 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.760
 note the location of the room 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.950
 and the sign of the age limit in the very 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.110
 In fact, they do not look at all there 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.200
 the room could be placed right next to 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.629
 name a 16 + somewhere down then 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.860
 everything would look much more appropriate who 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.470
 then say that I find fault 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.420
 and this is really a trifle but know everyone 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.150
 your opinion and me this thing is real 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.069
 hurts the eyes despite these minuses memory 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.290
 still worth buying at least 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.420
 for the sake of the rings and the fact is i read 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.819
 things that were trust me in the hundreds 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.040
 times worse I would call comics hard 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:53.510
 average and well with you was Misha 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.790
