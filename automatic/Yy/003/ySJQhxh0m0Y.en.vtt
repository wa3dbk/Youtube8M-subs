00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.450

 If you say 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.100
 Rare 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.530
 Quite recent but function is what Grand Theft Auto 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.770

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.640
 In that so that quite that freely so as to make anything 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.640
 Oh 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.290

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.810

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 So what can we do with that race 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.580
 Ummm 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.870
 Death match 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.870
 With paste desmatch 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.369
 It was not hot 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.170
 Busy to Ne and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.550

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.690
 Can be made freely 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.910
 And this is a death match 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.340
 The point is ah 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.010
 I did stayed there 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.080
 The point is that that deathmatch 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.390
 So you're a weapon 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.390
 Limited to rocket launcher 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.450
 When put to the nursery 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.450
 Such a mission is completed 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.030

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.860
 me 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.549
 If you 've come to alive and you 're addicted to a rocket launcher 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.549

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.740

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.370
 I unlike there Re Smash Bros. 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.790
 There are general mobs, but that car or something will come in quite a bit 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.819
 Well general mob too 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.819
 Because normally kill it from being killed 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.580
 This it would be without Oiso like um 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:41.690
 Enemy appears and survives 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.690
 It seems that no decision of that 3 seconds or 5 seconds 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.040
 It is a drunk pony sports cup 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.629

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.790
 It does not increase the number of day 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.009
 It is quite chaos this 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.009
