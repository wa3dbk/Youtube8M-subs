look at is the shape of your turns very

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
look at is the shape of your turns very
simply<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> look<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> tracks

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
simply if you look back at the tracks

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.220 
simply if you look back at the tracks
that<00:00:47.399> you've<00:00:47.550> left<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.420> want<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.750> seeing<00:00:49.050> a

control your speed you're chucking the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.130 
control your speed you're chucking the
skis<00:00:56.640> around<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> corner<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.870> running

rushed I'm doing the whole turn in one

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.990 
rushed I'm doing the whole turn in one
very<00:01:12.540> fast<00:01:12.900> erratic<00:01:13.530> movement<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.790> pick

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
very fast erratic movement then I pick

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.719 
very fast erratic movement then I pick
up<00:01:15.119> speed<00:01:15.390> between<00:01:15.540> my<00:01:15.930> turns<00:01:16.369> what<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.490> want

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
up speed between my turns what we want

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.480 
up speed between my turns what we want
to<00:01:17.850> achieve<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> round<00:01:19.080> link<00:01:19.590> turn<00:01:19.860> which

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to achieve is a round link turn which

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.480 
to achieve is a round link turn which
keeps<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.000> speed<00:01:21.299> constant<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.590> control

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.160 

you're<00:01:26.490> always<00:01:26.730> going<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.150> speed<00:01:27.480> up<00:01:27.690> when<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
you're always going to speed up when you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
you're always going to speed up when you
start<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.620> turn<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.100> point<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> skis<00:01:29.820> down

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
start the turn and point the skis down

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.150 
start the turn and point the skis down
the<00:01:30.210> hill<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.810> can't<00:01:31.110> change<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.830> what

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
the hill you can't change that but what

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160 
the hill you can't change that but what
you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.580> change<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.360> how<00:01:33.630> fast<00:01:33.930> you're<00:01:34.140> going

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
you can change is how fast you're going

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260 
you can change is how fast you're going
before<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.400> feel<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.090> you're

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
before you do that and feel that you're

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.510 
before you do that and feel that you're
going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> push<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.020> nice<00:01:37.260> gradual<00:01:37.950> break<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
going to push a nice gradual break and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.300 
going to push a nice gradual break and
then<00:01:39.210> start<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.810> next<00:01:40.080> term<00:01:40.290> feeling<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.160> lot

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
then start that next term feeling a lot

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.610 
then start that next term feeling a lot
calmer<00:01:41.610> less<00:01:42.300> stress<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.870> happier<00:01:43.500> about

life so I'm going to start to slide but
from<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:47.970> I'm<00:01:48.240> gradually<00:01:49.080> turning<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.650> the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
from here I'm gradually turning up the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.670 
from here I'm gradually turning up the
hill<00:01:50.100> now<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.820> feel<00:01:51.240> control<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.170> start<00:01:52.470> my

hill now I feel control I can start my

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.400 
hill now I feel control I can start my
next<00:01:52.740> turn<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:54.150> start<00:01:54.450> turning<00:01:54.690> up<00:01:55.050> that<00:01:55.080> hill
