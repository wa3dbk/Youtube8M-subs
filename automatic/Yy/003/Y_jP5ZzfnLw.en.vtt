00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.740
 it does not make him so today I 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.440
 shows how I recreated 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.929
 I made this the hair club a 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 little way it's a little life it's 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.690
 a lot the fashion was not enough but 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.000
 who's coming back this year so I'm showing 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.220
 the trick as in front of the waves their 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.449
 made without heat are rare and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.460
 only them with elastics 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.180
 so i want to show mtb the steps 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.039
 we must follow 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.199
 in fact this is what you of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.730
 place it it may be the shops are the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.680
 dry or wet hair 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.239
 finally I hope I will sleep with 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.200
 my hair my hair dry and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.629
 I'm waiting for this all year long as the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.219
 result is done by the uimm 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.340
 so in fact what we do is god 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.800
 how much to take a wick the money that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 you just want cold and more quote 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.730
 the biggest ripples so you 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.750
 take a wick 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.860
 I love curly hair when I 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.149
 do they know did the wind 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.710
 was therefore more fashioned for what 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.250
 hair types 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.699
 take your mersch and you make 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.049
 folds like the ones you come back to and 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.939
 once you have made your key 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.600
 you take lastic that you tie 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.229
 in the middle of the clip that you have 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.640
 created so like that and you do this 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.979
 for all around the planet and to 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.850
 Africa is worthless it will give the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.850
 look is expected 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.119
 so you're writing little bits 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.509
 like that every loto of the head and when 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.799
 you wake up dreaming morning or after 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.509
 few hours a package do the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.580
 morning he knows maybe one to two 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.080
 years as on the cuttlefish tax and when 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.090
 you're done you 're just getting 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.240
 detach the elastics carefully 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.869
 Saint Tropez must not be too abrupt 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.390
 on the loops I do not know how to lead you 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.420
 like me here and she dominated her 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.619
 recreation the bvk here are some cases because I 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.300
 have Thursday all the defenses I had 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.770
 really a lot of volume but 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.030
 maybe left about an hour on the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.460
 done it's throwing them a little bit more 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.049
 natural so it is certain that once 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.610
 as soon as you have them holidays this 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.729
 poor and poor results you want 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.299
 but after a while it's okay 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.830
 control is therefore declared bankrupt 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.080
 determined women with beanbags and either 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.450
 neglected the bone like that you can 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.920
 make hairstyles with his blade more 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.870
 to evolve more texture is always 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.670
 a woman warned the attachÃ©s to 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.560
 back to squirrel at the results or 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.980
 even if you do you tie 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.579
 completely I spend about 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.480
 it's really a beautiful rock horse 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.519
 volume protection so it's not easy 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.370
 to do sir can create some 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.680
 hairstyles a little bit more texture is a 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.900
 little more even more different from what we 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.209
 is small so if this passage it 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.910
 only knows about elastics and 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 a little bit of time for it to take 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.209
 in place 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.720
 so here it was the final result is 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.720
 entered the crash nice and lyon
