00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.890 

the<00:02:34.709> table<00:02:35.040> yeah<00:02:35.370> he<00:02:35.610> did<00:02:35.879> yeah<00:02:36.330> homeles<00:02:36.720> well

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the table yeah he did yeah homeles well

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.420 
the table yeah he did yeah homeles well
at<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.080> table<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.440> saved<00:02:37.709> every<00:02:37.980> pretty<00:02:38.099> quick
