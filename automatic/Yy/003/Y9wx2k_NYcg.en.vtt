model is there something they should

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.840 
model is there something they should
know<00:01:55.799> before<00:01:56.340> they<00:01:56.490> enter<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.969> industry

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
know before they enter this industry

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.889 
know before they enter this industry
there's<00:01:59.850> probably<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.149> few<00:02:00.180> things<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> they

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
there's probably a few things that they

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.080 
there's probably a few things that they
should<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.520> definitely

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
should know one is that it's definitely

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480 
should know one is that it's definitely
hard<00:02:03.299> work<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.810> secondly<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.950> think<00:02:05.189> actually

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
hard work and secondly I think actually

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.490 
hard work and secondly I think actually
the<00:02:05.670> second<00:02:05.969> thing<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.149> would<00:02:06.210> say<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:07.110> know

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the second thing I would say is you know

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.440 
the second thing I would say is you know
have<00:02:08.220> good<00:02:08.489> relationships<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.239> other

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
have good relationships with other

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.059 
have good relationships with other
people<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.989> work<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.410> double<00:02:10.979> will

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
people that you work with double will

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.910 
people that you work with double will
tell<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.310> more<00:02:11.430> about<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.760> is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
tell you more about this is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.350 
tell you more about this is
nobody<00:02:13.920> likes<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.280> bitch<00:02:14.460> model<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
nobody likes a bitch model and and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.120 
nobody likes a bitch model and and
secondly<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.960> think<00:02:19.050> be<00:02:19.380> objective<00:02:19.980> with

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
Bollywood I think everything has helped

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.960 
Bollywood I think everything has helped
me<00:02:35.640> down<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.840> way<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.380> think<00:02:38.220> when<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> are<00:02:38.790> a

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
me down the way I think when you are a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.000 
me down the way I think when you are a
model<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.600> country<00:02:40.080> directors<00:02:40.560> do<00:02:40.800> look

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
model in this country directors do look

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.320 
model in this country directors do look
at<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.280> wonder<00:02:41.430> oh<00:02:41.610> does<00:02:41.940> she<00:02:41.970> want<00:02:42.270> to

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
at you and wonder oh does she want to

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.670 
at you and wonder oh does she want to
get<00:02:42.450> into<00:02:42.690> films<00:02:42.990> there's<00:02:43.230> always<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.500> natural

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
get into films there's always a natural

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.310 
get into films there's always a natural
question<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.820> don't<00:02:45.270> think<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.570> helped<00:02:46.020> per

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
question but I don't think it helped per

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.710 
question but I don't think it helped per
se<00:02:46.560> because<00:02:46.740> once<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.160> became<00:02:47.430> an<00:02:47.610> actor<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.270> lot

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
se because once I became an actor a lot

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.990 
se because once I became an actor a lot
of<00:02:48.870> people<00:02:49.230> didn't<00:02:49.950> think<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.430> could<00:02:50.730> act

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
of people didn't think that I could act

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.090 
of people didn't think that I could act
and<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.360> was<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.590> preconceived

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
and that was a you know a preconceived

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.500 
and that was a you know a preconceived
notion<00:02:53.250> or<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.580> perception<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.120> had<00:02:54.360> to

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
notion or a perception that I had to

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.810 
notion or a perception that I had to
work<00:02:54.630> very<00:02:54.690> hard<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.200> break<00:02:55.380> down<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
work very hard to break down and the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.220 
work very hard to break down and the
only<00:02:57.030> way<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.540> do<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.990> by<00:02:58.200> just

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
only way that you can do that is by just

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.930 
only way that you can do that is by just
working<00:02:58.680> really<00:02:58.709> hard<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.370> working<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.760> prove

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
working really hard and working to prove

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.120 
working really hard and working to prove
people<00:03:00.060> wrong<00:03:00.240> so<00:03:00.750> while<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.440> did<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.740> its

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
people wrong so while it did have its

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.580

had disadvantages because people just

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.490 
had disadvantages because people just
saw<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.540> was<00:03:06.720> talentless<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.350> just
