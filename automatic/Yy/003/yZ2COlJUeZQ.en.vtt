00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 good friends of hdblog after smartwatch 1 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.359
 and 2 mounting a system 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.269
 sony owner passes from android were 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:17.070
 for his smartwatch 3 how it works 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:18.800
 Now I discover together and here's the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.210
 smartwatch over having changed 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.740
 subtractive sony throws a little at 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.210
 nettles all that work done by 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.480
 developers to develop applications 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.849
 for the excellent smartwatch one and two though 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.279
 relies on the google platform 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.250
 we already know how it works with 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.579
 the web application for smartphone is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.460
 You can go and change the various ones 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.219
 various background you can go to 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.170
 decide for the various vocal actions 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.750
 which applications applications activate 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.770
 for example see I'm using a lgg 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.840
 flex 2 and when you can you want to start 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.969
 a bike ride a race for the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 period I set the gl but you can 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.379
 set up different programs that start 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.480
 voice commands here are voice commands 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.769
 that I'm not the top on android were 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.600
 according to me it must be given too precise 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.600
 but first things first let's talk of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.520
 rubber bracelet watch unfortunately it is 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.990
 a powder cutter you know the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.869
 its fair here is practically the same 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.400
 what because it always remains attached a 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.780
 some dust or something of 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.700
 go and clean it often if you want 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.560
 keep the classic processor clean 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 snapdragon 400 almost as belonging 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.000
 all have this android wear ball 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.460
 speaker processor completely in 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.280
 steel with this strap weighs approx 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.930
 70 grams can be taken out of the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.960
 watch strap and replace it with 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.000
 metal rubber strap straps 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.159
 presented in these days of various 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.040
 colors 4 gigabytes of integrated memory 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.740
 512 megabytes of ram display of 16 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.960
 diagonal square inches 320 x 320 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.299
 pixels but what matters most is that 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.790
 send you see now it is off yes it is 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.549
 off the brightness can be reactivated 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.600
 turning when the wrist or 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.189
 touching it then I must say that I am not 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.680
 you're always perfect because of the sensor 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.540
 of brightness but he always remains in 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.969
 this state is thanks to this display 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.250
 which captures the light was reflected 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.479
 you can almost always see it now 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.700
 he can always see except at the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.560
 dark 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.160
 you have to click tap or move the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.750
 arm to light the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.670
 backlight so many bust sensor 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.470
 of the accelerometer gyroscope you want headlights 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.930
 then purely to food and do when 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 android web will be ripe for for 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.480
 activate it will be activated and also the GPS 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.660
 but for now only an application is 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.420
 takes run runkeeper and I must say that a 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.350
 me is an application that doesn't even do 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.120
 go crazy 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.710
 in short, I prefer to use it in 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.200
 pairing with the real smartphone is that 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.730
 with this application with the GPS can 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.980
 go for a run tracing the path 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.500
 without the need for a smartphone 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.500
 as a network the notifications are the classic ones 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.280
 many applications of android wear 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.370
 have updated to allow the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.510
 command directly from dal dal 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.340
 smartphone 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.430
 we can as its lower part 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.580
 look at the 420 milian battery 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.740
 for now it is quietly two 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.760
 days sees a 67 percent now but 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.100
 we can also command interruptions 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.110
 so we can display all the 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.940
 notification on priority notifications 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.990
 or all notifications of course 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.030
 this performs an action of 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.220
 edit also on the smartphone then 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.110
 we can put it in cinema mode 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.510
 it means that the display does not turn off 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.430
 vibrate does nothing except when 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.560
 let's click the physical button 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.100
 which is present on this on this 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.840
 sony waterproof smartwatches p 68 ma 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.550
 goes put cinema modes are just 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.730
 it's up to the water even in the shower 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.340
 goes crazy starts to do a little bit 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.020
 what you want here is very comfortable 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.580
 the fact that the charger is not 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.380
 owner but just any 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.120
 micro usb to insert back here for 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.990
 load it between a fast charge about 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.650
 one hour you load with this cap in 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.660
 rubber to make it waterproof and much 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.220
 convenient to carry with an adjustment 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.980
 simple strap enough to go up 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.930
 from this button move it and then e 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.880
 then close, however, I must mark one 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.910
 what I've tried for a long time 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.900
 smartwatch because it made me a couple of 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.019
 bad jokes 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.769
 three times in these around 15 days of 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.290
 utilization 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.550
 the smartwatch has overheated 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.840
 I couldn't do anything anymore 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.160
 wait for it to discharge 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.440
 completely the battery for then 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.790
 put the refills and let it resume 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.530
 it wasn't a nice thing either 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.350
 why have an object that instead of you 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.790
 overheating is a bit scary 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.410
 as for the functions it goes well 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.140
 I will dwell shortly on the classics of 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.370
 android wera with the possibility of 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.500
 of the voice command 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.169
 unfortunately this all commands 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.529
 possible speech recognition 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.770
 android despite having a great android 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:00.169
 intelligence and a great background on the 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.279
 recognition of the voice 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.370
 I must say that one must always be 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:08.749
 very very precise to give him the commands 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.439
 otherwise the clock goes in search 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:10.909
 Google 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:14.060
 I must say, however, compared to others 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:17.090
 smartwatch with web I had less 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.180
 disconnection problems with 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.270
 the clock and especially less sometimes 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.099
 verve in those who use the web will realize that 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.689
 comes cloud shape when maybe yes 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.479
 wants to answer vocally to 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.729
 notifications or you want to do some 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.680
 operation here with this smartwatch 3 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.919
 really happen ratified this phenomenon 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.180
 obviously lots of dials 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.909
 then customizable now on the play 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.650
 store there are really tons of them 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.710
 one more beautiful than the other and perhaps this one 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.580
 one of the reasons why I keep an android 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.439
 were on the wrist we will soon see it too 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.830
 apple smartwatch 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:57.560
 in short, in the average day wear ball 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.669
 android is a device that convinced me 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.889
 I especially liked the design 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.620
 very convenient to bring repeat catch a 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.229
 little battery dust you do 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.569
 the two days what convinced me well 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.800
 these three referendums are not for me 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.139
 nothing you liked but maybe it's a problem 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.009
 of our unit for hdblog andrea 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.009
 from the others
