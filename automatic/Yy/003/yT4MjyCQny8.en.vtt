00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.169
 so the following pickets that 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.509
 would like to talk 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.400
 half day 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.580
 Well, what is different but let's see 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.689
 Anchorage May spend thread I 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.750
 already how to be done initially she what 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.169
 That sample but look what he is above 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.230
 how is it different from being studied so that 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.180
 sharply denser however it looks more like 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.460
 Oscar and even imposed 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.600
 she will go for more dense cartilage 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.610
 you need not as there are no such 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.590
 better keeps its shape 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.600
 yes it is even useful to connect with 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.430
 veteran for purchase 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.010
 with lightning there 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.660
 this type of clothing 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.750
 if you need 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.830
 clothes are more tightly held better 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.610
 form 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.750
 tons this 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.510
 those ways Viennese 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.510
 it suits you maybe more 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.160
 yet again 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.980
 but it's a little leak 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 a little here tighten 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.220
 and see how the total of tires 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.740
 we are done 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 so we do it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.260
 form a five-minute that 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.150
 pogrom 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.160
 last electrical time 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.260
 again in Kiev 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
 once 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
 profession 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.030
 again i am working 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.870
 look under this second finger 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.350
 thereby 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.439
 the more he presses the less 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.960
 children from June 5 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.940
 the more we drop it 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.440
 they are more 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.440
 basic error for beginners 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.899
 lovers of this and who is to blame 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.049
 this car kits is obtained 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.269
 unevenly 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.939
 at the same time stifles more 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.599
 takes into account less 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.659
 so at the initial stage it is not worth much 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.589
 hurry 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.239
 just look for who you 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.329
 St. Petersburg turned out relatively 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.669
 evenly 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.669
 so suppose years 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.509
 in the bank 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.719
 so again I repeat that such a link 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.869
 she is more suitable 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.229
 the act of polish is more like kama than 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.149
 imposed 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.579
 plot from the gate is extremely unpleasant 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.829
 they can use more 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.919
 for more dense 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.919
 those that hold their shape better 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.879
 if you need 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.209
 to form 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.429
 barely spikes 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:37.769
 ok if 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.769
 dollars such linkage will suit you 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:45.229
 it is rather r 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.129
 some 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.129
 for tight 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.839
 jackets 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.869
 Well, in general, this is such a sharp type 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.679
 we do it 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:01.779
 one side ride
