 nor are we going to start succinctly from going up percent what wine is 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.860
 Wine is one of the most complex beverages known to man 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.599
 more than a thousand different compounds become part of its composition 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.050
 to unravel all these secrets and many others that we will advance in this 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.910
 tasting course 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.000
 let's have the definition of what is capable first 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 and for that, john jorba chatted 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.210
 because as its name suggests it is to appreciate the different qualities that 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.179
 has the producer 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:51.850
 for use by the senses 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.280
 first we see sense in sight to see the colors and nuances of 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.560
 its colors 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.730
 greg olsen from a background to see them to the fullest 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.889
 infinite nuances that are not going to give those substances 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:03.989
 efe 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.680
 no no there is a tremendous complexity children heroes 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.420
 and then 1 we will use the mouth and to see the technical tactile sensations of the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.540
 amount of the thousand flavors and aromas of reconstruction in complexity that has 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.750
 this 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.890
 but his simple funny play comedy three installments - for the time being he saw 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.620
 that not teaching 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.189
 to illustrate this course 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.280
 on this page the performances and concerts were permanently injured 

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.590
 the wine-growing landscape 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.650
 Spain 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.380
 we have a 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.380

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.749
 with him the comparison d the two emblematic zones 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.749
 in Spain the advantages of society 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.039
 bonomi and we are going to start the tasting course 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.779
 There are three basic elements that can not be missed 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.259
 we also want to have a good group of friends who 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:28.789
 they will accompany us in the tasting 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.789
 logically magnificent wines that we will also be 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.709
 as a third ingredient we have 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.900
 here you can see we have a good number cecopal different formats and 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.629
 sizes and volumes 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.799
 in the ideal glass that we should use is a medium-sized glass 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.269
 ad hoc that we have missed the top edge to concentrate the aromas 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.319
 and the smells and especially very important 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.349
 do not have reliefs do not have attacks habits do not have 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.039
 all kinds of filigrees that are very nice to exhibit in a museum but not for 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.769
 win 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.239
 the transparent care colors the cup to be always transparent 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.079
 there are no green blue colors 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.079
 violet purple headquarters of the mint is a horror and would not allow it 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.079
 the current phase and the favorite colors of wines 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.419
 how are we going to welcome the cup so you see that I am and with it the hand 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:17.549
 the first 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.839
 ideal to always take it from the stem 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.459
 hop from the pedestal 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.689
 that's why we're going to be two things 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.370
 heat the wine and secondly complain about these buoys that prevent us from seeing the phase 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:29.259
 visual 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:33.089
 speaking also a bit of since we have the wine served until by 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.049
 We must serve the cup 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.409
 when are we going to lie down 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.189
 in that case we have to pretend a measure more or less than a third of the 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:41.869
 total volume of the cup 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:45.749
 to allow a perfect olfaction in the perfect demonstration of tic 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:47.959
 some other tips 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.329
 Juanjo will indicate the same thing 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.529
 good for him 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.959
 The temperature service temperature consultant is very important 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.019
 the banks examined are fresh 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.549
 never télam 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.089

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.639
 always fresh

 reds from 16 to 18 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.049

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.799
 in reserve and we could counteract it 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.079
 the judokas looked for simple that prisoners take 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.219
 macri shorter banks to make them more pleasant seam 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:26.749
 more refreshing

 6 and 7 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.370
 Well, the crying 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.620
 to you today that what you have two glasses very similar the small size 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.360
 and colors out of the table displacing the soccer player from the cup to 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.249
 the rules 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.939
 we are because we are before the cup normalized by the French association 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.659
 standardization 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.210
 the turn 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.909
 also in Cuba the defects 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.680
 answer we found all its antlers a very small cup that concentrated 

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:50.610
 much the aromas 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.319
 the meetings towers 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.089
 It is not ideal to enjoy wine by insulting the minute and being a writer 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.169
 and what was contributed by the artist himself 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.419
 it is a cup liberators a cup 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.009
 the Bombonera 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.150
 timbre of a utility is that here the color because we do not appreciate it because it came 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.159
 that we are interested in seeing old wines that are polished 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:14.930
 but its organoleptic qualities can give and receive a cereal field 

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:17.069
 but what can be confused 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.099
 lula lumbre that I will be able hilarious fun can play with pieces

 richard meritoria the action of using a white and red rose 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.009
 and sometimes people get confused which they were attentive 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.979
 the entity has to finish 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.210
 and then there is another 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.909
 we have up to the classic 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.159

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.139
 opposite as for the room ccoo 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.009
 quabit where we are going to comply is very important that we have a light

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.469
 p is very important that there are no odors were similar to our environment 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.589
 so that nothing is masked cel alarms if you date the popular kitchen

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:15.499
 the discount is the same because it does not yield 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:16.840
 it's more every day 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.300
 Losada of the advances

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.240
 and serve the wine at the right temperature 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.789
 catch the cup because he never took the pedestal 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.169
