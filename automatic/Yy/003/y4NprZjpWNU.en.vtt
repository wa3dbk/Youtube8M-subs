 of the pools is practically 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.000
 unlimited in the case of our 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.970
 swimming pools the only maintenance that 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.660
 performs is a painting every 56 years of 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.050
 use in ips told us about the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.720
 difference between a cement basin and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.630
 one of these characteristics with

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.250
 lowest in the construction time of 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.650
 the pool we took two weeks 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.870
 practically to leave it running 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.610
 unlike the cement athlete if the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.480
 segment segment is not 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.470
 to finished on its surface with a 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.030
 coating 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.760
 you have to be taking away all the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.980
 years so that it looks good in the case of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.170

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.330
 meters long by about 3 meters of 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.490
 width is around 35 thousand pesos this 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.870
 including the thermal edge and the

 fiber reinforced plastic swimming pools 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.680
 of glass since we managed to integrate in 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.080
 this line in this line several sectors 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.270
 exclusive and innovative, generating a

 refreshments inside the pool 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.610
 we also make an important 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.370
 entrance stairway with a handrail 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.620
