00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.380
 three years ago 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.650
 and you can do financing shows 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.439
 here in brazil we also moved away a lot 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.439
 two of mercosul we do international events 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.589
 I felt in Paraguay 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.520

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.840

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.930
 Paulo 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 Paulo 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.819
 little or no leader either 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.179
 But it did not 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:37.179
 I'll tell you 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.399
 what is 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.789
 confused to understand what you tried to disperse 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.959
 moraes 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.130
 it's very clear your work is very clear the timing 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.799
 but take care of top that the confused 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.699
 one can not understand a little of the clichés 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:04.969
 different from this or go out in a normal way I think I missed some of this 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.979
 but even so you guys are very cool deserved the competition ahead 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.180
 the other did not speak 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.650
 it's logic like that 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.179
 I know that you 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.169
 contemporary nothing at all 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.989
 in the thing why it was also not so 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.540
 My love, my God, we're going to be realistic too. 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.589
 I will not 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:42.119
 I do not think anyone then jotted in started every time someone comes and one 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.119

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.389
