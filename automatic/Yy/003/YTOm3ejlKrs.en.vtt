but though I mean the really cool thing

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
but though I mean the really cool thing

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
is to really really be good at tricking

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.000 
is to really really be good at tricking
people<00:02:17.670> into<00:02:18.060> thinking<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.800> know<00:02:19.860> these

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
people into thinking that you know these

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.950 
people into thinking that you know these
cg<00:02:20.490> characters<00:02:20.940> are<00:02:21.090> actually<00:02:21.450> real<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
cg characters are actually real and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.780 
cg characters are actually real and
we're<00:02:22.740> starting<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.190> see<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.340> little<00:02:23.490> bit<00:02:23.730> of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
we're starting to see a little bit of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.720 
we're starting to see a little bit of
that<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.000> think<00:02:24.270> bale<00:02:24.510> wolf<00:02:25.160> comes<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> closest

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that I think bale wolf comes the closest

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.730 
that I think bale wolf comes the closest
that<00:02:26.970> I've<00:02:27.150> seen<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.540> far<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.930> doing<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.440> and

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
that I've seen so far to doing that and

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.350 
that I've seen so far to doing that and
the<00:02:29.130> other<00:02:29.160> way<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:30.630> be<00:02:31.440> more<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.950> mean<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.400> go

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the other way is to be more I mean to go

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.090 
the other way is to be more I mean to go
realistic<00:02:33.960> if<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.170> want<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:34.920> add

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
realistic if you want to do that but add

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.610 
realistic if you want to do that but add
some<00:02:35.430> things<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.790> let<00:02:36.120> people<00:02:36.420> know<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.630> no

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
some things that let people know that no

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.410 
some things that let people know that no
we're<00:02:37.830> not<00:02:37.950> talking<00:02:38.400> about<00:02:38.460> trying<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.030> fool

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
we're not talking about trying to fool

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.110 
we're not talking about trying to fool
people<00:02:39.780> into<00:02:40.070> real<00:02:41.070> characters<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.670> mean<00:02:42.000> that

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
people into real characters I mean that

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.000 
people into real characters I mean that
these<00:02:42.270> are<00:02:42.450> real<00:02:42.660> characters<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.650> there's<00:02:43.920> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
these are real characters that there's a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.640 
these are real characters that there's a
that<00:02:44.700> there's<00:02:44.880> some<00:02:45.090> element<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.750> takes<00:02:46.320> you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
that there's some element that takes you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.490
