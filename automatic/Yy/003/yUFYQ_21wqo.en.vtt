people at the back who wants to watch
DVD<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:38.069> downside<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.700> when<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> car<00:03:39.299> is

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
DVD the downside is that when the car is

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.110 
DVD the downside is that when the car is
running<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:40.500> front<00:03:40.799> monitor<00:03:41.340> which<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:41.970> can

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
running the front monitor which you can

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.199 
running the front monitor which you can
see<00:03:42.329> there<00:03:43.040> it's<00:03:44.040> not<00:03:44.220> gonna<00:03:44.400> well<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.940> turns

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.349 
see there it's not gonna well it turns
on<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.920> problem<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.760> won't<00:03:47.970> show

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
on but the problem is that it won't show

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.170 
on but the problem is that it won't show
you<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.569> movie<00:03:49.019> no<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:50.159> for<00:03:50.340> safety<00:03:50.760> reasons
