special<00:00:35.260> are<00:00:35.469> are<00:00:36.010> a<00:00:36.040> few<00:00:36.430> things<00:00:36.640> we<00:00:37.570> sort<00:00:37.780> of

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
special are are a few things we sort of

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.560 
special are are a few things we sort of
call<00:00:38.050> this<00:00:38.230> our<00:00:38.470> British<00:00:38.949> blackface<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:40.239> has

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
call this our British blackface it has

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.389 
call this our British blackface it has
the<00:00:41.409> EF<00:00:41.739> 86<00:00:42.399> Pinto<00:00:43.149> tube<00:00:43.540> as<00:00:43.839> your<00:00:44.710> main<00:00:44.920> input

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
the EF 86 Pinto tube as your main input

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.329 
the EF 86 Pinto tube as your main input
and<00:00:45.610> it<00:00:46.390> feeds<00:00:46.659> into<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:47.050> tone<00:00:47.409> stack<00:00:47.949> so<00:00:48.280> you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
and it feeds into a tone stack so you

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.509 
and it feeds into a tone stack so you
have<00:00:48.610> treble<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.269> bass<00:00:49.510> tone<00:00:49.899> control<00:00:50.440> so<00:00:51.399> it

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
have treble and bass tone control so it

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.320 
have treble and bass tone control so it
allows<00:00:51.790> for<00:00:51.820> really<00:00:52.659> nice<00:00:53.140> broad<00:00:55.170> tonal

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
allows for really nice broad tonal

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:10.420 
allows for really nice broad tonal
capability

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.060 

it<00:01:11.430> also<00:01:11.670> incorporates<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.960> mid-range<00:01:13.530> boost

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it also incorporates a mid-range boost

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.640 
it also incorporates a mid-range boost
that<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.610> call<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> bumps<00:01:15.480> which<00:01:15.750> has<00:01:16.620> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that we call the bumps which has a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.700 
that we call the bumps which has a
separate<00:01:17.100> level<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.610> tone<00:01:17.880> control<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.590> when

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
separate level in tone control so when

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:36.400 
separate level in tone control so when
you<00:01:19.770> put<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.040> in

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.450 

you<00:01:37.410> switch<00:01:37.710> back<00:01:37.950> you'll<00:01:38.190> hear<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you switch back you'll hear the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.760 
you switch back you'll hear the
difference

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:56.020 

it's<00:01:44.700> also<00:01:44.939> foot<00:01:45.360> switchable

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.170 

so<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:56.810> can<00:01:56.990> use<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.409> as<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.680> lead<00:01:57.979> boost<00:01:58.340> or<00:01:58.700> a

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
so you can use this as a lead boost or a

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.880 
so you can use this as a lead boost or a
tone<00:01:59.479> change<00:01:59.509> as<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.320> was<00:02:00.439> saying<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:00.740> have<00:02:00.770> a

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
tone change as I was saying you have a

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.219 
tone change as I was saying you have a
tone<00:02:01.189> control<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.329> also<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> level

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
tone control for it and also a level

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:15.900 
tone control for it and also a level
control

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.500 

really<00:02:16.780> really<00:02:17.560> scorching<00:02:17.950> sounds<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:18.910> say

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
really really scorching sounds so say

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:42.559 
really really scorching sounds so say
this<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.750> your<00:02:20.020> rhythm<00:02:20.320> sound

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.780 

and<00:02:43.569> it<00:02:43.659> makes<00:02:43.840> for<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.080> great<00:02:44.260> lead<00:02:44.500> boost<00:02:44.799> we

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
and it makes for a great lead boost we

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.229 
and it makes for a great lead boost we
also<00:02:46.030> have<00:02:46.360> incorporated<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.140> master<00:02:47.620> volume

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
also have incorporated a master volume

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.430 
also have incorporated a master volume
with<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.420> amplifier<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.870> can<00:02:53.080> use<00:02:53.260> it

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
with this amplifier so you can use it

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.670 
with this amplifier so you can use it
either<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:54.040> just<00:02:54.970> bring<00:02:55.209> your<00:02:55.390> volume<00:02:55.900> level

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
either to just bring your volume level

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:11.310 
either to just bring your volume level
down

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.350 

the<00:03:12.320> 112<00:03:12.770> version<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.430> Soho<00:03:13.820> we<00:03:14.000> call<00:03:14.210> our

the 112 version of the Soho we call our

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.510 
the 112 version of the Soho we call our
grab-and-go<00:03:14.900> amplifier<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.770> can<00:03:15.920> cover<00:03:16.130> any

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
grab-and-go amplifier it can cover any

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.690 
grab-and-go amplifier it can cover any
scenario<00:03:17.150> from<00:03:17.480> small<00:03:17.900> clubs<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.680> studio<00:03:19.130> to
