00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
sweet picking and develop it properly is

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.250 
sweet picking and develop it properly is

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
break it down in all of its components

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.250 
break it down in all of its components
so<00:00:45.949> let's<00:00:46.100> do<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.370> right<00:00:46.550> hand<00:00:46.789> first<00:00:47.260> let's

and it begins the next on the up on the
upstroke<00:03:45.230> sweet<00:03:53.800> when<00:03:54.800> I<00:03:54.830> sleep<00:03:55.250> I've

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
upstroke sweet when I sleep I've

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.730 
upstroke sweet when I sleep I've
developed<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.660> where<00:03:56.810> I'm<00:03:57.410> doing

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
developed it to where I'm doing

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.010 
developed it to where I'm doing
alternate<00:03:58.160> picking<00:03:58.340> at<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.670> turn<00:03:59.030> around<00:03:59.300> so

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
alternate picking at that turn around so

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.570 
alternate picking at that turn around so
that<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.320> notes<00:04:00.560> are<00:04:00.740> a<00:04:00.770> lot<00:04:00.980> more<00:04:01.010> defined

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
that the notes are a lot more defined

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.670 
that the notes are a lot more defined
and<00:04:01.880> what<00:04:02.330> I<00:04:02.360> mean<00:04:02.540> by<00:04:02.600> that<00:04:02.750> is<00:04:02.960> this<00:04:03.230> your

and what I mean by that is this your

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.970 
and what I mean by that is this your
doing<00:04:03.770> a<00:04:03.950> Down<00:04:04.130> stroke

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:25.050
