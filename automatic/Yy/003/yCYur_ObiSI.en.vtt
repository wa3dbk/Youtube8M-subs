2014 Yamaha yz250 F a few months ago we
had<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> chance<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.449> try<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
had the chance to try out the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.790 
had the chance to try out the
pre-production<00:00:29.179> yz250<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.900> 2014<00:00:31.529> and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
pre-production yz250 for 2014 and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
pre-production yz250 for 2014 and
essentially<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.880> was<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.239> same<00:00:33.420> thing<00:00:33.570> that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
essentially it was the same thing that

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.870 
essentially it was the same thing that
we<00:00:33.809> tried<00:00:34.020> today<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.559> Yamaha<00:00:35.370> hadn't<00:00:35.730> gone

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
we tried today but Yamaha hadn't gone

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.940 
we tried today but Yamaha hadn't gone
into<00:00:36.149> full<00:00:36.750> production<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> basically

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
into full production with it basically

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.010 
into full production with it basically
they<00:00:38.070> did<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> limited<00:00:38.670> number<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.120> bikes<00:00:39.780> just

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
they did a limited number of bikes just

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.780 
they did a limited number of bikes just
to<00:00:40.230> run<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> bikes<00:00:40.890> through<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> system<00:00:41.579> make

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
to run the bikes through the system make

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.979 
to run the bikes through the system make
sure<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> manufacturing<00:00:42.899> side

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
sure on the manufacturing side

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.420 
sure on the manufacturing side
everything<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.559> great<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.309> went

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
everything was great and then they went

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.790 
everything was great and then they went
ahead<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.820> full<00:00:45.000> production<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:46.320> really

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
ahead with full production so not really

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.799 
ahead with full production so not really
any<00:00:46.920> tweaks<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.850> did<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.539> wanted

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
any tweaks that they did but they wanted

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.410 
any tweaks that they did but they wanted
to<00:00:48.870> bring<00:00:48.989> us<00:00:49.140> out<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.829> Alabama<00:00:50.460> ride

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
to bring us out here to Alabama ride

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.970 
to bring us out here to Alabama ride
something<00:00:51.719> completely<00:00:52.469> different<00:00:52.500> than

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
something completely different than

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.680 
something completely different than
California<00:00:53.100> most<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> tests<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.239> you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
California most of the tests that you

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.920 
California most of the tests that you
see<00:00:54.930> basically<00:00:55.530> across<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.670> motocross<00:00:57.390> media

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
see basically across the motocross media

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.319 
see basically across the motocross media
are<00:00:58.260> tracks<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.370> California<00:00:59.910> somewhere<00:01:00.239> in

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
are tracks in California somewhere in

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.779 
are tracks in California somewhere in
California<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.020> coming<00:01:01.829> out<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.190> another

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
California and coming out to another

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.780 
California and coming out to another
track<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:04.350> only<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> very<00:01:05.070> cool<00:01:05.250> experience

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
track is not only a very cool experience

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
track is not only a very cool experience
to<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> ride<00:01:06.390> some<00:01:06.600> new<00:01:06.689> soil<00:01:06.990> just

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
to get to ride some new soil just

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.929 
to get to ride some new soil just
experience<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> completely<00:01:08.790> different

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
experience a completely different

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:09.649 
experience a completely different

beyond<00:01:11.400> Nebraska<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.270> said<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.600> yet<00:01:12.750> was

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
beyond Nebraska you said that yet was

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.350 
beyond Nebraska you said that yet was
Nebraska<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.310> we're<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.580> Alabama<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.180> deep

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
Nebraska so we're in Alabama in the deep

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.060 
Nebraska so we're in Alabama in the deep
south<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.049> bit<00:01:16.619> different<00:01:16.950> than

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
south a little bit different than

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
south a little bit different than

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
Nebraska definitely a lot different than

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
Nebraska definitely a lot different than
California<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.280> important<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
California and I was just important to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.570 
California and I was just important to
be<00:01:21.330> able<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.540> try<00:01:22.020> out<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> bike<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
be able to try out a bike on a lot of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.429 
be able to try out a bike on a lot of
different<00:01:23.759> terrain<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.630> opinions<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
different terrain the opinions that you

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.179 
different terrain the opinions that you
hear<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:26.310> often<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.540> west<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.189> that

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
hear are often from out west and that

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
hear are often from out west and that
soil<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.759> actually<00:01:30.090> fairly<00:01:30.360> unique<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
soil is actually fairly unique to the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.039 
soil is actually fairly unique to the
rest<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> country<00:01:31.799> soil<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.939> here<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
rest of the country soil like here is a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.840 
rest of the country soil like here is a
bit<00:01:34.229> more<00:01:34.439> common<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.979> motocross<00:01:35.369> tracks<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
bit more common on motocross tracks a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.789 
bit more common on motocross tracks a
deeper<00:01:36.420> richer<00:01:36.780> soil<00:01:37.170> there's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> lot<00:01:37.650> more

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
deeper richer soil there's a lot more

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.679 
deeper richer soil there's a lot more
organic<00:01:38.250> material<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.570> we're

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
organic material in it right here we're

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.660 
organic material in it right here we're
actually<00:01:39.810> standing<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.350> front<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.860> sand

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
actually standing in front of the sand

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.219 
actually standing in front of the sand
track<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.689> yet<00:01:43.020> another

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
track that they have and yet another

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.929 
track that they have and yet another
thing<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.740> don't<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.399> west<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
thing that you don't get out west so

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.550 
thing that you don't get out west so
much<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.659> good<00:01:45.840> opportunity<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
much it's a really good opportunity to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.679 
much it's a really good opportunity to
come<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.799> try<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.850> bike<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.509> had

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
come out try out a bike that I had

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.940 
come out try out a bike that I had
already<00:01:48.810> formed<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.320> opinion<00:01:49.350> about<00:01:49.799> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
already formed my opinion about it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.440 
already formed my opinion about it
already<00:01:50.280> had<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> little<00:01:50.670> bit<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.000> an<00:01:51.119> idea<00:01:51.390> of

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
Yamaha is definitely a different bike

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.800 
Yamaha is definitely a different bike
since<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.160> copy<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.519> 450<00:02:10.149> design<00:02:10.509> and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
since I copy the 450 design and

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.360 
since I copy the 450 design and
different<00:02:11.500> track<00:02:11.709> took<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.950> while<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.220> get<00:02:12.340> used

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
different track took a while to get used

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.850 
different track took a while to get used
to<00:02:12.640> but<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.180> can't<00:02:13.810> believe<00:02:14.319> how<00:02:14.500> much<00:02:14.650> I

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
off with the bike of course everybody

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.460 
off with the bike of course everybody
knows<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.540> Yamaha<00:02:19.810> had<00:02:20.050> probably<00:02:20.319> most

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
knows that Yamaha had probably most

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.160 
knows that Yamaha had probably most
aging<00:02:20.860> motor<00:02:21.069> design<00:02:21.519> pretty<00:02:22.060> much<00:02:22.239> motor<00:02:23.019> is

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
aging motor design pretty much motor is

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.290 
aging motor design pretty much motor is
almost<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.860> shining<00:02:24.099> example<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.670> original<00:02:24.849> oh

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
almost a shining example the original oh

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.089 
almost a shining example the original oh
one<00:02:25.569> it's<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.380> swap<00:02:26.590> around<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.830> bunch<00:02:26.950> of

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
one it's you can swap around a bunch of

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.830 
one it's you can swap around a bunch of
parts<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.400> probably<00:02:27.670> make<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.910> run<00:02:28.060> still<00:02:28.300> I'm

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
parts and probably make it run still I'm

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.690 
parts and probably make it run still I'm
kind<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.260> happy<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.560> they<00:02:29.830> waited<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.549> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
kind of happy that they waited to do the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.789 
kind of happy that they waited to do the
fi<00:02:31.000> bike<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.420> lot<00:02:31.569> of<00:02:31.690> people<00:02:31.900> were<00:02:31.989> cramming

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
fi bike a lot of people were cramming

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.860 
fi bike a lot of people were cramming
for<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:33.459> I'm<00:02:33.970> happy<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.330> they<00:02:34.540> took<00:02:34.720> that

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
for it but I'm happy that they took that

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.930 
for it but I'm happy that they took that
first<00:02:35.080> three<00:02:35.650> years<00:02:35.830> with<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.190> 450<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.910> then

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
first three years with the 450 and then

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.640 
first three years with the 450 and then
waited<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.569> second<00:02:37.930> generation<00:02:38.230> cuz<00:02:38.560> I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
waited to the second generation cuz I

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.830 
waited to the second generation cuz I
think<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:39.099> really<00:02:39.670> transferred<00:02:40.299> over<00:02:40.599> quite

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
think it really transferred over quite

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.020 
think it really transferred over quite
well<00:02:40.870> into<00:02:41.349> this<00:02:41.440> bike<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:42.340> basically<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.819> is

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
well into this bike so basically this is

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.910 
well into this bike so basically this is
a<00:02:43.060> completely<00:02:43.630> redesigned<00:02:43.810> motor<00:02:44.319> for<00:02:44.560> Yamaha

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
a completely redesigned motor for Yamaha

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.580 
a completely redesigned motor for Yamaha
it's<00:02:45.910> now<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> four<00:02:46.420> valve<00:02:46.630> head<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.170> reverse

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
it's now a four valve head it's reverse

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.559 
it's now a four valve head it's reverse
like<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.920> 450<00:02:48.459> they<00:02:48.819> took<00:02:48.970> everything<00:02:49.329> they

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
like the 450 they took everything they

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.240 
like the 450 they took everything they
learned<00:02:49.810> there<00:02:50.019> you've<00:02:50.319> got<00:02:50.349> intake<00:02:50.799> up<00:02:50.980> front

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
learned there you've got intake up front

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.589 
learned there you've got intake up front
exhaust<00:02:51.730> come<00:02:51.970> out<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.180> back<00:02:52.329> wrapping

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
exhaust come out the back wrapping

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.910 
exhaust come out the back wrapping
around<00:02:52.989> for<00:02:53.319> anybody<00:02:53.440> doesn't<00:02:53.739> know<00:02:53.799> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
around for anybody doesn't know the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.319 
around for anybody doesn't know the
reason<00:02:54.190> why<00:02:54.280> they<00:02:54.340> did<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.730> with<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:54.910> engine

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
reason why they did that with the engine

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.180 
reason why they did that with the engine
one<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.630> main<00:02:55.810> reasons<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.709> intake

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
one of the main reasons is is the intake

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.220 
one of the main reasons is is the intake
now<00:02:57.459> has<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> straighter<00:02:58.150> shot<00:02:58.239> basically

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
now has a straighter shot basically

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.809 
now has a straighter shot basically
they're<00:02:59.410> looking<00:02:59.709> for<00:02:59.890> power<00:03:00.040> everybody's

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
they're looking for power everybody's

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.580 
they're looking for power everybody's
cram<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.239> they<00:03:01.390> need<00:03:01.599> a<00:03:01.630> better<00:03:01.900> engine<00:03:02.410> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
cram that they need a better engine and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.430 
cram that they need a better engine and
this<00:03:03.010> delivers<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.209> was<00:03:04.959> extremely

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.839 
ripped out of my hands going through a
turn<00:03:46.720> because<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.709> had<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.010> little<00:03:48.430> bit<00:03:48.639> more

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
turn because it had a little bit more

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.640

rutted turn and going up this hill

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.890 
rutted turn and going up this hill
that's<00:03:54.370> right<00:03:54.519> behind<00:03:54.849> us<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.269> let<00:03:55.599> go<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
clutch and the bike literally ripped out

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.870 
clutch and the bike literally ripped out
of<00:03:57.609> my<00:03:57.760> throttle<00:03:58.480> hand<00:03:58.660> which<00:03:58.840> I've<00:03:59.639> never<00:04:00.639> had

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
of my throttle hand which I've never had

of my throttle hand which I've never had
happen<00:04:01.239> before<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:01.840> that's<00:04:02.109> kind<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.650> cool

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
happen before so that's kind of cool

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.860 
happen before so that's kind of cool
experience<00:04:04.109> it<00:04:04.290> was<00:04:04.379> a<00:04:04.409> little<00:04:04.560> scary<00:04:05.659> but<00:04:06.659> you

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
experience it was a little scary but you

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.449 
experience it was a little scary but you
know<00:04:06.989> that's<00:04:07.140> more<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.620> testament<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
know that's more a testament to the

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.250 
know that's more a testament to the
power<00:04:08.609> and<00:04:09.060> less<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.629> testament<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.140> my

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
power and less of a testament to my

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.690 
power and less of a testament to my
skill<00:04:12.170> but<00:04:13.170> overall<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.709> think<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:14.159> power<00:04:14.340> is

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
skill but overall I think the power is

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.979 
skill but overall I think the power is
really<00:04:15.329> impressive

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
really impressive

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.140 
really impressive

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
the entire bike was actually extremely

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.540 
the entire bike was actually extremely
impressive<00:04:51.960> even<00:04:52.560> coming<00:04:52.919> down<00:04:53.039> to<00:04:53.190> still<00:04:53.400> how

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
impressive even coming down to still how

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.980 
impressive even coming down to still how
the<00:04:53.610> engine<00:04:54.090> makes<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.389> whole<00:04:54.539> bike<00:04:54.720> react

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
the engine makes the whole bike react

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.080 
the engine makes the whole bike react
more<00:04:55.139> power<00:04:55.380> it's<00:04:56.070> still<00:04:56.190> handled<00:04:56.699> amazing

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
more power it's still handled amazing

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.270 
more power it's still handled amazing
and<00:04:57.270> even<00:04:57.509> down<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.810> suspension<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.740> fact

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280

the bike a little more for me personally

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.210 
the bike a little more for me personally
and<00:05:57.900> make<00:05:58.199> it<00:05:58.289> a<00:05:58.320> little<00:05:58.409> more<00:05:58.530> stable<00:05:58.979> at<00:05:59.099> high

the standard Forks in motocross there
it's<00:06:04.169> just

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
it's just

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.250 
it's just
a<00:06:04.590> go-to<00:06:05.100> pork<00:06:05.550> that<00:06:05.760> I've<00:06:06.390> rarely<00:06:06.810> had<00:06:07.140> an

a go-to pork that I've rarely had an

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270

today<00:06:09.630> honestly<00:06:10.320> I<00:06:10.380> didn't<00:06:10.590> even<00:06:10.680> touch<00:06:10.890> the

today honestly I didn't even touch the
clickers<00:06:11.490> Michael<00:06:12.420> and<00:06:12.540> I<00:06:12.600> were<00:06:12.720> switching

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
clickers Michael and I were switching

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.590 
clickers Michael and I were switching
back<00:06:13.200> and<00:06:13.260> forth<00:06:13.470> between<00:06:13.680> sack<00:06:14.250> settings<00:06:14.940> but

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
back and forth between sack settings but

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.020 
back and forth between sack settings but
on<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:16.050> forks<00:06:16.380> I<00:06:16.650> was<00:06:17.190> totally<00:06:17.550> happy<00:06:17.670> with

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
on the forks I was totally happy with

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.310 
on the forks I was totally happy with
the<00:06:18.450> way<00:06:18.570> it<00:06:18.690> was<00:06:18.810> set<00:06:18.930> up

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
the way it was set up

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.350 
the way it was set up
I<00:06:19.350> think<00:06:19.830> they<00:06:19.920> hold<00:06:20.160> up<00:06:20.310> really<00:06:20.340> well<00:06:20.640> the

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
I think they hold up really well the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.210 
I think they hold up really well the
stroke<00:06:21.630> is<00:06:21.780> super<00:06:22.080> smooth<00:06:22.410> they<00:06:22.740> never<00:06:22.920> blow

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
stroke is super smooth they never blow

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.370 
stroke is super smooth they never blow
through<00:06:23.550> it's<00:06:24.150> just<00:06:24.360> one<00:06:24.870> of<00:06:24.960> those<00:06:25.020> Forks

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
through it's just one of those Forks

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.930 
through it's just one of those Forks
that<00:06:25.530> is<00:06:25.680> super<00:06:26.040> predictable<00:06:26.280> the<00:06:26.580> rear<00:06:26.760> end

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
that is super predictable the rear end

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.690 
that is super predictable the rear end
also<00:06:27.750> is<00:06:27.900> a<00:06:28.110> really<00:06:28.770> really<00:06:28.950> stable<00:06:29.250> bike<00:06:29.550> I

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
also is a really really stable bike I

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.160 
also is a really really stable bike I
was<00:06:29.790> talking<00:06:30.090> about<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.420> handling<00:06:30.720> in<00:06:30.870> turns

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
was talking about the handling in turns

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.510 
was talking about the handling in turns
but<00:06:31.920> the<00:06:32.390> bonus<00:06:33.390> of<00:06:33.690> having<00:06:34.200> that<00:06:34.800> like<00:06:35.310> that

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
but the bonus of having that like that

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.700 
but the bonus of having that like that
wants<00:06:36.090> to<00:06:36.120> push<00:06:36.330> a<00:06:36.570> tiny<00:06:36.810> bit<00:06:37.020> is<00:06:37.230> that<00:06:37.260> in<00:06:37.620> a

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
wants to push a tiny bit is that in a

wants to push a tiny bit is that in a
straight<00:06:38.010> this<00:06:38.370> thing<00:06:38.550> is<00:06:38.820> amazingly<00:06:39.750> stable

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
straight this thing is amazingly stable

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.020 
straight this thing is amazingly stable
weight<00:06:40.440> real<00:06:40.860> complaint<00:06:41.310> I<00:06:41.460> have<00:06:41.640> is<00:06:41.669> two

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
weight real complaint I have is two

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.520 
weight real complaint I have is two
little<00:06:42.270> things<00:06:42.450> the<00:06:42.600> front<00:06:42.840> end<00:06:42.960> push<00:06:43.169> and<00:06:43.380> the

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
little things the front end push and the

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.159 
little things the front end push and the
Yamaha<00:06:43.950> is<00:06:44.070> still<00:06:44.430> the<00:06:45.180> set<00:06:45.419> up<00:06:45.540> they<00:06:45.690> use<00:06:45.900> is

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
Yamaha is still the set up they use is

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.710 
Yamaha is still the set up they use is
definitely<00:06:46.830> different<00:06:47.190> than<00:06:47.580> any<00:06:47.910> other<00:06:48.210> bike

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
definitely different than any other bike

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.900 
definitely different than any other bike
you<00:06:48.900> can<00:06:49.080> clearly<00:06:49.320> look<00:06:49.560> at<00:06:49.650> see<00:06:49.860> it<00:06:50.130> takes<00:06:50.730> a

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
you can clearly look at see it takes a

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.120 
you can clearly look at see it takes a
little<00:06:51.060> bit<00:06:51.180> getting<00:06:51.270> used<00:06:51.570> to<00:06:51.900> this<00:06:52.650> is<00:06:52.890> still

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
little bit getting used to this is still

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.680 
little bit getting used to this is still
a<00:06:53.160> huge<00:06:53.490> step<00:06:53.820> in<00:06:53.880> the<00:06:53.940> right<00:06:54.030> direction<00:06:54.120> I<00:06:54.630> can

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
a huge step in the right direction I can

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.350 
a huge step in the right direction I can
be<00:06:55.080> say<00:06:55.260> this<00:06:55.800> is<00:06:56.010> the<00:06:56.130> most<00:06:56.310> improved<00:06:56.820> bike<00:06:57.090> I

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
be say this is the most improved bike I

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.450 
be say this is the most improved bike I
think<00:06:57.390> I<00:06:57.750> have<00:06:57.900> ridden<00:06:58.320> in<00:06:58.440> a<00:06:58.530> long<00:06:58.560> time<00:06:59.190> from

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
think I have ridden in a long time from

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.700 
think I have ridden in a long time from
just<00:06:59.730> a<00:06:59.820> one-year<00:07:00.090> change<00:07:00.570> ow<00:07:00.780> my<00:07:00.900> foot<00:07:01.169> is<00:07:01.410> so

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
just a one-year change ow my foot is so

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.520 
just a one-year change ow my foot is so
far<00:07:01.980> in<00:07:02.010> the<00:07:02.160> correct<00:07:02.460> direction
