thick and then when it's set of course

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.730 
thick and then when it's set of course
you<00:03:20.700> can<00:03:20.850> easily<00:03:21.240> use<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.960> snowplows<00:03:22.350> effect

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740

and I send it to the grave grab by
special<00:03:24.660> summoning<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.470> works<00:03:25.620> with<00:03:25.770> that

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
special summoning and it works with that

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.320 
special summoning and it works with that
where<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.400> can<00:03:26.610> of<00:03:26.790> course<00:03:26.820> get<00:03:27.300> a

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
where you can of course get a

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.670 
where you can of course get a
machine-type<00:03:27.780> monster<00:03:28.050> engraver<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.440> add<00:03:28.590> it

to your hand I have I see this working
out<00:03:31.320> really<00:03:31.740> well<00:03:31.860> actually<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.760> yeah<00:03:32.910> what<00:03:33.330> do

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
out really well actually so yeah what do

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.030 
out really well actually so yeah what do
you<00:03:33.480> guys<00:03:33.570> think<00:03:33.840> about<00:03:34.290> these<00:03:34.500> cards<00:03:34.890> which

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
you guys think about these cards which

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.620 
you guys think about these cards which
one<00:03:35.190> do<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.550> best<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.120> kind<00:03:36.540> of

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
one do you think is the best I kind of

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.850 
one do you think is the best I kind of
like<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> night<00:03:36.960> Express<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.680> see<00:03:37.830> that

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
like the night Express that I see that

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.860 
like the night Express that I see that
one<00:03:38.130> being<00:03:38.340> probably<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.060> better<00:03:39.390> card<00:03:39.750> of

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
one being probably the better card of

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.330 
one being probably the better card of
three<00:03:40.320> just<00:03:40.530> because<00:03:40.740> I<00:03:40.770> can<00:03:40.980> see<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.190> working

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
three just because I can see it working

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.340 
three just because I can see it working
easily<00:03:41.640> with<00:03:41.910> like<00:03:42.060> maybe<00:03:42.600> like<00:03:42.750> skill<00:03:43.050> drain

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
easily with like maybe like skill drain

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.410 
easily with like maybe like skill drain
or<00:03:43.770> something<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.550> don't<00:03:44.610> know<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.760> kind<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.300> like

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
or something I don't know I kind of like

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.730 
or something I don't know I kind of like
because<00:03:45.600> there's<00:03:45.750> not<00:03:45.870> as<00:03:45.959> much<00:03:46.080> restrictions

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
because there's not as much restrictions

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.340 
because there's not as much restrictions
on<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.610> just<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.480> normal<00:03:48.690> summon<00:03:49.020> really<00:03:49.230> and

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
on it just a normal summon really and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.290 
on it just a normal summon really and
then<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.500> get<00:03:49.590> an<00:03:49.709> easy<00:03:49.860> level<00:03:50.520> 10<00:03:50.850> monster

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
then you get an easy level 10 monster

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.970 
then you get an easy level 10 monster
and<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.810> course<00:03:51.990> it's<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.350> night<00:03:52.500> card<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:52.860> I'm<00:03:52.950> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
little biased on that right I have to go

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.890 
little biased on that right I have to go
with<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.590> night<00:03:55.740> card<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.160> it's<00:03:56.459> law<00:03:56.840> see<00:03:57.840> you

three cards thank you for watching of

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.760 
three cards thank you for watching of
course<00:04:00.570> like<00:04:00.870> i<00:04:00.959> said<00:04:01.140> i<00:04:01.170> really<00:04:01.650> do<00:04:01.740> think

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
course like i said i really do think

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.870 
course like i said i really do think
we're<00:04:02.070> going<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:02.550> in<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.990> over<00:04:03.990> here

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
we're going to get this in a over here

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.750 
we're going to get this in a over here
I'm<00:04:05.880> i<00:04:06.090> would<00:04:06.390> really<00:04:06.540> assume<00:04:06.959> like<00:04:07.260> not<00:04:07.760> march

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
I'm i would really assume like not march

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.820 
I'm i would really assume like not march
would<00:04:09.270> be<00:04:09.420> my<00:04:09.540> guess<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.990> think<00:04:10.200> that's<00:04:10.350> usually

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
would be my guess I think that's usually

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.110 
would be my guess I think that's usually
when<00:04:11.010> we<00:04:11.100> got<00:04:11.280> some<00:04:11.520> of<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.670> older<00:04:11.910> games

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
when we got some of the older games

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.030 
when we got some of the older games
that's<00:04:13.080> gonna<00:04:13.230> be<00:04:13.290> my<00:04:13.440> guess<00:04:13.590> I'm<00:04:13.740> gonna<00:04:13.890> get

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
that's gonna be my guess I'm gonna get

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.260 
that's gonna be my guess I'm gonna get
some<00:04:14.160> March<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:14.550> I<00:04:14.640> really<00:04:14.850> do<00:04:14.940> think<00:04:15.030> I'll<00:04:15.180> be

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
some March but I really do think I'll be

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.970 
some March but I really do think I'll be
early<00:04:15.540> next<00:04:15.720> year<00:04:15.900> really<00:04:16.440> hope<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:16.890> I'm

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
early next year really hope so and I'm

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.560 
early next year really hope so and I'm
also<00:04:17.130> hoping<00:04:17.520> maybe<00:04:17.910> they'll<00:04:18.120> bring<00:04:18.209> over<00:04:18.480> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
also hoping maybe they'll bring over the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.420 
also hoping maybe they'll bring over the
Digimon<00:04:19.020> games<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.739> cardfight<00:04:19.979> vanguard
