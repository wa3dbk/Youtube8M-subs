00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
TV on the wall but what do you think

about that well I think that's obviously
a<00:01:42.010> solution<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.520> lot<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.700> people<00:01:42.910> go<00:01:43.060> with<00:01:43.240> but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
a solution a lot of people go with but

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.750 
a solution a lot of people go with but
it<00:01:43.570> causes<00:01:43.810> problems<00:01:44.410> associated<00:01:44.770> with<00:01:45.130> what

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
it causes problems associated with what

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.460 
it causes problems associated with what
you<00:01:45.820> do<00:01:45.940> with<00:01:46.030> your<00:01:46.090> wires<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:47.080> what<00:01:47.350> do<00:01:47.410> you

which<00:02:09.010> is<00:02:09.040> an<00:02:09.250> open<00:02:09.460> living<00:02:09.580> space<00:02:09.729> going<00:02:10.479> on

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
which is an open living space going on

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.960 
which is an open living space going on
to<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> kitchen<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:12.220> has<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> swivel<00:02:12.700> mount

solution<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.320> TV<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.739> be<00:02:14.770> basically

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
solution so the TV can be basically

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.949 
solution so the TV can be basically
pointing<00:02:15.760> towards<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.090> viewers<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.630> then

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
pointing towards the viewers and then

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.229 
pointing towards the viewers and then
also<00:02:17.110> rotate<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.860> if<00:02:18.550> you're<00:02:18.730> standing<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
also rotate to if you're standing in the

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.580 
also rotate to if you're standing in the
kitchen<00:02:19.360> or<00:02:19.690> when<00:02:19.870> we<00:02:19.959> have<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.110> party<00:02:20.440> like

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
we're having it gives optimum viewing oh

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.540 
we're having it gives optimum viewing oh
that's<00:02:23.110> gonna<00:02:23.260> be<00:02:23.350> great<00:02:23.860> yeah<00:02:24.130> everyone's
