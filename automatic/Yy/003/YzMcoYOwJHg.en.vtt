00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.020

 I am I have him and I am 19 years old 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.040

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.590
 so the ice unfortunately 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.010
 17 years my first year so 7 seasons 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.010
 just 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.330
 last Saturday fc received Groningen 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.100
 a1 and shivered fc utrecht a1 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.840
 we are following 2 FC players this afternoon 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.710
 groningen a1 right winger i just here 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.600
 mennega 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.409
 and central defender thijs gerlofs me 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.220
 did n't actually come like 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.519
 midfielder 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.930
 from gcs i want to do i have changed 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.879
 say defending in a style then 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.830
 for me this is striking today 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.659
 strong they played it is the music 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.580
 heart's content about being good at 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.339
 duels and close well a few times 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.540
 we also interfere with organization 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.729
 so for that matter if I am there today 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.619
 very satisfied with it is all young 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.739
 boys 17 years younger 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.030
 yes they first you a junior so push so 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.220
 if you continue like this next year 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.340
 and that's what it's all about 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.049
 of course I am now nice and 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.759
 at that time she has now played her so 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.130
 my very happy with it 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.030
 every minute i make yes i can learn 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.180
 learn from 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.829
 so yes certainly when sickness peace 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.579
 Gerlofs can also satisfy Kevin Mennega 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.109
 to be 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.090
 last season he came out regularly 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.590
 for FC Groningen and A1 this season 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.950
 He has become a permanent basis 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.500
 power 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.670
 it is my the 8 sixes in the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.720
 youth throughput 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.310
 from this I think I have an excellent 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.970
 experienced development in a technical 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.850
 skillful 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.410
 from speed then the overview can be good 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.450
 so run free 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.440
 and intentions of our football game that the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.910
 he has 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.040
 I just think he also looked like a him 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.480
 again I have to grow up and saw that 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.680
 today you will be here more often 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.390
 trumped 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.890
 then I still have to work on it 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.810
 mennega can do that since this season 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.460
 with the promises of FC Groningen 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.530
 he is regularly a member of the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.370
 selection of young fc groningen in the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.700
 trainer 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.080
 So you can join competitions every week 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.670
 buy sure it will work 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.870
 how is that to train with and then off 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.560
 We join in the promise 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.660
 shake is heavy quality high is also 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.830
 you first add players 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.330
 yes, you have to measure the training 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.070
 what god ever more sought 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.350
 I can also talk to the boys at the 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.330
 promises we carry there is also on the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.280
 euroborg with players from the first entrance 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.750
 of course daily with each other both 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.340
 a nice goal list are well know how 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.560
 you may smell the next step then 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.240
 to mark yes certainly 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.610
 make sure that still will happen 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.709
 I should therefore so far Gerlofs yet 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.660
 not though he has well in mind 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.640
 which steps he wants to take soon 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.860
 I think especially if you like the legs 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.269
 and then must be just silent by senior 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.190
 that you mainly need maturity 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.769
 so just get business football 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.570
 really just about gain weight and me 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.160
 think just the biggest step is bad 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.530
 away from the a-string the seniors 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.940
 so in any case must make for whim or 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.650
 is it this season as freshmen 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.390
 a-junior especially important so much 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.590
 possible experience in the one 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.209
 from fc groningen 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.450
 I think of making as much playing time 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.890
 much possible and and tried to out 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.040
 build to just a really basic place 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.410
 and hopefully the minutes or 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.200
 train train help from blog will 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.900
 I also care about how fast it goes there 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.760
 because the experience is also better 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.720
 fit after one then continue through 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.739
 grow faster 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.209
 I don't have a fixed base yet 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.769
 handy as he was no possession only yes 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.880
 I think I did pretty well 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.890
 today 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.570
 so I will definitely take it back with comfort 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.700
 the next best members 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.900
 fc groningen a1 lost 2 0 on Saturday 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.459
 from fc utrecht 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.770
 The result is that the Paula van Nou team 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.360
 has dropped to 9th place but the gap 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.670
 with number five fc twente is only two 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.410
 points and therefore remains 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.209
 luke positive about the possibilities this 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.099
 season I just think fits again 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.090
 the tab our target as seventh 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.610
 well i think we are a little bit now 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.250
 have fallen that that objective is 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.250
 that certainly achievable if she can still be 5
