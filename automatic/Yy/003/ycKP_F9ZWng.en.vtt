00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
6 device so solo comparison side-by-side

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.670 
6 device so solo comparison side-by-side
and<00:02:55.370> they<00:02:56.370> also<00:02:56.460> come<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:56.760> these<00:02:56.970> little

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
green flashes we have the red carbon

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.380 
green flashes we have the red carbon
fiber<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.950> match<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.460> theme<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:03.030> the

fiber red on black goes amazing with the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.440 
fiber red on black goes amazing with the
black<00:03:23.680> background<00:03:25.470> as<00:03:26.470> far<00:03:26.680> as<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.450> carbon

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
final skin off the device so you can

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.790 
final skin off the device so you can
always<00:04:27.960> change<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.140> out<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.470> not<00:04:29.560> have<00:04:29.710> to

worry about hitting off any of the
sticky<00:04:32.380> residue<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:33.820> that's<00:04:33.970> awesome<00:04:34.740> um<00:04:36.900> also

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900
