supposed<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> better<00:00:35.130> case<00:00:35.809> as<00:00:36.809> far<00:00:37.050> as

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
supposed to be a better case as far as

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.830

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
resistance according to this it's

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.790 
resistance according to this it's
waterproof<00:00:42.300> dirt<00:00:42.780> proofs<00:00:43.079> no<00:00:43.320> proof<00:00:43.559> and

waterproof dirt proofs no proof and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.209 
waterproof dirt proofs no proof and
shockproof<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.789> let's<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:46.050> see<00:00:46.950> how<00:00:47.010> good<00:00:47.160> of

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
shockproof so let's just see how good of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.709 
shockproof so let's just see how good of
a<00:00:47.340> case<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.980> give<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> nice<00:00:50.719> pretty

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
the ambient light sensor connections all

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.800 
the ambient light sensor connections all
are<00:03:09.170> available<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.940> course<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.390> front<00:03:11.600> firing

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
are available of course the front firing

camera<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.350> there<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.000> generation<00:03:14.420> 2

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
camera is there this is the generation 2

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.949 
camera is there this is the generation 2
case<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:16.220> has<00:03:16.400> these<00:03:16.610> little<00:03:16.820> extra<00:03:17.269> nubs<00:03:17.540> here

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
case it has these little extra nubs here

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.039 
case it has these little extra nubs here
so<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:18.769> if<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:18.950> do<00:03:19.100> drop<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.549> phone<00:03:19.790> on<00:03:20.540> its

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
so that if you do drop the phone on its

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.789 
so that if you do drop the phone on its
side<00:03:21.700> it'll<00:03:22.700> protect<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:24.049> buttons

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
side it'll protect the the buttons

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.370 
side it'll protect the the buttons
because<00:03:25.250> where<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.329> buttons<00:03:26.630> work<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:27.110> if<00:03:27.290> you

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
because where the buttons work is if you

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.900 
because where the buttons work is if you
see<00:03:27.560> inside<00:03:27.860> here<00:03:27.920> they<00:03:28.250> got<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.430> little<00:03:28.730> piece

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
see inside here they got a little piece

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.690 
see inside here they got a little piece
of<00:03:28.970> insert<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.660> when<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.930> slide<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:30.700> you

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
of insert that when you slide this you

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.509 
of insert that when you slide this you
physically<00:03:32.299> actually<00:03:32.720> slide<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.650> switch

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
physically actually slide a switch

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.210 
physically actually slide a switch
inside<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.239> out<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:36.470> you're<00:03:36.620> sliding<00:03:36.920> the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
inside and out so you're sliding the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.330 
inside and out so you're sliding the
switch<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:38.299> actually<00:03:38.660> just<00:03:38.709> toggle<00:03:39.709> this<00:03:40.100> or

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
switch you actually just toggle this or

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.189 
switch you actually just toggle this or
roll<00:03:40.609> it<00:03:40.639> one<00:03:41.060> direction<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.660> other<00:03:41.780> to

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
roll it one direction to the other to

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.910 
roll it one direction to the other to
switch

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
switch

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.370 
switch
so<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.520> supposedly<00:03:44.910> makes<00:03:45.210> us<00:03:45.420> waterproof<00:03:45.990> so

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
so the supposedly makes us waterproof so

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.290 
so the supposedly makes us waterproof so
I'm<00:03:46.890> not<00:03:47.040> exactly<00:03:47.370> sure<00:03:47.550> how<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.060> going

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
I'm not exactly sure how this is going

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.320 
I'm not exactly sure how this is going
to<00:03:48.390> work<00:03:48.920> but<00:03:49.920> there's<00:03:50.400> special<00:03:50.910> type<00:03:51.300> of

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
to work but there's special type of

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.240 
to work but there's special type of
material<00:03:51.900> down<00:03:52.050> inside<00:03:52.440> these<00:03:52.620> holes<00:03:52.890> here

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
material down inside these holes here

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.320 
material down inside these holes here
and<00:03:53.280> here<00:03:54.240> that<00:03:55.200> still<00:03:55.650> allows<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:56.330> earpiece

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
and here that still allows the earpiece

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.760 
and here that still allows the earpiece
to<00:03:57.540> work<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:57.990> microphone<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.740> the

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
to work and the microphone and the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.180 
to work and the microphone and the
speakers<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.220> work<00:04:00.500> but<00:04:01.500> still<00:04:01.770> keeping<00:04:02.100> the

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
speakers to work but still keeping the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.210 
speakers to work but still keeping the
water<00:04:02.400> out<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.780> I'm<00:04:03.900> kind<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.260> anxious<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.770> see

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.610 
water out so I'm kind of anxious to see
exactly<00:04:05.580> how<00:04:05.850> that<00:04:05.910> works<00:04:08.210> they<00:04:09.210> give<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.540> a

work<00:05:13.980> properly<00:05:14.160> so<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.990> can<00:05:16.140> see<00:05:16.350> that

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
work properly so you can see that

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.340 
work properly so you can see that
there's<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.830> little<00:05:17.730> ring<00:05:18.000> yellow<00:05:18.900> ring<00:05:19.200> in

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
there's a little ring yellow ring in

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.090 
there's a little ring yellow ring in
here<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:20.880> supposedly<00:05:21.419> protects<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.110> this

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
here that supposedly protects it this

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.900 
here that supposedly protects it this
material<00:05:23.669> isn't<00:05:24.240> very<00:05:24.780> thick<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:26.280> it's<00:05:26.760> not

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
material isn't very thick and it's not

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.360 
material isn't very thick and it's not
very<00:05:27.090> heavy<00:05:27.390> so<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.350> don't<00:05:28.620> know<00:05:28.740> exactly<00:05:29.160> sure

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
very heavy so I don't know exactly sure

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.980 
very heavy so I don't know exactly sure
how<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.820> has<00:05:30.000> been<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.270> work<00:05:30.480> as<00:05:30.660> far<00:05:30.900> as

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
how this has been to work as far as

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.590 
how this has been to work as far as
sealing<00:05:31.380> this<00:05:31.530> from<00:05:31.770> water<00:05:32.330> they<00:05:33.330> say<00:05:33.510> it

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
sealing this from water they say it

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.350 
sealing this from water they say it
works<00:05:33.780> really<00:05:33.960> well<00:05:34.080> but<00:05:34.860> I<00:05:35.310> wouldn't<00:05:36.180> want<00:05:36.330> to

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
works really well but I wouldn't want to

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.320 
works really well but I wouldn't want to
try<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.690> unless<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:37.830> know<00:05:38.280> is<00:05:38.460> by<00:05:38.640> accidental

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
try it unless you know is by accidental

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.030 
try it unless you know is by accidental
I<00:05:39.450> see<00:05:39.720> a<00:05:39.750> lot<00:05:39.810> of<00:05:39.930> YouTube<00:05:40.380> videos<00:05:40.740> where

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
I see a lot of YouTube videos where

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.980 
I see a lot of YouTube videos where
people<00:05:41.280> are<00:05:41.940> deliberately<00:05:42.390> putting<00:05:42.630> this<00:05:42.840> in

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
people are deliberately putting this in

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.130 
people are deliberately putting this in
the<00:05:43.080> water<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:45.030> taking<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:45.540> under<00:05:45.780> under

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
the water and taking it under under

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.580 
the water and taking it under under
water<00:05:46.380> but<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:46.880> I<00:05:47.880> frankly<00:05:48.419> I'm<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.080> little<00:05:49.110> leery

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
water but I I frankly I'm a little leery

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.779 
water but I I frankly I'm a little leery
about<00:05:49.710> doing<00:05:50.190> that<00:05:50.370> so<00:05:50.990> so<00:05:51.990> anyway<00:05:52.260> here's<00:05:52.590> the

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
about doing that so so anyway here's the

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.120 
about doing that so so anyway here's the
case<00:05:53.789> itself<00:05:54.210> there's<00:05:55.169> not<00:05:55.320> much<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.770> it<00:05:55.800> for

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
case itself there's not much to it for

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.190 
case itself there's not much to it for

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.230 
80
you<00:05:58.200> really<00:05:58.560> don't<00:05:58.740> get<00:05:58.890> a<00:05:58.950> lot<00:05:59.160> of<00:05:59.240> substance

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
you really don't get a lot of substance

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.990 
you really don't get a lot of substance
but<00:06:01.170> hopefully<00:06:01.620> you<00:06:01.770> get<00:06:01.980> a<00:06:02.490> lot<00:06:02.970> of

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
but hopefully you get a lot of

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.670 
but hopefully you get a lot of
protection<00:06:03.920> I'm<00:06:04.920> hoping<00:06:05.340> that<00:06:05.400> this<00:06:06.060> will

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
protection I'm hoping that this will

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.170 
protection I'm hoping that this will
protect<00:06:07.680> my<00:06:08.010> case<00:06:08.280> as<00:06:08.490> well<00:06:08.670> as<00:06:08.760> my<00:06:08.910> otterbox

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
protect my case as well as my otterbox

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.680 
protect my case as well as my otterbox
does<00:06:09.690> I<00:06:10.310> haven't<00:06:11.310> tested<00:06:11.550> my<00:06:11.880> header<00:06:12.060> box<00:06:12.330> by

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
does I haven't tested my header box by

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.860 
does I haven't tested my header box by
dropping<00:06:13.140> it<00:06:13.230> but<00:06:13.970> it<00:06:14.970> gets<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.480> otterbox

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
dropping it but it gets the otterbox

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.110 
dropping it but it gets the otterbox
gets<00:06:16.140> good<00:06:16.350> reviews<00:06:16.500> but<00:06:17.070> as<00:06:17.670> far<00:06:17.820> as<00:06:17.880> being

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
gets good reviews but as far as being

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.260 
gets good reviews but as far as being
water<00:06:18.360> resistant<00:06:18.930> it<00:06:19.380> is<00:06:19.590> not<00:06:20.060> this<00:06:21.060> will

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
water resistant it is not this will

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.180 
water resistant it is not this will
protect<00:06:21.420> all<00:06:21.780> the<00:06:21.930> ports<00:06:22.260> from<00:06:22.470> dust<00:06:22.800> and

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
protect all the ports from dust and

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.230 
protect all the ports from dust and
water<00:06:23.850> and<00:06:24.120> debris<00:06:25.220> so<00:06:26.220> let's<00:06:26.910> hope<00:06:27.120> it

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
water and debris so let's hope it

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.160 
water and debris so let's hope it
doesn't<00:06:27.420> impede<00:06:27.870> its<00:06:28.080> use<00:06:28.940> that<00:06:29.940> got<00:06:30.570> 14<00:06:30.990> days

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
doesn't impede its use that got 14 days

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.530 
doesn't impede its use that got 14 days
to<00:06:31.200> return<00:06:31.350> if<00:06:32.000> for<00:06:33.000> some<00:06:33.030> reason<00:06:33.180> I'm<00:06:33.480> not

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
to return if for some reason I'm not

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.940 
to return if for some reason I'm not
satisfied<00:06:34.110> with<00:06:34.140> it<00:06:34.610> so<00:06:35.610> thanks
