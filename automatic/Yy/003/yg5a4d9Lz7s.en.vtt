today we give us any ideas of what

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.920 
today we give us any ideas of what
information<00:02:22.209> do<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.750> got<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:24.150> wow<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.750> think

information do you got that wow I think

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.509 
information do you got that wow I think
the<00:02:25.989> best<00:02:26.140> knowledge<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.860> ability<00:02:27.190> to

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
the best knowledge is the ability to

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.400 
the best knowledge is the ability to
pick<00:02:27.670> out<00:02:27.819> any<00:02:28.299> more<00:02:28.540> system<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.110> would<00:02:29.230> work

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
pick out any more system that would work

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.289 
pick out any more system that would work

Ravel<00:02:38.379> just<00:02:39.099> a<00:02:39.220> little<00:02:39.370> bit<00:02:39.579> when<00:02:39.730> we<00:02:39.819> do<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.120> so

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
Ravel just a little bit when we do it so

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.030 
Ravel just a little bit when we do it so
i<00:02:40.959> think<00:02:41.110> that's<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.440> main<00:02:41.590> thing<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.860> just

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
i think that's the main thing is just

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.770 
i think that's the main thing is just
let<00:02:42.640> them<00:02:42.819> know<00:02:42.970> way<00:02:43.239> ahead<00:02:43.359> of<00:02:43.510> time<00:02:43.750> and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
let them know way ahead of time and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.009 
let them know way ahead of time and
we've<00:02:44.049> got<00:02:44.200> all<00:02:44.349> our<00:02:44.379> staff<00:02:44.650> here<00:02:44.859> today<00:02:46.019> and

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
we've got all our staff here today and

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.170 
we've got all our staff here today and
so<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.190> upcoming<00:02:48.310> months<00:02:48.609> i<00:02:48.940> think<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
so in the upcoming months i think the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.759 
so in the upcoming months i think the
transition<00:02:49.660> will<00:02:49.750> be<00:02:49.780> easier<00:02:50.170> because<00:02:50.349> we<00:02:50.590> did

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
transition will be easier because we did

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.030 
transition will be easier because we did
that<00:02:51.030> but<00:02:52.030> no<00:02:52.239> long<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.590> start<00:02:53.920> doing

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
that but no long and to start doing

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.440 
that but no long and to start doing
teach<00:02:54.340> our<00:02:54.519> eyes<00:02:54.730> they're<00:02:55.030> doing<00:02:55.359> that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
teach our eyes they're doing that

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.720 
teach our eyes they're doing that
already<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:56.709> asked<00:02:56.859> them<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.280> start<00:02:57.549> key

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
already we asked them to start key

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.129 
already we asked them to start key
prescribing<00:02:58.150> if<00:02:58.569> they<00:02:58.750> aren't<00:02:58.900> doing<00:02:59.049> that

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
prescribing if they aren't doing that

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.440 
prescribing if they aren't doing that
already<00:02:59.410> we<00:03:00.190> gave<00:03:00.370> them<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.609> hand<00:03:01.060> out<00:03:01.180> and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
already we gave them a hand out and

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.970 
already we gave them a hand out and
basically<00:03:01.959> walking<00:03:02.290> through<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.650> steps<00:03:02.829> of

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
basically walking through the steps of

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.539 
basically walking through the steps of
how<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.190> do<00:03:03.370> those<00:03:03.489> processes<00:03:04.150> we<00:03:04.900> also<00:03:05.549> really

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
how to do those processes we also really

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.520 
how to do those processes we also really
gave<00:03:06.730> them<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.060> guide<00:03:07.329> and<00:03:07.599> steps<00:03:08.139> on<00:03:08.290> how<00:03:08.500> to

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
gave them a guide and steps on how to

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.349 
gave them a guide and steps on how to
implement<00:03:08.769> their<00:03:09.280> EHR<00:03:09.730> they<00:03:10.030> haven't<00:03:10.329> done

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
implement their EHR they haven't done

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.379 
implement their EHR they haven't done
that<00:03:10.480> are<00:03:12.069> about<00:03:12.250> actually<00:03:12.669> ketosis<00:03:13.150> and

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
that are about actually ketosis and

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.089 
that are about actually ketosis and
how<00:03:13.750> important<00:03:14.200> because<00:03:14.349> it's<00:03:14.950> actually

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
how important because it's actually

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.180 
how important because it's actually
coming<00:03:15.489> up<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.060> without<00:03:16.799> doctors<00:03:17.799> meeting
