00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
not i'll probably be disappointed but

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.550 
not i'll probably be disappointed but
it's<00:04:08.760> an<00:04:08.880> ebay<00:04:09.090> purchase<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.660> who<00:04:10.200> knows<00:04:10.350> what

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
it's an ebay purchase so who knows what

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.560 
it's an ebay purchase so who knows what
it<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:12.230> because<00:04:13.230> there's<00:04:13.470> lots<00:04:14.070> of<00:04:14.160> those<00:04:14.570> okay

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
it is because there's lots of those okay

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.320 
it is because there's lots of those okay
he<00:04:15.959> filled<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.470> okay<00:04:17.250> i<00:04:17.280> think<00:04:17.400> i<00:04:17.700> think<00:04:17.910> i<00:04:18.150> see

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
he filled it okay i think i think i see

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330 
he filled it okay i think i think i see
the<00:04:18.989> looks<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.410> national<00:04:19.769> treasures<00:04:20.099> card
