the lead right now at first I started

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.810 
the lead right now at first I started
kind<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.170> slow<00:02:52.410> cuz<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.710> wasn't<00:02:52.980> sure<00:02:53.160> what<00:02:53.370> my

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
kind of slow cuz I wasn't sure what my

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.450 
kind of slow cuz I wasn't sure what my
plan<00:02:54.060> was<00:02:54.090> gonna<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.570> but<00:02:55.380> then<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:56.010> noticed

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.400 
plan was gonna be but then I noticed
that<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.850> water<00:02:57.150> helps<00:02:57.600> shrivel<00:02:58.170> up<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that the water helps shrivel up the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.740 
that the water helps shrivel up the
balls<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.950> my<00:02:59.130> mouth<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.730> would<00:03:00.420> end<00:03:00.600> up

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
balls in my mouth so I would end up

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.210 
balls in my mouth so I would end up
putting<00:03:00.900> two<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.410> three<00:03:01.650> sometimes<00:03:02.160> four

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
putting two to three sometimes four
