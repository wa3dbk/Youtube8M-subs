 so should this red led

 indicating its battery is in polarity 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.979
 correct and ready to load 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.450
 case it would be connected with the polarity 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.930

 feed 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:30.440
 we can regulate at two more voltages 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.440
 slow 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:39.090
 we can also regulate the 7 good one

 we will use the cable

 to argue breaker connect 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:13.640
 in the final power supply

 does not display on the back door of our 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:33.640
