00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:17.430
 the crowd where there is certain controversy 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.830
 by daniel alves do neymar aÃ­do da 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.720
 hashtag are all monkeys is the body 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.510
 much like a good that I do not 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.240
 I agree but so at least on my 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.540
 opinion that seems to want to show this 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.920
 so the message we are all equal we 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.320
 we were all monkeys we are all the same and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.680
 it is precisely here that you do not agree 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.680
 I think we 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.490
 just all different but how am 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.670
 other than earth, it starts from being 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.510
 human diversity so that this right 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.870
 our different ones and it's not all a 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:16.910
 issue in respect 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.410
 by the opinions of the gurus respect 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.780
 by other people 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.530
 this respect is missing not only as the guy 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.950
 take a banana in the stadium no more 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.560
 as one supporter attacked the other for 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.290
 cause of football that basically you 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.280
 continuous twisting billboards post 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.280
 this is normal 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.060
 even a few chances while cheering me 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.560
 I think normal 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.619
 now when you leave for the aggression 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.720
 even the violence is already there in a 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:55.090
 most justifiable size you no longer 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.569
 is respecting so in there you dine 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.520
 respecting to continue another person, right? 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:04.970
 because he liked a team you like 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.860
 the other in this specific event 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.039
 that's a thousand niggs 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.910
 She speaks a being well I do not know how well 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.510
 this fan fills it's an incident 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.519
 in these acts of racism, right? 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.849
 but it is sometimes a question of a 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:26.780
 we want to stabilize the player 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:31.960
 opponent not every racist song like 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:37.720
 I said I do not know I do not know but it is 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:45.400
 It is the dream of football in which 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:48.220
 Twisted always always the crowd will're 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.510
 arriving is doing something 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.860
 against an opponent to be boring is normal is 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.860
 within healthy limits 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.860
 What you can not disregard 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.890
 person, right? 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.140
 one with violent attitudes I also think 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.200
 that all this in the background for the sake of 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.960
 respect for the next 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.240
 these people had such 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.520
 respect account all that is the pocket has 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.920
 I say there are people who like the cold one. 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.410
 white space has said we fight together 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.290
 with the yellow floor contest of 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.300
 car that the four- wheel motorcycle and one 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.570
 who likes the team to the other likes the team 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.570
 B 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.110
 I said so is the human being no routes 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.540
 different tastes and opinions 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.020
 it is enough to have respect for those 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.020
 positions 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.379
 when you respect the human being 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:54.610
 matter the sex of color whatever 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.280
 either in the question simply of the coffin 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.970
 you know how to respect your neighbor. 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.370
 on all issues not only at a 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.590
 but everywhere 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.260
 We talk in traffic is a 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.379
 respecting the other if the driver 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.269
 hispital motorcyclist 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.480
 respect the driver 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.480
 pedestrian 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.540
 that's it and so we will not change 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.790
 The world is what I say, do not be 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.920
 So you think wrong do not be the guy. 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.300
 who plays banana right? 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.889
 be the example we'll be the people 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.430
 what a difference 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:42.150
 since others do it wrong 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:46.190
 how do we make the right differences 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.190
 exist and will always exist 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.210
 What do we have to know to live with 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.210
 she our neighborhood is good 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.710
 Right, guys, this is a week. 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.440
 everybody, be all well there 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.919

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.919
