00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
on this for example and it's about the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.740 
on this for example and it's about the
size<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.710> even<00:00:35.579> smaller<00:00:35.910> than<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.210> human<00:00:36.390> really

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
they're not that big in fact I'm sure

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
they're not that big in fact I'm sure
you<00:00:39.780> won't<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.079> able<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.290> ride<00:00:40.530> them<00:00:40.710> just

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
because then you're kind of not really

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.450 
because then you're kind of not really
be<00:00:43.290> able<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:43.739> off<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.070> all<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.399> think

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
is a t-rex but as a longer arm so I'm

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.229 
is a t-rex but as a longer arm so I'm
not<00:02:40.650> entirely<00:02:41.010> sure<00:02:41.220> what<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.820> trying<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
not entirely sure what it's trying to

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.390 
not entirely sure what it's trying to
say<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:43.110> might<00:02:43.290> be<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.470> raptor<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.130> they<00:02:44.220> look

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
say it might be a raptor but they look

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.220 
say it might be a raptor but they look
really<00:02:44.430> tiny<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.780> I'm<00:02:45.870> gonna<00:02:46.020> say

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
really tiny for that so I'm gonna say

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.400 
really tiny for that so I'm gonna say
it's<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.470> t-rex<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.870> drawn<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> little<00:02:49.170> bit

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410

artistically<00:02:50.160> strange<00:02:50.580> maybe<00:02:50.820> even<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.180> Spina

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
artistically strange maybe even a Spina

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.160 
artistically strange maybe even a Spina
but<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> can't<00:02:52.950> see<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> fin<00:02:53.670> anyway<00:02:54.170> ignoring

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
but I can't see the fin anyway ignoring

the<00:02:55.260> picture<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.070> can<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.730> they

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
the picture you can just see that they

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.940 
the picture you can just see that they
do<00:02:56.940> attack<00:02:57.510> things<00:02:57.810> much<00:02:58.170> larger<00:02:58.650> than<00:02:58.799> them

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
do attack things much larger than them

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.729

companionship but it's using combat is
also<00:03:08.730> quite<00:03:09.030> clear<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.870> will<00:03:10.019> hunt<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.410> large

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
also quite clear it will hunt in large
