00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello I'm blessed early leader 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.620
 produces electric axes at festo 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.179
 france today i would like you 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.710
 present a way to improve 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.519
 Positioning functions sleep machine 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.660
 and that while preserving your margins 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.490
 festo manufactures for many 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.340
 years of electric cylinders that is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.920
 trapezoidal screw ball screw or even 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
 a linear motor however 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000
 the integration of these axes is long 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.039
 remained economically bearable than pro 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.619
 very demanding applications at 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.880
 precision and dynamics for 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.280
 to go further festo creates today 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.350
 the optimize motion series which are 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.469
 solutions for electric movement to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.180
 both efficient and economical 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:46.620
 the first of these series is composed 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.809
 of an electromechanical jack lapco and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.870
 its economic controller these memos 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.670
 so the benefits of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 electrical servoing and rendering 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.390
 accessible for only a fraction 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.160
 of the price of a classic all saints system 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.719
 party of our famous cms controller 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.210
 we have reworked 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.369
 we have reduced its cost its size and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.210
 its energy consumption to succeed 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.210
 an optimized version 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.380
 the c remained even with, among others 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.780
 an entrance dedicated to taking 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.720
 reference an internet diagnosis 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.040
 a security function st lÃ´ ce 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 compact controller brands in its 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.290
 category 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.390
 let's take the start as an example 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.710
 there is no need to buy or 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.630
 download some software that this 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.180
 either knows it but word has its own 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.729
 integrated web server and firewall to mithra 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.619
 with any browser 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.299
 so once gathered internet the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.070
 controller will verify that his version of the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.290
 settings is optimal for the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.299
 motor axis controller configuration that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.880
 you have the verb that is available 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.079
 in a wide variety of sizes 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.170
 no and run 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.939
 moreover the motor and the mechanical verra 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 are pre-assembled at the factory 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.479
 this not only allows you to win 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.189
 time and in addition to benefit from a 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.899
 together at a reduced length you 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.159
 allowing integration for 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.170
 space-saving systems 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.520
 so if you consider that the brain 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.530
 positioning and beyond your 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.299
 budget think a second time 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.659
 we may have the solution 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.659
 you need
