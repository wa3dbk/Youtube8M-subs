00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.210
 one night to receive them 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.099
 in February we were inspired by the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.140
 Candelaria and the chip presented us with a 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.420
 candied pork leg tamale in 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 Adobo of dried chillies with cinnamon 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.079
 kind of contemporary version of a 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.370
 size that was paired with blanc deflates 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:46.370
 from the particular unite I loved the sinn 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.980
 fan of him with the delicious tamale 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.920
 in March we were inspired by the party of 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.540
 spring and a salad is presented 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.670
 of lettuce shoots with flowers 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.680
 edible and foam honey and pollen with 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.440
 amaranth marina goes sensational with 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.199
 implant anointing is a wonder because 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.729
 apart from being able to know corners of the 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.850
 Mexico City and its history its 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.530
 context one eats very rich takes well the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.640
 very rich, they explain what you are 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.710
 eating they explain what you are 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.020
 taking besides comfortable already said the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.690
 context does not end the story either of 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.190
 center or market of schümann or 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.830
 several corners of the federal destiny not 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.780
 in April it was very fun I think 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.030
 It was one of the most enjoyed dishes 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.580
 at night it was a quad with cotton 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.950
 sugar with cinnamon and brown sugar with 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.750
 nitro chewing gum beads this for 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.420
 remind us of all the flavors that 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.340
 we soon enjoyed when we were kids and 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.990
 It was presented in a bag with a balloon 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.210
 of helium that after the assistants 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.160
 they let go very excited because they are 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.250
 details that mark as part of the 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.220
 balloons or the part of explaining to each 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.230
 one each stop we made of the saucer 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.270
 because they did it like this 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.610
 commemorative and as by temporality 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.490
 of the year then good enough 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.910
 recommended us as a means to 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.880
 our clients in May we are inspired 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.410
 in the holy cross and good a little 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.990
 Inspired by the bricklayers' theme 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.540
 the taco that they eat in the work is 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.730
 presented a taco placero in a cone 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.260
 very funny paper where the taco 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.470
 is deconstructed in some way in 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.360
 different textures but that are maintained 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.530
 the flavors of the salt taco is crazy 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.290
 of the everyday 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.760
 enclosed white walls had something 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.640
 totally different than only 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.560
 You are living what could we know what that 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.480
 we jump from there to July a little bit with the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.600
 celebration of the guelaguetza 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.510
 presented a row pita of grasshoppers with 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.120
 guacamole and lemon air I think 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.860
 as a tourist experience especially 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.560
 I think the doors open a lot 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.450
 because you do not have to be like an expert 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.450
 in wine or anything like that 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.970
 in September it was also a saucer 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.060
 very interesting because it was a kind 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.010
 of abstraction of pozole and elche that 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.890
 he presented us with a port vell toast and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.680
 salad with red pozole that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.260
 husband in a wonderful way with a 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.930
 closes lanka saviñón blanca is fine 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.990
 valuable and it enriches you a lot like 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.600
 no more person at the level of drinking wine 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.180
 and try the kitchen but also like 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.130
 Mexican is very enriching for 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.500
 celebrate november or a little doing 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.959
 allusion to the celebration of dead are 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.900
 presented a duck with piloncillo and cinnamon 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.489
 Adobo of dried chiles and pepita and mashed 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.440
 roasted pumpkin with sprouts 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.660
 peach this alluding to the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.000
 flavors of autumn that is the time in 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.239
 where this celebration comes is a 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.209
 unique experience and you can also 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.090
 to pair it with enough Mexican food 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.940
 very innovative very spectacular and 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.610
 delicious and also mixing them with 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.880
 wines are perfect I think it's a 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.950
 taste an explosion of flavor 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.560
 It has been a very pleasant experience 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.830
 both at the historical level of the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.020
 buildings as well as the good 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.280
 in the wine tasting and also in 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.280
 the pairing that has been put 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.580
 Y 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.530
 do not
