00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.509 
buy attachments optics but the problem
is<00:00:52.659> you<00:00:52.839> need<00:00:53.199> service<00:00:53.710> stars<00:00:53.979> to<00:00:54.190> be<00:00:54.309> able<00:00:54.460> to

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
is you need service stars to be able to

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.880 
is you need service stars to be able to
access<00:00:54.670> some<00:00:55.360> of<00:00:55.449> those<00:00:55.540> slots<00:00:55.960> so<00:00:56.650> once<00:00:56.799> you

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
access some of those slots so once you

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.189 
access some of those slots so once you
start<00:00:57.129> granting<00:00:57.549> out<00:00:57.699> a<00:00:57.729> weapon<00:00:58.089> like<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.420> AKM

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
start granting out a weapon like the AKM

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.799 
start granting out a weapon like the AKM
you'll<00:00:59.769> first<00:01:00.040> gain<00:01:00.309> access<00:01:00.549> to<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.150> optics

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
you'll first gain access to the optics

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.869 
you'll first gain access to the optics
very<00:01:02.170> quickly<00:01:02.470> through<00:01:03.159> your<00:01:03.280> first<00:01:03.489> couple

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
very quickly through your first couple

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.300 
very quickly through your first couple
of<00:01:03.909> service<00:01:04.269> stars<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:04.870> then<00:01:05.530> you'll<00:01:06.040> get<00:01:06.220> in

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
of service stars and then you'll get in

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.130 
of service stars and then you'll get in
a<00:01:06.370> barrel<00:01:06.700> attachment<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:07.479> then<00:01:07.840> once<00:01:08.020> you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
a barrel attachment and then once you

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.660 
a barrel attachment and then once you
get<00:01:08.260> to<00:01:08.290> 10<00:01:08.560> service<00:01:08.950> stars<00:01:09.190> you'll<00:01:09.400> get<00:01:09.549> the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
get to 10 service stars you'll get the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.430 
get to 10 service stars you'll get the
underbarrel<00:01:10.299> attachment<00:01:10.479> which<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.320> don't

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
underbarrel attachment which I don't

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.039 
underbarrel attachment which I don't
have<00:01:11.740> just<00:01:12.280> yet<00:01:12.520> so<00:01:13.060> this<00:01:13.180> has<00:01:13.330> a<00:01:13.360> flash<00:01:13.720> hider

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
have just yet so this has a flash hider

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.280 
have just yet so this has a flash hider
coyote<00:01:14.860> optic<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.520> extended<00:01:16.210> mags<00:01:16.480> which<00:01:17.140> I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
coyote optic and extended mags which I

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.890 
coyote optic and extended mags which I
do<00:01:17.350> have<00:01:17.800> which<00:01:18.310> is<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.610> big<00:01:19.090> help<00:01:19.450> even<00:01:19.810> though

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
do have which is a big help even though

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.620 
do have which is a big help even though
this<00:01:20.050> reloads<00:01:20.440> extremely<00:01:21.070> fast<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:22.300> what

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
this reloads extremely fast so what

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.000 
this reloads extremely fast so what
would<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.840> put<00:01:23.080> on<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.290> back<00:01:23.500> end<00:01:23.740> of<00:01:23.860> this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
would I put on the back end of this

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.950 
would I put on the back end of this
since<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:24.700> has<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.880> ton<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.300> vertical<00:01:25.780> recoil

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
since it has a ton of vertical recoil

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.190 
since it has a ton of vertical recoil
and<00:01:26.440> his<00:01:26.830> strength<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.340> burst<00:01:27.850> firing<00:01:28.240> or<00:01:28.540> even

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
and his strength is burst firing or even

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.530 
and his strength is burst firing or even
tap<00:01:29.440> firing<00:01:29.710> I<00:01:30.100> would<00:01:30.580> start<00:01:30.820> off<00:01:30.940> with<00:01:31.510> the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
tap firing I would start off with the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.350 
tap firing I would start off with the
angled<00:01:32.050> grip<00:01:32.050> why<00:01:32.980> would<00:01:33.190> I<00:01:33.250> use<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.610> akm<00:01:34.180> if

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
angled grip why would I use the akm if

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.690 
angled grip why would I use the akm if
it<00:01:34.510> has<00:01:34.690> such<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:34.990> strong<00:01:35.140> vertical<00:01:35.770> recoil<00:01:36.250> and

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
it has such a strong vertical recoil and

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.840 
it has such a strong vertical recoil and
it's<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.210> beast<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.690> tame<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.370> hits

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
it's a beast to tame because it hits

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.360 
it's a beast to tame because it hits
like<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.660> ton<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.020> bricks<00:01:41.650> it's<00:01:42.010> absolutely

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
like a ton of bricks it's absolutely

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.780 
like a ton of bricks it's absolutely
insane<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.470> way<00:01:44.650> this<00:01:44.890> game<00:01:45.160> works<00:01:45.190> is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
insane and the way this game works is

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.780 
insane and the way this game works is
there's<00:01:46.060> not<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.270> ton<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.750> deviation<00:01:47.650> or<00:01:47.790> spread

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
there's not a ton of deviation or spread

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.150 
there's not a ton of deviation or spread
you<00:01:49.060> can<00:01:49.210> get<00:01:49.330> away<00:01:49.450> with<00:01:49.960> rounds<00:01:50.410> of<00:01:50.530> four<00:01:50.830> to

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
you can get away with rounds of four to

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.350 
you can get away with rounds of four to
seven<00:01:51.580> high<00:01:52.530> DPS<00:01:53.760> dropping<00:01:54.760> your<00:01:54.880> targets

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
seven high DPS dropping your targets

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.240 
seven high DPS dropping your targets
even<00:01:55.659> if<00:01:55.750> you're<00:01:55.870> late<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.320> party<00:01:56.530> like<00:01:57.100> I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
even if you're late to the party like I

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.700 
even if you're late to the party like I
was<00:01:57.460> in<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.790> last<00:01:58.000> exchange<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.810> still<00:01:59.409> was

the<00:02:05.770> akm<00:02:06.400> it's<00:02:06.640> always<00:02:06.970> best<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.540> seek<00:02:07.840> cover

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
the akm it's always best to seek cover

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.259 
the akm it's always best to seek cover
cover<00:02:08.739> your<00:02:08.920> reloads<00:02:09.340> try<00:02:09.909> to<00:02:09.970> stand

perfectly still with any weapon in this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.339 
perfectly still with any weapon in this
game<00:02:12.909> because<00:02:13.720> that's<00:02:13.930> when<00:02:14.080> you're<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.260> to

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
game because that's when you're going to

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.589 
game because that's when you're going to
have<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.709> best<00:02:15.129> accuracy<00:02:15.970> if<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:16.390> start

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
have the best accuracy if you start

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.899 
have the best accuracy if you start
strafing<00:02:16.930> around<00:02:17.440> your<00:02:17.890> start<00:02:18.190> adding<00:02:18.430> spread

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
strafing around your start adding spread

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.119 
strafing around your start adding spread
and<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.840> not<00:02:20.049> good<00:02:20.290> especially<00:02:20.469> when<00:02:20.980> a

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
and that is not good especially when a

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.320 
and that is not good especially when a
weapon<00:02:21.519> has

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
weapon has

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.780

much<00:02:22.630> recoil<00:02:23.320> of<00:02:23.620> course<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.250> can<00:02:24.370> see<00:02:24.550> some

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
much recoil of course you can see some

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.060 
much recoil of course you can see some
of<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.970> horizontal<00:02:25.540> recoil<00:02:25.720> kick<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.440> but

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
of the horizontal recoil kick in but

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.980 
of the horizontal recoil kick in but
it's<00:02:27.220> not<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.460> bad<00:02:27.880> i'm<00:02:28.090> close<00:02:28.390> give<00:02:28.630> him<00:02:28.840> an

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
it's not that bad i'm close give him an

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.410 
it's not that bad i'm close give him an
extra<00:02:29.230> couple<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.100> dome<00:02:30.280> piece<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.820> on<00:02:31.090> we

extra couple to the dome piece and on we

extra couple to the dome piece and on we
go<00:02:31.450> at<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.440> end<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.710> day<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.010> akm<00:02:33.700> packs<00:02:34.240> a

go at the end of the day the akm packs a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.470 
go at the end of the day the akm packs a
hell<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:35.080> punch<00:02:35.350> as<00:02:35.710> long<00:02:36.550> as<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:37.360> can

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
hell of a punch as long as you can

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.660 
hell of a punch as long as you can
counter<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.810> recoil<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.620> if<00:02:39.220> you're<00:02:39.370> out<00:02:39.520> in

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
counter the recoil and if you're out in

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.860 
counter the recoil and if you're out in
the<00:02:39.700> open<00:02:39.850> like<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.570> some<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.750> these

the open like this and some of these

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.920 
the open like this and some of these
longer<00:02:41.650> lanes<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.640> can<00:02:43.030> become<00:02:43.210> somewhat

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
longer lanes it can become somewhat

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.140 
longer lanes it can become somewhat
troublesome<00:02:44.350> but<00:02:45.130> as<00:02:45.250> long<00:02:45.520> as<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:45.940> some

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
troublesome but as long as you have some

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.570 
troublesome but as long as you have some
cover<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.600> play<00:02:46.840> behind<00:02:46.920> take<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:47.950> quick<00:02:48.280> peek

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
cover to play behind take a quick peek

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.790 
cover to play behind take a quick peek
and<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.210> your<00:02:49.360> shots<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:49.990> need<00:02:50.260> you

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
and get your shots that you need you

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.470 
and get your shots that you need you
should<00:02:51.070> be<00:02:51.190> able<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.430> successfully<00:02:51.730> take<00:02:52.270> down

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
should be able to successfully take down

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.480 
should be able to successfully take down
the<00:02:52.660> bad<00:02:52.870> guys<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.440> again<00:02:53.650> my<00:02:53.860> suggestion

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
the bad guys and again my suggestion

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.900 
the bad guys and again my suggestion
here<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.880> angled<00:02:55.750> grip<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.680> calm<00:02:57.130> down<00:02:57.160> that

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
here is angled grip to calm down that

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.150 
here is angled grip to calm down that
first<00:02:58.270> shot<00:02:58.540> multiplier<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.770> can't<00:03:00.040> go

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
first shot multiplier you can't go

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.010 
first shot multiplier you can't go
stubby<00:03:00.610> but<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.120> isn't<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.450> weapon<00:03:01.660> that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
stubby but this isn't a weapon that

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.720 
stubby but this isn't a weapon that
you're<00:03:02.200> really<00:03:02.530> going<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.740> want<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:03.010> burst<00:03:03.400> in

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
you're really going to want to burst in

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.940 
you're really going to want to burst in
large<00:03:04.540> increments<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.410> don't<00:03:05.590> want<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.800> stay

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
large increments you don't want to stay

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.400 
large increments you don't want to stay
with<00:03:05.980> those<00:03:06.280> smaller<00:03:06.790> patterns<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:08.110> if<00:03:08.260> this

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
with those smaller patterns so if this

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.400 
with those smaller patterns so if this
is<00:03:08.530> too<00:03:08.680> much<00:03:08.709> for<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.390> what<00:03:10.390> should<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.170> use

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
is too much for you what should you use

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.490 
is too much for you what should you use
what<00:03:11.950> can<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.310> use<00:03:12.340> that's<00:03:13.180> right<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.600> m16a3

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
what can you use that's right the m16a3

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.580 
what can you use that's right the m16a3
is<00:03:15.070> back<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.760> shoots<00:03:16.000> roughly<00:03:16.570> 800<00:03:17.380> rounds

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
is back and it shoots roughly 800 rounds

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.100 
is back and it shoots roughly 800 rounds
a<00:03:17.800> minute<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.130> AKM<00:03:18.760> says<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.209> shoots<00:03:19.420> 900<00:03:19.930> but

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
a minute the AKM says it shoots 900 but

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.780 
a minute the AKM says it shoots 900 but
it<00:03:20.200> clearly<00:03:20.590> does<00:03:20.860> not<00:03:20.890> it's<00:03:21.580> probably

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
it clearly does not it's probably

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.410 
it clearly does not it's probably
someplace<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.630> round<00:03:22.990> of<00:03:23.410> 650<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.670> 700<00:03:25.300> or

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
someplace in the round of 650 to 700 or

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.680 
someplace in the round of 650 to 700 or
so<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.440> rewards<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.220> accuracy<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.000> m16a3

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
so so it rewards the accuracy the m16a3

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.009 
so so it rewards the accuracy the m16a3
with<00:03:29.080> its<00:03:29.260> lightning-fast<00:03:29.830> reloads<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:31.060> a

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
with its lightning-fast reloads is a

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.370 
with its lightning-fast reloads is a
beast<00:03:32.739> up<00:03:33.340> close<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:34.060> at<00:03:34.660> medium<00:03:35.050> as<00:03:35.170> I'm

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
beast up close and at medium as I'm

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.140 
beast up close and at medium as I'm
trying<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:36.070> get<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.370> thing<00:03:36.430> disarmed

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
trying to get this thing disarmed

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.440 
trying to get this thing disarmed
holding<00:03:37.660> eat<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.370> shooting<00:03:39.370> at<00:03:39.489> somebody<00:03:39.790> the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
holding eat and shooting at somebody the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.390 
holding eat and shooting at somebody the
wonderful<00:03:40.720> thing<00:03:40.870> about<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.260> m16a3<00:03:41.950> is

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
wonderful thing about the m16a3 is

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.759 
wonderful thing about the m16a3 is
there's<00:03:42.610> not<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:43.209> lot<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.660> vertical<00:03:43.930> recoil<00:03:44.350> it

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
there's not a lot of vertical recoil it
