our<00:00:09.630> next<00:00:09.810> demonstration<00:00:10.170> will<00:00:10.830> show<00:00:10.860> how<00:00:11.340> our

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
our next demonstration will show how our

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.080 
our next demonstration will show how our
product<00:00:12.000> improves<00:00:12.510> the<00:00:12.750> atomization<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.680> fuel

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
product improves the atomization of fuel

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.820 
product improves the atomization of fuel
atomization<00:00:15.090> is<00:00:15.600> very<00:00:15.840> important<00:00:16.499> is<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
atomization is very important is the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.429 
atomization is very important is the

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
size of the fuel the better it will

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.380 
size of the fuel the better it will

combust and the less by products will be

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.140 
combust and the less by products will be
left<00:00:24.599> over<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.619> gives<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.130> more<00:00:26.429> horsepower

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150

this<00:00:31.589> demonstration<00:00:32.059> we're<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> take

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
this demonstration we're going to take

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360 
this demonstration we're going to take
some<00:00:33.660> cotton<00:00:34.109> ball<00:00:34.320> material<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.190> we've

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
some cotton ball material that we've

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.509 
some cotton ball material that we've
rotted<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.359> to<00:00:37.020> make<00:00:37.230> small<00:00:37.649> wicks<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
rotted up in to make small wicks and

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.529 
rotted up in to make small wicks and
place<00:00:39.329> one<00:00:39.660> at<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.019> center<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:41.180> each<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.420> these

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
place one at the center of each of these

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.740 
place one at the center of each of these
petri<00:00:42.899> dishes<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.120> we're<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.600> add

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
petri dishes to that we're going to add

00:00:45.750 --> 00:01:05.470 
petri dishes to that we're going to add
a<00:00:45.780> small<00:00:46.260> amount<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.769> diesel<00:00:47.190> fuel

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.280 

we're<00:01:06.480> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> burn<00:01:06.930> each<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.440> these

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.109 

you<00:01:14.290> can<00:01:14.439> see<00:01:14.650> that<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.890> fuel<00:01:15.250> burns<00:01:15.700> in

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
you can see that the fuel burns in

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.780 
you can see that the fuel burns in
completely<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.920> we're<00:01:18.100> having<00:01:18.220> poor
