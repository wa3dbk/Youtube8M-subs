00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.040
 Good to look at the name when you first 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.750
 Let's see how the trick works 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.060
 first time to come in as always for 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.649

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.160
 how could it be different is always 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.690
 table the queen requirement and yes 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.440
 the conditions today is the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.540
 football 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.100
 this is also step 1 of the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.660
 Step one also belongs to that one 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.740
 put your foot on the floor here and 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.619
 with it too 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.939
 This is financed with 1 both 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.500
 the prerequisite you have to 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.420
 secure protection under the flap 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.619
 But that is a first step and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.010
 you will quickly see the trick again 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.510
 and now it will come to the main part 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.300
 so now everyone is taking care now in 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.030
 my bulk and the crickets coils 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.470
 Let's go back and see is the whole 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.180
 the same as always in the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.340
 slow motion should also be heard at such 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.120
 a first step woodstock soon 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.720
 stabilize 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.370
 calm as always now 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.740
 or walk to the floor 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.450
 press and now the other at easy 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.350
 covers and drops the ball bender 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 pulling up 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.970
 that's it and actually see it now 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.500
 We all again for a while 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.020
 The earth offered now graphically 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.770
 coil shown recoils slow motion 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.790
 football is very important now at five 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.360
 or walk to the floor 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.460
 to press 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.650
 and now with the other leg over 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.300
 so that the iks movement comes out of this 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.980
 the cx movement and then easy 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.900
 The iks are very important 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.470
 you have to move on the war 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.530
 to be able to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.420
 and yes, that's just the main part 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.160
 and how you can give it all 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.920
 they come the same as always now 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.569
 the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.550
 dry exercises that look good 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.860
 But gold make again 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.959
 clarify here again we see the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.220
 iks move over now 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.180
 shown quickly but also okay and 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.010
 Jamaica is really nothing to say 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.810
 simply drag and just above the ixs 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.489
 Movement is very important to me 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.440
 again very concentrated and then is 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.440
 the bulk for today also done 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.780
 my tip of the day to you is you 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.070
 the plaster on both feet both left 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.150
 as well as right then could 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.920
 nothing really go wrong at 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.700
 this trick and yes I can 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.700
 actually only help 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.060
 my conclusion to the ronaldinho football trick 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.830
 is a normal or middle one there 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.810
 the trick is not so open free cell 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.540
 But industry uses real men 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.209
 could always use that no problem 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.250
 and yes i would say i'm out till 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.599
 next Tuesday frisell service 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.040
