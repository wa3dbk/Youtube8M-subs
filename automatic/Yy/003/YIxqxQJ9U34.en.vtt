light

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.760 

I<00:01:14.329> just<00:01:15.329> realized<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> routing<00:01:16.289> stops

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I just realized that the routing stops

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.649 
I just realized that the routing stops
here<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.860> two<00:01:26.610> combs<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.179> front<00:01:27.420> one

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
here it has two combs in the front one

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.270 
here it has two combs in the front one
in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> back<00:01:27.899> with<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.409> adjustable<00:01:28.829> straps

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
in the back with the adjustable straps

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.200 
in the back with the adjustable straps
and<00:01:29.610> boning<00:01:29.970> by<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.179> ear

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.050 

so<00:01:35.110> there's<00:01:35.560> only<00:01:35.770> about<00:01:36.100> an<00:01:36.250> inch<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.580> parting

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
so there's only about an inch of parting

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.690 
so there's only about an inch of parting
and<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:39.550> lace<00:01:39.760> is<00:01:40.030> ear<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.540> ear<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.460> this

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
and the lace is ear to ear but this

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.550 
and the lace is ear to ear but this
hairstyle<00:01:43.120> you<00:01:43.660> don't<00:01:43.930> need<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.350> much

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
shiny because of the curl pattern if

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.780 
shiny because of the curl pattern if
this<00:03:42.520> was<00:03:42.790> straight<00:03:43.390> or<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.290> body<00:03:45.130> wave<00:03:45.430> I'm

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.070 
pretty sure that the hair the synthetic
hair<00:03:48.580> fiber<00:03:49.410> would<00:03:50.410> be<00:03:50.650> shiny<00:03:51.150> but<00:03:52.150> because<00:03:52.570> it

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
hair fiber would be shiny but because it

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.610 
hair fiber would be shiny but because it
is<00:03:53.440> this<00:03:53.920> curl<00:03:54.310> pattern<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.959> does<00:03:56.200> have<00:03:56.470> that

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
is this curl pattern it does have that

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.320 
is this curl pattern it does have that
