guitar itself this is the neck pickup
alone<00:01:02.710> tones<00:01:03.219> all<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.550> way<00:01:03.640> up<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:06.369> sounds

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
alone tones all the way up just sounds

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.960 
alone tones all the way up just sounds
sort<00:01:06.789> of<00:01:06.850> muffled<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:07.990> weird<00:01:08.680> now<00:01:09.520> if<00:01:09.729> we

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
sort of muffled and weird now if we

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.779 
sort of muffled and weird now if we
connect<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.930> ground<00:01:11.259> back<00:01:11.560> up<00:01:11.830> see<00:01:12.250> what<00:01:12.369> see

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
connect that ground back up see what see

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:18.630 
connect that ground back up see what see
what<00:01:12.910> happens<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.830> connected<00:01:18.369> that<00:01:18.490> right

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
what happens I just connected that right

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.040 
what happens I just connected that right
to<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:18.880> back<00:01:19.030> of<00:01:19.209> the<00:01:19.270> pot<00:01:19.450> where<00:01:19.660> it<00:01:19.750> belongs

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
to the back of the pot where it belongs

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:30.089 
to the back of the pot where it belongs
so<00:01:20.349> now<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:21.580> what<00:01:21.759> felt<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.700> again<00:01:29.099> that's

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:30.099 
so now that what felt that again that's

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.240 
so now that what felt that again that's
better<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.509> can<00:01:31.720> hear<00:01:31.990> it's<00:01:32.890> totally

of the pots so if that wire came loose

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.509 
of the pots so if that wire came loose
you'd<00:02:36.330> hear<00:02:36.480> some<00:02:36.690> weirdness<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:38.310> you've

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
you'd hear some weirdness and if you've

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.949 
you'd hear some weirdness and if you've
got<00:02:38.670> any<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.150> wires<00:02:39.330> looks<00:02:39.630> inside

jack that would be the problem

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.140 
jack that would be the problem
ultimately<00:02:46.440> all<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.160> grounds<00:02:47.519> do<00:02:47.670> end<00:02:47.850> up<00:02:48.000> at

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
ultimately all the grounds do end up at

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.180 
ultimately all the grounds do end up at
the<00:02:48.239> ground<00:02:48.450> lug<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> jack<00:02:49.140> which<00:02:49.829> is

the ground lug of the jack which is

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.130 
the ground lug of the jack which is
connected<00:02:51.060> through<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.420> wire<00:02:51.600> out<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:52.049> your

connected through the wire out to your

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.199 
connected through the wire out to your
amp<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.590> then<00:02:52.709> into<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.070> electrical<00:02:53.880> system

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
amp and then into the electrical system

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.240 
amp and then into the electrical system
ground<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.720> all<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.680> ground<00:02:55.890> needs<00:02:56.130> to

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
ground and all of that ground needs to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.800 
ground and all of that ground needs to
be<00:02:56.370> tied<00:02:56.519> together<00:02:56.700> properly<00:02:57.299> for<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.570> sound

be tied together properly for it sound

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.460 
be tied together properly for it sound
good<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.430> hope<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.850> helps<00:03:00.180> good<00:03:01.079> luck<00:03:01.260> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
good so I hope that helps good luck and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.799 
good so I hope that helps good luck and
