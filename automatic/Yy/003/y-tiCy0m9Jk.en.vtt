00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:45.970 
said I you know I've kind of been out of

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.660 
said I you know I've kind of been out of
pocket<00:07:46.150> for<00:07:47.070> personal<00:07:48.070> reasons<00:07:48.190> as<00:07:48.490> we

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:48.670 
pocket for personal reasons as we

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.320 
pocket for personal reasons as we
discussed<00:07:49.060> before<00:07:49.150> and<00:07:50.400> you<00:07:51.400> know<00:07:51.520> it<00:07:51.700> showed

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:52.330 
discussed before and you know it showed

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.830 
discussed before and you know it showed
up<00:07:52.360> on<00:07:52.840> the<00:07:53.740> internet<00:07:54.370> I<00:07:54.400> guess<00:07:54.790> through<00:07:55.540> one

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 
up on the internet I guess through one

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.930 
up on the internet I guess through one
of<00:07:55.870> their<00:07:56.140> assistants<00:07:56.680> who<00:07:56.830> said<00:07:57.130> the<00:07:57.730> real

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:57.940 
of their assistants who said the real

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.640 
of their assistants who said the real
reason<00:07:58.330> they<00:07:58.450> didn't<00:07:58.720> pick<00:07:58.840> up<00:07:58.960> the<00:07:59.110> show<00:07:59.290> is

00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.650 
reason they didn't pick up the show is

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.590 
reason they didn't pick up the show is
because<00:07:59.970> you<00:08:00.970> know<00:08:02.430> the<00:08:03.430> women<00:08:04.000> weren't<00:08:04.330> yet

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:04.600 
because you know the women weren't yet
