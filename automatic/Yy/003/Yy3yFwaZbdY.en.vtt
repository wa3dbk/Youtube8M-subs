back then so back again after the long
luring<00:04:08.010> screened<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:09.860> that's<00:04:10.860> diving<00:04:11.250> for

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
luring screened and that's diving for

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:22.700 
luring screened and that's diving for
another<00:04:11.670> time<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:21.810> there's<00:04:22.199> brief<00:04:22.470> space
