00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.949
 every spectator my name Sparta product- and I accompany them through 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.220
 this offers 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.910
 Suddenly, many are seen as eerie as they are in photography 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.630
 Photographers prefered by their eyes rather than a funny one in the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 Milliseconds briefly becomes light and then no longer safe 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.550
 it turns the possibilities but much of me to banish photo 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.070
 Photography is not necessarily the reproducing exploitation of existing ones 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.120
 On the contrary, not without a reason, the vernacular says that in one too 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 other light appear 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.920
 because that's exactly what you get from this video training with extra work 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.680
 we can take photos and any lighting scenes according to ours 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.940
 Clean up ideas 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 changing an existing lighting mood creates something completely new and that 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.570
 all with a bit of light from a flash 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.520
 This theme Ambient banned a few hours of video 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.830
 Starting with a simple unfolded in the future is now Bode too 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.670
 work with studio percent off 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.420
 how is the light adjusted as one measured how do i get different 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.090
 Colors cover or suggest which possibilities of photography suddenly 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.820
 I have in the photo studio or at home or outdoors, the nature as at 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.780
 What are the advantages of the photo? What do I have to take care of? 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.780
 I can not do things 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.250
 Pay special attention to Amway on times like this 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.310
 what you should not do 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.780
 Using how to do it will have been one-sided 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.050
 are all very timeless held by that for all specifically all 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.320
 Pick up questions 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.950
 Infinite technology relates 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.510
 it's about the ulterior motives 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.220
 who founded why do you do that? 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.750
 and not necessarily for that reason or switch face texts to use 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.130
 the Answer structured and step by step 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.270
 For example, a specific topic will be discussed in different exercises 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.940
 explained 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.170
 turn outside or on the chair 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.560
 through this structure because the backgrounds say very clearly 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.090
 That may be in several videos refers to a particular light situation 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.169
 To be received 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.569
 I am particularly pleased about a special chapter presents dpa 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.189
 Fashion Photography at night 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.869
 logical thinking will bring some tricks and tricks and little equipment 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.629
 Great interesting results, I wish you a lot of fun 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.789
 try and experiment
