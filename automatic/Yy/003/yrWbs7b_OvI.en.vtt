00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
it ships it will be running Android 4.0

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.100 
it ships it will be running Android 4.0
yes<00:03:06.360> android<00:03:06.750> 4.0<00:03:08.270> we<00:03:09.270> haven't<00:03:09.540> announced<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
yes android 4.0 we haven't announced the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.260 
yes android 4.0 we haven't announced the
memory<00:03:10.440> size<00:03:10.680> yet<00:03:11.420> one<00:03:12.420> gigahertz<00:03:13.459> of<00:03:14.459> RAM<00:03:15.030> and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
memory size yet one gigahertz of RAM and

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.550 
memory size yet one gigahertz of RAM and
then<00:03:15.600> we're<00:03:15.840> going<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.020> have<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> quad-core

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
then we're going to have a quad-core

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.850 
then we're going to have a quad-core
processor<00:03:17.340> with<00:03:18.000> which<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.570> Tegra<00:03:18.870> 3<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.740> 1

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
processor with which is Tegra 3 and 1

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.620 
processor with which is Tegra 3 and 1
point<00:03:20.040> 4<00:03:20.160> gigahertz<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.180> Tegra<00:03:21.600> 3

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
point 4 gigahertz so the Tegra 3

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.010 
point 4 gigahertz so the Tegra 3
processor<00:03:22.070> we<00:03:23.070> are<00:03:23.220> thinking<00:03:23.670> as<00:03:24.180> solidly

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
processor we are thinking as solidly

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.380 
processor we are thinking as solidly
down<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.709> will<00:03:25.890> be<00:03:26.040> 1<00:03:26.280> gig<00:03:26.490> of<00:03:26.520> ram<00:03:26.670> on

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
down that it will be 1 gig of ram on

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.170 
down that it will be 1 gig of ram on
this<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.810> then<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.500> storage<00:03:29.010> size<00:03:29.370> will

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
this and then the storage size will

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.850 
this and then the storage size will
we'll<00:03:30.660> see<00:03:30.810> about<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.080> one<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.650> haven't

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
we'll see about that one we haven't

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.740 
we'll see about that one we haven't
announced<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.220> yet<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:33.000> there<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.600> an
