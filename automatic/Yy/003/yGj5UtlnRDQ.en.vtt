I'm<00:00:12.300> gonna<00:00:12.480> show<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.780> how<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.080> can<00:00:13.380> reverse<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
I'm gonna show you how you can reverse a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.180 
I'm gonna show you how you can reverse a
sample<00:00:15.500> specifically<00:00:16.500> today<00:00:16.830> we're<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.100> to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
sample specifically today we're going to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.330 
sample specifically today we're going to
be<00:00:17.340> using<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.880> symbol<00:00:18.390> sample<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:20.039> reason

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
be using a symbol sample and the reason

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.920 
be using a symbol sample and the reason
I<00:00:20.430> want<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> show<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.539> you

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
I want to show you this is because you

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.900 
I want to show you this is because you
can<00:00:22.080> add<00:00:22.289> some<00:00:22.560> pretty<00:00:22.800> dramatic<00:00:23.100> effects

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
can add some pretty dramatic effects

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.740 
can add some pretty dramatic effects
when<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.840> reverse<00:00:25.289> symbols<00:00:26.279> or<00:00:26.599> samples<00:00:27.599> in

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
when you reverse symbols or samples in

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.130 
when you reverse symbols or samples in
general<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:29.269> lot<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> times<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.779> would<00:00:30.840> use<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
general a lot of times I would use a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.310 
general a lot of times I would use a
reverse<00:00:31.650> symbol<00:00:32.369> when<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.270> fading<00:00:33.899> my<00:00:34.050> song

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
reverse symbol when I'm fading my song

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.190 
reverse symbol when I'm fading my song
back<00:00:34.680> into<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> hook<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.640> chorus<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
back into the hook or the chorus and it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.959 
back into the hook or the chorus and it
can<00:00:37.380> really<00:00:37.559> add<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.010> dramatic<00:00:38.579> effect

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
can really add that dramatic effect

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.040 
can really add that dramatic effect
sometimes<00:00:39.690> I'll<00:00:40.140> also<00:00:40.379> use<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.480> right<00:00:42.480> right

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
sometimes I'll also use it right right

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.690 
sometimes I'll also use it right right
at<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> beginning<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> song<00:00:44.070> following

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
at the beginning of the song following

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420 
at the beginning of the song following
the<00:00:44.850> intro<00:00:45.300> right<00:00:45.570> before<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> main<00:00:47.039> part<00:00:47.370> of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the intro right before the main part of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.060 
the intro right before the main part of
the<00:00:47.579> song<00:00:47.820> kicks<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.710> very

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the song kicks in so it can be very

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.750 
the song kicks in so it can be very
useful<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:51.059> reverse<00:00:51.780> samples<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
useful to have reverse samples and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.400 
useful to have reverse samples and
especially<00:00:53.760> cymbals<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.570> let's<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.199> right

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
especially cymbals so let's get right

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.189 
especially cymbals so let's get right
into<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:57.239> first<00:00:57.510> thing<00:00:57.690> I'm<00:00:57.809> gonna<00:00:57.930> do

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
into it and the first thing I'm gonna do

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.500 
into it and the first thing I'm gonna do
is<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.559> gonna<00:00:58.620> let<00:00:58.949> load<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.699> crash<00:01:00.210> cymbal

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
is I'm gonna let load up a crash cymbal

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.860 
is I'm gonna let load up a crash cymbal
that<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.000> navigate<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
see now you can see that the the sample

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.719 
see now you can see that the the sample
has<00:01:48.870> reversed<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.530> let's<00:01:49.710> take<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> listen

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.149 

very<00:01:56.000> nice<00:01:56.240> very<00:01:56.600> nice<00:01:56.840> dramatic<00:01:57.500> effect<00:01:57.920> I

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159

recommend you try putting those before
your<00:02:00.710> hooks<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.159> choruses<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.590> after<00:02:03.590> after

your intros before the main song kicks

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.320 
your intros before the main song kicks
in<00:02:06.289> they<00:02:06.530> can<00:02:06.710> really<00:02:06.979> add<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.159> dramatic<00:02:07.460> effect

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
to your beats one more time let's hear

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.979 
to your beats one more time let's hear
that<00:02:11.150> hear<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:17.330> thing<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.750> want<00:02:17.930> to

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
that hear and one thing I want to

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.589 
that hear and one thing I want to
mention<00:02:18.110> before<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.709> let<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:18.980> go<00:02:19.280> here<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.730> what

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
mention before I let you go here is what

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.350 
mention before I let you go here is what
I<00:02:20.630> what<00:02:21.170> I'll<00:02:21.290> often<00:02:21.590> do<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:23.060> know<00:02:23.180> when<00:02:23.330> I

it<00:02:27.310> reversed<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.670> get<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> nice<00:02:29.330> effect<00:02:29.540> from

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
it reversed and get a nice effect from

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.199 
it reversed and get a nice effect from
it<00:02:30.140> I'll<00:02:30.590> save<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:30.920> as<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.400> separate<00:02:32.000> sample

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
it I'll save that as a separate sample

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.360 
it I'll save that as a separate sample
which<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.319> can<00:02:33.440> do<00:02:33.590> easily<00:02:33.890> by

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
which you can do easily by

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.720 
which you can do easily by
right-clicking<00:02:35.000> here<00:02:35.569> save<00:02:36.319> as<00:02:36.560> save<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.579> what

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
right-clicking here save as save it what

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.259 
right-clicking here save as save it what
you<00:02:37.880> want

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
you want

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.449 
you want
reverse<00:02:38.810> crash<00:02:39.230> whatever<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.010> want<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.250> save

reverse crash whatever you want to save

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.240 
reverse crash whatever you want to save
it<00:02:40.489> as<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.000> now<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.690> have<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.650> reverse

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
it as and now you have that reverse

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.120 
it as and now you have that reverse
sample<00:02:43.880> already<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.560> next<00:02:45.829> time<00:02:45.980> you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
sample already and the next time you

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.460 
sample already and the next time you
come<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:46.640> can<00:02:46.790> just<00:02:46.819> pull<00:02:47.209> that<00:02:47.239> in<00:02:47.630> as

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
come in you can just pull that in as

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.410 
come in you can just pull that in as
another<00:02:48.680> sample<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.819> don't<00:02:49.970> have<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.269> go

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
another sample and you don't have to go

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.690 
another sample and you don't have to go
through<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:50.810> short<00:02:51.530> process<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.519> will

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
through this short process but it will

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.670 
through this short process but it will
save<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.150> some<00:02:53.390> time<00:02:53.599> if<00:02:53.900> you're<00:02:54.049> doing<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.500> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
save you some time if you're doing it a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.120 
save you some time if you're doing it a
lie<00:02:55.160> in<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.299> lot<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.510> your<00:02:56.720> beats<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.319> so

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
lie in a and a lot of your beats and so

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.770 
lie in a and a lot of your beats and so
I<00:02:58.160> definitely<00:02:58.400> recommend<00:02:58.940> giving<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.630> a

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
I definitely recommend giving this a
