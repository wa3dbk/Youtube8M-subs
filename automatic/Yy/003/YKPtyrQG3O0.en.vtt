 I want to present let's make a brief 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.720
 review of tweet polos tweet 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.610
 new one that just arrived at the cid already 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.350
 he recommended it to me yesterday when my 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.810
 friend has said sergio have to do 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 a video of this tweet that is great from 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 done last week tuti talked to us in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.180
 a post from aysÃ©n to code punto net about 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.399
 the tweets that had to come out and these 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.530
 developers to three tweets that are 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.970
 the app developers or this one 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.920
 villages was also quite expected 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.480
 well finally we have the first tweet of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.250
 these people in ios 7 and let's hope that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
 coming soon to use us with 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 quite interesting alternatives this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.190
 tweet is called powders and is available 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.620
 in big box and has a price of 0.99 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.880
 American dollars and does the following 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.739
 notice that we are going to the center of 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.660
 control and we vitamin it in such a way 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.640
 that down here modifies us what 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.020
 we had and notice that we 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.210
 We can add links to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.800
 applications that we wanted this 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.910
 for me it 's super productive because I 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.530
 just being in any 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.119
 application slid with your finger to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.649
 up and I'm going to any of the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.479
 I most use applications such as 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.500
 example may be youtube agree we 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.180
 we can move 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.130
 this way we're going to tweetbot 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.260
 and this we can configure 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.940
 the nests of hits by ibai we can 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.470
 configure and we can then at the end 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.060
 ordered as we want because 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.920
 it's how I say configurable from the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.390
 adjustments let's go to the settings 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 let's go to towns that we have 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.979
 here we can see that we enter it and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.390
 to begin with we have to select from 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.920
 among all the applications that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.180
 we have installed the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.100
 applications that we want that 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.960
 appear in the control center and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.670
 from here we could order them 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.410
 we could tell him to order 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.300
 frequency for the most applications 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.130
 used that we have here below 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.660
 not obvious we can order it manually 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.910
 as you see here is any kind of 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.500
 problem we can configure it in addition 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.110
 we can see what we could do here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.550
 change the icons today by default 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.619
 some applications the most used already 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.000
 they have their icon but among all these 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.869
 we could select the one 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.180
 we would like 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.130
 also tell you that we 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.020
 we can have more options here below 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.759
 we can tell you to show four 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.619
 icons as we can normally say 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.810
 that up to six icons are shown as 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.820
 you're seeing maybe it's a bit of everything 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.530
 this I think 5 would be cool and 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.390
 note that we have paging for 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.800
 move without any limitations 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.080
 between all applications 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.840
 here to notice that we can tell you that 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.000
 show in square or in circle if 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.380
 you like me is traditional this is the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.940
 yours and you simply doing 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.770
 a gesture here you are going to have more 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.410
 applications links to applications 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.900
 what else do you use also I like in 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.670
 I like that circles as well as on 5 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.080
 well a little more just tell you 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.790
 that we have here the paging to 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.020
 to be able to move without any kind of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.370
 limits worth 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.130
 in this way then we 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.810
 we would move the cursor or at the end the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.370
 shooter this slider like us 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.140
 we would like and in this way 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.880
 appear as small pages notice and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.160
 as it appears before not a truth that is 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.110
 a pretty cool tweet very productive 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.850
 because for me it is much more comfortable in 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.950
 instead of going to the sprint board, go to the 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.330
 YouTube application for example 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.610
 being anywhere doing so a 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.110
 gesture and go to tweetbot or where I 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.090
 I would like for me as I say is 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.830
 pure productivity guys and girls 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.330
 thank you very much for the attention if you 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.370
 like in the video you can support us with 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.960
 I like it and see you in a next 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.400
 video presents with dot net in the 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.670
 forums or where you want to continue 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.670
 explain
