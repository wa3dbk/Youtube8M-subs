thing except with two mutant skeletons

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.820 
thing except with two mutant skeletons
instead<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:28.110> know<00:02:28.230> they're<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> little<00:02:28.650> bit

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830

all<00:02:31.350> right<00:02:31.500> being<00:02:31.650> skeleton<00:02:32.160> do<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.210> me

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
all right being skeleton do you see me

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.140 
all right being skeleton do you see me
am<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.960> too<00:02:34.020> short<00:02:34.440> they<00:02:35.220> can't<00:02:35.430> even<00:02:35.520> see<00:02:35.790> me

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
am I too short they can't even see me

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.900 
am I too short they can't even see me
I'm<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.870> superhero<00:02:37.260> that's<00:02:37.650> insulting<00:02:37.920> all

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
I'm a superhero that's insulting all

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.110 
I'm a superhero that's insulting all
right<00:02:39.060> guys<00:02:39.270> so<00:02:39.480> here<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:39.810> go<00:02:39.960> let<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.500> battle

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
right guys so here we go let the battle

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.620 
right guys so here we go let the battle
begin

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
begin

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.790 
begin
so<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.840> think<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.140> best<00:02:43.260> way<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.710> is

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
so I think the best way to do it is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.710 
so I think the best way to do it is
probably<00:02:44.190> immune<00:02:44.460> skeletons<00:02:44.940> first<00:02:45.210> because

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
probably immune skeletons first because

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.540 
probably immune skeletons first because
if<00:02:45.870> they<00:02:45.990> don't<00:02:46.170> go<00:02:46.260> down<00:02:46.290> then<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.280> are

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
if they don't go down then we are

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.640 
if they don't go down then we are
probably<00:02:47.910> gonna<00:02:48.120> die<00:02:48.360> now<00:02:48.930> first<00:02:49.200> one<00:02:49.410> just

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
probably gonna die now first one just

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.210 
probably gonna die now first one just
crab<00:02:50.340> here<00:02:50.490> this<00:02:50.670> rib<00:02:50.880> cage<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.860> had<00:02:52.860> one<00:02:53.070> more

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.880 
crab here this rib cage I had one more

high-resistance<00:08:03.480> but<00:08:04.200> it<00:08:04.260> would<00:08:04.350> probably

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380 
high-resistance but it would probably

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.440 
high-resistance but it would probably
just<00:08:05.070> get<00:08:05.220> ridiculous<00:08:05.910> and<00:08:06.090> I<00:08:06.120> wouldn't<00:08:06.330> take
