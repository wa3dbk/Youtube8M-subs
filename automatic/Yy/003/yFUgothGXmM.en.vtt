00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
about this guy although he does resemble

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.969 
about this guy although he does resemble
glomp<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.689> lot<00:02:06.990> I've<00:02:07.200> got<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> instruction

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
glomp a lot I've got the instruction

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.249 
glomp a lot I've got the instruction
manual<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.429> glomp<00:02:08.789> here<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.629> if<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.810> ask<00:02:09.989> me

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
manual for glomp here but if you ask me

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.559 
manual for glomp here but if you ask me
he<00:02:10.560> looks<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.979> lot<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.730> glomp<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.450> they're

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
he looks a lot like glomp and they're

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.580 
he looks a lot like glomp and they're
both<00:02:12.720> from<00:02:13.020> glory

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
both from glory

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250 
both from glory
so<00:02:14.520> yeah<00:02:14.970> it's<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.239> little<00:02:15.360> bit<00:02:15.599> disappointing

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
so yeah it's a little bit disappointing

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.250 
so yeah it's a little bit disappointing
that<00:02:16.349> they<00:02:16.530> have<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:17.010> sort<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.760> copy<00:02:18.050> glomp<00:02:19.050> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
that they have to sort of copy glomp I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.839 
that they have to sort of copy glomp I
guess<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.650> could<00:02:19.800> say<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.069> he's<00:02:20.430> got<00:02:20.580> some

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
guess you could say but he's got some

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.030 
guess you could say but he's got some
different<00:02:21.030> stuff<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.420> down<00:02:21.750> here<00:02:22.140> with<00:02:22.770> his

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
different stuff going down here with his

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.640 
different stuff going down here with his
legs<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.880> feet<00:02:24.300> I'm<00:02:24.569> kind<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.170> wondering<00:02:25.349> what

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
legs and feet I'm kind of wondering what

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.339

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
goo and stuff it's kind of interesting

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.600 
goo and stuff it's kind of interesting
I'd<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.110> see<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.860> its<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.519> know

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.460 
I'd like to see that in its you know
brick-built<00:02:33.060> state<00:02:33.569> whenever<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.050> official

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
brick-built state whenever the official

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.490 
brick-built state whenever the official
images<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.700> set<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.480> google<00:02:36.900> comes<00:02:37.200> out

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
images for this set for google comes out

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.949 
images for this set for google comes out
I'd<00:02:38.430> be<00:02:38.610> pretty<00:02:38.790> interesting<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.480> see<00:02:39.720> if<00:02:39.840> they

for<00:02:42.510> glomp<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:42.989> use<00:02:43.200> these<00:02:43.500> ones<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.550> they

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
for glomp they use these ones that they

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.460 
for glomp they use these ones that they
use<00:02:44.790> for<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.060> spinner<00:02:45.330> booster<00:02:45.810> packs<00:02:46.049> from

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470

arms so I'd like to see how those come

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.940 
arms so I'd like to see how those come
out<00:03:18.540> hopefully<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.380> get<00:03:19.470> some<00:03:19.530> ball<00:03:19.829> and

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
out hopefully we can get some ball and

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.380 
out hopefully we can get some ball and
socket<00:03:20.280> joints<00:03:20.579> on<00:03:20.700> these<00:03:20.850> guys<00:03:21.090> cuz

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
socket joints on these guys cuz

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.630 
socket joints on these guys cuz
obviously<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.170> articulation<00:03:23.160> with<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.519> ball

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
obviously the articulation with the ball

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.789 
obviously the articulation with the ball
and<00:03:23.760> socket<00:03:24.060> joints<00:03:24.359> are<00:03:24.480> way<00:03:24.690> better<00:03:24.930> now<00:03:25.650> as

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
and socket joints are way better now as

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.319 
and socket joints are way better now as
you<00:03:25.920> come<00:03:26.100> up<00:03:26.130> here<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.670> see<00:03:26.820> sort<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.180> his

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
really do anything because they're so

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.339 
really do anything because they're so
you<00:05:30.069> know<00:05:30.159> close<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.669> ground<00:05:31.080> now<00:05:32.080> this

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
you know close to the ground now this

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.809 
you know close to the ground now this
picture<00:05:32.560> that<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:32.889> sketched<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.430> put<00:05:33.639> it<00:05:33.729> a

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
picture that I sketched I put it a

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.670 
picture that I sketched I put it a
little<00:05:33.969> bit<00:05:34.150> too<00:05:34.300> high<00:05:34.539> because<00:05:35.169> I<00:05:35.319> really

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
little bit too high because I really

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.559 
little bit too high because I really
think<00:05:35.830> he<00:05:36.039> is<00:05:36.129> gonna<00:05:36.279> be<00:05:36.520> just<00:05:36.789> like<00:05:36.879> flain<00:05:37.360> and

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569 
think he is gonna be just like flain and

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.709 
think he is gonna be just like flain and
Fleur<00:05:37.949> legs<00:05:38.949> they're<00:05:39.909> just<00:05:40.120> not<00:05:40.330> gonna<00:05:40.539> be

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
Fleur legs they're just not gonna be

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.540 
Fleur legs they're just not gonna be
able<00:05:40.839> to<00:05:41.020> articulate<00:05:41.620> or<00:05:42.039> they're<00:05:42.310> not<00:05:42.460> gonna

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
able to articulate or they're not gonna

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.369 
able to articulate or they're not gonna
be<00:05:42.699> able<00:05:42.789> to<00:05:42.939> do<00:05:43.089> anything<00:05:43.389> really<00:05:43.719> so<00:05:44.199> that's

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:44.379 
be able to do anything really so that's

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.409 
be able to do anything really so that's
a<00:05:44.469> little<00:05:44.620> bit<00:05:44.800> disappointing<00:05:45.099> I<00:05:45.610> really<00:05:46.240> like

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
a little bit disappointing I really like

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:47.939 
a little bit disappointing I really like
the<00:05:46.599> longer<00:05:46.990> legs<00:05:47.199> just<00:05:47.469> because<00:05:47.740> of<00:05:47.860> the

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
the longer legs just because of the

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.820 
the longer legs just because of the
Arctic<00:05:48.240> articulation<00:05:49.240> but<00:05:50.080> yeah<00:05:50.409> I<00:05:50.439> mean<00:05:50.680> it's

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
Arctic articulation but yeah I mean it's

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.399 
Arctic articulation but yeah I mean it's
