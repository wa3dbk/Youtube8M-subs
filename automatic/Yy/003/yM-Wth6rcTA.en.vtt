00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.030
 Hello, I have long wanted to take a small 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.870
 review on your video tripod tripod for 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.500
 Camcorder bought it for a long time 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:25.140
 in the summer but the hands did not reach 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:27.619
 take a little review this is a tripod firm 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.619
 well done 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:43.559
 model all 400 is the smallest 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 tripod from this line is still in the Elban 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.289
 7,600 essays 800 which is designed for 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:56.940
 heavier 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:01:01.850
 camcorder tripod made of such 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.850
 telescopic legs 3 knee 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.670
 bottom rubber feet tips 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:23.800
 clamps made of plastic that is not 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:28.800
 good principle but for this tripod 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:34.590
 price category in principle ok 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.590
 the number of YouTube is growing which is very good and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.790
 problem of choice 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.810
 so to speak filming equipment 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.810
 quite sharply 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.970
 as i found out the tripods are divided into two 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.170
 categories then tripods for photo and tripods 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:03.450
 for the video they are different here 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:08.160
 turning part of video tripods 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.650
 equipped with the possibility of a smooth rotation 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.100
 which eliminates sharp jerks when turning 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.100
 camera 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.730
 head made of plastic 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:47.250
 the adjusting screws can not head yet 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:53.519
 climb up let the side screw and 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:57.269
 Twist for you I take this pen on my hand 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.269
 this is a little awkward 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:18.719
 this is the maximum height of the tripod 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.719
 prepared in advance at the roulette table 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:34.510
 maximum tripod height 1480 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:40.950
 millimeters that is if you put here 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:45.389
 the camera is just the lens will be on top 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.389
 exactly one and a half meters from the floor 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.780
 head can still detachable that is 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.310
 here is this lever 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.020
 if we turn this playground on 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.989
 which the camera is mounted it can 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:19.750
 shoot that allows when shooting 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:24.040
 quickly remove the camera and capture the desired 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.670
 you have a moment and it is also easy to put in here 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.670
 such grooves 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:38.350
 then the ground goes grooves and with light 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.350
 pressed fixed 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:54.160
 the handle has a little so curved 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:05:00.820
 form that can be rotated let go 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:05.870
 screw can put up down in the side 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:08.470
 as you wish, depending on 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.470
 situations 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:25.389
 tripod is equipped with a small level 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:39.620
 I have concrete floors here 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:45.199
 about somewhere to the tripod comes in 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:48.009
 there is another cardboard box 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.009
 carrying case 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:59.539
 This of course the Chinese she dust me 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:06:06.620
 settings so of course china but stuff 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:14.539
 pretty good hard here 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:18.740
 pen so buying a camera is still 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:21.189
 far from all that is needed for quality 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.189
 stuffing 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:28.930
 shoot dare 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.930
