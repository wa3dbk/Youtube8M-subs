against<00:05:38.990> boo<00:05:39.110> boo<00:05:39.260> boo<00:05:39.289> boom<00:05:39.590> I<00:05:39.889> as<00:05:40.789> you<00:05:40.909> saw<00:05:41.120> in

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
against boo boo boo boom I as you saw in

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.149 
against boo boo boo boom I as you saw in
the<00:05:41.360> beginning<00:05:41.509> of<00:05:41.810> this<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:41.990> did<00:05:42.169> do<00:05:42.320> one<00:05:42.590> kind

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
the beginning of this I did do one kind

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.350 
the beginning of this I did do one kind
of<00:05:43.250> drop<00:05:43.460> shot<00:05:43.699> on<00:05:43.820> oath<00:05:43.970> it<00:05:44.060> was<00:05:44.150> really<00:05:44.330> a

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
of drop shot on oath it was really a

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.360 
of drop shot on oath it was really a
drop<00:05:44.659> shot<00:05:44.900> I<00:05:45.199> was<00:05:45.530> never<00:05:45.680> really<00:05:45.800> big<00:05:46.159> on<00:05:46.280> the

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
drop shot I was never really big on the

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.610 
drop shot I was never really big on the
drop<00:05:46.580> shot<00:05:46.759> thing<00:05:47.090> but<00:05:47.389> it<00:05:48.080> was<00:05:48.199> pretty<00:05:48.380> cool

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
drop shot thing but it was pretty cool

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.680 
drop shot thing but it was pretty cool
and<00:05:48.949> see<00:05:49.460> as<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.580> started<00:05:50.120> to<00:05:50.180> hold<00:05:50.449> it<00:05:50.570> down

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
and see as I started to hold it down

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.120 
and see as I started to hold it down
right<00:05:50.930> trigger<00:05:51.169> there<00:05:51.320> for<00:05:51.470> a<00:05:51.500> few<00:05:51.710> seconds

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
right trigger there for a few seconds

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.279 
right trigger there for a few seconds
and<00:05:52.310> usually<00:05:52.909> it's<00:05:53.180> just<00:05:53.539> easier<00:05:53.840> doing<00:05:53.990> burst

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
and usually it's just easier doing burst

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.379 
and usually it's just easier doing burst
fire<00:05:54.530> because<00:05:54.770> you<00:05:54.889> can<00:05:55.009> pace<00:05:55.759> your<00:05:55.940> shots<00:05:56.180> and

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
fire because you can pace your shots and

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.060 
fire because you can pace your shots and
you<00:05:56.449> can<00:05:56.570> get<00:05:56.720> more<00:05:56.930> accuracy<00:05:57.440> so<00:05:57.680> that<00:05:57.830> fires

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
you can get more accuracy so that fires

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.010 
you can get more accuracy so that fires
faster<00:05:59.199> but<00:06:00.199> yeah<00:06:00.320> guys<00:06:00.560> so

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
faster but yeah guys so

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.770 
faster but yeah guys so
like<00:06:02.620> I<00:06:02.710> said<00:06:02.889> we've<00:06:03.069> got<00:06:03.099> the<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:04.300> Grifball
