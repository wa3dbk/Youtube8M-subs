hey guys rhetoric here today I got a

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.499 
hey guys rhetoric here today I got a
video<00:00:03.259> with<00:00:04.259> another<00:00:04.589> thing<00:00:04.859> about<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.509> post

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
video with another thing about the post

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.070 
video with another thing about the post
patch<00:00:06.810> stuff<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.560> time<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.160> l85a2<00:00:09.080> now

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
patch stuff this time with the l85a2 now

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.839 
patch stuff this time with the l85a2 now
right<00:00:10.620> now<00:00:10.769> I'm<00:00:10.889> running<00:00:11.130> with<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.250> foregrip

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
right now I'm running with the foregrip

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.950 
right now I'm running with the foregrip
laser<00:00:12.240> sight<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.110> ACOG<00:00:13.650> scope<00:00:13.679> which<00:00:14.400> I

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
laser sight and the ACOG scope which I

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.359 
laser sight and the ACOG scope which I
think<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.199> might<00:00:16.260> make<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:16.980> down<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> little

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
think this might make this down a little

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.480 
think this might make this down a little
bit<00:00:17.520> glitchy<00:00:17.789> because<00:00:18.390> I'm<00:00:19.080> getting<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> really

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
bit glitchy because I'm getting a really

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.400 
bit glitchy because I'm getting a really
good<00:00:20.850> accuracy<00:00:21.510> when<00:00:21.810> firing<00:00:22.140> from<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> hip

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
good accuracy when firing from the hip

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.160 
good accuracy when firing from the hip
on<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.859> thing<00:00:23.570> with<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> laser<00:00:24.930> sight

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
on this thing with the laser sight

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.720 
on this thing with the laser sight
turned<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.830> i'm<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:26.099> sure<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.519> they'd

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
turned on so i'm not sure if they'd

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.880 
turned on so i'm not sure if they'd
really<00:00:27.090> buffed<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.720> accuracy<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> hip<00:00:28.619> firing

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
really buffed the accuracy of hip firing

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.179 
really buffed the accuracy of hip firing
with<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.519> weapon<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.449> particular<00:00:31.189> but

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
with this weapon but in particular but

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.190 
with this weapon but in particular but
if<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.430> notice<00:00:32.610> though<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.540> spread<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:33.960> this

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
if you notice though the spread on this

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.040 
if you notice though the spread on this
thing<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.590> very<00:00:34.950> very<00:00:35.250> tight<00:00:41.719> now<00:00:42.719> if<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.899> pay

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
thing is very very tight now if you pay

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.170 
thing is very very tight now if you pay
attention<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> grouping<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
attention to the grouping here and this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.240 
attention to the grouping here and this
time<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:45.570> running<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.170> Cobra<00:00:46.469> site<00:00:46.890> for

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
time I'm running with the Cobra site for

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.060 
time I'm running with the Cobra site for
grip<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.760> laser<00:00:48.360> pointer<00:00:48.899> notice<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
grip and laser pointer notice the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
grip and laser pointer notice the
roofing<00:00:50.370> right<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.390> maintains<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.020> very

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
roofing right here it's maintains a very

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.770 
roofing right here it's maintains a very
tight<00:00:52.500> spread<00:00:52.949> almost<00:00:53.550> comparable<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.510> when

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
tight spread almost comparable to when

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.010 
tight spread almost comparable to when
your<00:00:54.899> abs<00:00:55.530> are<00:00:56.010> aiming<00:00:56.309> down<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.699> site<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.239> mean

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
your abs are aiming down the site I mean

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.290 
your abs are aiming down the site I mean
the<00:00:58.379> spread<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> hipfire<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.940> little

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the spread on the hipfire is a little

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.439 
the spread on the hipfire is a little
bit<00:01:00.449> more<00:01:00.719> than<00:01:01.170> 80<00:01:01.530> s<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.820> same<00:01:03.059> time<00:01:03.270> though

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
bit more than 80 s the same time though

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.549 
bit more than 80 s the same time though
that's<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.930> much<00:01:04.049> difference

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that's not really that much difference

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.760 
that's not really that much difference
so<00:01:04.909> watch<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.420> people<00:01:06.659> using<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> l85a2

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so watch out for people using the l85a2

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.820 
so watch out for people using the l85a2
because<00:01:11.299> with<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> colorblind<00:01:12.900> mode<00:01:13.200> they

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
because with the colorblind mode they

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.820 
because with the colorblind mode they
changed<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.909> more<00:01:15.799> spread<00:01:16.799> out

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
changed it so that it's more spread out

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
changed it so that it's more spread out
across<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.280> entire<00:01:17.729> map<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.240> look<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
across the entire map if you look on the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.060 
across the entire map if you look on the
map<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.020> everything's<00:01:19.590> orange<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
map right here everything's orange and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.270 
map right here everything's orange and
blue<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.939> turn<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:22.009> everything<00:01:23.009> on

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
blue but if I turn this on everything on

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.580 
blue but if I turn this on everything on
the<00:01:23.729> map<00:01:23.909> turns<00:01:24.210> dark<00:01:24.570> red<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.170> dark<00:01:25.439> blue

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the map turns dark red and dark blue

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
the map turns dark red and dark blue
except<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> objectives<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.150> can

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
except for the objectives that I can

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
except for the objectives that I can
physically<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:27.780> myself<00:01:31.220> now<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.369> far<00:01:32.549> as

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
physically see myself now as far as

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.030 
physically see myself now as far as
below<00:01:33.000> radar<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> stingers<00:01:33.900> go<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.770> below

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
below radar and stingers go the below

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.429 
below radar and stingers go the below
radar<00:01:35.189> works<00:01:35.579> very<00:01:35.850> well<00:01:35.970> including<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> ECM

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
radar works very well including the ECM

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
radar works very well including the ECM
jammer<00:01:37.470> below<00:01:38.460> radar<00:01:38.640> basically<00:01:39.299> makes<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.540> so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
jammer below radar basically makes it so

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.990 
jammer below radar basically makes it so
I<00:01:39.689> cannot<00:01:40.110> lock<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.829> him<00:01:40.979> until<00:01:41.220> he's<00:01:41.729> about

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
I cannot lock on to him until he's about

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.960 
I cannot lock on to him until he's about
25<00:01:42.360> meters<00:01:42.869> above<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.200> ground<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.700> look

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
25 meters above the ground you can look

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.280 
25 meters above the ground you can look
at<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.149> inside<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> hut<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> helicopter

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
at that inside the hut of the helicopter

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.039 
at that inside the hut of the helicopter
you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.430> see<00:01:47.640> how<00:01:47.790> high<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.509> above<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.840> ground

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you can see how high up above the ground

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.550 
you can see how high up above the ground
it<00:01:49.829> pops<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> ECM<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:51.390> works<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.930> normal<00:01:52.140> as

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it pops the ECM that works as normal as

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.100 
it pops the ECM that works as normal as
far<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.159> tell<00:01:53.280> right<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:54.600> Stingers

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
far as I can tell right now the Stingers

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.340 
far as I can tell right now the Stingers
have<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> lot<00:01:55.799> more<00:01:55.950> power<00:01:56.219> behind<00:01:56.430> them<00:01:57.350> see

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
have a lot more power behind them see

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.530 
have a lot more power behind them see
one<00:01:58.590> shot<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> he's<00:01:59.460> already<00:01:59.700> disabled<00:02:00.360> he's
