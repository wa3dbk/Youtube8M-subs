00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello guys welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.150
 particular video after that of 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.610
 francesco on iphone 6 plus this time 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.830
 I on iphone if I say what is not me 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.830
 liked the new apple home apple 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.120
 good guys particular video because me 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.080
 I find myself speaking ill of a practically 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.440
 phone that for now really is for me 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.060
 awesome 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.940
 in reality there are actually gods 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.830
 things that I would have liked apple not 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.690
 did it differently and then 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.760
 we see them in this video 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.100
 then clearly there is the number one 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.610
 protruding camera not that this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.790
 camera both uncomfortable and that much 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.220
 ugly here is just the point is that it is a 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.260
 more element that perhaps there would not be 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.629
 it had to be here that I think maybe 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.269
 in an iphone 6 s it could fail 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.800
 so no doubt in this is one of the 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.350
 reasons why the camera is at first 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.710
 place but also the fact that being 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.159
 coated with that strip we say in 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.320
 aluminum nodÃ¬ given may copies of the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.140
 same effect that had the edge of 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.750
 iphone 5 and iphone 5 if that is in case of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.720
 bumps could peel off the paint and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.370
 this is something in short I do 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.230
 I worry a lot and it's the only point 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.660
 weak in the aesthetics of this 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.270
 device that still returns a 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.260
 very resistant effect we say to the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.360
 bumps to falls and nothing so this 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.430
 is without doubt one of the first aspects that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.070
 not so much that they go to the iPhone's genius 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.080
 6 in second place we find even if me 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.170
 I'm used to it but it's clearly one 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.670
 which must be accepted at the beginning 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.130
 lines here on the back 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.270
 then again I admit a silver model 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.490
 that clearly this here 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.280
 these lines I have to say today not 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.770
 sorry because I'm used to it 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.929
 because now I notice them much less than before 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.670
 but in any case these lines on the back 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.860
 they begin I don't say to like myself though 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.349
 at least, however, I accept them 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.019
 I recognize that I probably am not the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.629
 most elegant solution for iphone yes 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.910
 they could be thinner then less 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.040
 visible could not be really there but 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.510
 this is not possible because they integrate 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.160
 practically the nfc chip for apple pay 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.750
 so no doubt you could have a 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.060
 different color we say that precisely on the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.069
 servers are less noticeable but on the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.160
 gold model are really white a 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.620
 full white and gold are so noticeable 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.319
 so no doubt these lines are a 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.549
 aspect to consider is that not at all 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.870
 they may like it 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.420
 another thing that is not really me 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.790
 liked it even though it's minor like like 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.069
 defect we say is the fact that apple 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.329
 has decided to return the 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.390
 front camera 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.060
 here on the side of the iphone and not above 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.430
 as on iphone 5 its with 5 on iphone 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.459
 5 c honestly I did not understand the reason 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.049
 of this choice, however, here in this 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.109
 practically if we want to do a 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.239
 facetime take a self the camera 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.389
 it is no longer clearly centered 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.780
 we are talking about mm then of displacement 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:16.150
 of the photo but clearly it is a thing to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.980
 consider when it is used 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.109
 the front camera of the phone 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.209
 first you hit the phone is 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.870
 the center was also automatically centered 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.639
 camera 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.130
 another thing I didn't like about 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.280
 iphone 6 but not really iphone 6 e 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.590
 the absence in the package in the package 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.690
 of a lightning usb cable 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.280
 completely reversible if it was 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.669
 spoken would have been a great one 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.010
 practical innovation precisely because you have 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.489
 a usb cable from any side 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.169
 put it all right you know how long 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.150
 both inconvenient and occasionally enter the 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.650
 usb cable on the one hand realize that 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.109
 it's not the right side to have to turn the 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.489
 cable insert it again so yes this 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.540
 it's something I would have liked 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.540
 clearly not 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.099
 it won't change much, in short, it will remain 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.500
 like last year like all these 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.689
 years but here maybe with iphone 6 and if 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.640
 I'd like to see this change 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.430
 inside the package for a 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.379
 accessory for a cable in other words 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.450
 practical iphone if I didn't like it 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.159
 also a choice made by apple of 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.590
 exclude this practically 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.750
 device from using one 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.509
 optical stabilizer that arrives instead 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.130
 on iphone 6 plus is something that apple 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.380
 could very well also include in the 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.000
 iphone 6 camera however did not have it 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.250
 done maybe it will also be in 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.410
 this case for iphone 6s though here 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.330
 this is a marketing choice 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.699
 apple that I didn't go to so much at 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.979
 genius because it was just made 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.139
 practically to differentiate fonsi 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.479
 iphone 6 plus when also on iphone if 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.190
 there were all there were all 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.500
 possibility to carry it 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.120
 optical stabilizer and not software in 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.099
 last analysis something that is not me 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.419
 much liked but at the same time me 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.849
 like it because it's hard now 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.949
 explain the edges of the iphone if like 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.810
 we know they are extremely curved 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.820
 so the screen also curves into 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.860
 final part returning an effect 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.419
 very pleasant when you are in fact 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.430
 from the edge to the center of the screen 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.650
 or from the center of the screen towards the 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.389
 board here is this note was made 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.389
 possible thanks to the rounded design 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.620
 at the edges and practically symmetrical of the 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.720
 phone itself 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.789
 now everything is beautiful, not fabulous 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.530
 I would never change so better and with 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.970
 this small flaw that I will tell you about 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.400
 than not otherwise 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.010
 but here is this design when you have it 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.590
 own hands very dry or 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.660
 very humid instead at least at least 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.790
 in my experience it can happen that the 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.800
 phone in hand is a little less 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.530
 safe as if at any moment 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.510
 should it slip away so this is it 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.030
 no doubt an effect that I noticed 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.860
 and I'm continuing to notice a little 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.110
 it happened at the time of iphone 3g from iphone 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.300
 3gs maybe better with iphone yes anyway 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.960
 however it is something to consider ie 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.160
 iphone 6 maybe in hand in some cases 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.620
 you have to pay attention to how you do it 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.060
 which is clearly also a 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.280
 iphone 6 plus problem because it has i 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.220
 same rounded edges however I repeat is 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.320
 something I accept is anyway 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.680
 able to pay attention almost always 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.410
 hands way I fall the iphone 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.390
 but here is something to consider 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.850
 beautiful borders all fabulous design 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.740
 however, it can at times 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.750
 turn out not to be uncomfortable but a little less 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.250
 sure good guys i'm andrea 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.470
