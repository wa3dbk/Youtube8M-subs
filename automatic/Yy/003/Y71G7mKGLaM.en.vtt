tractor has been sitting the longest out

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.459 
tractor has been sitting the longest out
here<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.790> but<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.030> was<00:00:12.210> winterized<00:00:12.719> properly

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
here so but it was winterized properly

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.970 
here so but it was winterized properly
and<00:00:13.650> thoroughly<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.849> should<00:00:15.150> run<00:00:15.980> let's

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
and thoroughly so it should run let's

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.090 
and thoroughly so it should run let's
see<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.369> winterized<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> fall<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:19.100> 2003

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
see we winterized it in the fall of 2003

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.720 
see we winterized it in the fall of 2003
so<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.150> means<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.260> been<00:00:22.380> sitting<00:00:22.680> for

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
so that means that it's been sitting for

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.009 
so that means that it's been sitting for
geez<00:00:23.730> almost<00:00:24.090> 5<00:00:24.330> years<00:00:24.359> without<00:00:24.900> being
