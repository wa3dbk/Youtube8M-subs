00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hey guys I finally got ahold of a r4i

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.300 
hey guys I finally got ahold of a r4i
and<00:00:03.600> I'm<00:00:04.080> actually<00:00:04.230> quite<00:00:04.620> surprised<00:00:05.069> with

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
and I'm actually quite surprised with

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.039 
and I'm actually quite surprised with
the<00:00:05.430> quality<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.299> was<00:00:06.540> thinking<00:00:06.930> it's

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
the quality of this I was thinking it's

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.629 
the quality of this I was thinking it's
another<00:00:07.259> fake<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.919> it's<00:00:08.010> gonna<00:00:08.130> be<00:00:08.280> made<00:00:08.519> out

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
another fake and it's gonna be made out

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.120 
another fake and it's gonna be made out
of<00:00:08.730> cheap<00:00:08.910> material<00:00:09.360> but<00:00:09.510> at<00:00:09.570> least<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
of cheap material but at least it the

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.270 
of cheap material but at least it the
case<00:00:11.130> it's<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.580> pretty<00:00:12.300> decent<00:00:12.590> um<00:00:13.590> there's<00:00:14.099> no

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
case it's a pretty decent um there's no

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.160 
case it's a pretty decent um there's no
other<00:00:14.400> stats<00:00:14.790> it's<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.330> lot<00:00:15.450> bigger<00:00:15.660> or<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> lot

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
other stats it's a lot bigger or a lot

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.609 
other stats it's a lot bigger or a lot
smaller<00:00:16.560> than<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.980> older<00:00:17.910> r4<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.260> let's<00:00:19.500> take

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
smaller than the older r4 so let's take

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:30.589 
smaller than the older r4 so let's take
a<00:00:19.650> look<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.670> very<00:00:29.820> straightforward<00:00:30.179> they

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
a look so it's very straightforward they

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.490 
a look so it's very straightforward they
just<00:00:30.779> give<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> micro<00:00:31.470> SD<00:00:31.710> card<00:00:31.949> reader<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
just give you a micro SD card reader and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
just give you a micro SD card reader and
Department<00:00:34.790> they<00:00:35.790> don't<00:00:35.940> give<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> strap

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
Department they don't give you a strap

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.360 
Department they don't give you a strap
or<00:00:36.660> CD<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> guess<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.620> expect<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.190> you'll

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
or CD I guess they expect that you'll

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.220 
or CD I guess they expect that you'll
just<00:00:38.550> go<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.910> r4i<00:00:39.329> sdhc<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:42.079> download<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
just go to the r4i sdhc and download the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:53.270 
just go to the r4i sdhc and download the
latest<00:00:43.260> firmware<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.590> looks<00:00:49.770> good<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:53.219> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
latest firmware so it looks good so I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.590 
latest firmware so it looks good so I
went<00:00:53.520> ahead<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.730> loaded<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.270> 4<00:00:54.480> gigabyte

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
went ahead and loaded up a 4 gigabyte

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.080 
went ahead and loaded up a 4 gigabyte
micro<00:00:55.199> SDHC<00:00:55.260> card<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.309> let's<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:56.910> this

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
micro SDHC card and let's see if this

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.549 
micro SDHC card and let's see if this
works

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.779 

this<00:01:01.559> kind<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.829> needs<00:01:02.010> right<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> back

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
this kind of needs right on the back

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.429 
this kind of needs right on the back
says<00:01:03.329> r4i<00:01:03.840> sdhc<00:01:03.870> I'm<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.799> see<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:06.439> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
says r4i sdhc I'm going to see this and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.290 
says r4i sdhc I'm going to see this and
this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> US<00:01:08.340> Nintendo<00:01:08.880> DSi

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:24.749 

give<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.450> shot

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:37.710 

every<00:01:25.759> icon<00:01:26.149> by

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.150 

okay<00:01:38.730> looks<00:01:39.730> good<00:01:39.820> so<00:01:40.120> far<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.950> little

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
okay looks good so far it's a little

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.220 
okay looks good so far it's a little
laggy<00:01:42.430> but<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.540> probably<00:01:43.810> because<00:01:43.990> they<00:01:44.140> got

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
laggy but it's probably because they got

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.050 
laggy but it's probably because they got
this<00:01:44.380> weird<00:01:44.740> effect<00:01:44.920> where<00:01:45.460> they<00:01:45.580> move<00:01:45.910> the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
this weird effect where they move the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:59.550 
this weird effect where they move the
icon<00:01:46.210> from<00:01:46.690> right<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:46.930> left

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:08.350 

looks<00:02:00.560> like<00:02:00.710> it's<00:02:00.890> working<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.880> dark<00:02:08.090> fry<00:02:08.300> is

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
looks like it's working so dark fry is

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.450 
looks like it's working so dark fry is
good<00:02:08.750> for<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.020> u.s.<00:02:09.259> nintendo<00:02:09.740> dsi<00:02:09.890> at<00:02:10.310> least

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
good for the u.s. nintendo dsi at least

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.190 
good for the u.s. nintendo dsi at least
as<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.729> today<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.240> loaded<00:02:11.660> up<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.870> latest

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
as of today I loaded up the latest

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.850 
as of today I loaded up the latest
firmware<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:14.110> first<00:02:15.110> wasn't<00:02:15.260> gonna<00:02:15.500> recommend

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
firmware I first wasn't gonna recommend

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.680 
firmware I first wasn't gonna recommend
the<00:02:16.130> r4i<00:02:16.520> because<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.180> thought<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.450> was<00:02:17.510> just

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the r4i because I thought it was just

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.360 
the r4i because I thought it was just
another<00:02:17.900> fake<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.650> know<00:02:18.740> clone<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
another fake you know clone of the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.700 
another fake you know clone of the
original<00:02:19.400> r4<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.300> um<00:02:20.450> these<00:02:20.840> guys<00:02:21.320> seem<00:02:21.560> to

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
original r4 but um these guys seem to

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.410 
original r4 but um these guys seem to
update<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.160> firmware<00:02:22.370> quite<00:02:22.760> often<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.240> last

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
update the firmware quite often the last

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.680 
update the firmware quite often the last
one<00:02:23.600> was<00:02:23.780> from<00:02:24.220> 10<00:02:25.220> days<00:02:25.400> ago<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.850> yeah<00:02:26.660> I
