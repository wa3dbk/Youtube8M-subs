00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
Japanese names let me know if I got it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.319 
Japanese names let me know if I got it
right<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.320> using<00:00:34.800> something<00:00:35.760> like<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
right is using something like this a

right is using something like this a
virtual<00:00:36.840> reality<00:00:36.930> machine<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.219> in

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
virtual reality machine but I think in

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.360 
virtual reality machine but I think in
the<00:00:38.370> year<00:00:38.520> 2022<00:00:39.410> where<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.559> fully<00:00:40.829> realized

one Sao and finds out that if he dies in

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
one Sao and finds out that if he dies in
the<00:00:49.020> game<00:00:49.230> he<00:00:49.680> dies<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.039> real<00:00:50.190> life<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
