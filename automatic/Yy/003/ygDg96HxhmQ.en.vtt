00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.569
 as they are welcome to my channel 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.669
 the lupita recipes today I'm going 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:34.050
 to show them how to make an ice cream 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:37.300
 cheese is very easy to make this ice cream 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.700
 we are going to need a liter of base for 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.610
 ice cream remember that this base and the 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.340
 we have in the channel and I'm going to leave them 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.560
 in the description box the link 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.850
 so you can see how it 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.149
 make this ice cream base 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.640
 we're going to need cream cheese and 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.710
 I in this case have a bar of more 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.980
 of a kilo but we're just going to 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.250
 need 200 grams of cheese 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.290
 so let's start with our side 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.810
 and the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.190
 you already know is to beat our cream 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.190
 until I double its volume 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.509
 let's let it beat 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.700
 and while we are going to start our 200 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.000
 grams of our cheese that should be at 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.000
 room temperature 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.480
 here I already have my cheese split 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.110
 Now let's add it to our base 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.110
 for ice cream 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.680
 let's start adding our cheese 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.930
 remember that you have to be 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.080
 room temperature and I split it in 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.740
 pieces to make it easier in 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.740
 mingle 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.680
 let's finish beating 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.409
 let's pay for our blender and let's 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.530
 empty our ice cream in a container 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.140
 aluminum or plastic to carry it 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.480
 to the freezer 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.310
 well we emptied our ice cream now 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.580
 let's take it to the freezer for a 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.470
 time to later take it out we're going to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.450
 to beat again we will return to 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.850
 go back to the freezer and we go back to 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.770
 beat all this procedure that 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.480
 We always make for our ice cream like this 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.910
 it's like our ice cream has been 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.920
 I served it on a plate of 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.140
 chocolate 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.930
