too much but we're after those three and
we<00:03:07.720> need<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.260> low<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.340> or<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:10.660> string<00:03:11.290> at<00:03:11.470> the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
we need the low a or the a string at the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.780 

okay<00:03:15.430> that's<00:03:15.670> B<00:03:16.000> flat<00:03:16.890> we<00:03:17.890> also<00:03:18.130> don't<00:03:18.490> want<00:03:18.700> to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
okay that's B flat we also don't want to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.180 
okay that's B flat we also don't want to
play<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.030> low<00:03:19.240> E<00:03:19.270> string<00:03:19.420> on<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:19.960> one<00:03:20.190> okay

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
play the low E string on that one okay

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.970 
play the low E string on that one okay
so<00:03:21.940> if<00:03:22.210> we<00:03:22.810> want<00:03:22.990> something<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.530> little<00:03:23.650> easier

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
so if we want something a little easier

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.400 
so if we want something a little easier
we<00:03:24.640> can<00:03:24.820> just<00:03:25.000> treat<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.480> like<00:03:25.660> an<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.990> this<00:03:26.230> is

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
we can just treat it like an a this is

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.250 
we can just treat it like an a this is
an<00:03:26.560> egg<00:03:26.710> court<00:03:27.100> move<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.270> up<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.570> half<00:03:28.750> step<00:03:28.780> and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
an egg court move it up a half step and

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.710 
an egg court move it up a half step and
you<00:03:29.440> gotta<00:03:29.710> be<00:03:30.010> flat<00:03:30.400> but<00:03:31.210> you<00:03:31.360> have<00:03:31.570> to

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
you gotta be flat but you have to

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.140 
you gotta be flat but you have to
isolate<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:32.710> get<00:03:33.310> these<00:03:33.520> strings<00:03:34.110> okay

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
isolate and get these strings okay

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.250 
isolate and get these strings okay
because<00:03:37.150> if<00:03:37.270> you<00:03:37.330> put<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.600> other<00:03:37.750> strings<00:03:38.050> in

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
because if you put the other strings in

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.950 
because if you put the other strings in
there<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.530> sounds<00:03:38.830> bad<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:40.720> those

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
there it sounds bad so just those

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.560 
there it sounds bad so just those
strings<00:03:41.470> are<00:03:41.830> B<00:03:42.550> flat<00:03:42.820> chord<00:03:43.180> third<00:03:43.960> fret<00:03:44.400> okay

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
strings are B flat chord third fret okay

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.800 
strings are B flat chord third fret okay
