00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello I am olive tree I am 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.340
 climbed teacher today I 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.580
 will introduce you to the node of 8 then 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.540
 why induced rather than another 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.620
 so there was a time when we used 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.630
 a lot what we did the game of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 chairs favor one of chairs 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.590
 it's easy to get rid of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.789
 on once you took a lead 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.220
 that is, once you have fallen 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.590
 that you exercised a maximum charge 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.640
 at the level of not keeping down for 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.920
 to do them is very simple 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.590
 the disadvantage is that it does not make them 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.540
 also very easily so we opted for 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 general for one of the eight that is him 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.780
 a bit harder to undo once 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.760
 you took a lead no - he did not 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.800
 will not move as I wanted 10 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.200
 knots of chairs very easy to undo 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.430
 9.8 very hard to undo once you 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.940
 have taken a plan so here I am you 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.079
 presents one of the many strings that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.989
 exist in climbing 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.879
 so there are several diameters it goes from 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.649
 12 mm his season big fat 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.120
 ropes it's less and less used 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.910
 because it's very heavy to wear so 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.170
 it's more for rooms up to 9 mm 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.540
 so how to achieve an induced 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.080
 here's how to determine the right 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.140
 length of rope to make the No. 18 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 so we take to the end or the hand 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.960
 and the other end we level it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.290
 from the shoulder it's about a little 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.479
 less than 1 meter 80 cm by 10 cm take 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.670
 the rope on one side you blocked it with 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.090
 the thumb like this you pass the other 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.829
 end of the rope over you do 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.060
 many groups like that rolls to block and 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.060
 well you pick from below 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.560
 you grab the end and you got it 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.880
 dive into the eye here you are 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.680
 have what is called half of the 8 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.140
 to realize the continuation you put on 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.420
 the end of the agreement so here and no 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.330
 not on that part that is made for 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.820
 support metal objects 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.660
 so it's at the legs and at the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.850
 belt level and that's it 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:07.870
 simple we will follow the path of the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:09.580
 rope and come out here so we put on 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.610
 stick the knot as close as possible to the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.600
 harness and we continue the journey 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.600
 like this 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.550
 of course we pull each end of the rope 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.190
 end of the rope called in the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.440
 jargon the arm one pulls an arm then 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.210
 the other one you check that are not 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.770
 well tight here is an induced 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.210
 when we take a fall the pressure 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.040
 on the best is huge when we arrive 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.780
 in voice down the path and we want 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.950
 undo it is very very hard 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.110
 so we have to do what's called 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.860
 break the do you bend well the agreement 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.720
 says if you take that part there and 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.700
 you the case this is called the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.830
 break and there you can do them 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.180
 quietly fall so you saw 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.650
 as finally reduced 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.750
 it's one of the simplest knots 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.840
 very important to know it by heart 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.750
 really know how to do it 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.000
 be careful when a climber by in 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.010
 cliff to check well several times 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.380
 this knot is well done most of 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.900
 accidents that are occurring in 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.270
 cliff it's often due a bad knot 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.290
 done now it's up to you to play 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.290
 tmusee you well
