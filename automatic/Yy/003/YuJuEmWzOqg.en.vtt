00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.660
 your kitchen 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.940
 there are models of the most varied 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 meet different needs as 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.740
 the built-in weight cookers and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.460
 table also known as cooktop 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.560
 domino 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 conventional floor cookers are 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.160
 more practical model because it has the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.109
 ease of installation 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.359
 You can put this appliance 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.250
 in several places in the kitchen looking 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.439
 new settings for the environment 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.840
 thinking only where the cylinder or the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.120
 piped gas output will stay and many 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.280
 models have ten cars which increases the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.649
 space between the floor and the product 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960
 make it easier to clean family size 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.000
 It should also be taken into account for a 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.700
 Small group four burner stove is 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.800
 enough if the house has 5 to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.590
 more people and you need to cook 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.719
 much there the models with five or six 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.789
 mouths are the most indicated 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.190
 besides the advantage of coming with an oven 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.289
 built-in some models already comes with two 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.359
 ovens to prepare different recipes 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.400
 at the same time and still rely on 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.920
 digital panels to control the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.689
 temperature and others have timer 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.909
 built-in stoves have the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.310
 functioning as the floor but are 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.890
 more suitable for planned kitchens 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.590
 where each space has been carefully 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.229
 thought to be best used 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.360
 as the name says it needs to be embedded 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 in a mobile or masonry niche 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.560
 Now I'll talk about the next model. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.200
 gaining more and more supporters 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 the cooktop they were also thought of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.549
 especially for well- 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.220
 more versatile 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.170
 to be installed either in sinks 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.200
 furniture and tables for example 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.180
 and of course all this with style is 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.340
 you already have a stove at home and you need 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.280
 more burners or your kitchen already 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600
 with the oven the cooktop can be ideal 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.610
 but if you 're talking 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.040
 playing his kitchen now and being charmed 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.200
 by cooktop it is good to remember that you can 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.479
 need a stove more forward ok 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.790
 the cooktops are divided into three 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.830
 The most common heating categories are 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.790
 the gas that can be tricked 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.009
 canisters 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.649
 the electric that does not generate fire and offers 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.600
 total temperature accuracy and still 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.790
 by induction that generates heat when 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.010
 happens the contact of the metal pots 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.590
 with cover glass ceramic by 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.630
 electromagnetic currents in this system 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.819
 there is no heat loss for the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.010
 environment because all the energy goes only 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.959
 for food and the best if you 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.019
 touch the burner area 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.420
 You will not leave it to but do not forget 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.910
 that for this type of stove it is necessary 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.030
 magnetic cookware that can be made of steel 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.370
 triple or cast iron 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.980
 a good tip is to place a magnet on the bottom of the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.530
 pot if one sticks this pot 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.440
 now that you know more about 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.810
 the different types of stove is only to do 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.810
