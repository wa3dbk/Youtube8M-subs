because<00:00:07.440> we've<00:00:07.680> just<00:00:07.950> realized<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:08.790> is

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
because we've just realized that this is

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.690 
because we've just realized that this is
something<00:00:09.900> serious<00:00:10.080> line<00:00:10.590> but<00:00:10.950> not<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:11.370> we

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
something serious line but not as we

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.030 
something serious line but not as we
used<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.120> know<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.929> actually<00:00:13.230> has<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> far

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
used to know it this actually has a far

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.010 
used to know it this actually has a far
higher<00:00:14.309> resolution<00:00:15.030> now<00:00:15.599> what<00:00:15.719> we're<00:00:15.839> dealing

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
higher resolution now what we're dealing

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.200 
higher resolution now what we're dealing
with<00:00:16.049> here<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.440> series<00:00:16.949> 9w<00:00:17.609> qhd<00:00:18.180> display

Retina Display MacBook Pro we've seen

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.519 
Retina Display MacBook Pro we've seen
earlier<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:26.970> year<00:00:27.029> aside<00:00:28.019> from<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.199> it's

earlier this year aside from that it's
the<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.099> looks<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.699> same<00:00:29.939> series<00:00:30.720> 9<00:00:30.900> we

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the it looks like the same series 9 we

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.250 
the it looks like the same series 9 we
know<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.679> love<00:00:32.390> full<00:00:33.390> multi-touch<00:00:33.989> track

right<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:34.440> I'll<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.920> we're<00:00:35.070> running

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
right here I'll see we're running

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.520 
right here I'll see we're running
Windows<00:00:35.610> 8<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> tile

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
Windows 8 here here we have the tile

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.750 
Windows 8 here here we have the tile
format<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.300> desktop<00:00:40.760> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
format but if we go to the desktop you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.850 
format but if we go to the desktop you
get<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> familiar<00:00:42.899> display<00:00:43.350> now<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.829> zoom

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
get the familiar display now if we zoom

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.440 
get the familiar display now if we zoom
only<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:44.910> confirm<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
only on here we can just confirm the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.010 
only on here we can just confirm the
resolution<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.050> playing<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.440> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.600 

obviously<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.100> crank<00:00:50.280> down<00:00:50.460> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
obviously you can crank down that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.370 
obviously you can crank down that
resolution<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.150> needed<00:00:51.480> we've<00:00:51.960> asked<00:00:52.290> the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
resolution if needed we've asked the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.960 
resolution if needed we've asked the
Samsung<00:00:53.040> guys<00:00:53.220> here<00:00:53.400> and<00:00:53.550> they're<00:00:53.670> telling<00:00:53.880> us

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
Samsung guys here and they're telling us

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.310 
Samsung guys here and they're telling us
this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.240> actually<00:00:54.540> an<00:00:54.600> engineering<00:00:55.050> sample

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
this is actually an engineering sample

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.960 
this is actually an engineering sample
so<00:00:55.950> they<00:00:56.040> actually<00:00:56.160> haven't<00:00:56.580> named<00:00:56.790> the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
so they actually haven't named the

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.970 
so they actually haven't named the
technology<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> display<00:00:57.990> we're<00:00:58.800> using

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
technology of the display we're using

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.800 
technology of the display we're using
here<00:00:59.310> in<00:00:59.580> fact<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.150> arrived<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.630> week

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
here in fact this just arrived a week

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.540 
here in fact this just arrived a week
ago<00:01:01.110> so<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.800> wasn't<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.220> all<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
ago so there wasn't actually all that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.310 
ago so there wasn't actually all that
much<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:02.940> tell<00:01:03.090> us<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.630> take<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
much they can tell us about here take a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.750 
much they can tell us about here take a
tour<00:01:04.500> along<00:01:04.770> the<00:01:05.010> rest<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
tour along the rest of it you have a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460 
tour along the rest of it you have a
typical<00:01:06.060> chiclet<00:01:06.600> keyboard<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.440> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
typical chiclet keyboard here with a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.490 
typical chiclet keyboard here with a
Windows<00:01:07.890> key<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.870> it's<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.170> around<00:01:10.380> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
Windows key and if it's all around to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.160 
Windows key and if it's all around to

the right here yoga DisplayPort
headphone<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.400> USB<00:01:14.540> 3<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.890> close<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
headphone and USB 3 you just close it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.980 
headphone and USB 3 you just close it
down<00:01:17.160> you<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.580> an<00:01:17.790> idea<00:01:18.060> about<00:01:18.119> how<00:01:18.479> thin<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
down you get an idea about how thin it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.200 
down you get an idea about how thin it
still<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.619> mean<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.340> slate<00:01:20.670> panel<00:01:21.000> is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
still is I mean that slate panel is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.719 
still is I mean that slate panel is
fairly<00:01:21.600> anything<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.590> I'll<00:01:22.890> tall<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
fairly anything and I'll tall all the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.050 
fairly anything and I'll tall all the
way<00:01:23.790> around<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:25.140> left<00:01:25.170> edge<00:01:26.060> we're

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
way around to the left edge we're

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.440 
way around to the left edge we're
finished<00:01:27.270> off<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.660> micro<00:01:28.200> HDMI<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
finished off with a micro HDMI and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.710 
finished off with a micro HDMI and
network<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.720> yet<00:01:30.869> another<00:01:31.050> USB<00:01:31.590> port<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.720> take

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
network and yet another USB port to take

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.590 
network and yet another USB port to take
another<00:01:33.899> open<00:01:34.740> again<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.940> this<00:01:36.090> would<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
another open again so this would be a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.040 
another open again so this would be a
new<00:01:36.869> series<00:01:37.259> 9<00:01:37.530> ultrabook<00:01:38.369> from<00:01:38.610> Samsung<00:01:39.119> we

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
new series 9 ultrabook from Samsung we

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.420 
new series 9 ultrabook from Samsung we
haven't<00:01:40.290> heard<00:01:40.440> anything<00:01:40.890> about<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> be

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
haven't heard anything about it to be

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.620 
haven't heard anything about it to be
honest<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.850> all<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:41.970> bit<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> surprise

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
honest so it's all a bit of a surprise

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.570 
honest so it's all a bit of a surprise
to<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.200> here

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
to see it here

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.700 
to see it here
another<00:01:45.570> thing<00:01:45.720> worth<00:01:45.840> noting<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.320> fact<00:01:46.560> this

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
another thing worth noting in fact this

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.470
