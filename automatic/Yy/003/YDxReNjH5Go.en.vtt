will vary because it depends on whether

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.150 
will vary because it depends on whether
you<00:04:05.310> have<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:06.030> 120<00:04:06.959> millimeter<00:04:07.350> fan<00:04:07.680> installed

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160

you have a 120 millimeter fan installed
on<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.760> bottom<00:04:09.090> but<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.360> maximum<00:04:09.570> power

on the bottom but the maximum power
supply<00:04:10.350> length<00:04:10.590> would<00:04:10.799> be<00:04:11.120> 300<00:04:12.120> millimeters

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630

remember<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.780> they<00:04:24.960> only

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
remember that they only

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.110

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
budget cases do have a lot to live up to

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.460 
budget cases do have a lot to live up to
because<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.450> folks<00:05:03.660> who<00:05:03.780> are<00:05:03.870> buying<00:05:04.140> the

wanted case that looks good has a long
feature<00:05:07.080> list<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:08.330> affordable<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.420> think

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
feature list and is affordable I think

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.020 
feature list and is affordable I think
this<00:05:09.780> case<00:05:10.020> delivers<00:05:10.590> on<00:05:10.740> all<00:05:11.370> counts<00:05:11.910> but

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
this case delivers on all counts but

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.100 
this case delivers on all counts but
keep<00:05:12.270> in<00:05:12.450> mind<00:05:12.480> that<00:05:12.960> they<00:05:13.080> only<00:05:13.560> include<00:05:13.950> one

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
keep in mind that they only include one

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.990 
keep in mind that they only include one
120-millimeter<00:05:16.110> fan<00:05:16.830> so<00:05:17.430> you'll<00:05:17.640> have<00:05:17.820> to

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
120-millimeter fan so you'll have to

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.030 
120-millimeter fan so you'll have to
budget<00:05:18.420> for<00:05:18.450> more<00:05:19.110> fans<00:05:19.680> when<00:05:19.920> you're

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
budget for more fans when you're

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.600 
budget for more fans when you're
purchasing<00:05:20.490> this<00:05:21.060> case<00:05:21.480> but<00:05:21.900> overall<00:05:22.560> this<00:05:23.310> is

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
purchasing this case but overall this is

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.360 
purchasing this case but overall this is
a<00:05:23.700> great<00:05:24.450> product<00:05:24.780> until<00:05:25.560> next<00:05:25.710> time<00:05:25.980> take
