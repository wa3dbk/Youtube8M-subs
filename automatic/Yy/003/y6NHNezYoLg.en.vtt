scientifically<00:04:06.959> tested<00:04:07.229> and<00:04:07.909> formulated<00:04:08.909> and

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
scientifically tested and formulated and

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.529 
scientifically tested and formulated and
the<00:04:10.199> first<00:04:10.409> thing<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.859> did<00:04:10.949> was<00:04:11.329> to<00:04:12.329> look

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:12.539 
the first thing that I did was to look

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:14.659 
the first thing that I did was to look
at<00:04:12.689> what<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.019> results<00:04:13.439> were<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.949> we<00:04:14.459> found

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
at what the results were and we found

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.149 
at what the results were and we found
that<00:04:15.449> there<00:04:16.109> were<00:04:16.259> pretty<00:04:16.469> good<00:04:16.620> results<00:04:16.799> this

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
that there were pretty good results this

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.180 
that there were pretty good results this
is<00:04:17.219> a<00:04:17.370> field<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:17.880> have<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.120> understand<00:04:18.570> where

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
is a field you have to understand where

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.560 
is a field you have to understand where
efficacy<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.459> something<00:04:21.209> that's<00:04:21.299> difficult

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
efficacy is something that's difficult

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.360 
efficacy is something that's difficult
to<00:04:21.900> come<00:04:22.079> by<00:04:22.109> it's<00:04:22.620> very<00:04:22.830> difficult<00:04:23.039> for

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
to come by it's very difficult for

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.070 
to come by it's very difficult for
people<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.849> make<00:04:24.090> dietary<00:04:24.330> change

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
people to make dietary change

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.409 
people to make dietary change
and<00:04:25.229> sustain<00:04:25.620> them<00:04:25.860> so<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.789> even<00:04:27.030> if<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.240> get

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
and sustain them so that even if you get

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.379 
and sustain them so that even if you get
a<00:04:28.129> modest<00:04:29.129> proportion<00:04:29.639> of<00:04:29.729> people<00:04:29.879> to<00:04:30.210> make

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
a modest proportion of people to make

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.089 
a modest proportion of people to make
those<00:04:30.659> changes<00:04:30.870> permanently<00:04:31.590> you're<00:04:31.800> doing

those changes permanently you're doing

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.510 
those changes permanently you're doing
well<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:33.180> indeed<00:04:33.990> when<00:04:34.379> we<00:04:34.530> looked<00:04:35.009> at<00:04:35.280> the

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
well and indeed when we looked at the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.950 
well and indeed when we looked at the
clinics<00:04:35.960> they<00:04:36.960> were<00:04:37.189> getting<00:04:38.189> good<00:04:38.520> results

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
clinics they were getting good results

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.869 
clinics they were getting good results
this<00:04:39.960> requires<00:04:40.409> a<00:04:40.530> motivated<00:04:41.219> patients<00:04:41.699> and

of using very low calorie diets there

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.180 
of using very low calorie diets there
were<00:05:12.360> some<00:05:12.569> problems<00:05:12.750> because<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.740> source<00:05:14.009> of

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
were some problems because the source of

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.909 
were some problems because the source of
protein<00:05:14.250> that<00:05:14.849> was<00:05:15.060> used<00:05:15.300> was<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:16.199> poor<00:05:16.529> quality

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
protein that was used was a poor quality

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.339 
protein that was used was a poor quality
it<00:05:17.069> wasn't<00:05:17.370> nutritionally<00:05:17.969> complete<00:05:18.349> and

it wasn't nutritionally complete and

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.140 
it wasn't nutritionally complete and
there<00:05:19.500> were<00:05:19.560> either<00:05:19.740> even<00:05:20.250> some<00:05:20.520> some<00:05:20.909> deaths

there were either even some some deaths

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.969 
there were either even some some deaths
very<00:05:21.419> early<00:05:21.810> on<00:05:21.840> in<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.199> United<00:05:22.529> States<00:05:22.590> this

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
very early on in the United States this

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.510 
very early on in the United States this
is<00:05:23.129> now<00:05:23.310> 20<00:05:23.909> or<00:05:24.029> 30<00:05:24.210> years<00:05:24.330> ago<00:05:25.069> so<00:05:26.069> it<00:05:26.460> is

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
is now 20 or 30 years ago so it is

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.399 
is now 20 or 30 years ago so it is
important<00:05:27.060> what<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.330> source<00:05:27.569> of<00:05:27.750> protein<00:05:27.810> is

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
important what the source of protein is

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.519 
important what the source of protein is
because<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:29.370> lot<00:05:29.879> of<00:05:29.909> dieting<00:05:30.479> is<00:05:30.750> now<00:05:31.139> on<00:05:31.469> a

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
because a lot of dieting is now on a

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.850 
because a lot of dieting is now on a
high<00:05:31.860> protein<00:05:32.099> diet<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.810> low<00:05:34.110> carbohydrate

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
high protein diet and low carbohydrate

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.240 
high protein diet and low carbohydrate
levels<00:05:35.840> so<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:36.960> sources<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:37.710> protein<00:05:38.069> is

levels so the sources of protein is

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.189 
levels so the sources of protein is
important<00:05:38.759> that<00:05:39.029> a<00:05:39.060> fee<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.300> high<00:05:39.509> quality<00:05:39.569> and

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
important that a fee of high quality and

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.079 
important that a fee of high quality and
nutritionally<00:05:40.800> complete<00:05:40.909> what's<00:05:41.909> also

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.089 
nutritionally complete what's also

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.570 
nutritionally complete what's also

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
important is that if you're going to

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.730 
important is that if you're going to
replace<00:05:44.909> meals<00:05:45.629> then<00:05:46.199> you<00:05:46.319> need<00:05:46.440> to<00:05:46.560> make<00:05:46.680> sure

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
that you're replacing not just calories

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.950 
that you're replacing not just calories
but<00:05:50.009> the<00:05:50.370> micronutrients<00:05:51.240> vitamins<00:05:51.300> and
