500<00:01:02.280> scales<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:03.059> wanted<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
500 scales but I really wanted this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
second one of my favorite looks of this
aircraft<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.729> black<00:01:23.909> nose<00:01:24.180> area

and<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.869> radome<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> gives<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
and the radome I think it gives the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.480 
and the radome I think it gives the
especially<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> 77<00:01:28.590> give<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.340> good

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
especially the 77 give it a really good

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:41.620 
especially the 77 give it a really good
look<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.880> nice<00:01:32.880> engine<00:01:33.210> details<00:01:33.600> there
