00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
start on the 450 so I'm excited to learn

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.030 
start on the 450 so I'm excited to learn
everything<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.420> 450<00:02:13.930> now<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.830> much

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
everything on the 450 now it's so much

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.740 
everything on the 450 now it's so much
better<00:02:15.220> than<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.700> TF<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.360> think<00:02:16.570> it's

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
better than a to TF and I think it's

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.970 
better than a to TF and I think it's
going<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.930> make<00:02:17.080> everything<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.800> much<00:02:17.860> better

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980
