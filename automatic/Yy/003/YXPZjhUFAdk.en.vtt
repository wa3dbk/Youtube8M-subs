00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.740
 Hello everyone today we are each backpack from 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.259
 equipment companies are samurai 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.859
 see what valve she has 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.630
 hieroglyph 100 liter backpack 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.850
 Naturally follows the name well I want to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.210
 a couple of moments become such here 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.680
 most important for general for a backpack 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.570
 For me at least 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.309
 and say a few words about this backpack already 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.010
 several seasons blown away 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.290
 worn not by me and my friend but I him 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.090
 vilified several days to take off more 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.750
 objectively and video well and in general now 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.780
 I'll tell you everything 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.940
 look let's start with the valve valve 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.520
 hefty up to 100 liters of backpack can 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.840
 it was a little bit smaller now 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.690
 we learn as much as possible 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.289
 there is an adjustment here there is an adjustment 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.210
 here is what's the minus is that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.800
 when i'm backpack is not full of valve 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.160
 it's impossible to use it too 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.260
 too big and either need there 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.360
 many many things to fill either need 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.740
 use it only when the backpack 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.670
 crammed 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.250
 other points use it 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.490
 impossible that he is very great all 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.549
 there in it hangs at the valve standard 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.420
 attached yes there is a pocket inside and 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.580
 outside such pocket well valve 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.700
 hefty so good but he he good 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.320
 protects the neck from the rain go further 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.880
 backpack itself 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.789
 immediately visible bottom entrance 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.549
 here it just here that's on the fast 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.369
 X you see that this is an external pocket yes 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.860
 there is an external pocket here at 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.420
 this whole volume from this is extra 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.399
 entrance backpack here it is so much controversy 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.319
 Of course, if this is my function 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.069
 look absolutely not necessary never life 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.600
 nobody used it all these 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.640
 fast x 1 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.549
 it would be all too much easier 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.679
 weight weight is high 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.830
 rather big well more treshki exact in 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.140
 I will write in the description how much and very much 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.250
 any such moments in him well superfluous 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.140
 I do not even know my conditions 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.110
 general custom shell there tonic such 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.910
 the backpack is ok here really 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.400
 a lot of excess here you can directly cut off 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:30.450
 no need how to cut off this input i 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.760
 honestly I donâ€™t only know him 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.269
 there are pockets here such here they are 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.170
 such a size before such teams 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.540
 This type of something can be put 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.390
 useful in principle functions but it is also 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.549
 zipper material as you can see here 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.250
 material additional it all affects 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.410
 on weight is very convenient some operational 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.569
 little things put therefore these pockets and in 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.200
 principle endorsing but somehow 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.859
 us the situation took oil or 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.170
 Chainsaws nowhere found 10 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.440
 kilometers to the village lust turned 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.609
 that she was in that pocket and my friend 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.250
 although on the backpack a little bit and 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.250
 enjoyed at that time he bought it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.670
 forgot even about this feature about what 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.710
 there are side pockets 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.070
 rummaged there rummaged said no here 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.230
 really so invisible pockets here 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.780
 the color of the backpack made zipper hidden 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.550
 so that the water does not flow it in principle 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.260
 ok go ahead 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.760
 internal internal parts double 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.860
 naturally double games on 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:49.310
 the neck is not a classic core 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:54.650
 the blocks here are such tricks as they are 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:59.370
 how they work this here we pull up 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.800
 to lower down larger increased that 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.530
 pull down, she does not give up sliding down it 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.400
 you need to keep yourself like this and you can 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.880
 calmly operate until down does not give but 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.940
 I think the meaning is understood so there is inside 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.580
 Aluminum Vlad and here to them access with 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.580
 mummy please can i get it 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.130
 here there is here they go just from the inside 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.210
 backpack is not covered so 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.750
 some option thrust saws on 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.360
 Arched I did not think so well, well 30 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.360
 classic but maybe worth mentioning here 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.980
 this thing and the screed inside can be something 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.890
 fix so here is absolutely what 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.720
 interesting no lower entrance is there 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.940
 a septum which can never be 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.950
 use can be safely cut inside 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.890
 I will bring in two volumes separating 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.560
 the backpack here is naturally all strengthened 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:04.240
 fast iksami there is a mount for something 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.280
 long here it is 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.300
 here how many things are these things they 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.210
 already included 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.890
 something to fasten here such stickies 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.900
 for slings fasten the ends of the lines are the same 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.910
 also wider than the factory I am by the way on my backpack 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.700
 also found such when I saw this 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:28.150
 Here is a pretty nice such function. 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:31.860
 look I think someone's husband 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:36.990
 enjoy also make here roll off and 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:39.970
 we fix in such a way everything is fine 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.590
 here that they will give me so much that there is 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.280
 such are the places to us already to bear the ax 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.580
 and the ax on the side of it is a big plus 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.990
 go to the suspension briefly all 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.700
 classic adjustable there is a pen 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.960
 pen only from this side from that country 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.360
 there is no backpack 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.990
 unfortunately this is of course minus all 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.750
 adjustable to very comfortable suspension 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.940
 brand shoulders perfectly unloads this belt 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.350
 I really liked 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.200
 the train is not swinging on look like it 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:15.960
 made here is such an external 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:19.200
 part and the internal unbuttoned 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:24.190
 internal as it can be removed here it is 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:26.980
 leave only here right here this 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.830
 external that is to facilitate very much 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.860
 somehow weight and walk in such it is so so 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.650
 Well, the idea is pretty cool. 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.220
 Naturally stabilizers here everything is possible 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.229
 pull tight adjust 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:47.260
 Fastex Belt on not 50 millimeters 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:50.600
 she is 38 slightly less than the standard 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:55.190
 well address comfortable backpack to wear in 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.230
 convenient principle well for my own 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:03.410
 sizes for steel three landed trawl 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:06.800
 the weight is too big a lot from everyones 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:09.080
 Fasteksov yes this need somehow 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.390
 keeps thani there is lightning here 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.580
 these all have a lot of fabric had 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.220
 sew well and so backpack pretty 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.900
 cool can in principle 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.200
 look at the store if you are not 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:27.950
 scared weight if you say so tourist 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.790
 the weight of the backpack lived for you but really 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.090
 take everything 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.980
 external pocket clean little system there 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:38.960
 suspension in a different way to do in my opinion 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:42.160
 and he will lose a lot and be more 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:47.060
 so relevant for modest small 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.130
 hikes for a week okay conclusions like you 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:53.840
 make yourself worth a backpack somewhere 5,000 

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:55.270
 rubles worth taking or not I would take 

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.670
 of course a little different model 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.470
