00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
it's probably best I don't but it really

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.020 
it's probably best I don't but it really
adds<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.979> detractors<00:01:36.280> on<00:01:36.670> this<00:01:36.850> is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
a half of the grillers I guess four

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.350

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.350 
little bit stout if this was it like 349
I<00:01:53.380> would<00:01:54.130> have<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.490> better<00:01:54.670> feeling<00:01:55.030> about<00:01:55.180> it
