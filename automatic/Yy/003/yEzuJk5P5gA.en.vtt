00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
in command and conquer three were

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.560

definitely<00:01:13.700> taking<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.060> slightly<00:01:14.300> more

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
definitely taking a slightly more

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.810 
definitely taking a slightly more
nuanced<00:01:14.990> view<00:01:15.170> than<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.890> found<00:01:16.070> with<00:01:16.369> not<00:01:16.610> in

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
nuanced view than you found with not in

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.539 
nuanced view than you found with not in
the<00:01:16.909> first<00:01:17.149> two<00:01:17.330> games<00:01:17.540> this<00:01:18.500> is<00:01:18.680> after<00:01:19.009> all<00:01:19.040> a

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
the first two games this is after all a

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.700 
the first two games this is after all a
superpower<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:20.750> can<00:01:20.899> go<00:01:21.050> toe-to-toe<00:01:21.320> with

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
superpower that can go toe-to-toe with

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.410 
superpower that can go toe-to-toe with
the<00:01:22.130> GDI<00:01:22.550> they<00:01:22.940> have<00:01:23.119> millions<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:24.250> members

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
the GDI they have millions of members

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.779 
the GDI they have millions of members
and<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.320> we've<00:01:27.890> got<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.130> be<00:01:28.220> something<00:01:28.490> that's

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
and so we've got to be something that's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.430 
and so we've got to be something that's
appealing<00:01:29.179> about<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.600> Brotherhood<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.140> nod

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
appealing about the Brotherhood of nod

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.320 
appealing about the Brotherhood of nod
to<00:01:30.860> these<00:01:31.130> people<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.759> yellow<00:01:32.060> zones

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
to these people and the yellow zones

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.760 
to these people and the yellow zones
that<00:01:32.570> are<00:01:32.630> being<00:01:32.929> recruited<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.649> the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
that are being recruited it to the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.240 
that are being recruited it to the
organization<00:01:34.899> so<00:01:35.899> GDI<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.350> really<00:01:37.009> an

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
organization so GDI is really an

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.910 
organization so GDI is really an
extrapolation<00:01:38.000> of<00:01:38.259> first<00:01:39.259> world<00:01:39.500> countries

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
extrapolation of first world countries

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.590 
extrapolation of first world countries
even<00:01:40.100> as<00:01:40.310> we<00:01:40.460> know<00:01:40.640> them<00:01:40.789> now<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.420> their

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
even as we know them now so their

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.630 
even as we know them now so their
motivations<00:01:42.319> are<00:01:42.500> really<00:01:42.710> understandable<00:01:43.340> I

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
motivations are really understandable I

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.130 
motivations are really understandable I
think<00:01:44.060> they<00:01:44.149> view<00:01:44.360> themselves<00:01:44.509> as<00:01:44.840> kind<00:01:45.080> of

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
think they view themselves as kind of

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.200 
think they view themselves as kind of
the<00:01:45.259> white<00:01:45.470> knights<00:01:45.770> of<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.100> world<00:01:46.429> in<00:01:46.700> 20<00:01:46.940> 47

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
the white knights of the world in 20 47

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.180 
the white knights of the world in 20 47
they're<00:01:47.990> trying<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.319> reverse<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.860> biggest

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
they're trying to reverse the biggest

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.010 
they're trying to reverse the biggest
environmental<00:01:49.399> Cataclysm<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.420> history<00:01:50.780> with

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
environmental Cataclysm and history with

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.260 
environmental Cataclysm and history with
Iberian<00:01:51.679> slowly<00:01:52.009> consuming<00:01:52.459> the<00:01:52.640> earth<00:01:52.849> they

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
Iberian slowly consuming the earth they

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.389 
Iberian slowly consuming the earth they
view<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:53.509> as<00:01:53.750> an<00:01:53.869> evil<00:01:54.289> thing<00:01:54.770> something<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.280> be

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
view it as an evil thing something to be

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.490 
view it as an evil thing something to be
gotten<00:01:55.759> rid<00:01:55.789> of<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.929> they<00:01:57.020> really<00:01:57.259> can't

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
gotten rid of and they really can't

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.350 
gotten rid of and they really can't
understand<00:01:57.950> why<00:01:58.099> the<00:01:58.160> Brotherhood<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.670> Nod<00:01:58.970> is

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
understand why the Brotherhood of Nod is

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.770 
understand why the Brotherhood of Nod is
trying<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.810> accelerate<00:02:00.259> this<00:02:00.950> environmental

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
trying to accelerate this environmental

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.869 
trying to accelerate this environmental
catastrophe<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.160> they<00:02:04.160> really<00:02:04.340> viewed<00:02:04.700> them

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:04.879 
catastrophe so they really viewed them

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:07.859 
catastrophe so they really viewed them
as<00:02:05.060> virulent<00:02:05.840> nasty<00:02:06.440> sort<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.920> inexplicably

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
as virulent nasty sort of inexplicably

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.479 
as virulent nasty sort of inexplicably
self-sustaining<00:02:08.869> terrorist<00:02:09.709> organization

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
self-sustaining terrorist organization

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.570 
self-sustaining terrorist organization
and<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.959> nod<00:02:12.170> looks<00:02:12.709> at<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.980> world<00:02:13.010> somewhat

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
and the nod looks at the world somewhat

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.000 
and the nod looks at the world somewhat
differently<00:02:13.940> they<00:02:14.300> see<00:02:14.360> themselves<00:02:14.660> as<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
differently they see themselves as the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
orders broken down they're really pretty

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.729

messy<00:02:27.500> places<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:29.209> not<00:02:29.810> as<00:02:29.959> recruiting<00:02:30.410> out<00:02:30.590> of

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
messy places so not as recruiting out of

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.520 
messy places so not as recruiting out of
those<00:02:31.120> population<00:02:32.120> centers<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.260> people

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
those population centers and the people

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.589 
those population centers and the people
there<00:02:33.709> don't<00:02:34.129> see<00:02:34.340> GDI<00:02:34.670> quite<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.239> same<00:02:35.420> way

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
there don't see GDI quite the same way

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.720 
there don't see GDI quite the same way
GDI<00:02:35.930> sees<00:02:36.260> themselves<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:37.310> them<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.700> looks

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
GDI sees themselves to them it looks

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.360 
GDI sees themselves to them it looks
like<00:02:38.090> GDI<00:02:38.480> sits<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.530> blue<00:02:39.800> zones<00:02:40.099> these

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
like GDI sits in the blue zones these

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.110 
like GDI sits in the blue zones these
pristine<00:02:40.910> areas<00:02:41.769> pretty<00:02:42.769> much<00:02:43.010> using<00:02:43.640> all<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
pristine areas pretty much using all the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.580 
pristine areas pretty much using all the
world's<00:02:44.390> resources<00:02:44.569> all<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.319> world's

world's resources all of the world's

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.100 
world's resources all of the world's
wealth<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.069> concentrated<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.910> these<00:02:47.060> areas<00:02:47.300> so

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
wealth is concentrated in these areas so

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.130 
wealth is concentrated in these areas so
it<00:02:48.890> looks<00:02:48.920> kind<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.519> like<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:50.660> GDI<00:02:51.019> is

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
it looks kind of like that GDI is

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.809 
it looks kind of like that GDI is
keeping<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> good<00:02:52.190> stuff<00:02:52.459> for<00:02:52.670> themselves

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
keeping the good stuff for themselves

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.670 
keeping the good stuff for themselves
and<00:02:53.690> he

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
and he

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.860 
and he
eighty<00:02:55.609> percent<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.150> population<00:02:56.299> that

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
eighty percent of the population that

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.410 
eighty percent of the population that
lives<00:02:56.930> in<00:02:57.260> these<00:02:57.409> war-torn<00:02:57.829> areas<00:02:58.579> down<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
lives in these war-torn areas down and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.800 
lives in these war-torn areas down and
so<00:03:00.200> not<00:03:01.159> is<00:03:01.519> definitely<00:03:02.359> representing

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
so not is definitely representing

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.569 
so not is definitely representing
themselves<00:03:02.959> as<00:03:03.409> the<00:03:03.560> strength<00:03:03.859> to<00:03:04.219> counter

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
themselves as the strength to counter

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.509 
themselves as the strength to counter
GDI<00:03:04.909> strength<00:03:05.659> the<00:03:06.650> guardians<00:03:07.129> of<00:03:07.340> the

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
GDI strength the guardians of the

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.140 
GDI strength the guardians of the
oppressed<00:03:07.939> the<00:03:08.810> hope<00:03:09.049> for<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.379> future<00:03:09.650> and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
oppressed the hope for the future and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.679 
oppressed the hope for the future and
away<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.569> imbalance<00:03:12.049> of<00:03:12.439> wealth<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:13.159> power

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
away this imbalance of wealth and power

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:22.030 
away this imbalance of wealth and power
is<00:03:14.689> going<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.049> be<00:03:15.230> redressed

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.920 

so<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.160> non<00:03:23.310> fashion<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.760> actually<00:03:24.210> first<00:03:24.780> of

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
so the non fashion is actually first of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.510 
so the non fashion is actually first of
all<00:03:24.990> it's<00:03:25.320> it's<00:03:25.590> kind<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.830> interesting<00:03:26.130> in<00:03:26.430> the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
all it's it's kind of interesting in the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.750 
all it's it's kind of interesting in the
way<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.630> side<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.020> composed<00:03:28.410> because<00:03:29.160> nod

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
way the the side is composed because nod

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.490 
way the the side is composed because nod
is<00:03:30.000> recruiting<00:03:30.600> large<00:03:30.900> numbers<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.290> people

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
is recruiting large numbers of people

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.160 
is recruiting large numbers of people
out<00:03:31.800> of<00:03:31.890> these<00:03:32.040> yellow<00:03:32.550> zones<00:03:32.880> they<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:33.630> sort

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
out of these yellow zones they have sort

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.650 
out of these yellow zones they have sort
of<00:03:34.230> this<00:03:34.350> mix<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.800> low<00:03:35.010> tech<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.460> high<00:03:35.490> tech<00:03:35.880> so

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
of this mix of low tech and high tech so

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.650 
of this mix of low tech and high tech so
if<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.810> think<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.470> Northern<00:03:38.100> Alliance

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
if you think of the Northern Alliance

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.060 
if you think of the Northern Alliance
operating<00:03:39.660> with<00:03:39.870> art<00:03:40.080> with<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.410> US<00:03:40.680> Special

Forces and and the CIA in Afghanistan

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.350 
Forces and and the CIA in Afghanistan
you<00:03:44.400> had<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:44.640> really<00:03:44.940> interesting

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
you had this really interesting

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.900 
you had this really interesting
combination<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.500> low<00:03:47.040> tech<00:03:47.280> forces<00:03:47.730> on<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
combination of low tech forces on the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.810 
combination of low tech forces on the
ground<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:49.200> then<00:03:49.350> some<00:03:49.530> very<00:03:50.040> high<00:03:50.430> tech

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
ground and then some very high tech

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.650 
ground and then some very high tech
stuff<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.510> some<00:03:51.780> very<00:03:52.140> highly<00:03:52.770> trained<00:03:53.660> elite

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
stuff and some very highly trained elite

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.160 
stuff and some very highly trained elite
units<00:03:55.200> helping<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.010> coordinate<00:03:56.520> so<00:03:57.090> not<00:03:57.450> in<00:03:57.750> 20

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
units helping to coordinate so not in 20

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.110 
units helping to coordinate so not in 20
47<00:03:58.440> has<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.920> little<00:03:59.220> bit<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.430> flavor<00:03:59.760> so

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
47 has a little bit of that flavor so

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.780 
47 has a little bit of that flavor so
you<00:04:00.210> have<00:04:00.510> these<00:04:00.990> Ward's<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.830> militants<00:04:02.670> and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
you have these Ward's of militants and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.390 
you have these Ward's of militants and
fanatics<00:04:03.390> which<00:04:03.690> are<00:04:03.990> not<00:04:04.530> as<00:04:04.770> well<00:04:04.950> trained

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
fanatics which are not as well trained

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.790 
fanatics which are not as well trained
but<00:04:06.360> definitely<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.840> kind<00:04:07.080> of<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.230> cannon<00:04:07.470> fodder

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
but definitely a kind of a cannon fodder

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.460 
but definitely a kind of a cannon fodder
of<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.730> nod<00:04:08.910> factor<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.630> then<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.170> have<00:04:10.350> the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
of the nod factor and then you have the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.770 
of the nod factor and then you have the
super<00:04:10.920> elite<00:04:11.250> hardcore<00:04:11.910> troops<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.570> are<00:04:12.600> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
super elite hardcore troops that are the

with 73 which is user interfaces to make
something<00:05:11.240> that<00:05:11.479> was<00:05:11.570> accessible<00:05:11.930> but<00:05:12.770> also

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
something that was accessible but also

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.250 
something that was accessible but also
was<00:05:13.460> flexible<00:05:14.150> enough<00:05:14.450> and<00:05:14.660> sophisticated

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
was flexible enough and sophisticated

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.560 
was flexible enough and sophisticated
enough<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:15.800> that<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:15.950> hardcore<00:05:16.430> gamer<00:05:16.460> could<00:05:17.419> do

minimum number of clicks really fast
really<00:05:21.710> flexible<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.580> so<00:05:22.910> what<00:05:23.060> we've<00:05:23.180> done

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
really flexible and so what we've done

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.590 
really flexible and so what we've done
is<00:05:23.540> taken<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.770> old<00:05:25.060> sidebar<00:05:26.060> interface

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
is taken the the old sidebar interface

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.020 
is taken the the old sidebar interface
that<00:05:26.870> was<00:05:27.080> classic<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.710> CNC<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.340> updated<00:05:28.880> it

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
that was classic to CNC and updated it

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.810 
that was classic to CNC and updated it
in<00:05:29.720> a<00:05:29.870> way<00:05:30.080> that<00:05:30.110> you<00:05:31.010> can<00:05:31.130> control<00:05:31.460> all<00:05:31.789> of

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
your production cues anywhere on the

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.190 
your production cues anywhere on the
battlefield<00:05:34.430> but<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:35.360> can<00:05:35.510> also<00:05:35.630> click<00:05:35.960> on

battlefield but you can also click on
any<00:05:36.380> unit<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.400> essentially<00:05:37.820> get<00:05:37.970> all<00:05:38.090> the

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
any unit and essentially get all the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.939 
any unit and essentially get all the

options and information associated with
that<00:05:40.070> unit<00:05:40.280> so<00:05:40.639> we're<00:05:40.760> really<00:05:40.940> bringing<00:05:41.419> the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
that unit so we're really bringing the

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.590 
that unit so we're really bringing the
best<00:05:41.810> of<00:05:42.020> both<00:05:42.229> worlds<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.949> CNC<00:05:43.729> it's<00:05:44.180> a<00:05:44.389> very

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
best of both worlds the CNC it's a very

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.719 
best of both worlds the CNC it's a very
familiar<00:05:45.110> way<00:05:45.289> to<00:05:45.350> play<00:05:45.650> for<00:05:46.130> anybody<00:05:46.490> who

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
familiar way to play for anybody who

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:54.810 
familiar way to play for anybody who

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.270 

so<00:05:55.690> look<00:05:55.960> for<00:05:56.230> a<00:05:56.260> command<00:05:56.710> and<00:05:56.830> conquer<00:05:57.070> 3

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
so look for a command and conquer 3

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.590 
so look for a command and conquer 3
tiberium<00:05:57.430> wars<00:05:57.820> in<00:05:58.590> 2007
