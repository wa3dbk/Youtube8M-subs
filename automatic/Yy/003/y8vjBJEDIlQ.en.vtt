00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.740 
artwork on each one of them you got blue
on<00:04:48.030> all<00:04:48.930> three<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.440> them<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:50.270> it's<00:04:51.270> basically

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
on all three of them and it's basically

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.250 
on all three of them and it's basically
on<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.560> two<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:53.190> them<00:04:53.400> it's<00:04:53.850> snow<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:55.080> looks

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
on the two of them it's snow it looks

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.070 
on the two of them it's snow it looks
like<00:04:55.440> during<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.800> snow<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:59.060> then<00:05:00.060> disc<00:05:00.690> three

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
like during the snow and then disc three

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.980 
like during the snow and then disc three
it<00:05:01.260> looks<00:05:01.290> like<00:05:01.770> he's<00:05:01.980> in<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.550> flying<00:05:03.710> section

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
it looks like he's in the flying section

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.120 
it looks like he's in the flying section
so<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.200> get<00:05:07.350> one<00:05:07.530> two<00:05:07.740> three<00:05:08.160> and<00:05:09.560> no<00:05:10.560> artwork

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
so you get one two three and no artwork

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.960 
so you get one two three and no artwork
in<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:12.450> case<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:13.370> doesn't<00:05:14.370> matter

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
in the case so doesn't matter

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.560 
in the case so doesn't matter
there's<00:05:15.420> no<00:05:15.720> timing<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:17.580> think<00:05:18.030> it's<00:05:18.390> not<00:05:18.540> a

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
there's no timing I think it's not a

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.159 
there's no timing I think it's not a
