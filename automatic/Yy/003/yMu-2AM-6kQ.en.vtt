the Cougars put him on the field he's

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.150 
the Cougars put him on the field he's
probably<00:00:33.719> about<00:00:33.930> 10<00:00:34.200> pounds<00:00:34.410> lighter<00:00:34.620> than<00:00:34.950> he

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
probably about 10 pounds lighter than he

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.119 
probably about 10 pounds lighter than he
was<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.670> year<00:00:35.880> ago<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.649> know<00:00:37.680> he's<00:00:37.920> been

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
was a year ago so I you know he's been

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.190 
was a year ago so I you know he's been
