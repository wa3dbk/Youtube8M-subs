00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
okay how you can tell if a mangosteen is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.539 
okay how you can tell if a mangosteen is
ripe<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.659> soft

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
ripe is you want it to be soft

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.819 
ripe is you want it to be soft
we're<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.329> incredibly<00:01:25.079> soft<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.740> like

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
we're not incredibly soft but just like

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.160 
we're not incredibly soft but just like
yields<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> little<00:01:26.610> bit<00:01:26.789> when<00:01:27.450> these<00:01:27.659> are<00:01:27.810> under

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
yields a little bit when these are under

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
yields a little bit when these are under
ripe<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.710> are<00:01:28.920> rock<00:01:29.460> hard<00:01:29.789> and<00:01:30.090> when<00:01:30.390> they're

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
ripe they are rock hard and when they're

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.440 
ripe they are rock hard and when they're
overripe<00:01:31.049> they're<00:01:31.649> rock<00:01:31.979> hard<00:01:32.450> sometimes

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
overripe they're rock hard sometimes

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.029 
overripe they're rock hard sometimes
when<00:01:33.719> they're<00:01:33.930> hard<00:01:34.289> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.649> open<00:01:34.890> them<00:01:34.979> up

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
when they're hard you can open them up

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.959 
when they're hard you can open them up
they'll<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.369> okay

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
they'll be okay

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.230 
they'll be okay

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
that I noticed in the u.s. is that

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.179 
that I noticed in the u.s. is that
whenever<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.049> go<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.259> fruit<00:01:43.619> stand<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.009> has

mangosteen is very hard to describe as a

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.500 
mangosteen is very hard to describe as a
fruit<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.110> very<00:03:01.320> unique<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:02.760> can't<00:03:03.360> really

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
fruit it's very unique I can't really

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.840 
fruit it's very unique I can't really
compare<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:05.310> another<00:03:05.600> kind<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.750> fruit<00:03:07.140> so

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
very good they're very mild tasting but

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.440 
very good they're very mild tasting but
they<00:03:16.620> have<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> little<00:03:17.160> like<00:03:17.730> sourness<00:03:18.420> to

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
say they taste like grapes I think

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.880 
say they taste like grapes I think
they're<00:03:23.660> trying<00:03:24.660> too<00:03:25.020> hard<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.530> don't<00:03:25.560> think

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
they're trying too hard I don't think

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.410

they really taste like grapes that much
I<00:03:27.660> can<00:03:27.870> say<00:03:27.990> they're<00:03:28.170> mild<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> way<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.310> a

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
I can say they're mild in the way that a

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.940 
I can say they're mild in the way that a
grape<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.090> guess<00:03:30.300> but<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.050> flavor<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.500> um

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
grape is I guess but the flavor is um

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.500 
grape is I guess but the flavor is um

give a little bit more information these

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.460 
give a little bit more information these
are<00:04:18.209> actually<00:04:18.630> not<00:04:19.040> nutritious<00:04:20.040> at<00:04:20.400> all<00:04:20.609> the

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
are actually not nutritious at all the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.300 
are actually not nutritious at all the
edges<00:04:22.470> inside<00:04:23.900> aren't<00:04:24.900> good<00:04:25.620> for<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.070> they're

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
edges inside aren't good for you they're

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.860 
edges inside aren't good for you they're
just<00:04:26.340> full<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:26.850> sugar<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.330> carbohydrates

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
just full of sugar and carbohydrates

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.320 
just full of sugar and carbohydrates
they're<00:04:28.860> not<00:04:29.010> really<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.400> great<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:30.180> may

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
they're not really that great you may

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.190 
they're not really that great you may
think<00:04:30.600> like

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
think like

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.380 
think like
fruit<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.710> they<00:04:31.890> have<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.100> be<00:04:32.220> like<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:33.030> healthy

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
fruit so they have to be like so healthy

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.560 
fruit so they have to be like so healthy
for<00:04:33.420> you<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:34.290> one<00:04:34.470> isn't<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.570> outside

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
for you this one isn't the outside

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.670 
for you this one isn't the outside
however<00:04:36.930> like<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.710> rind<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:39.230> as<00:04:40.230> you<00:04:40.380> see<00:04:40.530> it's

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
however like the rind is as you see it's

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.250 
however like the rind is as you see it's
like<00:04:40.740> dark<00:04:41.130> purple<00:04:41.640> which<00:04:42.330> means<00:04:42.630> it's<00:04:43.080> full

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
like dark purple which means it's full

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.520 
like dark purple which means it's full
of<00:04:43.440> polyphenols<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:44.850> this<00:04:45.090> is<00:04:45.920> high<00:04:46.920> in

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
of polyphenols so this is high in

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.820 
of polyphenols so this is high in
antioxidants<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:50.630> anti-cancer<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:52.440> rind<00:04:52.650> is
