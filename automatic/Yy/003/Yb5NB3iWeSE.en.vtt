 hello youtube people welcome to my 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.109
 channel in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.730
 teach a simple method to be able to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.000
 make the pattern of a skirt of two 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.710
 folds this type of skirt is pretty 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.080
 current animes especially for 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.390
 uniforms it's about a skirt with a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.910
 fold forward and back but 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.580
 there may be variations such as for example 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.490
 this one in uniform of the series in weeks 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.470
 box is the scholar who carries king vich and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.780
 me and you can see on the screen or the skirt 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.440
 of the target costume of the frozen film of 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.440
 disney 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.450
 It can be done in all kinds of fabrics and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.470
 the lining is done in the same way 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.810
 that a basic skirt and also both 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.700
 For front as for rear it is done 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.390
 in the same way but if I'm just going to 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.750
 explain it with a forward 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.030
 we just need the base skirt pattern 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.400
 If you do not know how to do it 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.320
 please visit the video that is in my 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.940
 channel you can do it by clicking 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.140
 directly this image that comes out in 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.800
 screen 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.590
 we started step 1 on the base pattern of 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.259
 skirt we mark eleventh contour of the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.390
 hip with a vertical line at 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.909
 throughout the pattern that is where it goes 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.250
 the clamp and then lengthened the piece 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.400
 with the same width as the base pattern 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.250
 up to the hip 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.710
 Step 2 number the parts of the skirts 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.500
 so as not to lose them this time they will be 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.050
 of 1 and 2 and you're going to cut along the line 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 of eleventh contour that is where it is 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.980
 the clamp and also that clamp you're going to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.230
 cut because we do not need it to 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.560
 this skirt 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.630
 step 3 places the previous piece in the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.939
 spine or fold of the fabric 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.079
 if you want you can do all the pattern 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.420
 on whole paper before step 4 mark now 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.960
 a separation of about 15 centimeters in 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.750
 the low and from the hip line of 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.140
 12 centimeters and will divide by 2 by the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.360
 half this will be your fold now place 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.590
 the interior piece 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.110
 step 5 on the bottom towards the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.060
 inside of the crease marks a 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.899
 centimeter and a half and it fades sanz 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.180
 the hip 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.440
 that's the depth of your fold and in 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.080
 the outside inwards marks 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.100
 that same distance and the fade is 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.650
 towards the hip again 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.040
 are these triangular colored parts 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.040
 water 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.750
 step 7 round the bass and fold the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.480
 folds joining the initial pieces 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.220
 as if I had not separated them as 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.190
 shows in the video from the back of 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.710
 tables and cut the top part when 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.080
 be bent but not before so that 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.480
 sew you can grab all the fold of 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.700
 the skirt and own the waistband you should 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.280
 stay like a piquito in the part of 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.200
