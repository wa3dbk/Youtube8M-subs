this<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.560> my<00:00:01.740> air<00:00:02.100> tap<00:00:02.399> system<00:00:02.850> this<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.210> what

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
this is my air tap system this is what

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.460 
this is my air tap system this is what
heats<00:00:03.629> my<00:00:03.810> water<00:00:04.460> it's<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:06.259> heat<00:00:07.259> pump

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
heats my water it's a heat pump

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.430 
heats my water it's a heat pump
basically<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:08.340> sits<00:00:08.790> on<00:00:08.940> top<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.179> my<00:00:09.570> hot

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
basically that sits on top of my hot

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.120 
basically that sits on top of my hot
water<00:00:10.710> tank<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:12.259> you<00:00:13.259> disconnect<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> hot

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
water tank and you disconnect the hot

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.880 
water tank and you disconnect the hot
water<00:00:14.370> tank<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.590> add<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.820> unit<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.300> top

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
water tank and add this this unit on top

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.189 
water tank and add this this unit on top
by<00:00:19.890> disconnecting<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.820> mean<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.570> take<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
by disconnecting it I mean you take the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.120 
by disconnecting it I mean you take the
220<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.310> disconnected<00:00:23.820> 220<00:00:24.269> from<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
220 and disconnected 220 from this and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.919 
220 and disconnected 220 from this and
then<00:00:26.130> put<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:28.550> 110<00:00:29.929> 110

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
then put this on and this is a 110 110

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.920 
then put this on and this is a 110 110
volt<00:00:31.500> unit<00:00:32.000> and<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.360> reading<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> side

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
volt unit and I was reading the side

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.650 
volt unit and I was reading the side
here

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.960 

it<00:00:39.060> will<00:00:40.060> keep<00:00:40.210> water<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.750> 130<00:00:41.530> degrees<00:00:41.970> it's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
it will keep water to 130 degrees it's

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.270 
it will keep water to 130 degrees it's
seven<00:00:43.420> thousand<00:00:43.810> BTUs<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:46.080> it's<00:00:47.080> a<00:00:47.320> 900<00:00:47.980> watt

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
seven thousand BTUs and it's a 900 watt

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.720 
seven thousand BTUs and it's a 900 watt
unit

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
unit

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.119 
unit
so<00:00:51.730> basically<00:00:52.239> Oh<00:00:52.570> 80<00:00:53.020> amps<00:00:53.410> so<00:00:53.680> it<00:00:53.739> rolls<00:00:53.890> 80

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
so basically Oh 80 amps so it rolls 80

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.520 
so basically Oh 80 amps so it rolls 80
amps<00:00:54.430> when<00:00:54.519> it<00:00:54.610> runs<00:00:54.989> heats<00:00:55.989> water<00:00:56.170> very

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
amps when it runs heats water very

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.759 
amps when it runs heats water very
slowly<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.940> as<00:00:58.239> you<00:00:58.390> can<00:00:58.540> see<00:00:58.720> it's<00:00:59.379> running

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
slowly but as you can see it's running

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.380 
slowly but as you can see it's running
right<00:00:59.920> now<00:01:00.129> I<00:01:00.519> just<00:01:01.059> took<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.449> shower<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:03.390> it'll

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
right now I just took a shower and it'll

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.300 
right now I just took a shower and it'll
just<00:01:04.540> charge<00:01:04.809> this<00:01:04.960> tank<00:01:05.229> up<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.710> then<00:01:06.160> this

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
just charge this tank up and then this

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.969 
just charge this tank up and then this
tank<00:01:06.610> will<00:01:06.729> be<00:01:06.759> ready<00:01:07.000> for<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.360> next<00:01:07.979> shower

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
tank will be ready for the next shower

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.260 
tank will be ready for the next shower
or<00:01:09.490> or<00:01:10.030> what<00:01:10.390> not<00:01:10.600> now<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:12.430> right<00:01:12.670> here<00:01:12.729> is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
or or what not now this right here is

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.370 
or or what not now this right here is
the<00:01:13.930> air<00:01:14.800> that<00:01:15.130> comes<00:01:15.310> off<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.360> unit<00:01:16.660> it's

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
the air that comes off of the unit it's

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.990 
the air that comes off of the unit it's
cold<00:01:17.740> down<00:01:17.979> because<00:01:18.310> it's<00:01:18.490> taking<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.850> heat

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
cold down because it's taking the heat

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
cold down because it's taking the heat
from<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.390> air<00:01:19.509> and<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.950> awesome

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
from the air and it's awesome

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.040 
from the air and it's awesome
dehumidifies<00:01:23.830> here<00:01:24.190> as<00:01:24.340> well<00:01:24.550> so<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.600> have<00:01:25.840> this

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
dehumidifies here as well so I have this

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.980 
dehumidifies here as well so I have this
venting<00:01:26.530> outside<00:01:26.979> because<00:01:27.759> it's<00:01:28.180> it's<00:01:28.720> cold

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
venting outside because it's it's cold

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.200 
venting outside because it's it's cold
out<00:01:29.170> now<00:01:29.979> in<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.250> summer<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.610> what<00:01:30.820> I'll<00:01:30.910> do<00:01:31.060> is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
out now in the summer of what I'll do is

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.029 
out now in the summer of what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:31.360> take<00:01:31.479> this<00:01:31.660> pipe<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.170> all<00:01:32.289> I'll<00:01:32.619> connect

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
I'll take this pipe and all I'll connect

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.109 
I'll take this pipe and all I'll connect
it<00:01:33.160> up<00:01:33.300> over<00:01:34.300> here<00:01:34.899> which<00:01:35.500> goes<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.190> event<00:01:36.610> in

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
it up over here which goes to a event in

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.790 
it up over here which goes to a event in
my<00:01:37.360> living<00:01:37.750> room<00:01:37.780> floor<00:01:38.080> so<00:01:38.410> it<00:01:38.500> actually

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
my living room floor so it actually

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.620 
my living room floor so it actually
provides<00:01:39.130> air<00:01:39.340> conditioning

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
provides air conditioning

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.589 
provides air conditioning
the<00:01:40.930> other<00:01:41.110> cool<00:01:41.380> thing<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:41.619> this<00:01:41.890> does<00:01:42.759> down

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599 
the other cool thing that this does down

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.109 
the other cool thing that this does down
here<00:01:44.520> there's<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.910> dream<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:48.009> water<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:48.759> as<00:01:48.940> is

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
here there's a dream for water so as is

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.300 
here there's a dream for water so as is
dehumidifying<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.110> is<00:01:50.319> where<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.890> water<00:01:51.099> is

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
dehumidifying this is where the water is

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.059 
dehumidifying this is where the water is
discharged<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.149> it<00:01:52.780> runs<00:01:52.959> up<00:01:53.200> out<00:01:53.560> down<00:01:53.860> this

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
discharged and it runs up out down this

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.749 
discharged and it runs up out down this
pipe<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.990> drains<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.289> a<00:01:56.319> sewer<00:01:57.310> drain<00:01:57.610> over

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
pipe and drains to a sewer drain over

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.160 
pipe and drains to a sewer drain over
there<00:01:58.000> but<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:59.170> right<00:01:59.679> here<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.300> one<00:02:01.300> third

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
there but this right here is one third

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.449 
there but this right here is one third
the<00:02:02.830> energy<00:02:03.630> or<00:02:04.630> electricity<00:02:05.020> has<00:02:05.500> normal<00:02:06.280> hot

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
the energy or electricity has normal hot

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.699 
the energy or electricity has normal hot
water<00:02:06.700> tank<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:08.140> would<00:02:08.319> highly<00:02:08.679> recommend

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
water tank and I would highly recommend

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.859 
water tank and I would highly recommend
if<00:02:09.220> there's<00:02:09.369> any<00:02:09.610> appliance<00:02:10.090> out<00:02:10.300> there<00:02:10.539> that

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
if there's any appliance out there that

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.470 
if there's any appliance out there that
you<00:02:11.050> want<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.590> replace<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.459> be<00:02:12.970> more<00:02:13.120> energy

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
you want to replace and be more energy

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.710 
you want to replace and be more energy
efficient<00:02:13.870> air<00:02:14.830> tap<00:02:15.099> is<00:02:15.400> gonna<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:15.819> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
efficient air tap is gonna be the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.979 
efficient air tap is gonna be the
number-one<00:02:17.020> choice<00:02:17.380> because<00:02:18.840> probably<00:02:19.840> more

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
number-one choice because probably more

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.479 
number-one choice because probably more
than<00:02:20.170> fifty<00:02:20.530> or<00:02:20.709> sixty<00:02:20.890> percent<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.430> your

electricity used in your home just goes

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.580 
electricity used in your home just goes
into<00:02:23.830> heating<00:02:24.040> water

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
into heating water
