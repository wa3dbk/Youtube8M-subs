00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
so I thought why not go in depth of it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.740 
so I thought why not go in depth of it
and<00:00:40.070> stuff<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:42.530> uh<00:00:43.149> yeah<00:00:44.149> let's<00:00:44.270> start<00:00:44.660> with

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
and stuff so uh yeah let's start with

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.130 
and stuff so uh yeah let's start with
the<00:00:45.079> size<00:00:45.980> comparison<00:00:46.690> before<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:47.840> get<00:00:48.020> into

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
the size comparison before I get into

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.740 
the size comparison before I get into
all<00:00:48.320> that<00:00:48.350> cool<00:00:48.680> stuff<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.360> for<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.450> most<00:00:50.629> part

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
all that cool stuff so for the most part

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.580 
all that cool stuff so for the most part
is<00:00:51.140> quite<00:00:51.379> in<00:00:51.590> scale<00:00:51.890> with<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:53.350> generally<00:00:54.350> most

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
is quite in scale with a generally most

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.590 
is quite in scale with a generally most
vehicles<00:00:56.020> which<00:00:57.020> is<00:00:57.230> pretty<00:00:57.980> good<00:00:58.960> I<00:01:01.600> would

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
vehicles which is pretty good I would

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.289 
vehicles which is pretty good I would
say<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.410> is<00:01:04.420> slightly<00:01:05.420> out-of-scale<00:01:06.970> or<00:01:07.970> maybe

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.160

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
cuz the burt's look a bit smaller than

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.539 
cuz the burt's look a bit smaller than
everybody
