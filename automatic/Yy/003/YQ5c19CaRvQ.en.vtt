all<00:00:43.280> right<00:00:43.430> guys

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
all right guys

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.300 
all right guys
where<00:00:44.030> are<00:00:44.510> they<00:00:44.690> have<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.930> protocol<00:00:45.380> now<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.250> to

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
where are they have a protocol now so to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.070 
where are they have a protocol now so to
access<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:47.030> what's<00:00:47.420> far<00:00:47.600> this<00:00:47.660> is<00:00:47.810> a<00:00:47.840> pretty

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
access it what's far this is a pretty

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.780 
access it what's far this is a pretty
much<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.410> same<00:00:48.590> principle<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:49.310> will<00:00:49.460> school

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
much the same principle you will school

00:00:49.790 --> 00:01:01.060 
much the same principle you will school
like<00:00:50.450> that<00:00:50.770> to<00:00:51.770> open<00:00:51.950> up<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.490> tape

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.500 

Quorra<00:01:02.070> thing<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.490> that<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:03.060> you<00:01:03.240> are<00:01:03.270> tempted

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
Quorra thing is that if you are tempted

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.500 
Quorra thing is that if you are tempted
to<00:01:03.720> another<00:01:04.650> powder<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.190> meet<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.210> lot<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
to another powder and you meet a lot of

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.990 
to another powder and you meet a lot of
resistance<00:01:06.690> like<00:01:07.410> in<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.680> case<00:01:08.000> obviously

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
resistance like in this case obviously

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
resistance like in this case obviously
there<00:01:09.600> must<00:01:09.870> be<00:01:10.050> a<00:01:10.080> fast<00:01:10.350> line<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.590> forgot<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
there must be a fast line you forgot to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.700 
there must be a fast line you forgot to
remove<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.670> hidden<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.720> I'm<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.590> to
