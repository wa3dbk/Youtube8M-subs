span doubt and I'll usually paste these
things<00:01:08.560> out<00:01:08.799> depending<00:01:09.189> on<00:01:09.280> how<00:01:09.459> far<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.759> want

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
things out depending on how far I want

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.620 
things out depending on how far I want
my<00:01:10.149> lines<00:01:10.359> to<00:01:10.539> go<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.799> longer<00:01:12.159> your<00:01:12.310> line<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
my lines to go the longer your line the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.179 
my lines to go the longer your line the
more<00:01:13.840> chance<00:01:14.139> there<00:01:14.289> is<00:01:14.469> for<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:14.799> to<00:01:14.829> actually

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
more chance there is for it to actually

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.849 
more chance there is for it to actually
get<00:01:15.310> tangled<00:01:15.759> up<00:01:15.850> around<00:01:16.600> something<00:01:16.929> and<00:01:17.770> if

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
get tangled up around something and if

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:19.260 
get tangled up around something and if
the<00:01:17.950> fish<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.280> on<00:01:18.399> there<00:01:18.609> for<00:01:18.789> any<00:01:18.939> length<00:01:19.029> of

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
the fish is on there for any length of

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.419 
the fish is on there for any length of
time<00:01:19.329> it<00:01:20.229> gives<00:01:20.469> them<00:01:20.649> more<00:01:20.859> time<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.310> actually

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
time it gives them more time to actually

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.149 
time it gives them more time to actually
start<00:01:21.670> projects<00:01:22.389> now<00:01:23.380> I've<00:01:23.679> stopped<00:01:23.950> right

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
start projects now I've stopped right

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.559 
start projects now I've stopped right
here<00:01:24.189> eventually<00:01:24.939> you<00:01:25.090> should<00:01:25.119> get<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.539> the

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
here eventually you should get to the

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.410 
here eventually you should get to the
point<00:01:25.630> where<00:01:26.049> you<00:01:26.200> hit<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.439> hook<00:01:26.649> or<00:01:26.829> 2<00:01:27.240> 2<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.389> 3

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
point where you hit a hook or 2 2 to 3

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.449 
point where you hit a hook or 2 2 to 3
hooks<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:29.049> as<00:01:29.289> many<00:01:29.529> as<00:01:29.679> I<00:01:29.829> put<00:01:30.039> on<00:01:30.069> these<00:01:30.249> rigs

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
hooks is as many as I put on these rigs

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.179 
hooks is as many as I put on these rigs
again<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.450> more<00:01:31.600> hooks<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.560> more<00:01:32.770> chances

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
again the more hooks the more chances

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.889 
again the more hooks the more chances
for<00:01:33.249> getting<00:01:33.399> things<00:01:33.670> caught<00:01:34.029> the<00:01:34.689> more

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
for getting things caught the more

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.620 
for getting things caught the more
trouble<00:01:35.229> you<00:01:35.289> can<00:01:35.439> get<00:01:35.560> into<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.630> eventually

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
trouble you can get into and eventually

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.849 
trouble you can get into and eventually
you'll<00:01:37.779> probably<00:01:37.929> be<00:01:38.170> spending<00:01:38.319> most<00:01:38.619> your

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
you'll probably be spending most your

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.819 
you'll probably be spending most your
time<00:01:39.029> untying<00:01:40.029> untangling<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:41.469> snagging

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
time untying untangling and on snagging

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.830 
time untying untangling and on snagging
so<00:01:42.700> 2<00:01:42.759> hooks<00:01:43.149> I'm<00:01:43.689> using<00:01:44.109> a<00:01:45.359> self<00:01:46.359> setting<00:01:46.659> hook

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
so 2 hooks I'm using a self setting hook

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.989 
so 2 hooks I'm using a self setting hook
pretty<00:01:47.319> large<00:01:47.590> one<00:01:47.889> it<00:01:48.399> keeps<00:01:48.669> the<00:01:48.789> bait<00:01:48.969> on

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
but it's heavy enough where I can throw

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
here this is the tricky part that a lot

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.969 
here this is the tricky part that a lot
of<00:03:42.120> people<00:03:42.359> can<00:03:42.479> bungle<00:03:42.870> up<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.319> it<00:03:43.680> can<00:03:43.829> get

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
quite dangerous I've seen people just

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.899 
quite dangerous I've seen people just
simply<00:03:46.319> toss<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:47.009> try<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.310> throw<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:47.759> like<00:03:47.849> a

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
simply toss it try and throw it like a

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.360 
simply toss it try and throw it like a
baseball<00:03:48.139> I've<00:03:49.139> seen<00:03:49.409> people<00:03:49.709> twist<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.250> and

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
baseball I've seen people twist it and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.179 
baseball I've seen people twist it and
chunk<00:03:51.079> all<00:03:52.079> of<00:03:52.439> them<00:03:52.560> are<00:03:52.650> pretty<00:03:52.799> unnerving

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
chunk all of them are pretty unnerving

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.640 
chunk all of them are pretty unnerving
if<00:03:53.519> somebody's<00:03:54.150> not<00:03:54.319> watching<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:55.439> paying

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
if somebody's not watching and paying

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.670 
if somebody's not watching and paying
attention<00:03:56.750> when<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.810> was<00:03:57.930> about<00:03:58.049> ten<00:03:58.349> I<00:03:58.379> watched

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
attention when I was about ten I watched

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.589 
attention when I was about ten I watched
my<00:03:58.829> grandfather<00:03:59.310> chunk<00:03:59.699> one<00:03:59.879> out<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.389> hook

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
my grandfather chunk one out the hook

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.559 
my grandfather chunk one out the hook
grab<00:04:00.780> his<00:04:01.079> finger<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:02.099> weight<00:04:02.819> kept<00:04:03.090> on<00:04:03.239> going

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
grab his finger the weight kept on going

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.119 
grab his finger the weight kept on going
and<00:04:03.780> he<00:04:03.840> nearly<00:04:04.049> got<00:04:04.290> yanked<00:04:04.560> into<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.949> river

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
and he nearly got yanked into the river

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.119 
and he nearly got yanked into the river
so<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.790> was<00:04:06.079> pretty<00:04:07.079> traumatizing<00:04:07.349> at<00:04:07.979> that

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
so that was pretty traumatizing at that

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.129 
so that was pretty traumatizing at that
age<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:09.060> usually<00:04:09.419> I'll<00:04:09.509> grab<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.049> the

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
age but usually I'll grab on to the

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.780 
age but usually I'll grab on to the
first<00:04:10.349> hook<00:04:10.560> maybe<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.040> second<00:04:11.400> hook<00:04:11.519> in<00:04:11.669> a

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
first hook maybe the second hook in a

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.460
