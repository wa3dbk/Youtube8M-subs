00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 yes hello people in this video look 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.550
 We warmly look at a new camera and 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.460
 Although the panasonic lumix dmc 70 that 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.769
 whole is a 4k camera as I said from 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.199
 the company panasonic and what I like it all 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.430
 in the carton how does it immediately follow her 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.430
 the intro a lot of fun 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.330
 the camera comes in this chic and 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.340
 Small packaging will look us 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.379
 a short time the packaging on here is also 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.239
 again the camera pictured here 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.640
 we have various information about 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.650
 camera here also a few 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.590
 information just once again to 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.350
 Camera on the back few unnecessary 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.699
 things and then we want the same 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.830
 let's open the box 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.199
 we just have to do this here 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.879
 lax away here and then we can 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.160
 even open the lid 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.790
 we will also be shown here 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.500
 what it optional for accessories there 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.079
 We are not interested now 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.199
 and then we have here first too 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.119
 ever look at the short instructions there 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.680
 Let's have a quick look what I'm doing 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.369
 everything in this package in here 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.430
 is 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.640
 here once such a dvd for software 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.369
 or other then here short instructions 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.160
 brief user manuals in 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.080
 different languages and here still 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.789
 Any note for tips and 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.369
 updates but this can also be gone 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.410
 We are not interested in further and 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.000
 we just open the box and 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.369
 what else to look for then 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.380
 it appears here will be already 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.920
 interesting I think we open up times 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.950
 first so here we have the well 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.880
 First of all the battery for the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.709
 Battery York small and compact that 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.020
 whole has 1200 milliamps 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:56.459
 but he already set aside then have 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.280
 here we just have a power cord and 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:04.599
 another USB cable if you have the whole 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.880
 somehow connect to pc then 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:09.700
 is also here the load 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.640
 So let me have it here later, then 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.870
 recharge battery 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.730
 it will be easy then 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.190
 charged here on the back can 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.379
 then we plug in the power cord 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.730
 I think that was really great 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.520
 practically because i had it here now 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.770
 in front of it a nikon camera with the me 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.440
 whole year on film and there was the whole 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.600
 Eleven installed one had no son cable 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.090
 and forest already a bit 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.129
 limited modern 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.530
 that annoyed me so much 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.989
 But let's see what yet so 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.349
 in addition to all the accessories such a carton 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.330
 is there only here the first one ever so 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.120
 carrying handle or 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.920
 tourists band but I do not need it 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.599
 unpack because I need the similar 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.900
 will 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:59.239
 and that's how cool we get there 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.099
 a lens hood included 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:08.450
 due to the objective that is here and 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:13.220
 damn small is not that special 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:18.620
 Large lens 1 14 to 42 mm with one 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.480
 dazzle of I believe 3.5 to 5 6 so 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.569
 not the best but i think for now 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.500
 the beginning is enough we do here too 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.500
 also the same time 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.150
 lens hood on it pulls so already 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.220
 a little bit more professional 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.610
 objectively put but also first 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.860
 page 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.590
 and then we come to the times 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.930
 star of the show, I'll do it again 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.269
 so packed away with the paper your 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.030
 I really like small and compact 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.950
 Well, I already have what's called 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.739
 I could test in the shop for a short time 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.859
 on saturday only media market and has me 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.810
 the whole already looked at briefly and 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.030
 the whole thing is pretty compact 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.709
 also has no fixed rattling 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.560
 mirror more in it so the whole looks 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.030
 then later out with objective really 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.010
 very small and compact whole and it 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.940
 is also really amazing the good 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.820
 hand so I would not have thought now 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.440
 the whole is something I knew but 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.470
 also from the processing makes a real 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.510
 Great impression which I am particularly good 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.060
 We like that here, a swiveling 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.250
 display I have that I necessarily 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.280
 I need the videos otherwise 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.800
 film can not see for itself and the ice 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.770
 such a year of duty with a camera for 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.590
 In any case, that's very convenient for me 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.580
 Here we are again 35 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.020
 also installed 4 k 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.600
 without saying how you are 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.120
 still the battery in and we can too 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.069
 just do the sd card in because 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.660
 The thing also needs to be neat 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:57.470
 performance if one with a lot of squad 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.490
 wants to record 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.870
 That's why I have a 128 gb here 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.220
 memory card still bought 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.430
 from trans knows the whole is good or 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.990
 or recommended for 4k 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:19.669
 video recordings I will now synonymous 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:21.620
 Grad still open is already the 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.949
 packaging does not want but does not matter 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:30.110
 I have time 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:32.419
 so the tricky one got lost 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.020
 here we can now download our sd card 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:39.159
 clean it down and then also the 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.479
 turn on the battery at the same place 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.009
 that's just going to happen now 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.220
 then we can also see if that 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:49.599
 whole even maybe has electricity 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.599
 would be pretty cool anyway 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.509
 this one must also set up the whole 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.449
 state language but yes the first 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:05.500
 impression really pretty positive only 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:08.509
 I just noticed the battery cover 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.370
 yes, here I could plate my tripod 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.560
 on it and then I would have to do that every time 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.449
 unscrew is not so cool times 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.340
 I'll look there but I think 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.039
 even a battery grip as is there 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.810
 what gives buy but the first impression 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.840
 in any case so far very much 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.690
 positive the whole looks really solid 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.639
 and it will also be summed up in 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.710
 So give a month write again 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.590
 still in the comments on what videos 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.940
 This camera would like to have in the future 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.409
 I can stop there for you still 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.300
 Turn some videos to 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.130
 which we have just bock so 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.380
 a conclusion will be in any case 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.669
 come and yes it was now 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.590
 already with this video 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.840
 I'll grab you the links to the left 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.580
 memory card to the camera times in 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.810
 the video description can you 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.580
 look at it all 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.320
 that was it with this one already 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.550
 video I thank you for watching 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.550
 Until next time
