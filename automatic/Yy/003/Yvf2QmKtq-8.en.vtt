us that's they're just going to think
that's<00:02:27.549> normal<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.900> we<00:02:29.110> can<00:02:29.260> encourage<00:02:29.530> them

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
that's normal so we can encourage them

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.500 
that's normal so we can encourage them
to<00:02:29.799> eat<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.189> a<00:02:30.250> healthy<00:02:30.670> way<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.849> make<00:02:31.150> better
