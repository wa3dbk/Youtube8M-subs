your tablet now the audio quality is
much<00:00:40.650> better<00:00:40.850> than<00:00:41.850> your<00:00:42.290> device<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
much better than your device because you

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.730 
much better than your device because you
got<00:00:44.190> two<00:00:44.370> speakers<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.150> I<00:00:45.390> actually<00:00:46.350> wouldn't

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
got two speakers but I actually wouldn't

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.800 
got two speakers but I actually wouldn't
say<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.280> e<00:00:47.370> louder<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.210> actually<00:00:48.570> about

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
say it's an e louder it's actually about

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.950 
say it's an e louder it's actually about
the<00:00:49.020> same<00:00:49.320> volume<00:00:50.040> but<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.720> better

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the same volume but you have a better

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.050 
the same volume but you have a better
distribution<00:00:52.560> because<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.610> coming<00:00:53.820> from

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
distribution because it's coming from

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.480 
distribution because it's coming from
both<00:00:54.390> sides<00:00:54.630> instead<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.860> tiny<00:00:56.310> little

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
both sides instead of this tiny little

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.220 
both sides instead of this tiny little
speakers<00:00:56.970> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.150> bottom<00:00:57.300> trying<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.870> push

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
speakers on the bottom trying to push

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
is $29.99 so it's very affordable and it

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.840 
is $29.99 so it's very affordable and it
is<00:01:03.540> universal<00:01:04.140> even<00:01:04.409> though<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.680> say<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.190> mean
