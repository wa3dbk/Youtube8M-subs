00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello people in this video I show 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.120
 you 1 7 beta 4 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.120
 on an ipad iphone and ipod touch 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.080
 we begin the lockscreen to sounds 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 Almost nothing changed to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.369
 beta 3 except that there is one now 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.660
 small arrow so we know in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.660
 which direction we have to sweat 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.689
 then we have the same nice animation 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.500
 and you can go to the homescreen 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.710
 Actually, everything has stayed the same 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.070
 we only have very small user interface 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.870
 memories for example at the iphone in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.600
 the phone app there we have it all 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.789
 normal mail options of call button 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.340
 has changed there in the notification 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.480
 center I had done something and indeed 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.710
 which I think is very good we can do it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.870
 just between the different ones 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:01:00.000
 Of course, switchen on the website is also possible 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 iPhone do not have to be above then anymore 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.750
 the little bakken press what I too 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.489
 very good, the control center goes 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.869
 It's wonderfully fast and does not hang 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.729
 we see more after that 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.509
 control center has nothing now 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.140
 done so I can not see anything new 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.140
 close again 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.890
 in multitasking actually looks too 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.240
 everything alike 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.549
 everything just runs smoother as well 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.280
 before and that 's just every beta 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.500
 so it is more fluid and only eat a few 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.119
 small innovations there what else 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.570
 new when we search in the spotlight 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.220
 we have now go to the top right 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.350
 cancel the button we had before 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.149
 is not now made new rom 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.270
 is a bit different otherwise he himself 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.850
 Nothing changes calendar 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.240
 as before from wonderfully simple 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.240
 held 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.820
 the photos app also looks like 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.070
 previously seen no new features 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.510
 in camera app on march in hdr button 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.890
 Elsewhere on the iphone is up here 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.819
 he just had a turn on and off 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.530
 at the ipad we have it right up there 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.000
 It used to be down there somehow 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.690
 the side with the filters have now 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.690
 a slightly different view 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.090
 as far as the camera app in safari 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.090
 we also make small changes 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.920
 we see here in the ipad we have the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.810
 different tabs when I turn on it 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.010
 bookmark on it presses we see the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.019
 reading list because they have a small top 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.430
 glasses added on the right you have one 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.470
 small at what was nicer added 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:54.260
 looks like before and left just that 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.239
 has regarded the favorites bookmarks 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.410
 something changed we have now 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.880
 all this bit more in the middle 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.000
 before that was all the way to the edge 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.200
 exploited at iphone sees it 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.769
 actually still the same 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.269
 the different tabs and we have 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.299
 here with the bookmarks and reading list 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.400
 we have the new icons on top of the ipad 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.600
 now when we open iphone apps one 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.980
 another button below right 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.060
 We can see that in the new design as well 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.590
 this 1x and 2x button 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.660
 what are beta 3 already new 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.030
 we now have the full hd resolution 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.630
 so the full retina resolution if we 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.730
 Running iphone apps in double mode 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.109
 So here's the full one 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.079
 resolution and I have just seen 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.640
 if we switch to some we have 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.410
 no longer this weird edge in the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.660
 app on the outside, I find also very cool 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.820
 if your series has not been seen in 7 yet 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.359
 have clearly shown or so here 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.579
 Do you see that? 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.290
 on the ipad it is now fullscreen us 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.820
 I have a few things in the middle 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.109
 pressed it here on the question mark 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.730
 to see what we can command 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.260
 we can post on twitter 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.739
 facebook can restaurants in her 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.459
 search 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.440
 movies music sports events cards like 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.209
 I come from a to b and so on 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.419
 can apps open someone call 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.919
 of course and much more 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.720
 we have questions and answers now 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.460
 here below 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.230
 there could be any questions 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.110
 and siri you answer like to 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.090
 for example, how many euros are 45 dollars 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.160
 what was the hindenburg how long to live 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.739
 dogs and so on really cool 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.570
 features which are new 7 beta 4 at 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.200
 series by and large it was 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.180
 actually 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.530
 it runs as I said everything liquid we 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.870
 have very small user interface 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.770
 change that really use that 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.820
 make it easier 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.380
 Now I can already rather 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.170
 Introduce this version 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.180
 release candidate is the most 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.340
 bugs that somehow had 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.050
 here dissolved what the battery life 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.880
 concerns can not say anything because 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.880
 beta is just an hour outside 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.920
 I have to test it now and report it 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.120
 I possibly sometime later in the beta 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.060
 3 which I also quite good the 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.250
 battery life in beta 1 was grottig me 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.500
 like that she writes super writes 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.660
 still my comments as you 7 finds 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.360
 So I think it's nice , that 's it 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.060
 with the short video what's new in ios 7 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.700
 beta 4 is not showing much anyway 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.230
