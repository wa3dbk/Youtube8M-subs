00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
concept that I've been talking about

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.880

well<00:01:18.030> basically<00:01:18.210> every<00:01:18.840> poker<00:01:19.290> decision<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.149 
well basically every poker decision that
we're<00:01:20.040> involved<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.790> has<00:01:21.479> two<00:01:21.720> main<00:01:22.350> simple

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
we're involved in it has two main simple

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.130 
we're involved in it has two main simple
parts<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.390> first<00:01:24.600> part<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> be

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
parts and the first part is going to be

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.399 
parts and the first part is going to be
making<00:01:25.680> assumptions<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.759> opponent

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
making assumptions about your opponent

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.719 
making assumptions about your opponent
and<00:01:28.409> these<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:29.100> slump<00:01:29.280> shins<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.670> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and these are slump shins are going to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030 
and these are slump shins are going to
be<00:01:29.820> based<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.840> current<00:01:31.079> plane<00:01:31.409> habits<00:01:31.860> of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
be based on the current plane habits of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.429 
be based on the current plane habits of
your<00:01:32.220> opponent<00:01:32.670> past<00:01:33.270> experience<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:34.200> them

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
your opponent past experience with them

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.640 
your opponent past experience with them
if<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.189> pokertracker<00:01:35.820> HUD<00:01:36.630> stats<00:01:36.960> hold

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
if you have pokertracker HUD stats hold

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.160 
if you have pokertracker HUD stats hold
a<00:01:37.710> manager<00:01:38.220> HD<00:01:38.790> stats<00:01:39.150> those<00:01:39.840> are<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> be

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
a manager HD stats those are going to be

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.980 
a manager HD stats those are going to be
huge<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.070> also<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.240> ranges<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.689> we

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
huge for you and also the ranges that we

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
huge for you and also the ranges that we
can<00:01:43.170> apply<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.250> opponent<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.790> that's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
can apply to this opponent and that's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.120 
can apply to this opponent and that's
probably<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.479> most<00:01:45.780> important<00:01:46.320> factor<00:01:46.649> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
probably the most important factor is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.940 
probably the most important factor is
putting<00:01:47.520> them<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.869> correct<00:01:48.869> hand<00:01:49.290> range<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
putting them on a correct hand range and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.550 
putting them on a correct hand range and
once<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.210> these<00:01:51.329> assumptions<00:01:51.689> we

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
once we make all these assumptions we

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.709 
once we make all these assumptions we
figure<00:01:53.310> out<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.090> relatively

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
figure out you know a relatively

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.749 
figure out you know a relatively
accurate<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.840> least<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.170> our<00:01:58.259> mind<00:01:58.759> assumption

accurate at least in our mind assumption

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.889 
accurate at least in our mind assumption
then<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.210> go<00:02:00.329> about<00:02:00.420> choosing<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
then we can go about choosing the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.840 
then we can go about choosing the
correct<00:02:01.079> line<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.799> correct<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> play<00:02:02.729> our

to go up you're going to play a lot

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.560 
to go up you're going to play a lot
better<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.090> you're<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.270> make<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> lot

better and you're going to make a lot

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.380 
better and you're going to make a lot
better<00:02:21.750> moves<00:02:22.700> let's<00:02:23.700> get<00:02:23.820> into<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.060> common

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
better moves let's get into the common

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.150 
better moves let's get into the common
misconceptions<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.380> biggest<00:02:25.740> one<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.130> that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
misconceptions the biggest one is that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.010 
misconceptions the biggest one is that
if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.910> play<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> hand<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.480> same<00:02:27.660> way<00:02:27.780> every

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
if you play a hand the same way every

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.620 
if you play a hand the same way every
time<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.590> correct<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.580> know<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.240> you

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
time it's correct you know you you you

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.350 
time it's correct you know you you you
raise<00:02:30.900> pocket<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:32.580> raise<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.880> puck<00:02:33.060> at<00:02:33.090> nine

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
raise pocket you raise the puck at nine

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
raise pocket you raise the puck at nine
so<00:02:33.570> that's<00:02:33.600> that's<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.080> example<00:02:34.680> we're<00:02:34.920> going

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
so that's that's a example we're going

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.860 
so that's that's a example we're going
to<00:02:35.100> use<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.300> raise<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.570> plugin

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
to use here if you raise the plugin

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.690 
to use here if you raise the plugin
nines<00:02:37.020> one<00:02:37.200> hundred<00:02:37.410> percent<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.740> time<00:02:37.890> you

that's<00:03:48.060> when<00:03:48.390> you're<00:03:48.540> going<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.750> that's<00:03:49.290> when

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
that's when you're going to that's when

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.930 
that's when you're going to that's when
your<00:03:49.710> games<00:03:49.920> going<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:50.400> sore<00:03:50.640> you're

going to win way more money and and if
you<00:03:55.380> just<00:03:55.530> apply<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:56.760> concept<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.750> all<00:03:57.900> these

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
you just apply that concept to all these

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.690 
you just apply that concept to all these
general<00:03:58.530> rules<00:03:58.740> that<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.100> might<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.340> using

general rules that you might be using

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.910 
general rules that you might be using
you<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.540> dispel<00:04:00.930> all<00:04:00.960> those<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.680> start

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
you just dispel all those and you start

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.040 
you just dispel all those and you start
playing<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.550> situation<00:04:03.210> the<00:04:03.780> player<00:04:04.020> the

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
playing the situation the player the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.470 
playing the situation the player the
hand<00:04:04.680> you're<00:04:05.580> going<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.820> you're<00:04:06.150> going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.360> be

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
hand you're going to you're going to be

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.080 
hand you're going to you're going to be
way<00:04:06.750> better<00:04:06.960> off<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:08.790> that's<00:04:08.910> probably

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
way better off and so that's probably

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.000 
way better off and so that's probably
the<00:04:09.240> biggest<00:04:09.500> misconception<00:04:10.500> another<00:04:11.960> slight

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
the biggest misconception another slight

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.710 
the biggest misconception another slight
myth<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.220> Poker<00:04:14.610> would<00:04:14.790> be<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.480> fundamental

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
myth of Poker would be the fundamental

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.289 
myth of Poker would be the fundamental
theorem<00:04:16.170> of<00:04:16.320> Poker<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.890> was<00:04:17.280> written<00:04:17.820> by<00:04:18.000> David

skiing<00:04:18.690> ski<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.340> think<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.430> appears<00:04:20.790> in<00:04:21.030> his

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
skiing ski I think it appears in his

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.810 
skiing ski I think it appears in his
theory<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.600> poker<00:04:22.840> book<00:04:23.140> maybe<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:24.100> don't<00:04:24.760> know

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
theory of poker book maybe I don't know

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.160 
theory of poker book maybe I don't know
I<00:04:25.000> think<00:04:25.360> that's<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.630> book<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:25.990> he's

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
I think that's the book it is he's

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.210 
I think that's the book it is he's
written<00:04:26.350> a<00:04:26.500> million<00:04:26.770> of<00:04:26.890> them<00:04:27.010> but<00:04:27.730> it's<00:04:28.570> been

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
written a million of them but it's been

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.950 
written a million of them but it's been
reproduced<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.400> million<00:04:30.910> times<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.570> basically

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
reproduced a million times and basically

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.570 
reproduced a million times and basically
what<00:04:32.140> it<00:04:32.260> says<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.500> that<00:04:32.680> every<00:04:33.130> time<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.460> play

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
what it says is that every time you play

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.190 
what it says is that every time you play
a<00:04:33.640> hand<00:04:33.850> differently<00:04:34.450> than<00:04:34.780> if<00:04:34.930> your<00:04:35.050> opponent

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
a hand differently than if your opponent

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.870 
a hand differently than if your opponent
could<00:04:35.440> see<00:04:35.680> your<00:04:35.800> hand<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.190> benefit<00:04:36.670> and

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
could see your hand you benefit and

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.150 
could see your hand you benefit and
every<00:04:37.450> time<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.780> play<00:04:38.170> a<00:04:38.260> hand<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.980> way<00:04:39.100> you

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
every time you play a hand the way you

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.530 
every time you play a hand the way you
would<00:04:39.400> if<00:04:39.520> your<00:04:39.670> opponent<00:04:39.850> could<00:04:40.180> see<00:04:40.420> your

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
would if your opponent could see your

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.730 
would if your opponent could see your
hand<00:04:40.750> then<00:04:41.020> your<00:04:41.170> opponent's<00:04:41.530> going<00:04:41.680> to

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
hand then your opponent's going to

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.050 
hand then your opponent's going to
benefit<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:44.250> real<00:04:45.250> truth<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.640> this<00:04:45.790> is

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
benefit and the real truth to this is

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.600 
benefit and the real truth to this is
that<00:04:46.270> it's<00:04:46.480> not<00:04:46.570> really<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.230> theorem<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.310> how<00:04:48.550> to

that it's not really a theorem of how to

a good way to play the game and now

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.330 
a good way to play the game and now
let's<00:05:34.000> get<00:05:34.120> into<00:05:34.240> some<00:05:34.540> like<00:05:35.230> the<00:05:35.380> assumptions

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
let's get into some like the assumptions

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
let's get into some like the assumptions
of<00:05:36.580> a<00:05:38.280> plane<00:05:39.280> it's<00:05:39.550> like<00:05:39.730> putting<00:05:39.940> your<00:05:40.120> hand

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
of a plane it's like putting your hand

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.820 
of a plane it's like putting your hand
are<00:05:40.870> you<00:05:41.020> putting<00:05:41.200> your<00:05:41.320> opponent's<00:05:41.710> on<00:05:41.800> a

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
are you putting your opponent's on a

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.090 
are you putting your opponent's on a
hand<00:05:42.100> so<00:05:43.090> one<00:05:43.960> of<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.140> mistakes<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:44.980> people

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
hand so one of the mistakes that people

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.100 
hand so one of the mistakes that people
make<00:05:45.310> with<00:05:45.700> assumptions<00:05:46.030> is<00:05:46.480> that<00:05:46.690> instead<00:05:46.990> of

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
make with assumptions is that instead of

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.630 
make with assumptions is that instead of
trying<00:05:47.350> to<00:05:47.410> put<00:05:47.650> their<00:05:47.890> opponent<00:05:48.280> on<00:05:48.400> like<00:05:48.610> a

you<00:06:24.880> can<00:06:25.150> fold<00:06:25.330> that's<00:06:25.570> fine<00:06:25.870> but<00:06:26.940> you<00:06:27.940> don't

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
you can fold that's fine but you don't

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.700 
you can fold that's fine but you don't

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
want to be making that assumption very

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.800 
want to be making that assumption very
often<00:06:30.220> what<00:06:30.970> you<00:06:31.090> need<00:06:31.270> to<00:06:31.360> do<00:06:31.480> is<00:06:31.600> put<00:06:31.780> your

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
often what you need to do is put your

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:32.870 
often what you need to do is put your
opponent<00:06:32.080> on<00:06:32.500> a

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
opponent on a

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.240 
opponent on a
based<00:06:33.870> on<00:06:34.050> what<00:06:34.230> they've<00:06:34.350> done<00:06:34.500> before<00:06:34.920> and

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
based on what they've done before and

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.650 
based on what they've done before and
based<00:06:35.550> on<00:06:35.640> what<00:06:35.790> they<00:06:35.940> are<00:06:36.270> doing<00:06:36.480> now<00:06:37.160> so<00:06:38.160> like

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
based on what they are doing now so like

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.420 
based on what they are doing now so like
with<00:06:39.660> that<00:06:39.810> three-bet<00:06:40.200> example<00:06:40.710> if<00:06:40.920> you<00:06:41.190> see

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
with that three-bet example if you see

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.160 
with that three-bet example if you see
like<00:06:41.940> if<00:06:41.970> you<00:06:42.210> have<00:06:42.330> poker<00:06:42.570> tracker<00:06:42.750> running

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
like if you have poker tracker running

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.200 
like if you have poker tracker running
and<00:06:43.320> you<00:06:43.380> see<00:06:43.590> hey<00:06:44.100> his<00:06:44.400> three<00:06:44.610> about<00:06:44.760> range<00:06:45.000> is

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
and you see hey his three about range is

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.700 
and you see hey his three about range is
like<00:06:45.390> seventeen<00:06:45.960> percent<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:46.530> I've<00:06:46.620> only

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
like seventeen percent and I've only

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.400 
like seventeen percent and I've only
played<00:06:46.980> 60<00:06:47.970> hands<00:06:48.180> with<00:06:48.390> him<00:06:48.540> well<00:06:49.080> chances

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
played 60 hands with him well chances

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.770 
played 60 hands with him well chances
are<00:06:49.680> he<00:06:49.890> probably<00:06:50.340> doesn't<00:06:50.940> have<00:06:51.090> aces<00:06:51.570> here

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
are he probably doesn't have aces here

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.620 
are he probably doesn't have aces here
and<00:06:51.990> if<00:06:52.560> you've<00:06:52.710> seen<00:06:52.920> in<00:06:53.100> the<00:06:53.190> past<00:06:53.370> at<00:06:54.330> this

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
and if you've seen in the past at this

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.170 
and if you've seen in the past at this
table<00:06:54.840> that<00:06:55.200> he's<00:06:55.440> three<00:06:56.190> bet<00:06:56.370> on<00:06:56.640> the<00:06:56.940> button

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
table that he's three bet on the button

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.790 
table that he's three bet on the button
before<00:06:57.330> well<00:06:58.050> he's<00:06:58.170> probably<00:06:58.290> just<00:06:58.560> three

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
before well he's probably just three

bettin<00:06:59.070> in<00:06:59.160> position<00:06:59.610> there<00:06:59.760> and<00:07:00.030> you<00:07:00.150> can

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
bettin in position there and you can

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.900 
bettin in position there and you can
shove<00:07:00.540> it<00:07:00.690> up<00:07:00.780> his<00:07:00.870> ass<00:07:00.930> with<00:07:01.350> those<00:07:01.440> nines

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
shove it up his ass with those nines

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.550 
shove it up his ass with those nines
totally<00:07:02.910> cool<00:07:03.090> so<00:07:03.810> see<00:07:03.990> how<00:07:04.020> that<00:07:04.290> your<00:07:04.380> game

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
totally cool so see how that your game

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.230 
totally cool so see how that your game
involves<00:07:05.070> when<00:07:05.220> you<00:07:05.310> start<00:07:05.550> thinking<00:07:05.700> up<00:07:06.000> over

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
involves when you start thinking up over

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.710 
involves when you start thinking up over
like<00:07:06.390> this<00:07:07.430> anyway<00:07:08.430> when<00:07:09.090> we<00:07:09.180> put<00:07:09.390> our<00:07:09.420> pulling

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
like this anyway when we put our pulling

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.770 
like this anyway when we put our pulling
on<00:07:09.870> a<00:07:09.900> range<00:07:10.170> we<00:07:10.800> can<00:07:10.980> play<00:07:11.600> against<00:07:12.600> that

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
on a range we can play against that

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.590 
on a range we can play against that
range<00:07:12.990> and<00:07:13.320> the<00:07:14.310> range<00:07:14.490> of<00:07:14.550> a<00:07:14.640> boss<00:07:14.820> block<00:07:15.120> or

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 
range and the range of a boss block or

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.330 
range and the range of a boss block or
the<00:07:15.660> range<00:07:16.200> of<00:07:16.350> possible<00:07:16.680> actions<00:07:16.860> that's

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
the range of possible actions that's

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.910 
the range of possible actions that's
that's<00:07:17.640> the<00:07:17.790> key<00:07:17.970> right<00:07:18.000> there<00:07:18.650> so<00:07:19.650> anyways

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:19.920 
that's the key right there so anyways

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.100 
that's the key right there so anyways
I'm<00:07:20.100> just<00:07:20.220> going<00:07:20.340> to<00:07:20.370> touch<00:07:20.670> on<00:07:20.850> this<00:07:21.110> concept

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110 
I'm just going to touch on this concept

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.500 
I'm just going to touch on this concept
of<00:07:22.530> continuous<00:07:23.310> ranges<00:07:23.850> just<00:07:24.240> real<00:07:24.690> three
