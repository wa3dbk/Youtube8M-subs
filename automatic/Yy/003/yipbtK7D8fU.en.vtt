00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 what's up, I'm still wing haven and os 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.330
 I bring the debate council for the first time 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.919
 fil 4 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 and is that as you see in the title before 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.460
 shoot you have to aim and as always 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.670
 we have our green friend to 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.350
 Guinea pig us the kind people came 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.539
 tonight it so as always 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.130
 let's put ourselves in situation and how many 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 times we will have passed that we see a 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.810
 enemy we started firing hip and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.460
 when we carry 34 bullets we aim and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.529
 As you can see we are not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.179
 giving a fucking bullet I think one of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.219
 the bullets has killed my family and the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.590
 another killed my dog ​​and there are many people 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.320
 that attacks this ned couto attacks this to 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 a problem with the weapon but what happens is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.250
 that only you give to implemented and it's 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.890
 that if you're shooting from hip and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.539
 then you aim the bullets as 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.489
 support as you can see they are going to 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.100
 basin so let's make a small 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.530
 try here the wall to stop it 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.890
 that you see it clear first we will point and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.719
 we will shoot so we will prepare about 30 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.000
 bullets for example and as you can see 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.890
 they all go more or less to the center more or 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 less and now from the same distance 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.670
 we will do the same but in reverse 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.390
 first we will shoot and then 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.820
 we will point 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.120
 and as you can see all the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.190
 bullets are gone they have gone to basin and 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.990
 this is why said above is 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.900
 that if we shoot first and then 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.090
 we aim the game understands that still 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.800
 we are firing from hip so 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.410
 basically the only thing to get is 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.380
 explore from hip but having the 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.970
 pointing animation so I 'm going to 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.650
 to do again so you can see more or 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.730
 minus how sad it can be 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.130
 the dispersion of the bullets 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.040
 or you can check if we have an enemy 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.590
 in the distance which we are shooting 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.300
 the safest thing that we will draw all the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.070
 silhouette but what is killing as well 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.150
 little we will do it in reverse 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.870
 we aim and shoot 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.870
 the difference is brutal as you are 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.750
 watching then there are a couple of ways 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.300
 to correct this let's say if first 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.730
 we shoot and then we aim you have 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.010
 two ways to shoot the first well 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.869
 of them is to make three or four micro 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.060
 bursts I tried to do just a couple 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.820
 and it does not work I think at least they are 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.320
 three for it to work and for the people 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.000
 that does not understand the micro bursts is 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.070
 to be with the mouse or with the command 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.420
 make a quick click so that I 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.190
 you understand and you have to do it between 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.920
 three and four times so let's go to 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.370
 try shoot we shoot from hip 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.780
 we aim and do the same bursts 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.250
 and how can you check then now 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.930
 that we are already shooting from hip and 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.310
 they are giving us all the bullets where 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.170
 should 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.480
 and the other way that is a bit more 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.060
 annoying or a little less effective 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.310
 it depends on how we look at it is that 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.670
 we have to stop firing during 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.020
 half second one second approximately 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.239
 so for you to get an idea 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.130
 let's do it we shoot we aim 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.930
 we stop shooting during medium 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.280
 video and we shoot again and as 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.670
 you can see then we are again 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.470
 firing shooting from hip so 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.840
 This is a problem that many people 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.730
 you will have found that so far as not 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.260
 it brings us the solution 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.299
 assigned this is the first time advice 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.970
 the first of many of course I hope 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.500
 that you liked this that is the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.560
 first and always for me it is the most 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.390
 important since it always says how 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.010
 will go the series assigned if you have 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.599
 some idea some old advice of which 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.190
 Would you like me to make a video 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.989
 leaving in the comments 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.760
 thank you very much for watching the video and we 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.480
 we see on another occasion people see you later 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.480
 bye 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.740
