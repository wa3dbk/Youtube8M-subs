00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
sparing with this because this can be

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.679 
sparing with this because this can be
drawing<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.660> your<00:00:27.840> hair<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:29.510> I'll<00:00:30.510> probably

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
drawing to your hair so I'll probably

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.650 
drawing to your hair so I'll probably
add<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.349> much<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.309> I'll<00:00:33.210> take<00:00:33.480> my

add just that much and I'll take my

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.170 
add just that much and I'll take my
leave<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.110> from<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.739> side<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:36.860> put

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
leave out from one side and just put

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.790 
leave out from one side and just put
that<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.410> side<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> part<00:00:42.800> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
that on to the one side of the part and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.950 
that on to the one side of the part and
then<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
then what I'm going to do which is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.270 
then what I'm going to do which is
probably<00:00:46.320> something<00:00:46.559> different<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.250> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
probably something different that you

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400 
probably something different that you
haven't<00:00:47.700> seen<00:00:47.879> people<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> love<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.289> do

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
haven't seen people do but I love to do

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.660 
haven't seen people do but I love to do
it<00:00:49.530> because<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.129> adds<00:00:50.309> texture<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:52.410> my<00:00:52.620> hair

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
it because it adds texture to my hair

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.860 
it because it adds texture to my hair
when<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:53.820> trying<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.360> blend<00:00:54.570> in

when I'm trying to blend in

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.610 
when I'm trying to blend in
I<00:00:54.899> will<00:00:55.199> braid<00:00:55.559> my<00:00:55.980> hair<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.050> when<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> braid<00:00:58.440> my

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
I will braid my hair and when I braid my

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.599 
I will braid my hair and when I braid my
hair<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.460> sure<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.030> start<00:01:00.449> my<00:01:00.719> braids

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
hair I make sure that I start my braids

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.760 
hair I make sure that I start my braids
kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.730> loose<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> started<00:01:05.040> pretty<00:01:05.280> loose

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
kind of loose so I started pretty loose

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.140 
kind of loose so I started pretty loose
and<00:01:08.510> then<00:01:09.860> sort<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.159> tighter<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> come

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630 
and then sort of get tighter as I come
down<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:13.229> makes<00:01:13.439> any<00:01:13.590> sense<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.580> I

and just twist it around the weave so
like<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.650> naturally<00:03:11.130> falling<00:03:11.550> over

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
like this one is naturally falling over

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.650 
like this one is naturally falling over
here<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.959> I'll<00:03:13.380> just<00:03:13.410> grab<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:14.400> piece<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.209> curl

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
here so I'll just grab a piece of a curl

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.920 
here so I'll just grab a piece of a curl
from<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.989> weave<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:18.090> kind<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.420> twist<00:03:18.660> it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
from the weave and just kind of twist it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.130 
from the weave and just kind of twist it
in<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.910> curl<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.670> sort<00:03:23.940> of

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
in to the curl so that it just sort of

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.620 
in to the curl so that it just sort of
goes<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.010> if<00:03:26.459> it's<00:03:26.640> not<00:03:26.790> enough<00:03:26.970> or<00:03:27.450> not<00:03:27.480> a

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
goes in and if it's not enough or not a

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.930 
goes in and if it's not enough or not a
long<00:03:27.930> enough<00:03:28.260> strand<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:29.400> might<00:03:29.610> have<00:03:29.790> to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
long enough strand you might have to

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.850 
long enough strand you might have to
find<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.360> different<00:03:30.540> piece<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.380> twist<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.800> into

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
find a different piece to twist it into

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.020 
find a different piece to twist it into
so<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.190> blends<00:03:35.489> really<00:03:36.209> well<00:03:38.030> and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
so that it blends really well and

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.120 
so that it blends really well and
sometimes<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.900> don't<00:03:40.200> even<00:03:40.410> do<00:03:40.770> too<00:03:40.980> much

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
sometimes I don't even do too much

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.830 
sometimes I don't even do too much
twisting<00:03:41.640> because<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.330> just<00:03:42.480> looks<00:03:42.750> more

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
twisting because it just looks more

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.900 
twisting because it just looks more
natural<00:03:43.140> without<00:03:43.770> doing<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:45.860> so<00:03:46.860> that's<00:03:47.519> one

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
natural without doing it so that's one

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.990 
natural without doing it so that's one
area<00:03:49.040> where<00:03:50.040> some<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.489> them<00:03:50.610> have<00:03:50.820> been

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
area where some of them have been

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.150 
area where some of them have been
comments<00:03:51.510> with<00:03:51.630> thin<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.080> some<00:03:52.350> not<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:55.160> then

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
comments with thin and some not and then

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.740 
comments with thin and some not and then
I'll<00:03:56.280> come<00:03:56.459> over<00:03:56.489> here<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.300> do<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.720> same

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
I'll come over here and do the same

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.590 
I'll come over here and do the same
thing<00:03:58.170> on<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.500> side<00:03:58.940> sorry<00:03:59.940> here<00:04:00.240> my<00:04:00.390> camera

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
thing on this side sorry here my camera

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.420 
thing on this side sorry here my camera
died<00:04:00.960> so<00:04:01.220> pretty

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
died so pretty

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.759 
died so pretty
I'll<00:04:02.670> do<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:02.970> same<00:04:03.150> thing<00:04:03.390> over<00:04:03.540> here<00:04:03.959> just

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
I'll do the same thing over here just

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.039 
I'll do the same thing over here just
sort<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.129> lay<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:06.000> figure<00:04:06.360> out<00:04:06.420> where<00:04:06.870> it

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
sort of lay it and figure out where it

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.509 
sort of lay it and figure out where it
will<00:04:07.260> look<00:04:07.409> best<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:08.159> then<00:04:09.060> just<00:04:09.420> start<00:04:09.720> to

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
will look best and then just start to

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.970 
will look best and then just start to
twist<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.700> in<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.599> extension<00:04:13.200> now<00:04:13.769> my

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
twist it in to the extension now my

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.219 
twist it in to the extension now my
extensions<00:04:14.549> are<00:04:14.730> not<00:04:14.909> dry<00:04:15.269> yet<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:15.840> they<00:04:15.989> are

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
extensions are not dry yet but they are

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.650 
extensions are not dry yet but they are
defined<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:19.820> normally<00:04:20.820> I'll<00:04:21.000> do<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:21.449> when

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
defined and normally I'll do this when

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.250 
defined and normally I'll do this when
they're<00:04:21.810> completely<00:04:22.320> dry<00:04:22.740> but<00:04:24.050> today<00:04:25.050> I'm

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
they're completely dry but today I'm

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.540 
they're completely dry but today I'm
just<00:04:25.290> doing<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:25.979> this<00:04:26.160> because<00:04:26.310> I'm

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
just doing it like this because I'm

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.000 
just doing it like this because I'm
short<00:04:26.820> on<00:04:26.910> time<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:30.690> will<00:04:30.960> show<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.560> clip

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
short on time but I will show you a clip

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.189 
short on time but I will show you a clip
at<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.250> end<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.729> picture<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.449> what<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:33.990> looks

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
at the end the picture of what it looks

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.010 
at the end the picture of what it looks
like<00:04:34.410> when<00:04:35.280> it's<00:04:35.460> fully<00:04:35.820> dry<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.479> everything

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
like when it's fully dry and everything

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.370 
like when it's fully dry and everything
is<00:04:37.610> blended<00:04:38.610> together<00:04:38.970> but<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:39.990> is<00:04:40.169> pretty

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
is blended together but this is pretty

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.939 
is blended together but this is pretty
much<00:04:40.650> what<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.370> blending<00:04:41.789> looks<00:04:42.060> like<00:04:42.949> when

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
much what the blending looks like when

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.939 
much what the blending looks like when
I'm<00:04:44.100> finished<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:45.090> like<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:45.990> said<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.289> don't<00:04:46.740> do

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
I'm finished and like I said I don't do

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.029 
I'm finished and like I said I don't do
a<00:04:46.979> whole<00:04:47.460> lot<00:04:47.789> I<00:04:48.090> kind<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.449> just<00:04:48.690> let<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.169> do<00:04:49.830> its

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
a whole lot I kind of just let it do its

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.370 
a whole lot I kind of just let it do its
thing<00:04:50.130> but<00:04:50.699> this<00:04:51.389> is<00:04:51.449> pretty<00:04:51.840> much<00:04:51.930> what<00:04:52.260> it'll

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
thing but this is pretty much what it'll

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.350 
thing but this is pretty much what it'll
look<00:04:52.440> like<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.039> I'll<00:04:53.270> put<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.650> clip<00:04:55.650> in<00:04:55.889> it

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
look like and I'll put a clip in it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.830 
look like and I'll put a clip in it
at<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.600> end<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.199> can<00:04:58.530> see<00:04:58.860> exactly<00:04:59.840> what

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
at the end so you can see exactly what

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.469 
at the end so you can see exactly what
this<00:05:01.020> hair<00:05:01.320> looks<00:05:01.590> like<00:05:01.800> when<00:05:02.430> it's<00:05:02.580> dry<00:05:03.060> I

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
this hair looks like when it's dry I

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.330 
this hair looks like when it's dry I
have<00:05:04.229> dyed<00:05:04.500> this<00:05:04.860> hair<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:06.050> purple<00:05:07.050> so<00:05:07.530> I<00:05:07.979> know

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
have dyed this hair and purple so I know

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.850 
have dyed this hair and purple so I know
it's<00:05:08.580> pretty<00:05:08.760> not<00:05:09.210> pretty<00:05:09.240> black<00:05:09.990> but<00:05:10.380> like<00:05:10.770> I

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
it's pretty not pretty black but like I

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.440 
it's pretty not pretty black but like I
said<00:05:10.919> when<00:05:11.250> it<00:05:11.370> dries<00:05:11.610> and<00:05:11.880> it's<00:05:12.030> in<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.240> light

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
said when it dries and it's in the light

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.110 
said when it dries and it's in the light
you'll<00:05:12.690> be<00:05:12.810> able<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.080> see<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.410> color<00:05:13.650> as<00:05:13.860> well

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
you'll be able to see the color as well

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.450 
you'll be able to see the color as well
