00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.849
 dust falls and blows is a 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.429
 silicone housing are very cheap very 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.890

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.140

 the casing that I have today is 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.570
 also a simpler housing 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.689
 for falls we're going to take it off so that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.610
 you see the casing has already a 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.670
 a little bit damaged 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.170

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.860
 an external protection of pasta and a 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.090
 basically internal rubber protection 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.380
 this protects it a little from the boxes 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.150
 then we are going to do here in a boxing 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.070

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.510
 Case 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.840

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.030
 dust protection 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.580
 is the dust protection 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.530
 the internal protection to advertising 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.100

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.440
 galaxy s3 and 93 doubles 0 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.360

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.110
 we'll see 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.270
 in what way do we sometimes speak here now 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.480
 I have no idea 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.780
 let's see so now what to follow 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.010
 removing this external lining here I have 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.010
 We put the eggs again 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.790
 ready has cell phone fits perfectly 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.500
 now let's put this through 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.900
 good as you will see I have already put the protector 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.690
 externally as you will see it is very robust if 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.740
 we compare with the previous one that I had 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.220
 in before 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.770
 the difference of great 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.989

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.290
 against falls 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.770

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.190
 protector that is for dust 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.639
 we see this protector as really 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.639
 A) Yes

 with an amazing carcass great I know what 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.120

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.870
 worry about any fall this 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.840
