pedal over is a tone bender from the 70s
and<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.820> actually<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> muff<00:01:09.360> style<00:01:09.690> circuit

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
and it's actually a muff style circuit

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.170 
and it's actually a muff style circuit
it<00:01:10.440> was<00:01:10.560> called<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.890> color<00:01:11.369> sound<00:01:11.640> supa<00:01:12.000> tone

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it was called the color sound supa tone

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.090 
it was called the color sound supa tone
bender<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.720> people<00:01:13.590> might<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.740> heard<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.009> on

late Genesis sorry like Gabriel a
orogenesis<00:01:16.320> steve<00:01:16.770> hackett<00:01:16.950> played<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> lot

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
orogenesis steve hackett played it a lot

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.910 
orogenesis steve hackett played it a lot
it's<00:01:18.660> an<00:01:18.750> interesting<00:01:18.930> they're<00:01:19.590> both<00:01:19.740> kind

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
it's an interesting they're both kind

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.260 
it's an interesting they're both kind
interesting<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.399> their<00:01:20.759> tone<00:01:21.030> knobs

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
interesting in that their tone knobs

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.999 
interesting in that their tone knobs
take<00:01:21.509> them<00:01:21.690> through<00:01:21.930> very<00:01:22.680> separate

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
take them through very separate

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.770 
take them through very separate
territories<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:23.910> from<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> base<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
territories when you go from the base to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.029 
territories when you go from the base to
the<00:01:24.810> mid<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.170> treble<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.890> they're

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
the mid to the treble and so they're

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.520 
the mid to the treble and so they're
kind<00:01:26.190> of<00:01:26.310> versatile<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.910> voice<00:01:27.539> fuzz<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
kind of versatile as voice fuzz is you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.480 
kind of versatile as voice fuzz is you
can<00:01:28.649> use<00:01:28.770> them<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.039> lot<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.190> different

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
can use them in a lot of different

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
can use them in a lot of different
contexts<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.330> fuzz<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.899> fuzzy<00:01:31.140> face

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
contexts that one fuzz like a fuzzy face

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.540 
contexts that one fuzz like a fuzzy face
circuit<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:31.800> instance<00:01:32.070> might<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.369> function

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
circuit for instance might not function

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.290 
circuit for instance might not function
and<00:01:32.940> well<00:01:33.360> all<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.000> they're<00:01:36.000> also<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
and well all of them and they're also a

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.400 
and well all of them and they're also a
little<00:01:36.479> bit<00:01:36.660> easier<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.170> along<00:01:37.259> with

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
little bit easier to get along with

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.870 
little bit easier to get along with
other<00:01:37.649> pedals<00:01:38.039> so<00:01:38.220> we're<00:01:38.340> trying<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> find

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
other pedals so we're trying to find

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.340 
other pedals so we're trying to find
some<00:01:39.030> fuzz<00:01:39.240> circuits<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.720> people<00:01:40.050> who<00:01:40.140> don't

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
some fuzz circuits that people who don't

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.139 
some fuzz circuits that people who don't
necessarily<00:01:40.410> want<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> dive<00:01:41.130> deep<00:01:41.369> into<00:01:41.580> using

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
necessarily want to dive deep into using

guitar<00:01:42.479> fuzz<00:01:42.630> amp<00:01:42.959> setups<00:01:43.350> could<00:01:44.160> use<00:01:44.310> on

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
guitar fuzz amp setups could use on

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:45.710 
guitar fuzz amp setups could use on
pedal<00:01:44.670> boards<00:01:44.910> that<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.090> their<00:01:45.300> stuff<00:01:45.450> going

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
pedal boards that have their stuff going

pedal boards that have their stuff going
on<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:47.039> cool<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.310> Doug's<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.330> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
on on it very cool and Doug's going to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.859 
on on it very cool and Doug's going to
show<00:01:48.899> us<00:01:49.020> ceza<00:01:49.520> starting<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.720> one

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
show us ceza starting with the which one

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.780 
warm and sort of woody tone in the first
third<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.739> sweep<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.099> the<00:02:55.159> tone<00:02:55.370> dial<00:02:55.609> and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
third of the sweep of the tone dial and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.459 
third of the sweep of the tone dial and
then<00:02:55.879> you<00:02:55.969> get<00:02:56.060> into<00:02:56.209> more<00:02:56.390> open<00:02:56.719> sort<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:57.019> what

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.469 
then you get into more open sort of what

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.289 
then you get into more open sort of what
I<00:02:57.500> think<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.799> was<00:02:57.920> like<00:02:58.549> sort<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.849> barking

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
I think it was like sort of a barking

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.000 
I think it was like sort of a barking
kind<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.659> tone<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.019> germanium<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.680> make<00:03:00.829> and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
kind of tone that germanium can make and

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.679 
kind of tone that germanium can make and
then<00:03:01.129> when<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.640> get<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> tone<00:03:02.299> up<00:03:02.480> in<00:03:02.629> the

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
then when you get the tone up in the

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.089 
then when you get the tone up in the
gain<00:03:02.870> up<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.200> really<00:03:03.379> just<00:03:03.500> pushes<00:03:03.829> the<00:03:03.950> high

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
gain up it really just pushes the high

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.289 
gain up it really just pushes the high
end<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.459> if<00:03:04.549> you<00:03:04.640> have<00:03:04.790> any<00:03:04.819> app<00:03:05.060> that's

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
end and if you have any app that's

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.759 
end and if you have any app that's
that's<00:03:05.689> sweet<00:03:06.019> up<00:03:06.170> there<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:06.500> can<00:03:06.620> really
