so what you do now is these lower

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.390 
so what you do now is these lower
Springs<00:05:52.300> you'll<00:05:52.509> slide<00:05:52.780> them<00:05:52.990> on<00:05:53.080> here<00:05:53.400> and

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
Springs you'll slide them on here and

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.550 
Springs you'll slide them on here and
then<00:05:55.389> then<00:05:55.599> we're<00:05:55.750> going<00:05:55.840> to<00:05:55.930> you<00:05:56.319> going<00:05:56.500> to

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
right I got it now normally these

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.460 
right I got it now normally these
bushings<00:06:03.370> would<00:06:03.610> go<00:06:03.789> in<00:06:04.060> here<00:06:04.629> right<00:06:05.409> now

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
bushings would go in here right now

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.559 
bushings would go in here right now
we're<00:06:05.830> mocking<00:06:06.039> this<00:06:06.430> up<00:06:06.669> you<00:06:06.970> know<00:06:07.120> we're<00:06:07.479> not

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
we're mocking this up you know we're not

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.210 
we're mocking this up you know we're not
doing<00:06:07.900> final<00:06:08.259> assembly<00:06:08.530> so<00:06:08.830> I'm<00:06:08.889> gonna<00:06:09.009> pull

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
doing final assembly so I'm gonna pull

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.529 
doing final assembly so I'm gonna pull
these<00:06:09.370> out<00:06:09.550> right<00:06:09.789> now<00:06:09.970> I<00:06:10.000> just<00:06:10.060> want<00:06:10.240> to<00:06:10.360> show

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
these out right now I just want to show

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.480 
these out right now I just want to show
you<00:06:10.599> this<00:06:10.840> go<00:06:11.440> ahead<00:06:11.620> and<00:06:11.740> slide<00:06:11.979> that<00:06:12.159> up<00:06:12.340> in

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
you this go ahead and slide that up in

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.029 
you this go ahead and slide that up in
there<00:06:12.699> and<00:06:12.909> then<00:06:13.840> these<00:06:14.229> would<00:06:14.530> fit<00:06:14.560> up<00:06:14.889> in

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
there and then these would fit up in

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.350 
there and then these would fit up in
there<00:06:15.190> like<00:06:15.220> that<00:06:15.370> Holly<00:06:15.819> and<00:06:16.060> then<00:06:16.150> what<00:06:16.270> we

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
there like that Holly and then what we

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.510 
there like that Holly and then what we
have<00:06:16.629> to<00:06:16.780> do<00:06:16.960> is<00:06:17.199> these<00:06:17.349> top<00:06:17.590> springs<00:06:17.979> ago<00:06:18.159> one

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
have to do is these top springs ago one

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.129 
have to do is these top springs ago one
we<00:06:18.669> have<00:06:18.789> to<00:06:18.879> be<00:06:19.030> get<00:06:19.419> a<00:06:19.449> big<00:06:19.659> clamp<00:06:19.990> and

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
we have to be get a big clamp and

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.260 
we have to be get a big clamp and
compress<00:06:20.560> all<00:06:20.830> this<00:06:21.069> it's<00:06:21.699> kind<00:06:21.940> of<00:06:22.000> tough<00:06:22.180> to

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
compress all this it's kind of tough to

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.850 
compress all this it's kind of tough to
do<00:06:22.539> on<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:22.840> lift<00:06:23.050> because<00:06:23.319> you<00:06:23.530> got<00:06:23.680> to<00:06:23.770> do<00:06:23.830> a

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
do on the lift because you got to do a

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.700 
do on the lift because you got to do a
lot<00:06:24.069> of<00:06:24.099> pressure<00:06:24.400> with<00:06:24.610> this<00:06:24.849> and<00:06:25.469> right<00:06:26.469> here

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
lot of pressure with this and right here

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.309 
lot of pressure with this and right here
okay<00:06:27.159> it<00:06:27.940> takes<00:06:28.180> a<00:06:28.270> lot<00:06:28.419> of<00:06:28.449> work<00:06:28.659> in<00:06:28.900> order<00:06:29.139> for

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
okay it takes a lot of work in order for

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.570 
okay it takes a lot of work in order for
us<00:06:29.349> to<00:06:29.469> do<00:06:29.710> this<00:06:29.860> we're<00:06:30.009> going<00:06:30.099> to<00:06:30.159> continue<00:06:30.340> to

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
us to do this we're going to continue to

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.070 
us to do this we're going to continue to
work<00:06:30.669> on<00:06:30.909> this<00:06:31.030> bike<00:06:31.270> but<00:06:31.780> we're<00:06:31.930> going<00:06:32.020> to
