00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.280
 and good to all a greeting to those who 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.590
 are you guys how are you then nothing like 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.570
 you see many is happening to me has 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.909
 I was also passing up how good 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.879
 I saw a video they had tricks that was 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.260
 great and that I did this method to 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.239
 the first one and it worked for me and 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.190
 it works perfectly well as well 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.129
 you know many are giving us problems 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.110
 to enter the online agreement then 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.899
 there is a very simple trick very simple 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.010
 very simple that is the following worth if 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.010
 you notice when we try to enter 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.110
 online, look at the orange ball that 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.270
 it's down on the right it's going to 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.050
 stay when we are going to go into error 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.009
 it's orange, there you go to see it 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.550
 notice that it is stinging turns in 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.080
 orange is worth it when this happens 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.850
 after this we will throw away the error 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.190
 telling us how good we can not 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.069
 find a session to me has put me 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.720
 until installing all the gta and back 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.250
 I installed it then so that some 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.560
 do not pass that to you and do not have to do what 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.659
 same what we will have to do is what 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.539
 next ok we will throw it back to 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.610
 gta 5 to the story mode then we 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.440
 we will come and we will place over 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.870
 from where we want to enter if I want 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.510
 enter a session 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.130
 I'm going to place over here and I'm going to 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.870
 stay there and then what are we going to 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.400
 have to do is remove the cable from 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.860
 network of our router simply 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.320
 disconnect and reconnect 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.330
 valero the principal but how is and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.160
 the yellow for example then at 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.260
 remove and reconnect us 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.940
 will come out that message of found us 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.070
 internet cable and then it will go back to 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.140
 connect only see session started and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.510
 started then once it has 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.660
 reconnected us put that decision 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.920
 started again to enter where 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.780
 we want to enter the session by 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.060
 invitation for example and note that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.640
 nothing else start the ball will change 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.500
 orange to white ball is worth this 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.750
 means that not anymore so we're going to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.310
 can enter in agreement 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.130
 it's a very simple way a very trick 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.040
 simple as I say only via 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.990
 there were tricks and of course for sure 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.120
 you have to give merit to the person you have 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.830
 seen things is worth it so I do not expect anything 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.020
 that at least you serve as a 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.390
 he has served me and those who better 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.830
 They are nervous and worried because we 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.810
 you can connect to online you can 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.489
 solve in this way so nothing 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.140
 See you guys in the next video 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.620
 a greeting and how 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.400
 forever 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.400
 as flag
