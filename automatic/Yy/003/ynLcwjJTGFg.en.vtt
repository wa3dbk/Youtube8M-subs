00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
your body gets immune to that vitamin so

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.360

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
hair because every time I straighten it

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.679 
hair because every time I straighten it
it<00:04:08.530> gets<00:04:08.709> tangled<00:04:09.069> in<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.669> end<00:04:09.759> but<00:04:10.239> if<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.449> put

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
it gets tangled in the end but if I put

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.020 
it gets tangled in the end but if I put
that<00:04:10.870> in<00:04:11.049> my<00:04:11.199> hair<00:04:11.409> before<00:04:11.590> hand<00:04:12.099> I<00:04:12.370> can<00:04:12.849> run<00:04:12.969> my

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
that in my hair before hand I can run my

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.180 
that in my hair before hand I can run my
hand<00:04:13.359> through

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
hand through

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.030 
hand through
and<00:04:14.280> it's<00:04:14.490> just<00:04:14.610> smooth<00:04:15.300> so<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.380> believe<00:04:16.890> in

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
and it's just smooth so I believe in

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.500 
and it's just smooth so I believe in
this<00:04:17.190> product<00:04:17.519> I<00:04:17.850> do<00:04:17.910> even<00:04:18.209> though<00:04:18.390> it's

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
this product I do even though it's

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.350 
this product I do even though it's
really<00:04:18.660> expensive<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.620> whatnot<00:04:19.950> but<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.610> think

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
really expensive and whatnot but I think

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.990 
really expensive and whatnot but I think
that<00:04:21.510> if<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:21.690> want<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.320> silky<00:04:23.100> smooth<00:04:23.370> hair<00:04:23.730> and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
that if you want a silky smooth hair and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.900 
that if you want a silky smooth hair and
not<00:04:24.150> shiny<00:04:24.540> or<00:04:24.840> whatever<00:04:25.230> get<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.400> this

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
not shiny or whatever get this this

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.450 
not shiny or whatever get this this
really<00:04:27.540> works<00:04:27.810> except<00:04:28.680> for<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.920> smell<00:04:29.190> the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
really works except for the smell the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.890 
really works except for the smell the
smell<00:04:29.730> isn't<00:04:29.910> great<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.300> smells<00:04:30.420> like<00:04:30.630> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
smell isn't great it smells like the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.630 
smell isn't great it smells like the

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
everything but that was the only time

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.840 
everything but that was the only time
that<00:05:00.360> I<00:05:00.570> ever<00:05:00.930> put<00:05:01.440> any<00:05:01.890> product<00:05:02.520> in<00:05:02.670> my<00:05:02.820> hair

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
that I ever put any product in my hair

that I ever put any product in my hair

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
and I think that reason itself is why my

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.590 
and I think that reason itself is why my
hair<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.100> much<00:05:08.310> more<00:05:08.340> healthier<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.270> not
