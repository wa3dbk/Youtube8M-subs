00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 ramos 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.140
 you are a black hole family mongrel dog 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.480
 black hole studio 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.490
 fuck everything else you know I'm not talking 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.640
 often of life but this time it takes 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.640
 come on 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.280
 and always the usual bastard dog if you 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.870
 had I opened an account inside the soul e 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.480
 of a pro in all my against that 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.030
 encloses in a quick tear and the 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.580
 life as steep and this climb too 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.120
 until I have a voice while I live mine 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.310
 challenge is a bad thing to cry for laughter but 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.740
 before those few good moments of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.990
 stability make us accountable 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.330
 to be dead from the beginning and it is not that 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.150
 I'm pessimistic is that I 'm alive 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.280
 understand me or choose to pretend to 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.950
 ignore miming fire my grit 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.259
 while another asshole first under the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.660
 eyes of people eluded by life 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.229
 expect the abyss an asshole that they 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.660
 spinga dreams not let you stop maria 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.180
 the lives of those who manage to live it it 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.640
 meanwhile I will write while I pass a 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.619
 year another year in which you understand who 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.619
 there are those who leave while others leave 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.369
 no 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.980
 you who say and fight for what 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.860
 you will want those real unrealizable dreams 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.110
 if you will and do not always be sad 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.370
 if life hurts heavily 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.980
 still open 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.050
 make you stronger and sometimes not 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.630
 I distinguish what is right but basically 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.050
 better this than to classify all the 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.570
 rest 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.270
 and now the waste more serious subjects 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.990
 for people who don't really see that 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.900
 what are you and I would like to give me strength you know 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.690
 but the soul is extinguished now alive without 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.510
 she but I thank my star I shine 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.660
 together with her and if I look at her I see 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.000
 same eyes of mine and I would do a thousand things but 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.459
 still not enough for me to trample the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.550
 same land where they are born then 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:03.190
 they cry when I return to them 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.190
 plan when they won't return 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.659
 no
