00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
the PlayStation 4 I mean what am I to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.910

say<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:24.250> don't<00:01:24.520> want<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.729> make<00:01:24.819> any<00:01:25.030> assumptions

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
say I don't want to make any assumptions

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.370 
say I don't want to make any assumptions
but<00:01:26.920> we<00:01:27.130> all<00:01:27.340> know<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:27.640> Xbox<00:01:28.630> one<00:01:28.929> didn't

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
but we all know that Xbox one didn't

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.900 
but we all know that Xbox one didn't
have<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.590> really<00:01:30.479> superior<00:01:31.950> start<00:01:32.950> compared<00:01:33.640> to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
have a really superior start compared to

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.900 
have a really superior start compared to
the<00:01:34.149> PlayStation<00:01:34.780> 4<00:01:35.080> but<00:01:35.429> they<00:01:36.429> fix<00:01:36.729> some

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
the PlayStation 4 but they fix some

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.570 
the PlayStation 4 but they fix some
things<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:38.590> then<00:01:38.739> people<00:01:38.979> kind<00:01:39.310> of<00:01:39.399> got<00:01:39.550> a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
things but then people kind of got a

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.089 
things but then people kind of got a
little<00:01:39.849> aggravated<00:01:40.390> about<00:01:41.289> how<00:01:41.500> they<00:01:41.709> fixed

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
little aggravated about how they fixed

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.010 
little aggravated about how they fixed
it<00:01:42.160> because<00:01:42.489> they<00:01:42.670> felt<00:01:42.970> that<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.630> was<00:01:43.840> only

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
it because they felt that it was only

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.699 
it because they felt that it was only
because<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:45.239> loss<00:01:46.239> of<00:01:46.479> pre-orders<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.560> loss

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
because of loss of pre-orders and loss

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.580 
because of loss of pre-orders and loss
of<00:01:47.860> sales<00:01:48.099> for<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.789> future<00:01:49.209> etc<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.989> not

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
of sales for the future etc and not

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.990 
of sales for the future etc and not
really<00:01:50.860> for<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.099> gamers<00:01:51.489> and<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.729> players

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
really for the gamers and the players

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.949 
really for the gamers and the players
etc<00:01:52.209> so<00:01:53.910> that's<00:01:54.910> what<00:01:55.209> kind<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.539> pissed<00:01:55.750> people

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
etc so that's what kind of pissed people

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.380 
etc so that's what kind of pissed people
off<00:01:56.259> because<00:01:56.709> they<00:01:56.950> knew<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.580> they're<00:01:58.119> pretty

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
off because they knew and they're pretty

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.359 
off because they knew and they're pretty
sure<00:01:58.660> that<00:01:58.899> Microsoft<00:01:59.440> only<00:01:59.739> did<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.039> because

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
sure that Microsoft only did it because

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.109 
sure that Microsoft only did it because
of<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.580> whole<00:02:00.759> cells<00:02:01.720> taking<00:02:02.379> a<00:02:02.470> big<00:02:02.679> dive

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
of the whole cells taking a big dive

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.749 
of the whole cells taking a big dive
compared<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.360> Sony<00:02:04.660> with<00:02:05.619> PlayStation<00:02:06.520> 4

compared to Sony with PlayStation 4

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.660 
compared to Sony with PlayStation 4
booming<00:02:07.239> right<00:02:07.569> but<00:02:08.289> it<00:02:08.379> seems<00:02:08.679> like<00:02:08.950> now<00:02:08.979> they

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
booming right but it seems like now they
