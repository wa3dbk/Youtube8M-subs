will surprise people the most is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
will surprise people the most is
actually<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> volume<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.560> stuff<00:00:34.770> that's<00:00:35.070> real

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.640 
actually the volume of stuff that's real
as<00:00:36.720> opposed<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:37.200> they<00:00:37.380> might<00:00:37.530> have

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
as opposed to what they might have

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.090 
as opposed to what they might have
thought<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:37.920> digital<00:00:39.140> because<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.830> know<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
thought was digital because you know the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.890 
thought was digital because you know the
place<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.460> stuffed<00:00:42.240> with<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.810> also

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
place is just stuffed with it and also

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.220 
place is just stuffed with it and also
the<00:00:43.140> fact<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.500> everything<00:00:44.220> is<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.670> detailed

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
the fact that everything is so detailed

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.870 
the fact that everything is so detailed
on<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.290> movie<00:00:46.680> very<00:00:46.860> often<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> compromise<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
on a movie very often you compromise the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.010 
on a movie very often you compromise the
finish<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.240> things<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.660> don't<00:00:48.840> need

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
finish of things because you don't need

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.720 
finish of things because you don't need
to<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.320> certain<00:00:49.530> things<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.040> close<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.610> all

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to see certain things so close and all

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.960 
to see certain things so close and all
of<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.150> Don<00:00:51.900> Potter<00:00:52.140> from<00:00:52.410> day<00:00:52.560> one

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
of that and Don Potter from day one

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.920 
of that and Don Potter from day one
everything<00:00:53.970> was<00:00:54.120> designed<00:00:54.450> to<00:00:54.540> be<00:00:54.600> seen<00:00:54.840> in

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
everything was designed to be seen in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
everything was designed to be seen in
close-up<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.710> hyper<00:00:55.950> real<00:00:56.310> and<00:00:56.579> so

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
close-up and to be hyper real and so

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.430 
close-up and to be hyper real and so
when<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.420> come<00:00:57.570> around<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.900> get<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.110> benefit

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
when you come around you get the benefit

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.830 
when you come around you get the benefit
of<00:00:58.470> that<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.850> great<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.149> they're<00:01:00.720> not

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
of that it's so great that they're not

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
of that it's so great that they're not
wanting<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.560> be<00:01:01.620> boxed<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.160> most<00:01:02.310> things

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
under close scrutiny you know we see it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.770 
under close scrutiny you know we see it
whizzed<00:01:23.670> by<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.120> film<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.720> can

take it in I think that's surprising and
I<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.790> saw<00:01:29.970> how<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> things<00:01:31.260> were

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560 
I just saw how some of the things were
created<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> some<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.240> tricks

not<00:01:45.210> also<00:01:46.210> they<00:01:46.509> can<00:01:46.540> go<00:01:47.049> on<00:01:47.400> broomsticks<00:01:48.400> and

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
not also they can go on broomsticks and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.370 
not also they can go on broomsticks and
get<00:01:48.670> involved<00:01:49.270> interactive<00:01:49.900> stuff<00:01:50.080> so<00:01:50.259> they

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
get involved interactive stuff so they

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.880 
get involved interactive stuff so they
can<00:01:50.530> know<00:01:50.560> what<00:01:50.770> feels<00:01:51.009> like<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:52.060> fly<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:53.500> a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
can know what feels like to fly as a

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.330 
can know what feels like to fly as a
witch<00:01:54.159> or<00:01:54.369> was<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.640> um<00:01:54.820> what<00:01:55.360> else<00:01:56.310> does<00:01:57.310> she

scale<00:01:57.880> of<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.330> mean<00:01:58.689> I<00:01:58.750> forget<00:01:59.080> his<00:01:59.290> own<00:01:59.560> but

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
scale of it I mean I forget his own but

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:00.930 
scale of it I mean I forget his own but
I<00:01:59.830> remember<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.190> first<00:02:00.310> time<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.580> walked<00:02:00.700> in

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
I remember the first time I walked in

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.100 
I remember the first time I walked in
and<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.210> what<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.509> didn't<00:02:01.659> even<00:02:01.750> look<00:02:01.869> it's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
and it what it didn't even look it's

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.960 
and it what it didn't even look it's
kind<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.289> sleek<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.680> nice<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:03.070> but<00:02:03.820> just

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
kind of sleek and nice this but just

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.510 
kind of sleek and nice this but just
walking<00:02:04.330> around<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.690> was<00:02:04.780> up<00:02:04.869> what<00:02:05.740> I'm<00:02:06.130> never

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
walking around I was up what I'm never

take so long to make it's not like
people<00:02:36.519> are<00:02:37.239> being<00:02:37.390> lazy<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:37.959> like<00:02:38.140> there

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319

whatever<00:02:48.220> yeah<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.940> mean<00:02:49.269> it's<00:02:50.049> not<00:02:50.230> really<00:02:50.500> one

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
whatever yeah I mean it's not really one

whatever yeah I mean it's not really one
item<00:02:51.070> as<00:02:51.190> such<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.910> collective<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.480> all

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
it's a computer it's a lot easier to do

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.780 
it's a computer it's a lot easier to do
that<00:03:08.109> way<00:03:08.380> but<00:03:08.440> it's<00:03:08.859> not<00:03:09.070> someone<00:03:09.430> spent
