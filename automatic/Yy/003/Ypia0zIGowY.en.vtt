00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.080
 to the question 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.420
 we would like to address professor carla 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.420
 profit is exactly that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.920
 expresses the company 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.690
 or even it is capable of constraining 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.000
 the company 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.480
 in a nutshell one is possible 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.320
 architecture also valid in a company 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 contradictory 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.649
 no one could understand how to do it anymore 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.340
 to build an architect so 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.469
 whole wheat 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 if it does not say integrating it into many pieces 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.680
 different but this then and just 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.300
 contrary to the value of his 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.339
 bis architectures is just the idea of 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.059
 build politically in a unitary way 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.059
 the things 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.460
 the only Italian is actually still today 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.490
 a sole in upi form turi that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.170
 even then maybe it will come out 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.670
 some architect have done it all 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.280
 spontaneous 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.590
 I think that by now the huge digit gap 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.289
 anointing of Italian physics and the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.090
 Western culture 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.720
 an initial needs to form the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.720
 architects 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.870
 I recommend to students that when 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.680
 they must design something they must 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.320
 first of all to understand the place so I would say 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.730
 take a chair and stand where it is 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.020
 the building they are going to stand will rise 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.930
 planning and thinking and thinking 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.280
 say listen because you understand a place 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.400
 it means gathering the voices of the place 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.520
 which may be his story 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.520
 consistency its beauty when there is 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.420
 but it is a shortcut to 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.000
 teach students what they need 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.160
 choose they must do it 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.210
 alone 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.890
 of course it's a bit like throwing one 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.530
 person in the water who cannot swim 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.670
 drowning, however, if someone too 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.880
 who can learn to be giving if 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.280
 learn from it if you learn it deeply 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.280
 learn in such a way as not to forget it 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.069
 to build is the oldest bet 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.090
 of man together with discovering at the 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.620
 navigate to cultivate the noblest fields 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.540
 the profession of the architect is 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.989
 well done to do well to do well 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.440
 you have to understand and listen is an art 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.120
 complex that will scott it is difficult 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.280
 because often the voices of those who 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.500
 have more things to say are discrete and 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.850
 subtle listening is not obeying 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.150
 listening is not finding compromise 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.740
 listen try to understand and then do 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:30.190
 million projects do for others yes 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.960
 he used to say to do the common good 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.110
 one must always remember that he will do of 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.889
 vegetable means building buildings for 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.889
 people universities museums schools rises 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.690
 for concerts they are all places that 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.289
 become outposts against 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.289
 the barbarism 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:57.770
 making beauty is a word or at least 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:05:00.629
 try the beauty is impregnable 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.029
 stretch out your hand but run away 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.339
 defines how the Greeks did and then 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:09.389
 everything becomes possible 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:11.639
 beauty is the utility put together 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.479
 they win the formalism win 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.479
 the academy
