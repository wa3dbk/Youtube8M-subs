00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.859
 to finish 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.880
 the birth of a calf to the press a symbolic character for a country 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 scored an essay a year eventually this actually in the canton of zurich 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.170
 with the resumption of operations in the coming months 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.120
 it is indeed a new era that is announced for this young farmer 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.970
 newly graduated 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.699
 even if he does not intend as he says himself to turn everything upside down 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.629
 rimouski allowed to set clear objectives especially in the field of 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.160
 milk production 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.839
 whistled by the referee m 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.839
 certainly cows with good longevity 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.480
 an average of the tables from 8500 to 9000 kilos 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.490
 4% fat and three more than 5% protein 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 a goal that I was a bit of a pain to currently reach allard 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.360
 thomas stallman 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.100
 but who is himself a farmer and technical adviser to the lighthouse leeds to 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.170
 reach this goal 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.480
 the more fade and false hageman info system that's been in use for five years 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.190
 by the technical service of the lighthouse 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.460
 serves as a basis for establishing a fund plan quickly for cows 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.880
 dairy 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.280
 and they do what the fake corresponds to the basic ration that the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.820
 cows consented 6 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.290
 it means optimizing the different components 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.960
 which form the basic ration 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.440
 so that the microorganisms of the belly has 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.560
 an optimal environment 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230
 it is the base of everything 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.360
 and that's what fake does 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.570
 on this farm we try to comply with this principle in 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.630
 making the necessary calculations Article 5 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.840
 the calculations do not just take into account as was the case until 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.780
 screen the supply of nutrients are distant 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.870
 but especially different proportions quickly available from 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.770
 putrescible organic substances 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.420
 fermentable so-called fake forage declarations 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.840
 we obtain thaÃ§i an additional indication on the speed of the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.900
 degradation of the different components senergis ticket protein 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.660
 the mixed ration beetle be adapted precisely and the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.430
 natural performance of rumen activity without having to consent to 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.639
 extraordinary efforts 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.090
 frÃ©maux stirling uses firmer support as an instrument of 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.089
 check for false calculations 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.900
 thomas stallman can download directly from the database 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.090
 of the breeding federations concerned all the results concerning the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.450
 milk control of the spirits grove operation it is integrated with the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.719
 chs management system 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.809
 benmosche who had received in time following paris but an interpretation of 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.290
 analysis with practical tips to fodder mans 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.410
 as well as advice on the measures to be taken with regard to 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.919
 problem animals 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.169
 and I draw stallman stomachs meet about four times a year 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.539
 on the farm 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.360
 if I see you it's the only cow that is shifted up 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.550
 but for the rest the distribution and balanced with respect to the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.889
 performance level 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.499
 that means that with a performance food we do not have the 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.499
 situation in the presence of a critical ration mow 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:10.060
 this is obvious on this exploitation the two men who is at 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.259
 the same rope they are also open for critical remarks 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.249
 and this is necessary because such collaboration can also 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.149
 have consequences on off-piste forage production it 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:22.470
 must blow 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.590
 for the left that relay things are clear in the future the advice of 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.699
 thomas stallman and the system is hs 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.429
 they will continue to be an integral part of its management system 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.579
 herd 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.019
 thomas stallman does not concede very well 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.790
 I really enjoy talking to him and I intend to 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.790
 continue to progress with the authorities for all countries 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:42.689
 it is that
