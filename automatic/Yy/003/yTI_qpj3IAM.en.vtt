 this is a 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.229
 a community aquarium could be said 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.939

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.590
 large aquarium in which I can put 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.590
 up to five couples 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.490

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:57.050

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.889
 and feed them and touch 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.889

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.310
 today you can see 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.310

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:45.060

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.060

 these are the juvenile males too 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:55.100
 still too small to produce they will have 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.100
