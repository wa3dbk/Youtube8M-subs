00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.090
 if I'm sorry I'm so sorry because 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.410
 unfortunately accidents that happen though 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.369
 he didn't want us right now because 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.509
 however, I think it remains a bit behind 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.949
 that there is plenty of time to recover 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.650
 I'm pretty serene here makes me 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.430
 still like the words that so many 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.949
 my companions spent on me though 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.210
 I always work with the utmost serenity e 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.399
 because anyway the championship would be it 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.670
 we know it's hard for a few years 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.480
 that we do it so I don't feel any 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.600
 responsibility rather they are available 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.960
 of the coach and the team and I try to 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 put my qualities 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.940
 in the group I found a group of 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.480
 really great guys where like 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.579
 they made me feel immediately at ease 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.610
 but there were no problems because so many 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.259
 already we knew each other and this is me 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.340
 I am certainly pleased 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.140
 start point 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.670
 I always gave myself the answer 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.689
 everyone has what they deserve in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 in life it means probably 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.530
 I grew up too late though 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.979
 we are here hoping to reach the first one 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.840
 or then I am 30 years old I don't know very well not 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.750
 I don't even know very young so there is 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.729
 still time I always hope 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.329
 I hope maybe it's the right time 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.189
 here in pescara and a few years now that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.469
 I arrived in b maybe doing 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.500
 important seasons however behind there is a 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:47.670
 path of battles because anyway 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.670
 I made squares that were not so easy either 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.620
 by Julian Benevento Taranto himself 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.860
 perugia so I made some 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.730
 the mess tin as you said so now 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.500
 I am here and I am I am very pleased I 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.510
 I am conquered this category by 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.300
 a few years and I hope to be able to say 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.790
 still mine together with the team 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.070
 because I repeat I think I am a part 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.030
 of a group of important boys from 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.570
 an important team so there are the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.480
 prerequisites for making a championship of d 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.190
 others think there is a fair visa and 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.720
 what we say every day e 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.550
 that you see during let's say i 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.700
 training and the desire to do well 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.020
 the desire for redemption is important then 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.580
 we all know the league of 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.090
 series b is not easy so we think 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.680
 that you are working well to try to 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.270
 improve ourselves day after day and second 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.960
 me there are the hard conditions for 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.990
 make a championship at the highest level 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.410
 no, but there are so many 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.640
 really good guys because anyway 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.980
 the company thinks it has operated 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.590
 then it's not for me to decide it's not up to me 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.420
 but that from what I've seen and that 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.180
 I see every day I think it's done 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.440
 really a good job so we can 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.110
 just grow up 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.760
 starting from a coach like that is 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.620
 an important signal no one wants 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.090
 do something important then me 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.900
 you're definitely gonna give us a big hand 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.030
 because it is the experience and the quality for 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.110
 to read the situations in any 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.970
 moment gave us already say an idea 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.330
 right and I think anyway in these 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.739
 we did it first time out we saw 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.739
 it was clear that there is a footprint 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.280
 already of the mister x that I think anyway 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.940
 it's done quite well then always knows 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.120
 to the minister as and correct his own 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.480
 errors is definitely if they are made but 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.480
 there are still large margins of 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.480
 improvement
