00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
with feel it's like I said there's

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.440 
with feel it's like I said there's
physical<00:02:16.190> things<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:16.760> do<00:02:16.910> some<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.300> us

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
physical things you can do some of us

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.759 
physical things you can do some of us
mental<00:02:17.900> because<00:02:18.110> obviously<00:02:18.290> there's<00:02:18.680> a

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
mental because obviously there's a

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.400 
mental because obviously there's a
frustration<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.459> they<00:02:19.580> can't<00:02:19.820> play<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:21.140> it's

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
frustration that they can't play so it's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.320 
frustration that they can't play so it's
a<00:02:21.709> combination<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.700> those<00:02:22.820> two<00:02:22.880> things

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
a combination of those two things

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.600 
a combination of those two things
there's<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:24.440> bhl<00:02:24.739> protocol<00:02:25.220> it's<00:02:25.400> like

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
there's a that bhl protocol it's like

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.910 
there's a that bhl protocol it's like
you<00:02:26.300> ride<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.570> bike<00:02:26.750> light<00:02:27.260> for<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:27.739> 120

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
you ride the bike light for like 120

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.100 
you ride the bike light for like 120
heartrate<00:02:28.519> then<00:02:29.239> you<00:02:29.360> move<00:02:29.510> on<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.690> heavy

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
heartrate then you move on to heavy

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.380 
heartrate then you move on to heavy
heavy<00:02:30.860> biking<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.550> then<00:02:31.850> skating<00:02:32.269> by

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
heavy biking and then skating by

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.720 
heavy biking and then skating by
yourself<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.140> then<00:02:33.290> skiing<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:33.920> contact<00:02:34.430> and

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
yourself and then skiing in contact and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.690 
yourself and then skiing in contact and
then<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:36.050> skating<00:02:36.320> contacts<00:02:36.830> then<00:02:37.070> if<00:02:37.580> you

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
then to skating contacts then if you

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.340 
then to skating contacts then if you
feel<00:02:37.880> fine<00:02:38.150> from<00:02:38.330> there<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.810> get<00:02:38.900> back<00:02:39.110> in<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
feel fine from there you get back in the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.440 
feel fine from there you get back in the
game<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:39.860> for<00:02:40.370> me<00:02:40.550> kind<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.910> was<00:02:41.030> longer

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
game so for me kind of was longer

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.259 
game so for me kind of was longer
obviously<00:02:41.570> because<00:02:42.320> it<00:02:43.310> was<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.519> pretty<00:02:43.700> bad

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
obviously because it was a pretty bad

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.540 
obviously because it was a pretty bad
concussion<00:02:44.800> so<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:45.890> took<00:02:46.040> me<00:02:46.100> quite<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.459> while

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
concussion so it took me quite a while

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.940 
concussion so it took me quite a while
to<00:02:46.670> step<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.450> step<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.590> was<00:02:48.830> obviously

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
to step of step so that was obviously

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.830 
to step of step so that was obviously
really<00:02:49.370> frustrating<00:02:49.910> because<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.570> times

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
really frustrating because I have times

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.350 
really frustrating because I have times
where<00:02:51.079> I<00:02:51.110> didn't<00:02:51.709> like<00:02:52.070> okay<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.549> cut<00:02:52.940> her<00:02:53.120> a

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
where I didn't like okay to cut her a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.240 
where I didn't like okay to cut her a
headache<00:02:53.600> or<00:02:53.959> couldn't<00:02:54.560> skate<00:02:54.829> looking<00:02:55.130> and

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
headache or couldn't skate looking and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.009 
headache or couldn't skate looking and
headache<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:56.000> mean<00:02:56.540> once<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.780> get<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
headache so I mean once you get the

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.720 
headache so I mean once you get the
headache<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.380> get<00:02:57.560> set<00:02:57.739> back<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> step<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.610> it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
headache you get set back a step so it

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.640 
headache you get set back a step so it
was<00:02:58.850> pretty<00:02:59.060> frustrating<00:02:59.630> for<00:03:00.110> sure<00:03:00.260> it's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
was pretty frustrating for sure it's

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.710 
was pretty frustrating for sure it's
almost<00:03:00.829> as<00:03:01.070> like<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.310> sigh<00:03:02.060> relief

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
almost as like a sigh relief

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.760 
almost as like a sigh relief
just<00:03:04.380> coming<00:03:04.590> back<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:05.040> felt<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.460> good<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:07.620> to

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
just coming back it felt so good just to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.410 
just coming back it felt so good just to
see<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.430> regular<00:03:08.580> face<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.150> see<00:03:09.300> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
see like the regular face you see the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.390 
see like the regular face you see the
stands<00:03:09.750> warming<00:03:10.410> up<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.830> just<00:03:11.100> being<00:03:11.250> around

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
stands warming up and just being around

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.160 
stands warming up and just being around
the<00:03:11.520> guys<00:03:11.700> on<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> comer<00:03:12.330> Rd<00:03:12.570> in<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.690> room<00:03:12.900> was

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the guys on the comer Rd in the room was

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.590 
the guys on the comer Rd in the room was
just<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.310> sigh<00:03:14.520> relief<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.360> think

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
just just a sigh relief and just think

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.170 
just just a sigh relief and just think
back

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.399 

and<00:03:22.629> so<00:03:23.439> I<00:03:23.470> think<00:03:23.590> probably<00:03:24.489> in<00:03:25.079> first<00:03:26.079> seven

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
and so I think probably in first seven

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.750 
and so I think probably in first seven
years<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.739> my<00:03:26.829> career<00:03:26.890> when<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.370> was<00:03:27.489> with<00:03:27.549> Moose

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
years of my career when I was with Moose

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.130 
years of my career when I was with Moose
Jaw<00:03:28.030> probably<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.510> don't<00:03:28.599> think<00:03:28.780> anybody

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
Jaw probably I don't think anybody

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.819 
Jaw probably I don't think anybody
retired<00:03:29.549> this<00:03:30.989> lost<00:03:31.989> ten<00:03:32.200> years<00:03:32.409> maybe<00:03:32.560> two

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
retired this lost ten years maybe two

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.130 
retired this lost ten years maybe two
guys<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.069> have<00:03:33.370> had<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.730> say<00:03:34.120> you<00:03:34.180> know<00:03:34.420> that

guys that have had to say you know that

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.839 
guys that have had to say you know that
said<00:03:35.409> because<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.860> concussions<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:36.579> not<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> lot

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
said because of concussions so not a lot

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.300 
said because of concussions so not a lot
but<00:03:37.299> probably<00:03:37.989> too<00:03:38.170> too<00:03:38.349> many<00:03:38.470> how<00:03:39.129> do<00:03:39.189> you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
but probably too too many how do you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.069 
but probably too too many how do you
think<00:03:41.640> honestly<00:03:42.640> don't<00:03:43.090> think<00:03:43.329> they<00:03:43.450> can<00:03:43.510> be<00:03:43.689> I

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
think honestly don't think they can be I

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.130 
think honestly don't think they can be I
mean<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:45.189> can<00:03:45.340> do<00:03:46.060> whatever<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.540> want<00:03:46.930> to

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
mean you can do whatever you want to

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.770 
mean you can do whatever you want to
your<00:03:47.230> elements<00:03:47.739> but<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.370> mean<00:03:48.609> they<00:03:49.420> could<00:03:49.599> be

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
your elements but I mean they could be

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.089 
your elements but I mean they could be
just<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:50.049> punch<00:03:50.290> in<00:03:50.439> the<00:03:50.500> face<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.859> could<00:03:50.950> be

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
just a punch in the face it could be

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.210 
just a punch in the face it could be
just<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.370> routine<00:03:52.359> cat<00:03:52.659> I<00:03:52.900> mean<00:03:53.109> I<00:03:53.379> think<00:03:53.920> it

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
just a routine cat I mean I think it

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.759 
just a routine cat I mean I think it
could<00:03:54.280> be<00:03:54.459> anything<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:54.909> just<00:03:55.200> it's<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:56.470> I

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
could be anything it just it's just I

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.500 
could be anything it just it's just I
don't<00:03:57.069> think<00:03:57.250> they'll<00:03:57.760> ever<00:03:57.819> be<00:03:57.970> friendly<00:03:58.420> I

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
don't think they'll ever be friendly I

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.050 
don't think they'll ever be friendly I
think<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:59.470> think<00:04:00.069> drives<00:04:00.310> really<00:04:00.579> taking<00:04:01.000> a

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
think I think drives really taking a

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.190 
think I think drives really taking a
long<00:04:01.239> stairs<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.629> mean<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.810> remember<00:04:01.930> when<00:04:02.139> he

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
long stairs I mean I remember when he

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.690 
long stairs I mean I remember when he
first<00:04:02.409> came<00:04:02.680> here<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.040> you're<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.280> young<00:04:03.489> guy

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
first came here and you're the young guy

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.369 
first came here and you're the young guy
that<00:04:03.730> wasn't<00:04:04.090> drafting<00:04:04.659> it<00:04:04.720> was<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> walk-on

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
that wasn't drafting it was a walk-on

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.520 
that wasn't drafting it was a walk-on
and<00:04:05.650> in<00:04:05.889> that<00:04:06.639> camp<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.510> every<00:04:08.109> year<00:04:08.379> he's

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
and in that camp and every year he's

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.530 
and in that camp and every year he's
gotten<00:04:08.920> better<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.459> better<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.819> I<00:04:10.299> think<00:04:10.480> he

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
gotten better and better and I think he

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.479 
gotten better and better and I think he
just<00:04:10.720> got<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:11.049> keep<00:04:11.139> on<00:04:11.319> going<00:04:11.349> there<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:12.370> way

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
just got to keep on going there the way

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.369 
just got to keep on going there the way
he's<00:04:13.209> been<00:04:13.329> progressing<00:04:13.900> every<00:04:14.019> year<00:04:14.260> you've

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
he's been progressing every year you've

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.660 
he's been progressing every year you've
gotten<00:04:14.680> better<00:04:14.829> better<00:04:15.159> he's<00:04:15.400> gotten

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
gotten better better he's gotten

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.060 
gotten better better he's gotten
stronger<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.299> little<00:04:16.599> bit<00:04:16.690> faster<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:17.470> you

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
stronger a little bit faster and you

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.110 
stronger a little bit faster and you
know<00:04:18.160> those<00:04:18.340> are<00:04:18.489> things<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.669> every<00:04:18.970> athlete

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
know those are things that every athlete

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.670 
know those are things that every athlete
needs<00:04:19.510> from<00:04:19.690> these<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.989> do<00:04:20.139> so<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.349> think<00:04:20.470> he's

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
needs from these to do so I think he's

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.540 
needs from these to do so I think he's
he's<00:04:21.280> on<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.489> right<00:04:21.609> path<00:04:21.849> I<00:04:22.240> could<00:04:22.750> see<00:04:23.050> him

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
he's on the right path I could see him

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.499 
he's on the right path I could see him
variously<00:04:24.550> getting<00:04:24.789> drafted<00:04:25.000> this<00:04:25.240> serious

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
variously getting drafted this serious

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.560 
variously getting drafted this serious
in<00:04:25.599> his<00:04:25.690> draft<00:04:25.930> here<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:27.099> could<00:04:28.060> see<00:04:28.090> him

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
in his draft here so I could see him

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.450 
in his draft here so I could see him
getting<00:04:28.599> drafted<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.349> if<00:04:29.440> not<00:04:29.620> probably<00:04:30.370> got
