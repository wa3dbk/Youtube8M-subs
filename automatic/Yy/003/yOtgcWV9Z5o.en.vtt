00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
really anything particularly special the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.040 
really anything particularly special the
box<00:00:55.680> size<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.570> weird<00:00:57.570> it's

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
box size is a little bit weird it's

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.470

licensed<00:01:01.199> sets<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.129> bit

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
licensed sets which is a little bit

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.770 
licensed sets which is a little bit
uncommon<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.969> think<00:01:03.210> they're<00:01:03.329> using<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
uncommon but I think they're using this

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.260 
uncommon but I think they're using this
more<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> city<00:01:05.129> sets<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.150> again

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
more with the city sets but then again

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.810

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
Annie's head is quite uncommon I mean I

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.130 
Annie's head is quite uncommon I mean I
don't<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.460> any<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.880> his<00:01:30.030> head<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> know

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
don't have any of his head but I know

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
don't have any of his head but I know
was<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.950> lot<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> mining<00:01:32.640> sets<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.119> was

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
was in a lot of the mining sets it was

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
was in a lot of the mining sets it was
in<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> cheapest<00:01:33.960> mine<00:01:34.350> extent<00:01:34.740> which<00:01:34.829> was

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
in the cheapest mine extent which was

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
in the cheapest mine extent which was
only<00:01:35.100> ten<00:01:35.310> dollars<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> deal<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.720> that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
only ten dollars but the deal with that

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.380 
only ten dollars but the deal with that
is<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:38.250> discontinued<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
is that that's discontinued so this is

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
it's a little bit simple and the

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:03.999 
it's a little bit simple and the
minifigure<00:06:02.990> himself<00:06:03.349> is<00:06:03.530> not<00:06:03.740> really

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
minifigure himself is not really

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.100 
minifigure himself is not really
anything<00:06:04.250> particularly<00:06:05.000> special<00:06:05.270> even

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
anything particularly special even

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.600 
anything particularly special even
though<00:06:06.199> he<00:06:06.410> is<00:06:06.500> a<00:06:06.530> step<00:06:06.830> up<00:06:06.979> from<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.250> lot<00:06:07.370> of<00:06:07.430> the

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
though he is a step up from a lot of the

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.980 
though he is a step up from a lot of the
other<00:06:07.789> bitty<00:06:08.060> figures<00:06:08.330> because<00:06:08.599> this<00:06:08.750> one<00:06:08.930> is

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
other bitty figures because this one is

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.900 
other bitty figures because this one is
just<00:06:09.110> a<00:06:09.259> little<00:06:09.530> bit<00:06:09.680> more<00:06:09.919> unique<00:06:10.250> or<00:06:10.849> a

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
just a little bit more unique or a

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.850 
just a little bit more unique or a
little<00:06:11.120> bit<00:06:11.210> more<00:06:11.389> uncommon<00:06:11.810> a<00:06:12.289> little

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
little bit more uncommon a little

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.839 
little bit more uncommon a little
structure<00:06:13.039> to<00:06:13.220> give<00:06:13.340> you<00:06:13.430> what<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.669> light<00:06:13.819> is

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
structure to give you what the light is

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.089 
structure to give you what the light is
cute<00:06:14.240> and<00:06:14.360> it's<00:06:14.509> necessary<00:06:14.720> for<00:06:15.319> this<00:06:15.470> and<00:06:15.740> it

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
cute and it's necessary for this and it

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.409 
cute and it's necessary for this and it
makes<00:06:16.250> sense<00:06:16.490> but<00:06:16.699> I<00:06:16.759> have<00:06:17.000> it<00:06:17.150> but<00:06:17.240> there's

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
makes sense but I have it but there's

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.749 
makes sense but I have it but there's
really<00:06:17.569> not<00:06:17.750> much<00:06:17.960> going<00:06:18.020> on<00:06:18.349> there<00:06:18.410> I<00:06:19.160> think

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
really not much going on there I think

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.309 
really not much going on there I think
the<00:06:19.880> price<00:06:20.210> is<00:06:20.240> just<00:06:20.599> the<00:06:20.810> part<00:06:20.990> that<00:06:21.020> really

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
the price is just the part that really

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.779 
the price is just the part that really
stands<00:06:21.560> out<00:06:21.740> I<00:06:21.800> mean<00:06:22.099> I'm<00:06:22.460> going<00:06:22.610> to<00:06:22.669> see

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
stands out I mean I'm going to see

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.520 
stands out I mean I'm going to see
people<00:06:22.940> buy<00:06:23.180> ten<00:06:23.509> of<00:06:23.599> these<00:06:23.720> and<00:06:24.289> maybe

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
people buy ten of these and maybe

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.740 
people buy ten of these and maybe
putting<00:06:25.430> more<00:06:25.909> to<00:06:26.060> their<00:06:26.180> City<00:06:26.419> and<00:06:26.569> stuff

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
putting more to their City and stuff

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.670 
putting more to their City and stuff
like<00:06:26.840> that

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
like that

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.890 
like that
who<00:06:28.159> this<00:06:28.370> would<00:06:28.550> be<00:06:28.639> really<00:06:28.819> cool<00:06:29.060> BOGO<00:06:29.419> if

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
who this would be really cool BOGO if

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.779 
who this would be really cool BOGO if
someplace<00:06:30.590> you<00:06:30.680> could<00:06:30.770> find<00:06:30.979> regular<00:06:31.370> BOGO<00:06:31.759> I

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
someplace you could find regular BOGO I

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.600 
someplace you could find regular BOGO I
think<00:06:32.060> Kmart<00:06:32.449> has<00:06:32.599> it<00:06:32.780> by<00:06:33.319> like<00:06:33.620> ten<00:06:34.400> of<00:06:34.520> these

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
think Kmart has it by like ten of these

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.249 
think Kmart has it by like ten of these
and<00:06:34.849> then<00:06:34.940> you<00:06:35.030> only<00:06:35.270> pay<00:06:36.430> $50<00:06:37.539> so<00:06:38.539> even<00:06:39.199> though

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
and then you only pay $50 so even though

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:40.360 
and then you only pay $50 so even though
it<00:06:39.319> doesn't<00:06:39.470> particularly<00:06:39.830> stand<00:06:40.190> out<00:06:40.340> I

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
it doesn't particularly stand out I

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.890 
it doesn't particularly stand out I
think<00:06:40.520> it's<00:06:40.759> still<00:06:40.909> a<00:06:40.970> very<00:06:41.120> strong<00:06:41.300> set<00:06:41.750> for

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
think it's still a very strong set for

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.510 
think it's still a very strong set for
price<00:06:42.169> and<00:06:42.199> stuff<00:06:42.560> like<00:06:42.650> that<00:06:42.860> I<00:06:43.039> would

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
price and stuff like that I would

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.670 
price and stuff like that I would
definitely<00:06:43.610> give<00:06:43.909> it<00:06:43.940> a<00:06:44.180> B+<00:06:44.810> it's<00:06:45.229> just<00:06:45.530> I

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
definitely give it a B+ it's just I

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.320 
definitely give it a B+ it's just I
don't<00:06:45.800> know<00:06:45.919> it's<00:06:46.099> just<00:06:46.190> such<00:06:46.400> a<00:06:46.430> cute<00:06:46.610> set<00:06:46.909> you

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
don't know it's just such a cute set you

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.790 
don't know it's just such a cute set you
could<00:06:47.449> buy<00:06:47.539> multiples<00:06:48.020> of<00:06:48.080> it<00:06:48.229> and<00:06:48.440> there's

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
could buy multiples of it and there's

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.200 
could buy multiples of it and there's
nothing<00:06:49.039> really<00:06:49.130> wrong<00:06:49.250> with<00:06:49.460> it<00:06:49.880> it's<00:06:50.090> just

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
nothing really wrong with it it's just

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.490 
nothing really wrong with it it's just
that<00:06:50.330> they<00:06:50.690> need<00:06:50.870> should<00:06:51.020> have<00:06:51.110> been<00:06:51.199> a<00:06:51.229> little

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
that they need should have been a little

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.719 
that they need should have been a little
bit<00:06:51.590> more<00:06:51.770> unique<00:06:51.949> maybe<00:06:52.280> it<00:06:52.460> should<00:06:52.639> have

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
bit more unique maybe it should have

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:54.670 
bit more unique maybe it should have
been<00:06:52.880> a<00:06:53.120> little<00:06:53.569> bit<00:06:53.720> maybe<00:06:54.380> there<00:06:54.560> should

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
been a little bit maybe there should

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.140 
been a little bit maybe there should
have<00:06:54.710> been<00:06:54.860> better<00:06:55.039> pieces<00:06:55.520> included<00:06:55.940> with<00:06:56.030> it

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
have been better pieces included with it

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.610 
have been better pieces included with it
even<00:06:56.360> though<00:06:56.479> the<00:06:56.630> orange<00:06:56.960> does<00:06:57.229> look<00:06:57.409> really

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
even though the orange does look really

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.230 
even though the orange does look really
nice<00:06:57.800> and<00:06:58.039> orange<00:06:58.280> is<00:06:58.490> it<00:06:58.610> the<00:06:58.699> most<00:06:58.820> common

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240
