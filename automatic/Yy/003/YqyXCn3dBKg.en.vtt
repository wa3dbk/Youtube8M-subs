00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.740
 differential bost neco talks what clothes 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.329

 colored all kinds just as I like it 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.280
 That's why I did project thinking. 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.770
 in the east as it is that they are good it does not have 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.709
 six sides are quite large but meeting 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.730
 the most modern and colorful ones for your 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.319
 physical type

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.100
 offer to an audience so has a 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:02.100
 difficulty of finding good products 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:07.030
 young quality to which a niche is 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.760
 gigantic market that is looking for 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.760
 but lack of material 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.610
 I think cool clothes of my size do not 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.160
 Are there any clothes I can afford? 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.110

 It's all too old 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.049

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.680
 there's more fun with an audience that 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.020

 physique to pulse and yes with this footprint 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.069
 younger then I think it's two 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.980
 differentials of the director of suzano who 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.380
 they have out there in an environment that is 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.910

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.270
