just double check that on one of my 2.7

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.539 
just double check that on one of my 2.7
k<00:01:28.380> videos<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:30.350> two<00:01:31.350> point<00:01:31.619> 704<00:01:32.280> by

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
k videos and we have two point 704 by

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.260 
k videos and we have two point 704 by
1440<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:33.869> correct<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:36.000> you'll

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
1440 so that's correct on this you'll

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.039 
1440 so that's correct on this you'll
leave<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.430> square<00:01:38.700> pixels<00:01:39.270> this

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
leave so you have square pixels this

export<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.519> go<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.730> file<00:02:14.450> export<00:02:15.010> export

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
export so just go to file export export

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.360 
export so just go to file export export
media<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.660> there<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.810> no<00:02:18.110> first<00:02:19.069> of<00:02:19.130> all<00:02:19.220> for

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
media and there is no first of all for

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.820 
media and there is no first of all for
the<00:02:19.459> format<00:02:19.819> I<00:02:19.850> like<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.180> choose<00:02:20.360> h.264<00:02:21.049> I<00:02:21.530> find

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the format I like to choose h.264 I find

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.580 
the format I like to choose h.264 I find
I<00:02:21.890> get<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.160> best<00:02:22.959> clearest<00:02:23.959> video<00:02:24.290> quality

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
I get the best clearest video quality

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.400 
I get the best clearest video quality
out<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.480> for<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.600> preset<00:02:27.049> there<00:02:27.260> is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
out of that and for the preset there is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.070 
out of that and for the preset there is
no<00:02:27.590> 2.7<00:02:28.310> K<00:02:28.459> preset<00:02:29.060> here<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:29.780> you're<00:02:29.930> going<00:02:30.049> to

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
no 2.7 K preset here so you're going to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.289 
no 2.7 K preset here so you're going to
have<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> custom<00:02:31.040> one<00:02:31.190> first<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.120> want

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
have to do a custom one first you want

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.170 
have to do a custom one first you want
to<00:02:32.390> go<00:02:32.480> down<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.830> level<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.430> increase

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
to go down to the level and increase

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.789 
to go down to the level and increase
that<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.420> 5.1<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:37.000> now<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:39.110> want<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.349> Inc<00:02:39.530> you

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
that to 5.1 and now you want to Inc you

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.610 
that to 5.1 and now you want to Inc you
want<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> add<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.299> correct<00:02:41.620> resolution

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
want to add the the correct resolution

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.039 
want to add the the correct resolution
which<00:02:43.099> is<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.400> set<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.970> 704<00:02:44.810> by<00:02:45.099> 1440<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:47.049> the

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
which is to set to 704 by 1440 and the

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.990 
which is to set to 704 by 1440 and the
framerate<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:48.620> want<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.860> export<00:02:49.220> at<00:02:50.200> 2997<00:02:51.200> and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
framerate you want to export at 2997 and

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.009 
framerate you want to export at 2997 and
another<00:02:53.000> thing<00:02:53.239> you're<00:02:53.359> going<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.570> want<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.840> do

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
another thing you're going to want to do

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.340 
another thing you're going to want to do
is<00:02:54.260> double<00:02:54.980> check<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.910> see<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.630> fer<00:02:56.900> the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
is double check to see what the fer the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.120 
is double check to see what the fer the
video<00:02:57.650> bitrate<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.489> on<00:02:58.790> your<00:02:59.000> videos<00:02:59.920> i<00:03:00.920> think

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
video bitrate is on your videos i think

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.460 
video bitrate is on your videos i think
the<00:03:01.370> typical<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.850> 46<00:03:02.420> megabits<00:03:02.870> per<00:03:02.959> second

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
the typical is 46 megabits per second

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.130 
the typical is 46 megabits per second
for<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.799> bitrate<00:03:04.010> see<00:03:04.579> i<00:03:04.640> got<00:03:04.760> 46<00:03:05.239> here<00:03:05.540> so

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
for the bitrate see i got 46 here so

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.800 
for the bitrate see i got 46 here so
that's<00:03:06.650> what<00:03:06.829> we<00:03:06.950> want<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.370> set<00:03:08.209> for<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.569> video

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
that's what we want to set for the video

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.210 
that's what we want to set for the video
we<00:03:08.989> want<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.230> do<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.410> target<00:03:10.370> bitrate<00:03:10.579> of<00:03:10.850> 46

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
we want to do a target bitrate of 46

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.940 
we want to do a target bitrate of 46
and<00:03:13.310> we'll<00:03:13.910> do<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.120> maximum<00:03:14.900> bitrate<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.350> let's

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
and we'll do a maximum bitrate of let's

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.340 
and we'll do a maximum bitrate of let's
say<00:03:16.130> 48<00:03:16.670> for<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.090> video<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.900> usually<00:03:18.110> just

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
say 48 for this video and I usually just

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.640 
say 48 for this video and I usually just
leave<00:03:18.710> the<00:03:19.460> one<00:03:19.670> pass<00:03:19.970> if<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.780> do<00:03:20.990> two<00:03:21.200> pass<00:03:21.410> is

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
leave the one pass if you do two pass is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.230 
leave the one pass if you do two pass is
going<00:03:21.800> to<00:03:21.860> take<00:03:22.040> twice<00:03:22.340> as<00:03:22.550> long<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.790> render

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
going to take twice as long to render

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.260 
going to take twice as long to render
out<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.630> whole<00:03:23.780> video<00:03:24.560> clip<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.270> really

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
out the whole video clip and really

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.190 
out the whole video clip and really
that's<00:03:26.450> it

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
that's it

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.810 
that's it
choose<00:03:27.530> your<00:03:27.710> location<00:03:27.860> on<00:03:28.400> where<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.640> want

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
choose your location on where you want

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.360 
choose your location on where you want
to<00:03:28.880> save<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:30.820> just<00:03:31.820> click<00:03:32.060> save<00:03:33.130> just<00:03:34.130> go

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
to save it and just click save just go

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.050 
to save it and just click save just go
through<00:03:34.610> all<00:03:34.730> my<00:03:34.760> stuff<00:03:35.470> here<00:03:36.470> what<00:03:37.400> do<00:03:37.460> I<00:03:37.520> got

stuff to edit and we'll do too

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:56.010 
stuff to edit and we'll do too
do<00:03:46.810> two<00:03:47.020> points<00:03:47.380> so<00:03:49.590> do<00:03:50.700> 2704<00:03:52.410> test<00:03:54.540> test<00:03:55.540> video

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
clip save export and that will take

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.330 
clip save export and that will take
about<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.310> don't<00:04:00.370> know<00:04:00.490> maybe<00:04:00.610> 10<00:04:01.300> minutes<00:04:02.340> 5-10

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
about I don't know maybe 10 minutes 5-10

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.010 
about I don't know maybe 10 minutes 5-10
minutes

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
minutes

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.680 
minutes
or<00:04:05.590> more<00:04:05.830> we'll<00:04:06.160> see<00:04:06.370> how<00:04:06.490> it<00:04:06.580> goes<00:04:07.000> all<00:04:07.450> right

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
or more we'll see how it goes all right

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.130 
or more we'll see how it goes all right
it<00:04:07.870> just<00:04:07.900> finished<00:04:08.650> up<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.270> I<00:04:10.270> got<00:04:10.450> my<00:04:10.630> footage

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
it just finished up and I got my footage

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:21.080 
it just finished up and I got my footage
here<00:04:12.630> see<00:04:13.630> if<00:04:13.720> we<00:04:13.840> could<00:04:13.960> play<00:04:14.200> it

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.450 

and<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.540> looks<00:04:21.750> pretty<00:04:21.840> good

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
and it looks pretty good

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.550 
and it looks pretty good
just<00:04:24.270> double-check<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.020> see<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.440> it's

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
just double-check and see that it's

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.790 
just double-check and see that it's
actually<00:04:25.850> 2.7<00:04:26.850> K<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:28.080> will<00:04:28.169> right<00:04:28.410> click<00:04:28.440> and

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
actually 2.7 K it will right click and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.840 
actually 2.7 K it will right click and
go<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:28.889> media<00:04:29.250> info

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.150 

and<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:33.420> tells<00:04:33.780> me<00:04:34.130> that<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:37.010> resolution<00:04:38.010> is

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
and that tells me that the resolution is

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.520 
and that tells me that the resolution is
to<00:04:38.570> 704<00:04:39.570> by<00:04:39.780> 1440<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.910> bit<00:04:42.300> rate<00:04:42.660> is<00:04:42.930> forty

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
to 704 by 1440 and the bit rate is forty

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
original footage option instead of 1080

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.480 
original footage option instead of 1080
well<00:05:25.020> obviously<00:05:25.140> 1080p<00:05:25.890> will<00:05:26.040> still<00:05:26.250> be<00:05:26.370> there

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
well obviously 1080p will still be there

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.620 
well obviously 1080p will still be there
but<00:05:26.550> you'll<00:05:27.150> get<00:05:27.330> another<00:05:27.630> option<00:05:28.230> for<00:05:29.630> the

but you'll get another option for the
2.7<00:05:31.350> k<00:05:31.970> resolution<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.180> we'll<00:05:33.300> see<00:05:33.480> how<00:05:33.660> that

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
2.7 k resolution so we'll see how that

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.960 
2.7 k resolution so we'll see how that
goes<00:05:34.050> now<00:05:34.380> alright<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.370> video<00:05:35.640> is<00:05:35.760> done

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
uploading I didn't get the option for

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.330 
uploading I didn't get the option for
2.7<00:05:38.820> K<00:05:39.000> or<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.330> original<00:05:39.630> option<00:05:40.470> until<00:05:41.160> about

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
2.7 K or the original option until about

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.340 
2.7 K or the original option until about
3<00:05:41.700> or<00:05:41.730> 4<00:05:42.090> minutes<00:05:42.270> after<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.870> video<00:05:43.170> was

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
3 or 4 minutes after the video was

3 or 4 minutes after the video was
finally<00:05:43.950> uploaded<00:05:44.400> I<00:05:44.670> guess<00:05:45.420> it<00:05:45.570> still<00:05:45.750> had

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
finally uploaded I guess it still had

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.510 
finally uploaded I guess it still had
some<00:05:46.140> processing<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.920> do<00:05:47.070> behind<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.460> scenes

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
some processing to do behind the scenes

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.210 
some processing to do behind the scenes
but<00:05:48.450> if<00:05:48.660> we<00:05:48.810> go<00:05:49.080> here<00:05:49.380> we<00:05:49.560> should<00:05:49.770> see<00:05:50.010> the

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
but if we go here we should see the

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.090 
but if we go here we should see the
original<00:05:50.730> option<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:51.330> there<00:05:51.480> it<00:05:51.570> is<00:05:51.690> and

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
original option and there it is and

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.850 
original option and there it is and
that's<00:05:53.100> basically<00:05:53.580> 2.7<00:05:54.450> K<00:05:54.630> now<00:05:55.380> it's<00:05:55.710> not
