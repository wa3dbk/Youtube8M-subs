00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.210

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.570

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.640
 day of the seven days to restart and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.590
 You do not know what I'm talking about 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.700
 go back to my previous videos because 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.369
 there you will find all the information 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.070
 what do you need about the challenge that we are 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.410
 making these seven days for 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.300
 give up remember that if it gives you more 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.059
 hungry you can make more liquefied but 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.220
 would be three of these shakes one for 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.710
 buy breakfast one for food 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.809
 and one for dinner today is going 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.840
 to give the list of five things that I 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.260
 I think you should eliminate from your diet by 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.960
 complete for good health good 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.109
 let's start the first one is food 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.460
 Processed processed food includes 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:02.190
 all the chocolates chips all that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.769
 see everything that comes packaged all 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.140
 you could buy a maquinita the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.259
 junk food places of food 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.400
 fast all that is food that has happened 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.850
 a long process to get there 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.010
 make food and really not me I do not 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.280
 I call food because it is not 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.350
 contributing with any type of nutrients 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.110
 and vitamins you will not feel well 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.050
 you will only feel tired 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.010
 exhausted you're going to gain weight you're going 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.680
 nothing 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.050
 you are going to have diseases then you do not 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.630
 will bring with nothing good I'm super 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.650
 proud of my brother because he makes a 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.040
 year he left cocacola and he no longer drank coca 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.860
 colÃ¡ I'm super super happy and I feel 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.090
 that is a step that we can all do 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.360
 number 2 is red meat and red meat 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.340
 It is very very toxic to the body 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.979
 we all have cancer cells 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.560
 inside our body but it depends 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.990
 to depend but it will depend if we 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.110
 gives cancer or not depending on what 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.500
 we feed them the red meat is 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.340
 very very toxic to the body and meat 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.849
 red 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.400
 to accelerate that cancer cells 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.610
 grow and grow and grow not only 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.300
 That will raise the cholesterol 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.110
 high blood pressure can give you diabetes 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.330
 premature then we do not want anything from 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.030
 that apart that is very very heavy for the 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.190
 body in our bodies were not 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.330
 designed for 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.670
 to process the red meat and you knew that the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.800
 Red meat can stay in your system 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:50.040
 for 7 days 7 days it takes to leave number 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.360
 3 are fried foods all you have 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.870
 the word fried the french fries all 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.820
 whatever is fried is going to be very bad for 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.980
 your health because that is full of 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.410
 fatty fat fat grace we do not want 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.780
 that saturated fat because because the 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.060
 fat is for your arteries and what happens 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.340
 When your arteries are blocked 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.320
 blood can pass and when it can not 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.970
 pass the blood can not reach your 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.650
 heart is why people have 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.500
 40-50 years and they are already being beaten 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.220
 cardiac is for all that fat that is 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.620
 eating number 4 that is white bread all 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.620
 whatever white flour white bread 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.470
 flour tortillas all that is not going to 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.500
 cut with nothing nothing nothing only you 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.140
 will fill and will obstruct your 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.750
 intestines we want our 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.819
 intestines are super clean we want 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.610
 that all the food can go through there 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.370
 that our colon is clean is very 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.709
 important because of the intestines is 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.260
 where all the nutrients are absorbed 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.620
 our cells to our blood number 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.379
 5 is dairy all kinds of dairy goes to 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.040
 be very very toxic to your body because 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:08.260
 Dairy will bring a lot of acidity 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.730
 to your good body and because we want a 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.290
 alkaline body because in a body 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.900
 acid is where diseases 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.180
 I love it is for diabetes the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.539
 cholesterol all diseases go to 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.520
 edit in an acid body then 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.889
 we want to eat more fruits and vegetables 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.550
 to attract more oxygen to our body 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.310
 so it's more alkaline and all those 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.310
 all those big cells that are being 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.070
 feeding all the bad cells of 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.440
 the diseases are slowly going to go 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.660
 decreasing then let's see the
