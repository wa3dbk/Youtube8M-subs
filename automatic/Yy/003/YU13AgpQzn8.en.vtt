 ahead of time a person who 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.660
 has defined several fashion things before 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.670
 that it was done and then we entered the

 exposure and then you see another part of 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.070
 frida that is even more feminine where 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.150

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.090
 in front of 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.559
 the red varnish that if a woman yes 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.320
 he loved to wear the dresses 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:55.239

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.370
 to be photographed in the magazine

 vogue our style already called the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.360
 attention that is, it was a proposal 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.290
 different a proposal that happened in that 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.310
 moment and today is still a 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.079
 today's innovative proposal 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.369
 over the years we have seen 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.899
 international designers that we see in 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.030
 our exhibition how are they rendered 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.390
 her dresses that have been inspired by 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.579
 her essential part of this study are 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.039
 the dresses that identify this 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.429
 Mexican art icon all over the 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.429
 world 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.250
 each one very pointedly shows us in 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.320
 another side inspires you the fact that a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.670
 company as vogue is interested in 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.920
 sponsor already 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.470
 you accept in an alliance with emotion the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.299
 escalo it would not be possible for us to have to 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.000

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.369
 the visionary magazine that I photograph by 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.689
 first time to africa in a local appointment 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.869
 which is also an exhibition 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.030
 international with the fortune of Japanese 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.010
 the museologist is English the curator 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.810

 Spanish in short set to many 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.160
 nationalities many interests and this 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.680
 I think it's only achieved with two 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.560
 elements 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.410
