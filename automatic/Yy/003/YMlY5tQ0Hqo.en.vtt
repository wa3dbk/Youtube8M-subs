it's fished rotary style a helicopter
style<00:00:18.160> just<00:00:18.580> so<00:00:18.730> it<00:00:18.880> kicks<00:00:19.120> the<00:00:19.590> bait<00:00:20.590> further

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100

one<00:00:24.310> about<00:00:24.400> led<00:00:24.730> release<00:00:25.650> being<00:00:26.650> very

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
one about led release being very

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.430 
one about led release being very
important<00:00:27.310> when<00:00:27.550> fishing<00:00:27.970> in<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.119> weed<00:00:28.440> with

the helicopter rotary style the
important<00:00:32.289> thing<00:00:32.500> again<00:00:32.770> is<00:00:32.800> obviously

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
important thing again is obviously

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.010 
important thing again is obviously
losing<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.790> lid<00:00:34.000> and<00:00:34.329> this<00:00:34.540> is<00:00:34.720> slightly

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
losing the lid and this is slightly

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.080 
losing the lid and this is slightly
different<00:00:35.320> in<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.770> lid<00:00:36.250> on<00:00:36.460> this<00:00:36.610> is<00:00:36.820> simply

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
different in the lid on this is simply

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.720 
different in the lid on this is simply
tied<00:00:37.390> on<00:00:37.890> there's<00:00:38.890> a<00:00:38.950> ring<00:00:39.190> at<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.460> bottom<00:00:39.700> of

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
tied on there's a ring at the bottom of

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.510 
tied on there's a ring at the bottom of
the<00:00:39.820> lead<00:00:40.000> core<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:41.590> which<00:00:41.739> I<00:00:41.890> tie<00:00:42.130> the<00:00:42.190> lead

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
the lead core to which I tie the lead

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.460 
the lead core to which I tie the lead
with<00:00:42.760> full<00:00:43.030> pay<00:00:43.239> online<00:00:43.420> they'll<00:00:43.989> take<00:00:44.320> the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
with full pay online they'll take the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.490 
with full pay online they'll take the
force<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.070> cast<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.930> when<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.200> fish<00:00:47.470> is

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
force of a cast but when a fish is

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.380 
force of a cast but when a fish is
hooked<00:00:47.800> in<00:00:48.040> the<00:00:48.070> weed<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.850> full<00:00:49.180> power

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
hooked in the weed that the full power

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.020 
hooked in the weed that the full power
line<00:00:49.570> simply<00:00:49.960> snaps<00:00:50.380> off<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.730> you've<00:00:51.850> got<00:00:51.969> a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
line simply snaps off and you've got a

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.229 
line simply snaps off and you've got a
rig<00:00:52.270> on<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.450> bottling<00:00:53.290> on<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.530> bottom<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
rig on the bottling on the bottom that

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.229 
rig on the bottling on the bottom that
obviously<00:00:55.649> keeps<00:00:56.649> you<00:00:56.800> hooked<00:00:57.640> link<00:00:57.910> on<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
obviously keeps you hooked link on the

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.139 
obviously keeps you hooked link on the
line<00:00:58.420> supply<00:00:58.840> straight<00:00:59.200> on<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.410> lead<00:00:59.590> core

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
line supply straight on the lead core

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.630 
line supply straight on the lead core
and<00:01:01.149> that<00:01:01.360> is<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.570> main<00:01:01.750> difference<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:03.460> is

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
and that is the main difference this is

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.480 
and that is the main difference this is
as<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.879> set<00:01:04.089> of<00:01:04.210> pop<00:01:04.360> up<00:01:04.539> rig<00:01:05.130> again<00:01:06.130> it's<00:01:06.280> quite

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
as a set of pop up rig again it's quite

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.050 
as a set of pop up rig again it's quite
stiff<00:01:06.789> nylon<00:01:07.799> putty<00:01:08.799> on<00:01:08.979> with<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.340> strip<00:01:09.789> piece

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
stiff nylon putty on with a strip piece

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.370 
stiff nylon putty on with a strip piece
about<00:01:10.719> midway<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.229> give<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:11.649> movement<00:01:12.329> and<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
about midway to give it movement and a

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.039 
about midway to give it movement and a
size<00:01:14.889> six<00:01:15.219> hook<00:01:15.490> again<00:01:16.240> with<00:01:16.539> a<00:01:16.569> bit<00:01:16.689> of<00:01:16.719> shrink

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
size six hook again with a bit of shrink

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.629 
size six hook again with a bit of shrink
tube<00:01:17.289> over<00:01:17.529> the<00:01:17.619> I<00:01:17.649> just<00:01:17.979> turns<00:01:18.249> the<00:01:18.459> eye<00:01:18.490> down

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639 
tube over the I just turns the eye down

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:21.029 
tube over the I just turns the eye down
it<00:01:19.090> kicks<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.479> eye<00:01:19.509> down<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:20.109> makes<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.439> baits

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
it kicks the eye down it makes the baits

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.269 
it kicks the eye down it makes the baits
it<00:01:21.340> more<00:01:21.549> proud<00:01:22.499> and<00:01:23.499> it<00:01:23.799> gives<00:01:24.009> you<00:01:24.130> that

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:24.279 
it more proud and it gives you that

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:26.309 
it more proud and it gives you that
aggressive<00:01:24.939> angle<00:01:25.359> which<00:01:25.509> really<00:01:25.840> helps<00:01:26.200> you

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
aggressive angle which really helps you

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.399 
aggressive angle which really helps you
with<00:01:26.639> hooking<00:01:27.639> fish<00:01:28.020> again<00:01:29.020> it's<00:01:29.200> one<00:01:29.349> of

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
with hooking fish again it's one of

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.929 
with hooking fish again it's one of
those<00:01:29.499> rigs<00:01:29.740> i<00:01:29.950> think<00:01:30.249> that<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.459> fish<00:01:30.670> picks

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
those rigs i think that the fish picks

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.539 
those rigs i think that the fish picks
it<00:01:31.119> up<00:01:31.209> whilst<00:01:31.539> it<00:01:31.749> isn't<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.529> most<00:01:32.770> finesse

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
it up whilst it isn't the most finesse

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.999 
it up whilst it isn't the most finesse
rig<00:01:33.909> it<00:01:34.569> again<00:01:34.899> if<00:01:35.079> a<00:01:35.229> fish<00:01:35.380> picks<00:01:35.649> up<00:01:35.829> its

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
rig it again if a fish picks up its

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.889 
rig it again if a fish picks up its
hooked<00:01:36.249> and<00:01:36.609> the<00:01:37.119> hook<00:01:37.299> holds<00:01:37.659> on<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:38.849> really

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
hooked and the hook holds on this really

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.099 
hooked and the hook holds on this really
outstanding<00:01:40.899> very<00:01:41.889> deep<00:01:42.130> hole<00:01:42.159> colds<00:01:42.819> and

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
outstanding very deep hole colds and

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.809 
outstanding very deep hole colds and
again<00:01:44.109> great<00:01:44.409> for<00:01:44.649> fishing<00:01:44.799> weed<00:01:45.219> and<00:01:45.520> snags

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
again great for fishing weed and snags

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.190 
again great for fishing weed and snags
of<00:01:45.999> your<00:01:46.149> hook<00:01:46.299> and<00:01:46.329> you<00:01:46.840> know<00:01:46.959> you're<00:01:47.109> going

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
of your hook and you know you're going

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.889 
of your hook and you know you're going
to<00:01:47.259> get<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.499> fish<00:01:47.679> out<00:01:47.919> Bates<00:01:48.880> tied<00:01:49.270> onto<00:01:49.749> a

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
to get the fish out Bates tied onto a

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.559 
to get the fish out Bates tied onto a
ring<00:01:50.139> at<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.319> back<00:01:50.529> of<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.740> shank<00:01:51.359> that<00:01:52.359> gives

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
ring at the back of the shank that gives

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.659 
ring at the back of the shank that gives
you<00:01:52.689> a<00:01:52.749> great<00:01:52.959> angle<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.590> bait<00:01:54.099> sort<00:01:54.369> of<00:01:54.429> sits

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:54.669 
you a great angle the bait sort of sits

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.729 
you a great angle the bait sort of sits
below<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.240> hook<00:01:55.450> tight<00:01:55.959> against<00:01:56.319> the<00:01:56.380> shank

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:56.739 
below the hook tight against the shank

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.359 
below the hook tight against the shank
and<00:01:57.899> again<00:01:58.899> you<00:01:58.929> can<00:01:59.049> measure<00:01:59.409> this<00:01:59.649> rig<00:01:59.950> 1<00:02:00.189> by

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
and again you can measure this rig 1 by

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.099
