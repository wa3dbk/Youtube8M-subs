00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
animation and there's a dog about to

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
animation and there's a dog about to
explode<00:00:30.269> next<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.470> press<00:00:31.710> roll

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
away while you're in the animation

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.810

the other dog won't have hurt you okay

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.940 
the other dog won't have hurt you okay
so<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:40.379> should<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.680> able<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.860> get

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
so you can you should be able to get

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.760 
so you can you should be able to get
through<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.219> first<00:00:41.280> third<00:00:42.230> without<00:00:43.230> losing

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
through this first third without losing

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.040 
through this first third without losing
any<00:00:43.920> health<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.969> he<00:00:45.059> does<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.360> oh<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
any health and he does that oh that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.420 
any health and he does that oh that
seems<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> only<00:00:46.530> other<00:00:46.739> attack<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
seems the only other attack is the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.010 
seems the only other attack is the
fireball<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:50.660> know<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.809> keep

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
fireball thing and I know if you keep

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.029 
fireball thing and I know if you keep
distance<00:00:52.320> from<00:00:52.530> them

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
distance from them

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.369 
distance from them
it's<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.579> easy<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.910> avoid<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:57.109> I'm<00:00:58.109> not

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it's really easy to avoid the I'm not

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.680 
it's really easy to avoid the I'm not
going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> use<00:00:58.739> any<00:00:58.980> magic<00:00:59.670> until<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> third

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
going to use any magic until the third

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.719 
going to use any magic until the third
part<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> fight<00:01:02.750> second<00:01:03.750> part<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.729> second

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
part of the fight second part is second

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.460 
part of the fight second part is second
and<00:01:05.820> third<00:01:05.970> part<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.360> significantly<00:01:07.200> harder

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and third part are significantly harder

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.250 
and third part are significantly harder
like<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.070> could<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.580> part<00:01:09.260> without

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
like I could get this part without

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
like I could get this part without
losing<00:01:10.590> any<00:01:10.770> how<00:01:11.000> 100%<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> there's<00:01:12.299> no

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
losing any how 100% and there's no

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.640 
losing any how 100% and there's no
checkpoints<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.320> there's<00:01:13.439> no

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
checkpoints for this and there's no

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.160 
checkpoints for this and there's no
checkpoints<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.700> you'll<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.720> good<00:01:16.020> at

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
checkpoints so you'll get really good at

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.480 
checkpoints so you'll get really good at
this<00:01:16.259> first<00:01:16.530> part<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:18.990> like

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
this first part and you can just like

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.679 
this first part and you can just like
kind<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.549> screw<00:01:20.759> around<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.299> how<00:01:21.360> many

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
kind of screw around and see how many

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.850 
kind of screw around and see how many
combo<00:01:22.170> hits<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.950> stuff<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.580> that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.580 

oh<00:01:26.890> yeah<00:01:27.580> so<00:01:28.240> once<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.690> get<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.930> first<00:01:29.110> circle

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
oh yeah so once you get the first circle

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.450 
oh yeah so once you get the first circle
over<00:01:29.830> his<00:01:29.950> head

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
over his head

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.850 
over his head
it<00:01:30.880> becomes<00:01:31.270> significantly<00:01:32.260> harder<00:01:32.500> because

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
it becomes significantly harder because

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.240 
it becomes significantly harder because
there's<00:01:32.980> a<00:01:33.040> fucking<00:01:33.400> satyr<00:01:34.410> that<00:01:35.410> enters<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
there's a fucking satyr that enters the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.590 
there's a fucking satyr that enters the
ring<00:01:36.460> satyr<00:01:36.940> I<00:01:37.270> don't<00:01:37.720> know<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:39.790> strategy<00:01:40.030> here

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
ring satyr I don't know my strategy here

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.820 
ring satyr I don't know my strategy here
is<00:01:41.910> just<00:01:42.910> kind<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.150> avoid<00:01:43.600> him<00:01:43.810> as<00:01:44.350> best<00:01:44.620> you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
is just kind of avoid him as best you

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.490 
is just kind of avoid him as best you
can<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.580> what<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.570> discovered<00:01:47.110> while<00:01:47.260> playing

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500

instantly<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:09.399> I<00:02:09.850> would<00:02:10.780> imagine<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.290> would

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
instantly so I would imagine that would

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.170 
instantly so I would imagine that would
be<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:12.010> good<00:02:12.310> way<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.520> get<00:02:12.790> through<00:02:13.060> this

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
be a really good way to get through this

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.460 
be a really good way to get through this
part<00:02:13.420> at<00:02:14.080> least<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.470> kill<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.800> satyr<00:02:16.470> yeah

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
part at least to kill that satyr yeah

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.230 
part at least to kill that satyr yeah
I'm<00:02:17.590> not<00:02:17.740> sure<00:02:17.770> if<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.100> works<00:02:18.490> because<00:02:19.000> I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
I'm not sure if that works because I

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.350 
I'm not sure if that works because I
didn't<00:02:19.450> try<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.660> really<00:02:20.290> but<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.760> also<00:02:21.910> uses<00:02:22.330> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
didn't try it really but it also uses a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.270 
didn't try it really but it also uses a
ton<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.690> magic<00:02:23.140> oh<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:23.860> one<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.160> more

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
ton of magic oh it's one of the more

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.640 
ton of magic oh it's one of the more
costly<00:02:24.730> welcomes<00:02:25.540> if<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.900> took<00:02:26.140> care<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
costly welcomes if it took care of the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.770 
costly welcomes if it took care of the
satyr<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.660> satyr
