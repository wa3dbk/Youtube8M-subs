you<00:00:50.249> know<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.370> think<00:00:50.460> once<00:00:50.730> Sammy<00:00:50.969> Morris<00:00:51.300> gets

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you know I think once Sammy Morris gets

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.840 
you know I think once Sammy Morris gets
back<00:00:51.839> this<00:00:52.109> kid<00:00:52.350> isn't<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.829> long<00:00:53.039> termer<00:00:53.399> but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
