one kept falling off it was a pain in

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.340 
one kept falling off it was a pain in
the<00:01:44.070> ass<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> noticed<00:01:45.420> was<00:01:45.570> one<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the ass and what I noticed was one of

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.289 
the ass and what I noticed was one of
the<00:01:46.409> ends<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.399> longer<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the ends is a little bit longer and that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.749 
the ends is a little bit longer and that
actually<00:01:48.720> happened<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> outside

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
actually happened to be on the outside

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.190 
actually happened to be on the outside
so<00:01:50.759> whenever<00:01:50.970> they<00:01:51.240> packed<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:51.930> did<00:01:52.079> it

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so whenever they packed it they did it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.280 
so whenever they packed it they did it
wrong<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> had<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> actually<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.540> set<00:01:55.170> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
wrong so I had to actually get a set of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.069 
wrong so I had to actually get a set of
pliers<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.759> push<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.299> carefully<00:01:57.600> on

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
pliers just to push it in carefully on

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.649 
pliers just to push it in carefully on
the<00:01:58.259> long<00:01:58.469> head<00:01:58.710> into<00:01:59.310> his<00:01:59.399> actual<00:01:59.759> forearm<00:02:00.210> so

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the long head into his actual forearm so

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.030 
the long head into his actual forearm so
hopefully<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.320> won't<00:02:01.409> come<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.770> anymore

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
hopefully now it won't come out anymore

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.830 
hopefully now it won't come out anymore
so<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:02.969> thing<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> notice<00:02:03.719> on

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so that's one thing that I notice on

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
so that's one thing that I notice on
mine<00:02:04.189> other<00:02:05.189> than<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.430> he<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.759> pretty<00:02:05.969> cool

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
mine other than that he is pretty cool

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.180 
mine other than that he is pretty cool
is<00:02:06.270> very<00:02:06.479> tight<00:02:06.780> his<00:02:07.560> first<00:02:07.799> time<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.009> could

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
is very tight his first time I could

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.040 
is very tight his first time I could
take<00:02:08.520> him<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.910> box<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.750> guess<00:02:09.899> one

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
take him out of the box and I guess one

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.570 
take him out of the box and I guess one
of<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> reasons<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.649> took<00:02:10.830> me<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.099> long<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
of the reasons they took me this long to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.790 
of the reasons they took me this long to
review<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.180> or<00:02:12.300> even<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.690> show<00:02:12.930> was<00:02:13.170> I

very nice and there all right let me see

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.040 
very nice and there all right let me see
if<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.820> will<00:02:50.970> focus<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.420> little<00:02:51.570> bit<00:02:51.810> there

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
if this will focus a little bit there

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.230 
if this will focus a little bit there
cool<00:02:52.560> these<00:02:53.310> are<00:02:53.370> very<00:02:53.640> nice<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:53.850> their<00:02:54.120> own

cool these are very nice in their own

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.680 
cool these are very nice in their own
right

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
right

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.080 
right
but<00:02:54.930> as<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:56.130> can<00:02:56.280> see<00:02:56.400> they're<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.550> lot<00:02:56.760> smaller

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
but as you can see they're a lot smaller

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.630 
but as you can see they're a lot smaller
they<00:02:58.020> don't<00:02:58.290> have<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.650> hook<00:02:59.340> there

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
they don't have that hook there

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.240 
they don't have that hook there
obviously<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.630> would<00:03:00.900> probably<00:03:01.290> not<00:03:01.560> go<00:03:02.190> too

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
obviously this would probably not go too

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.220 
obviously this would probably not go too
well<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.090> wasn't<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> mass-market

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
well if it wasn't like a mass-market

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
to buy that not notice I mean this isn't

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.620 
to buy that not notice I mean this isn't
this<00:03:10.410> isn't<00:03:10.620> like<00:03:10.970> super<00:03:11.970> blunt<00:03:12.210> or<00:03:12.360> anything

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
this isn't like super blunt or anything

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.840 
this isn't like super blunt or anything
either<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.890> think<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.640> hook<00:03:14.820> right

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
either but I think that hook right

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.430 
either but I think that hook right
there's<00:03:15.210> part<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.510> little<00:03:15.630> bit<00:03:15.870> more<00:03:16.020> dangerous

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
there's part a little bit more dangerous

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.250 
there's part a little bit more dangerous
in<00:03:16.770> terms<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.280> gun<00:03:17.430> colors<00:03:18.209> my<00:03:18.570> camera<00:03:19.080> keeps

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
in terms of gun colors my camera keeps

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.070 
in terms of gun colors my camera keeps
trying<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.590> focus<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.130> arm<00:03:20.310> cradles<00:03:20.730> they're

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
trying to focus on arm cradles they're

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.810 
trying to focus on arm cradles they're
obviously<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.170> even<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.130> skull<00:03:23.459> head<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.790> a

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
obviously the even the skull head is a

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.490 
obviously the even the skull head is a
little<00:03:24.030> bit<00:03:24.180> different<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:25.020> looks<00:03:25.320> like

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
little bit different this looks like

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.560 
little bit different this looks like
there's<00:03:25.770> somebody<00:03:26.070> yelling<00:03:26.459> or<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:27.450> know<00:03:27.540> a

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
there's somebody yelling or you know a

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.750 
there's somebody yelling or you know a
demon<00:03:28.020> whatever<00:03:28.320> yelling<00:03:29.160> now<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.520> there's<00:03:29.700> a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
demon whatever yelling now and there's a

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.150 
demon whatever yelling now and there's a
fire<00:03:30.090> while<00:03:30.690> this<00:03:30.870> one's<00:03:31.080> more<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.440> score

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
fire while this one's more of a score

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.460 
fire while this one's more of a score
actually<00:03:32.370> holding<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.510> does<00:03:33.690> have<00:03:33.900> from<00:03:34.200> a

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
actually holding it it does have from a

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.880 
actually holding it it does have from a
little<00:03:34.890> bit<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.040> detail<00:03:35.580> there<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.150> chain

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
little bit of detail there of the chain

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.370 
little bit of detail there of the chain
being<00:03:37.890> held<00:03:38.220> unlike<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:39.000> one<00:03:39.270> here<00:03:39.690> actually

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
being held unlike this one here actually

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.960 
being held unlike this one here actually
does<00:03:40.739> have<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.070> on<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.280> side<00:03:41.550> sorry<00:03:41.790> there

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
does have it on that side sorry there

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.510 
does have it on that side sorry there
you<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.440> only<00:03:43.560> has<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.920> on<00:03:43.950> one<00:03:44.160> side<00:03:44.400> no

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
you go so it only has it on one side no

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.920 
you go so it only has it on one side no
that<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.850> two<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.150> them<00:03:45.270> right<00:03:45.420> there<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.630> guess

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
that is two of them right there I guess

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.600 
that is two of them right there I guess
I'm<00:03:46.080> freaking<00:03:46.530> blind<00:03:46.830> sorry<00:03:47.190> guys

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
so anyways so then this is actually one

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.979 
so anyways so then this is actually one
of<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.670> chains<00:03:50.910> they<00:03:51.060> actually<00:03:51.390> come<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.780> and

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
of the chains they actually come in and

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.160 
of the chains they actually come in and
these<00:03:52.820> tiny<00:03:53.820> little<00:03:54.209> plastic<00:03:54.510> wrap<00:03:54.900> stones

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
these tiny little plastic wrap stones

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.300 
these tiny little plastic wrap stones
you<00:03:55.290> can<00:03:55.440> see<00:03:55.590> hopefully<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:56.040> kind<00:03:56.250> of

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
you can see hopefully you can kind of

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.540 
you can see hopefully you can kind of
see<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.580> pretty<00:03:56.850> well<00:03:57.770> so<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.310> made

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
see that pretty well so and it is made

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.430 
see that pretty well so and it is made
out<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.850> a<00:03:59.940> metal<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.870> let<00:04:01.200> me<00:04:01.260> bring<00:04:01.380> him

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
out of a metal so let me bring him

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.840 
out of a metal so let me bring him
forward<00:04:01.950> here<00:04:03.500> he<00:04:04.500> has<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.770> like<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> little<00:04:05.670> hole

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
forward here he has a like a little hole

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.310 
forward here he has a like a little hole
right<00:04:05.880> there<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.540> can<00:04:06.690> put<00:04:06.900> one<00:04:07.080> right

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
right there and you can put one right

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.320 
right there and you can put one right
there<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.890> know<00:04:08.430> it's<00:04:08.580> kind<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.790> tough<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.030> see

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
there I know it's kind of tough to see

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.810 
there I know it's kind of tough to see
I'm<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.870> dungeon<00:04:10.380> here<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:10.860> long<00:04:11.130> until<00:04:11.310> I

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
I'm in the dungeon here so long until I

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.270 
I'm in the dungeon here so long until I
get<00:04:11.970> better<00:04:12.180> lighting<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.690> won't<00:04:12.900> be<00:04:13.050> able<00:04:13.170> to

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
get better lighting I won't be able to

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.849 
get better lighting I won't be able to
show<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.340> better<00:04:15.120> detail<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.870> then<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.680> can

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
show you better detail and then you can

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.670 
show you better detail and then you can
either<00:04:16.980> put<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:18.419> rest<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.840> chain<00:04:19.109> on<00:04:19.350> this

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
either put the rest of the chain on this

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.190 
either put the rest of the chain on this
side<00:04:19.980> here<00:04:20.190> on<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.430> peg<00:04:20.669> or<00:04:21.330> you<00:04:21.780> can<00:04:21.960> do<00:04:22.080> it

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
side here on that peg or you can do it

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.510 
side here on that peg or you can do it
on<00:04:22.289> this<00:04:22.470> side<00:04:22.530> here<00:04:22.919> I<00:04:22.950> did<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.280> on<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
on this side here I did it on the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.480 
on this side here I did it on the
outside<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:23.940> mean<00:04:24.300> or<00:04:24.419> whatever<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:25.500> um<00:04:25.770> but

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
outside I mean or whatever so um but

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.810 
outside I mean or whatever so um but
yeah

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
yeah

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.050 
yeah
so<00:04:26.970> that's<00:04:27.390> basically<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:28.050> when<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.320> comes<00:04:28.560> to

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
so that's basically it when it comes to

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.760 
so that's basically it when it comes to
his<00:04:30.060> chaos<00:04:30.450> blade<00:04:30.750> he<00:04:31.140> does<00:04:31.320> come<00:04:31.470> with<00:04:31.620> these

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
his chaos blade he does come with these

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.140 
his chaos blade he does come with these
real<00:04:31.980> nice<00:04:32.130> hook<00:04:32.400> cipher<00:04:32.670> get<00:04:32.790> what<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.000> hell

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
real nice hook cipher get what the hell

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.620 
real nice hook cipher get what the hell
they<00:04:33.300> were<00:04:33.420> called<00:04:33.660> but<00:04:33.870> they<00:04:34.650> give<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:34.860> this

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
they were called but they give you this

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.360 
they were called but they give you this
kind<00:04:36.630> of<00:04:36.750> peg<00:04:36.990> holder<00:04:37.320> right<00:04:37.440> there<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:38.220> can

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
kind of peg holder right there you can

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.920 
kind of peg holder right there you can
put<00:04:38.550> them<00:04:38.640> either<00:04:38.730> together<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:39.480> this<00:04:39.690> or

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
put them either together like this or

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.320 
put them either together like this or
you<00:04:39.990> can<00:04:40.110> make<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.290> cross<00:04:40.650> whatever<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.910> like

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
you can make a cross whatever I like

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.670 
you can make a cross whatever I like
making<00:04:42.630> across<00:04:42.840> this<00:04:43.080> because<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.440> kind<00:04:43.650> of

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
making across this because it kind of

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.620 
making across this because it kind of
looks<00:04:43.830> cool<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.910> just<00:04:45.030> go<00:04:45.210> right<00:04:45.450> through

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
looks cool and you just go right through
