 for that is that you can not anymore what 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.670
 I feel a kilo of clothes 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.050
 among non-EU citizens who 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.780
 they leave the country they highlight the 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.520
 Colombian and Bolivian Colombians but 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.280
 above all of them the 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.090
 Ecuadorians over 45 thousand abandoned 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.460
 Spain last year it is estimated that 7 of 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.680
 every 10 plans to return to Ecuador many 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.720
 come to the national secretariat of 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.540
 migrant in madrid we come to look for 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.330
 information about everything to know what 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.880
 possibilities and in what possibilities 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.430
 you can return to the equator to try 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.259
 seek not to return you with your hands 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.660
 empty but with everything you've achieved 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.580
 here in Spain the data offered by 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.009
 the national statistical institute does not 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.090
 they are an instant photograph the figure 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.759
 real of foreign citizens 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.190
 Residents in Spain today will not know 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.289
 accuracy up to two years from now 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.179
 the number of Latin Americans that 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.460
 are returning to their countries could be 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.440
 actually much greater louis maybe and his 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.759
 family are also Ecuadorians after 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.860
 work in the construction and 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.390
 trade the absence of opportunities for 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 employment has forced them to return to their 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.620
 country in search of a new future 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.110
 future although we have in fact 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.680
 with what little we have done then treat 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.000
 to overcome and do any little thing that 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.610
 let us have our benefit to their 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.170
 backs leave memories and experiences 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.110
 promise of a better future than 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.780
 finally it could not be fulfilled
