00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello everyone is joe cavic 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.430
 today a little video a little 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.600
 weird finally weird weird 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.950
 because in fact simply my 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.190
 computer had little problems 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.780
 so in fact I 'm doing your ends it's 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.910
 as if I had just bought the returns 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.590
 at turn 0 so waiting for me 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.529
 installs me all the stuff and all already 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.060
 once a windows 7 cd 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.070
 because his game can not I think 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 I can not really do anything so in fact 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.550
 there I am under windows vista and I have 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.019
 no connection on windows 8 that so 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.699
 I can not install minecraft the bread 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.369
 stahl and camtasia I can not do anything 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.920
 everything but put online video more of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.170
 shot makes a little video like that so 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.800
 yes I still have it online and you 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.969
 may finally see it maybe but 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.950
 it's on my father's computer or 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.260
 my brother I would put it as it is 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.730
 for that so today so why 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.239
 a video like that to the point to see it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.920
 also a lot just what bah I 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.570
 will you explain it but why 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.890
 not what I'm going to show you 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.719
 little things I made a cardboard 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.100
 I did not take a lot of time 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.059
 to do but here I am so suddenly it's 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 small soup of minecraft 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.540
 we start with the torch so the torch 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.799
 that's good but she's not good because 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.119
 in fact he that phase there that is 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.830
 pretty feint of madness in quotation marks 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.400
 because here you see small 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.860
 spots everywhere here put here fights 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.350
 revenge and glue that sank and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.110
 veiled with a very strong collar whose bottom 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.500
 after we start so infinite finally 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.900
 am by pickaxe here is the pickaxe 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.409
 so she's doing two thick soon 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.850
 yes, here is the thickness of boxes that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.520
 I stuck that I did not color a 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.790
 measure on both lots to color them 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.850
 Black behind small enrollments 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.159
 after the payroll so here is so here I 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.170
 makes a small hole 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.170
 here are all the tools are in diamonds 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.810
 after the call here is the same call 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.820
 behind sent we can see small 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.150
 inscriptions behind as it is for 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.400
 that coward 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.740
 that in fact I stuck the neck here 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.810
 hours a little faith here here except when 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.430
 in fact I made two of them or the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.870
 sleeve was small and the other where the head 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.140
 was small so I cut the handle 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.050
 and the head and I changed with each other 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.560
 so it fits but it's a bit 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.390
 fragile where yes I still did 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.110
 because I find it actually fun to 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.590
 this level 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.720
 So I do it after that so I have 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.770
 finished for all the tools but after 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.820
 I did some little things 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.330
 because I'm bored a little 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.430
 so I made the jump from the avs so 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.520
 this is wrong coloring finally with the fact 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.310
 that I was not super practical is in 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.850
 did I cut inside tope there I 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.200
 cut therein for actually m 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.230
 in fact here I had been fair and I had 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.860
 too much coloring in black from the blow of the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.930
 the idea of ​​cutting morning and color in 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.209
 red like that well that's what it gives 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.650
 it's pretty nice just that we put the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.360
 light 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.810
 here we are a little jump from the same 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.370
 behind so after good there it's gone 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.709
 really someone watts and I did a 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.510
 new 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.290
 it would be for delirium this is all a 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.180
 soon after it stays 3 so I did 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.459
 So the endless mud no compass 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.350
 the clock where the monte it depends so 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.620
 that he had at noon I wanted to do it at 6 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.580
 hours but I have not succeeded so I 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.810
 prefer the case like this here finally 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.489
 it's starting to get interesting I 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.000
 does the apple that I find very 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.290
 nice 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.510
 ouch that is red apple apple 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.620
 I think to make the apple in gold while 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.269
 it's just it's just 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.230
 to take the same pattern and the 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:51.590
 coloring actually yellow yellow yellow 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.049
 friendly so the best is the 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.480
 compass what are you saying that there is a 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.700
 little ties that has it and so suddenly 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.660
 we can find it and it's really 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.549
 nice so that's so I'd rather 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.840
 well done I'm happy too badly 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.510
 here you can see it without his script 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.159
 so here we go 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.010
 So here I propose to vote for 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:20.130
 the compass sent for the apple has 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.540
 sent two to 36 46 22 equal danger 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.210
 so what I propose is 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.500
 to send the excavations conducted on his 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.039
 send a message 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:36.699
 yeah to pick a whole thing that I could 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:38.560
 do so between all this for that 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.030
 after I can do them so it's up to 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.560
 to say I'll try it be the apple 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.870
 fall all that in fact that's all that 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.300
 will you need to do it 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:52.240
 so necker the important cutter could 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.440
 so if you want the apple then you 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.960
 put in a comment 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:02.949
 you can make the apple after so their 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:05.830
 houses the seal of lava the pickaxe the 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.530
 torch the compass or the ax the call 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.970
 off or the sword you put without comment 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.410
 to and after so you would finally decide it 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.449
 I will do it and directly live in 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.099
 cardboard I will take my small size of 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.449
 cartons and I will decide 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.570
 and then after that would cut it off 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.650
 color ray so that's it for you 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.510
 say on the other hand he'll do I 'm 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.460
 just prepare well what I 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.400
 can not make a break I can not 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.080
 not because I do not know how to change 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.760
 the format of the videos even I 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.310
 will film with anything else either 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.490
 will see my but here it is here I am you 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.720
 take a last look here so 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.310
 you send me the name in comment 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.229
 is also good one even if there is a 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.180
 comment I would do it even if you 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.130
 say felt just do the apple 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.330
 please here I will do it as we 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.849
 do not know that it takes a lot of time 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:57.699
 but I 'll go back 30 40 or 45 30 to 45 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.490
 minutes I think that's 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:04.300
 it's really easy to do so 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:07.090
 easy so here we go listen to friends 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.260
 I'm going to say hi to all 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.940
 next thing I'm going to do I'll 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.130
 film happy like that it will be more 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.260
 simple as there is the holidays I 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.240
 could make some like that 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.190
 I will provide you videos even if 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.870
 I do not have much opportunity 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.450
 we pay or make videos on 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.300
 minecraft very nice game audio 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.460
 so I'm going to do that so that 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.460
 this is apple in loge machin you you 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:34.540

 and I will make them cardboard with a 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.950
 sensor so be careful 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.300
 I do it with a cutter after you 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.670
 can do it with a knife if you 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.820
 want but of dance with a cutter or 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:49.180
 the less it suits me all right 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:54.130
 simply simply the effect the 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.510
 focus and so that's it I'm you 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.130
 will offer a lot of videos like that 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.340
 not bad especially we have them 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:05.440
 holidays I would do some not 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.880
 you want and here is the actor all skull 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.210
 since in fact I took glue 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.280
 for you to paste brief 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.450
 so here's after I'll give you too 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.890
 the little tips to make them 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.720
 just because there are some 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:20.770
 little tips to do all that kind 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:23.020
 Bin drain stuff that's the only thing 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.500
 that I can avoid doing that would be the 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.480
 torch 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.930
 if you really want I can do it 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:33.760
 huh but personally I would not like 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:35.140
 too much I do not know I'm going to 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.910

 to do I'm going to film in case if if 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.640
 I did them well but try not to 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.050
 not asked me for a comment here 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.250

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.440
 do not think I will answer your 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.360
 comments anyway so that's it 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.880
