the AC car and basically we'll reach

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
the AC car and basically we'll reach
under<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> map<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.940> underneath

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
under the map and you can see underneath

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
under the map and you can see underneath
the<00:00:45.960> ground<00:00:46.170> he<00:00:46.350> works<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.680> top<00:00:46.920> floors<00:00:47.250> works

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the ground he works on top floors works

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.279 
the ground he works on top floors works
on<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> ground<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.539> works<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.840> any<00:00:49.050> single

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
on the ground it works on any single

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.160 
on the ground it works on any single
corner<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> map<00:00:50.039> building<00:00:50.930> it<00:00:51.930> works

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
corner of the map building it works

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
corner of the map building it works
anywhere<00:00:52.739> basically<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.789> map<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.270> it's

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
anywhere basically on the map so it's

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.939 
anywhere basically on the map so it's
really<00:00:54.840> awesome<00:00:54.960> definitely<00:00:55.590> worth<00:00:55.710> doing

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
really awesome definitely worth doing

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
really awesome definitely worth doing
tough<00:00:56.250> corner<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.820> friends<00:00:57.329> online<00:00:57.480> or

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
tough corner with your friends online or

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.200 
tough corner with your friends online or
stuff<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:59.280> underneath<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.910> map

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
stuff like that see underneath the map

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660 
stuff like that see underneath the map
and<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.230> definitely<00:01:01.559> worth<00:01:01.649> doing<00:01:01.859> plus<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.370> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and so definitely worth doing plus a you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.939 
and so definitely worth doing plus a you
got<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.090> probably<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.539> breach<00:01:04.080> AC<00:01:04.470> car

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
got you can probably a breach AC car

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
got you can probably a breach AC car
under<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.489> map<00:01:05.700> fully<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
under the map fully if you get to the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.080 
under the map fully if you get to the
perfect<00:01:07.560> spot<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.430> perfect<00:01:08.850> format

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
perfect spot on the perfect format

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.780 
perfect spot on the perfect format
basically<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.830> reckon<00:01:11.220> some<00:01:11.430> map<00:01:11.610> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
basically so I do reckon some map you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
basically so I do reckon some map you
can<00:01:12.180> probably<00:01:12.360> travel<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> least<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.080> map<00:01:13.260> if

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
can probably travel the least a map if

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.190 
can probably travel the least a map if
you<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.650> basically<00:01:14.250> yeah<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:15.180> you're<00:01:15.960> doing<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you do basically yeah if you're doing a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
you do basically yeah if you're doing a
certain<00:01:16.500> spot<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.250> most<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> spots

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
certain spot but most of the spots

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.429 
certain spot but most of the spots
basically<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.720> AC<00:01:18.869> car<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.290> goes

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
basically your AC car just goes

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.109 
basically your AC car just goes
underneath<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> map<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.610> stays<00:01:20.850> there

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
underneath the map and just stays there

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.330 
underneath the map and just stays there
and<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.009> gonna<00:01:23.130> show

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and that's it really but I'm gonna show

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
and that's it really but I'm gonna show
you<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.880> con<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.210> wall<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> can
