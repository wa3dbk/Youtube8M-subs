00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
the Dallas Cowboys which is why I've

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.480 
the Dallas Cowboys which is why I've
given<00:01:40.960> them<00:01:41.049> Travis<00:01:41.470> Frederick<00:01:41.710> out<00:01:42.250> of

Wisconsin 643 12 I think makes a lot of
sense<00:01:45.399> and<00:01:45.729> we'll<00:01:45.940> probably<00:01:46.179> end<00:01:46.570> up<00:01:46.929> starting

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
sense and we'll probably end up starting

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.529 
sense and we'll probably end up starting
for<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:47.950> Cowboys<00:01:48.429> if<00:01:48.640> he's<00:01:48.910> around<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.420> the

third<00:01:49.750> round<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.409> would<00:01:50.619> be<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.770> great

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
third round this would be a great

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.100 
third round this would be a great

I<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.450> cowboys<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.990> have<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.380> luxury

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
I think the cowboys can have the luxury

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.530 
I think the cowboys can have the luxury
of<00:02:43.770> taking<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.190> guy<00:02:44.340> like<00:02:44.640> Landry<00:02:45.060> Jones<00:02:45.270> to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
of taking a guy like Landry Jones to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.110 
of taking a guy like Landry Jones to
groom<00:02:45.810> him<00:02:46.020> behind<00:02:46.410> Tony<00:02:46.710> Romo<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.370> Kyle<00:02:47.760> Orton

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
groom him behind Tony Romo in Kyle Orton

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.340 
groom him behind Tony Romo in Kyle Orton
a<00:02:48.330> lot<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.600> production<00:02:49.050> coming<00:02:49.230> out<00:02:49.320> of

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
a lot of production coming out of

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.770 
a lot of production coming out of
Oklahoma<00:02:49.950> has<00:02:50.400> some<00:02:50.730> mechanical<00:02:51.240> issues<00:02:51.570> and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
Oklahoma has some mechanical issues and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.690 
Oklahoma has some mechanical issues and
that's<00:02:51.960> where<00:02:52.140> his<00:02:52.290> problems<00:02:52.680> start<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.280> think

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
that's where his problems start I think

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.250 
that's where his problems start I think
learning<00:02:53.940> from<00:02:54.300> Jason<00:02:54.630> Garrett<00:02:54.930> will<00:02:55.080> help

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
learning from Jason Garrett will help

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.230 
learning from Jason Garrett will help
this<00:02:55.380> guy<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.830> lot<00:02:56.190> he<00:02:56.640> should<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.970> lone

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
this guy out a lot he should have a lone

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.300 
this guy out a lot he should have a lone
solid<00:02:57.750> career<00:02:58.050> as<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.230> number<00:02:58.770> two<00:02:58.980> quarterback

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
solid career as a number two quarterback

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.950 
solid career as a number two quarterback
so<00:02:59.910> I<00:02:59.970> think<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.240> makes<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.510> lot<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.660> sense<00:03:00.780> for

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
so I think it makes a lot of sense for

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.660 
so I think it makes a lot of sense for
the<00:03:01.110> Cowboys<00:03:01.500> take<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.740> guy<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:01.950> Landry<00:03:02.430> Jones
