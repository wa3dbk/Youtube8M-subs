00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everyone okay 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.620
 listen to me it's going great today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.270
 we find ourselves in a small video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.799
 so menus because of the videos of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.990
 minecraft or whatever but today I have 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.330
 want to make a short video of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.099
 so more so here we are to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 how to buy kamas but really 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.720
 cheap and over the phone and serves down 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.240
 of the mecca and it's very fast in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.539
 more so it's compatible on the prod 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.300
 which dofus server 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.769
 so that's 1200 1 1 million 250 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.900
 thousand cammas and for code so his 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.669
 woman could 3 euros and so to me 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.110
 today I'm going to you I'm going to me 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.930
 make four million five hundred thousand 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.570
 so that's going to get me 30 code 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:47.010
 we're going to say about 5 euros 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.270
 so here I started as his charge 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.750
 So here it is blah blah 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.670
 fuck a little so we have to call this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.850
 number there if you live in France well 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.489
 sure 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 and you're going to wait a little more or 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.879
 30 seconds and you will receive a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.230
 code that you enter and you have to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.390
 call four times to receive four 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.210
 codes next if not can pay by 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.200
 credit card or other so that's it 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.220
 then if you live by 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.689
 example at the meeting island in 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.490
 Guadeloupe in Martinique where I do not know 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.350
 I'm crazy crazy that's going 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.180
 in fact if you live ben I do not know 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.380
 me in Switzerland is in the Swiss here 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.380
 it's logic cut makes sense 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.310
 France so far perfect centers 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.620
 so me what am I going to do I'm going 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.000
 actually enter I already called month of 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.770
 I put well I kept well 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.650
 of my codes next so I believe that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.920
 it's a lifetime his life 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.030
 if you phone I believe that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.750
 now it was 24 hours maybe 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.610
 there an idea 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.320
 I do not know if a date of 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.210
 expiry or not brief in any case you 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.650
 call to the needs of your code of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.480
 mark exchange of paper for not 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.510
 forget then wanted to go there 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.090
 on there so because I'm about four 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.790
 million five hundred thousand there are four 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.790
 codes here more than at the last 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.280
 so here I like to go all my 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.380
 bullshit no but more than with d it's 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.210
 the big word four million five hundred 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.950
 a thousand cases not in your qg four 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:16.710
 million five hundred thousand times no sorry 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:20.670
 little sorry so we hope it 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:24.959
 walk and where is the nickname then 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.260
 my to do on minecraft his pizzas your 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.660
 E-mail 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.690
 I was sure had no theft or hd channels but 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.320
 we do not care a little leak commands and 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.680
 I'm sorry for the group of ta 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.220
 career 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.330
 then your order is valid and 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.459
 so and if you make them do that you'll 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.470
 put an error page because you 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.880
 do not do it more than once 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.390
 therefore the voice of those who refuse to 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.300
 15 minutes 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.570
 we find ourselves charles gounod crisis is 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.570
 there everything 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.500
 everything starts so here we are 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.850
 on my bed and darwin oscars actually my 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.770
 mac a little buggy 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.030
 so I could not do a few 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.800
 video screens but against me I 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.630
 did fencing fiat finally with regards to 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.360
 does not particularly shock down from 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.250
 my perso oria an arrival ciani or 75 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.680

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.050

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.450
