00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
now that I've explained to you what we

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.070 
now that I've explained to you what we
need<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.429> do<00:00:02.610> let's<00:00:03.240> take<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.480> look<00:00:03.750> at<00:00:03.899> some

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
need to do let's take a look at some

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.680 
need to do let's take a look at some
video<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.710> I've<00:00:05.040> put<00:00:05.279> into<00:00:05.460> slow<00:00:05.970> motion<00:00:06.000> so

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
video and I've put into slow motion so

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.299 
video and I've put into slow motion so
we<00:00:06.810> can<00:00:06.930> have<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> little<00:00:07.410> more<00:00:07.649> focus<00:00:08.130> on

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
we can have a little more focus on

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.180 
we can have a little more focus on
exactly<00:00:08.910> what<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.300> need<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.599> do<00:00:10.010> getting<00:00:11.010> your

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
exactly what you need to do getting your

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.480 
exactly what you need to do getting your
rpms<00:00:11.910> your<00:00:12.509> front<00:00:12.870> brake<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.860> clutch<00:00:14.130> set

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
rpms your front brake and the clutch set

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.720 
rpms your front brake and the clutch set
perfectly<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.320> first<00:00:16.680> part<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.190> getting<00:00:17.580> a

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
perfectly is the first part of getting a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.779 
perfectly is the first part of getting a
good<00:00:18.060> start<00:00:19.100> once<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.340> your

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
good start once you have your

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.109 
good start once you have your
preparation<00:00:21.720> right<00:00:21.990> next<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.189> about<00:00:23.430> follow

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
preparation right next it's about follow

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.589 
preparation right next it's about follow
through<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> doing<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.470> perfectly<00:00:26.539> okay<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
through and doing that perfectly okay so

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.349 
through and doing that perfectly okay so
let's<00:00:28.080> take<00:00:28.320> another<00:00:28.529> look<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.340> Cooper<00:00:29.820> doing

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
let's take another look at Cooper doing

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.889 
let's take another look at Cooper doing
a<00:00:30.480> start<00:00:30.949> get<00:00:31.949> your<00:00:32.250> feet<00:00:32.520> locked<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.270> tight<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
a start get your feet locked in tight to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.770 
a start get your feet locked in tight to
the<00:00:34.050> pigs<00:00:34.320> make<00:00:35.309> sure<00:00:35.340> your<00:00:35.790> clutch<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.480> set

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the pigs make sure your clutch is set

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.530 
the pigs make sure your clutch is set
properly<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:38.670> sure<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.390> are

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
properly and make sure that you are

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
properly and make sure that you are
getting<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.200> best<00:00:40.530> possible<00:00:41.090> traction

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
getting the best possible traction

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.139 
getting the best possible traction
whenever<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.570> take<00:00:42.780> off<00:00:43.219> now<00:00:44.219> let's<00:00:44.610> listen

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
whenever you take off now let's listen

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.049 
whenever you take off now let's listen
and<00:00:45.300> watch<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.289> Cooper<00:00:46.829> does<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.789> real

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and watch is Cooper does one in a real

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.779 
and watch is Cooper does one in a real
time<00:00:51.440> one<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> biggest<00:00:52.949> differences

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
time one of the biggest differences

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
time one of the biggest differences
between<00:00:54.180> doing<00:00:54.930> an<00:00:55.079> outdoor<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.250> super

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
between doing an outdoor and a super

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.959 
between doing an outdoor and a super
cost<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:58.140> length<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> start<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.309> also

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
cost is the length of the start and also

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.840 
cost is the length of the start and also
how<00:01:00.329> much<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.809> track<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.320> cloud<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.670> will

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
how much the track is cloud you will

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.030 
how much the track is cloud you will
probably<00:01:03.239> need<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.080> back<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.769> bit

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
probably need to get back a little bit

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.090 
probably need to get back a little bit
more<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.390> deeper<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.049> plowed<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.950> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
more the deeper it's plowed so that you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
more the deeper it's plowed so that you
can<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.430> more<00:01:08.760> traction<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.600> keep<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> front

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
can get more traction and keep the front

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.980 
can get more traction and keep the front
end<00:01:10.650> light<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.220> much<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.180> possibly<00:01:12.390> can

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
end light as much as you possibly can

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.890 
end light as much as you possibly can
all<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.799> way<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> first<00:01:14.400> turn<00:01:14.900> it's

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
all the way to the first turn it's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.289 
all the way to the first turn it's
important<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> lot<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> starts<00:01:18.090> on

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
important that you do a lot of starts on

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
important that you do a lot of starts on
different<00:01:18.780> terrain<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.680> learn<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.310> keep

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
different terrain so you learn to keep

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.740 
different terrain so you learn to keep
the<00:01:20.700> rpms<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.320> don't<00:01:22.619> bog<00:01:23.750> while

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the rpms right and you don't bog while

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.999 
the rpms right and you don't bog while
making<00:01:25.020> sure<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.650> doing<00:01:25.860> your

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
making sure you're doing your

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.190 
making sure you're doing your
preparation<00:01:26.939> before<00:01:27.299> every<00:01:27.659> start<00:01:27.689> it's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
preparation before every start it's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.469 
preparation before every start it's
always<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.979> idea<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.579> spin<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> rear

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
always a good idea to spin the rear

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.960 
always a good idea to spin the rear
wheel<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:30.960> bit<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.340> lays<00:01:32.520> right

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
wheel a little bit so that it lays right

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.590 
wheel a little bit so that it lays right
in<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.630> bottom<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> groove<00:01:35.420> once<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
in the bottom of that groove once you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200 
in the bottom of that groove once you
have<00:01:36.750> done<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.100> preparation<00:01:38.100> focus<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
have done your preparation focus on the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
have done your preparation focus on the
gate<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:40.140> sure<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> execute<00:01:41.400> everything

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
gate and be sure to execute everything

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.420 
gate and be sure to execute everything
perfectly<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.229> every<00:01:44.009> start<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.729> do

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
perfectly on every start that you do

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.060 
perfectly on every start that you do
perfection<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:48.479> important<00:01:49.229> even<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
perfection is very important even a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.580 
perfection is very important even a
little<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.030> cross<00:01:51.479> rut<00:01:51.930> coming<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
little bit of a cross rut coming out of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.880 
little bit of a cross rut coming out of
the<00:01:52.799> gate<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.369> cost<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.259> that<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.590> bit

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the gate will cost you that little bit

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.740 
the gate will cost you that little bit
can<00:01:56.250> mean<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.460> difference<00:01:56.640> between<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.420> hole

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
can mean the difference between a hole

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.260 
can mean the difference between a hole
shot<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.439> only<00:01:58.979> being<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> top<00:01:59.820> five

going into the first turn even though
we're<00:02:03.780> talking<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.469> 450<00:02:05.369> here<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.060> make

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
we're talking a 450 here you to make

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.109

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
sure the RPMs are up and there is no bug
