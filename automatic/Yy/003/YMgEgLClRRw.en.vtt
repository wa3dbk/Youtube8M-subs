00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
this point the first way is to stack

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.140 
this point the first way is to stack
them<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.739> then<00:00:59.949> you<00:01:00.040> can<00:01:00.280> punch<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.940> holes

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
them and then you can punch the holes

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.969 
them and then you can punch the holes

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
when using edge processors forgot it I

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.260 
when using edge processors forgot it I
can't<00:02:43.700> straight<00:02:44.700> those<00:02:44.910> are<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.300> moments<00:02:45.770> you

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
can't straight those are the moments you

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:56.480 
can't straight those are the moments you
can<00:02:48.270> use<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.720> ribbon<00:02:51.260> letter<00:02:52.260> or<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:53.400> needle<00:02:55.490> but

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
can use a ribbon letter or a needle but

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.310 
can use a ribbon letter or a needle but
that's<00:02:56.730> why<00:02:56.910> i<00:02:56.940> use<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.330> three<00:02:57.600> hole<00:02:57.870> puncher

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
that's why i use the three hole puncher

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.960 
that's why i use the three hole puncher
is<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:59.330> the<00:03:00.330> holes<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.870> gives<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.970> pretty

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
is because the holes it gives a pretty

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.490 
is because the holes it gives a pretty
big<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:03.450> then<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.930> use<00:03:04.050> whatever<00:03:04.200> kind

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
big and then you can use whatever kind

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.140 
big and then you can use whatever kind
