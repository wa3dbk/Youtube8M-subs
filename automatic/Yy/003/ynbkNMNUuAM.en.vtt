00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.290
 good morning good afternoon good 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.290
 night friends around the world to them 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.590
 greets his friend the imperfect teacher 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:31.690
 this time I'm in front of a 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:35.140
 set of cypresses and iu of a pine 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.380
 already with the purpose of recommending the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.530
 most suitable plants within the 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.500
 conifer that is a family of trees 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.250
 special this division I dedicate it 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.989
 this neighborhood 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.879
 jose manuel reyes you'll see one of 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.559
 many I love you I'm not going to go 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.870
 advancing something already 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.450
 this is this dedicated video for one of 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.940
 my virtual students that I have to 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.480
 called jose manuel reyes who is a young man 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.730
 quite enthusiastic and funny makes a 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.520
 very interesting forensic question that 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.250
 has some value to me because it is one 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.909
 of users who do not insult but who 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.400
 makes correct assessments does 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:23.260
 timely questions does not start is not 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.960
 bad very good look at jose I want to point out 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.909
 that the main conifers that I have 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.100
 worked during my 365 years of 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.750
 experience with him gonz치lez and success 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.940
 I've had with most of them and 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.950
 some failures also not then 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.170
 to begin with let's start with the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.570
 juniper is mandatory 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.570
 the person who grows bonsai has a 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.170
 juniper and talk that yes worry 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.149
 compact and unique the peaceful any 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.490
 kind of juni but you have to have a 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.580
 johnny but to be able to enjoy the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.159
 gonz치lez before a juniper it seems to me that 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.310
 it's the compact no good summit 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.500
 here we have another type of juniper that I 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.439
 I've heard many people say to me 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.530
 they say if you think Edulis not because he has 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.650
 appearance also of cypress and is a 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.140
 kind of juni but but I think but of 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.239
 to be so accurate, I mean juniper os es 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.459
 very beautiful the species and let it bend and 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.170
 it's very nice to do it gonz치lez a 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.120
 each of the new species that has 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.340
 appeared that in Colombia they have 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.830
 made a liter of this is the cypress 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.870
 aureus or the fulfillment of saurians would be 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.090
 the botanical name or the lemon cypress 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.400
 as you would say and water they call the language 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.799
 common that I also recommend it is 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.049
 ready to be designed is 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.980
 extraordinarily it's easy to 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.680
 to work 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.890
 another of the jose plants that you must 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.770
 have mandatory because here for example 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.660
 son of the one who was francisco that I've 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.450
 could I on the network 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.950
 I have a video with this system I think 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.260
 tent 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.660
 to occupy those macrocarpa also like 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.810
 important sedition that I recommend them 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.000
 of superbly look how well close to 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.640
 go ahead and it is possible for you to 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.050
 order a macrocarpa cypress in any 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.720
 nursery and you will be very useful 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.700
 here behind cyprus macrocarpa we have 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.370
 a species also of pyramidal cypress 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.620
 is that they grow long they grow towards 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.250
 up when it is in its natural habitat 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.650
 it is left to very easy to wire and it is a 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.840
 simple is that it is called pyramidal also 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.440
 I highly recommend it and here 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.480
 friend have another plant that I have 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.900
 rendered good effects that is the famous 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.510
 yours not yours will last in yours 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.909
 there will be nothing in Japan but yours 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.829
 It is already green and has very good 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:46.720
 result to do the gonz치lez and for 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:49.180
 last brought for you to see a pine 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.730
 Japanese white also who call it the 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.409
 pine halepensis there is a very species 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.379
 similar also what they call the pine 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.480
 for and flora but it is a good pine 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.400
 time and jose then these are the 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.650
 most important plants of pines and 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.450
 cypresses so you start doing the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.340
 Bonsai chooses you some species that you 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.470
 like in a nursery and then 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.239
 we will continue then still this 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.359
 has its second part where I'm going to do 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.950
 some pruning work and 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.090
 wired especially so that 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.299
 understand better 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.370
 jose manuel that the conifers are 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.039
 extraordinary and thank you very much friends 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.650
