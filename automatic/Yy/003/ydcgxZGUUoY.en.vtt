00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
wrestling around with these for 45

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.880

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
minutes trying to insert them so here's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.580 
minutes trying to insert them so here's
my<00:00:47.160> tip<00:00:47.520> use<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> hairdryer<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:49.079> keep<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
my tip use a hairdryer to keep the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.250 
my tip use a hairdryer to keep the
socket<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.520> temporarily<00:00:51.090> soften<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
socket will temporarily soften the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.740 
socket will temporarily soften the
plastic<00:00:52.489> so<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> need<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.940> apply<00:00:54.239> heat<00:00:54.570> for

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
plastic so you need to apply heat for

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.439 
plastic so you need to apply heat for
about<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.500> two<00:00:55.530> minutes<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:56.910> insert

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
about one to two minutes and then insert

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.720 
about one to two minutes and then insert
the<00:00:57.719> ball<00:00:57.960> park<00:00:58.320> into<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> socket<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the ball park into the socket and it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.569 
the ball park into the socket and it
slips<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.440> looking<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
slips in just like that looking at the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.549

been worth it while we all expected Nika

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.780 
been worth it while we all expected Nika
to<00:02:10.229> knock<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.619> sculpt<00:02:11.009> out<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> park<00:02:11.610> with

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.460 
of articulation at the neck and the head
at<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.370> shoulder<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:20.030> rotates<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.720> moves<00:02:20.900> up

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
at the shoulder it rotates and moves up

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.420 
at the shoulder it rotates and moves up
and<00:02:21.860> down<00:02:22.780> at<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.930> elbow<00:02:24.440> there's<00:02:24.709> rotation

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.360 
and down at the elbow there's rotation
plus<00:02:25.700> its<00:02:25.940> hinge<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.450> move<00:02:26.630> up<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.230> down<00:02:27.500> as<00:02:27.860> it

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
plus its hinge to move up and down as it

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.270 
plus its hinge to move up and down as it
also<00:02:28.849> is<00:02:29.209> at<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:30.050> wrist<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.800> then<00:02:31.040> at<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
also is at the wrist and then at the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.670 
also is at the wrist and then at the
waist<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.819> torso<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.480> hinged<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.440> move

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
waist the torso is hinged so it can move

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.220 
waist the torso is hinged so it can move
forward<00:02:34.220> which<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.580> great<00:02:34.880> piece<00:02:35.180> of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
forward which is a great piece of

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.930 
forward which is a great piece of
articulation<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.350> be<00:02:36.470> included<00:02:37.130> because<00:02:37.640> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
articulation to be included because it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.100 
articulation to be included because it
allows<00:02:38.239> spider<00:02:38.750> gremlin<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.620> peer<00:02:40.010> down<00:02:41.110> gizmo

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
allows spider gremlin to peer down gizmo

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.410 
allows spider gremlin to peer down gizmo
more<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.040> him<00:02:43.220> later<00:02:43.459> but<00:02:43.610> right<00:02:43.940> now<00:02:44.000> let's

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
more of him later but right now let's

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.479 
more of him later but right now let's
get<00:02:44.569> back<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.930> articulation<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.739> abdomen<00:02:46.370> is

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
get back to articulation the abdomen is

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.210 
get back to articulation the abdomen is
also<00:02:46.819> articulated<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.140> also<00:02:48.590> hollow<00:02:48.920> I

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
also articulated this is also hollow I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.699 
also articulated this is also hollow I
guess<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:49.940> leave<00:02:50.209> weight<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.500> legs

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
guess is to a leave weight and the legs

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.860 
guess is to a leave weight and the legs
feature<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.190> host<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.610> articulation<00:02:53.540> there's<00:02:53.810> a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
feature a host of articulation there's a

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.140 
feature a host of articulation there's a
joint<00:02:54.230> where<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.769> legs<00:02:54.980> meet<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.489> body<00:02:55.730> and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
joint where the legs meet the body and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.479 
joint where the legs meet the body and
then<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.959> course<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.410> ball<00:02:57.739> socket<00:02:58.250> joint

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
then of course that ball socket joint

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.809 
then of course that ball socket joint
where<00:02:58.730> we<00:02:58.910> attach<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.630> legs<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:03.760> then<00:03:04.760> a

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
where we attach the legs and then a

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.150 
where we attach the legs and then a
further<00:03:05.209> joint<00:03:05.540> even<00:03:06.110> lower<00:03:06.290> down<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.010> can

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
further joint even lower down so you can

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.460 
further joint even lower down so you can
get<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.340> host<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:07.940> articulation<00:03:08.810> out<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.260> these

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
get a host of articulation out of these

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.740 
get a host of articulation out of these
as<00:03:09.739> an<00:03:09.980> accessory<00:03:10.340> we<00:03:10.610> get<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.850> spider<00:03:11.180> serum

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
as an accessory we get the spider serum

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.600 
as an accessory we get the spider serum
bottle<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:12.410> exactly<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.160> same<00:03:13.400> one<00:03:13.580> as

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
bottle this is exactly the same one as

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.550

snugly in spider gremlins hands I think

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.210 
snugly in spider gremlins hands I think
it<00:03:20.780> would<00:03:20.870> have<00:03:20.959> been<00:03:20.989> more<00:03:21.290> fun<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.920> include

shot<00:03:55.370> really<00:03:55.880> shows<00:03:56.269> why<00:03:56.569> we<00:03:56.840> need<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.200> new

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
shot really shows why we need that new

shot really shows why we need that new
mohawk<00:03:58.190> as<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.970> spider<00:03:59.329> gremlin<00:03:59.660> just<00:04:00.200> has<00:04:00.410> so

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
mohawk as the spider gremlin just has so

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.940 
mohawk as the spider gremlin just has so
much<00:04:01.100> more<00:04:01.519> life<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.569> sculpt<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.620> the

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
much more life to the sculpt and the

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.479 
much more life to the sculpt and the
