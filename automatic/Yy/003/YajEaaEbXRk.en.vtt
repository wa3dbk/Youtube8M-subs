we<00:00:00.420> thoughts<00:00:00.719> on<00:00:00.900> the<00:00:00.989> game<00:00:01.110> as<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.290> whole

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
we thoughts on the game as a whole

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.780 
we thoughts on the game as a whole
because<00:00:01.620> it<00:00:01.800> seemed<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.100> be<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.220> game<00:00:02.429> that<00:00:02.580> took

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
because it seemed to be a game that took

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.370 
because it seemed to be a game that took
a<00:00:02.909> while<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.120> get<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.419> but<00:00:03.780> there's<00:00:04.259> no

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
a while to get going but there's no

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.050 
a while to get going but there's no
doubting<00:00:04.650> we<00:00:04.920> were<00:00:05.040> as<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.220> it<00:00:05.339> as<00:00:05.490> they<00:00:05.640> were<00:00:05.700> I

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
doubting we were as in it as they were I

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.230 
doubting we were as in it as they were I
thought<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.870> ghum<00:00:07.550> fired<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:08.849> them<00:00:08.970> break

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
thought the ghum fired for them break

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.509 
thought the ghum fired for them break
from<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.510> kickoff<00:00:09.660> they<00:00:09.990> had<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> friendly

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
from the kickoff they had a friendly

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.370 
from the kickoff they had a friendly
little<00:00:11.730> five<00:00:12.030> minutes<00:00:12.389> for<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.139> through

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
little five minutes for the the through

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.470 
little five minutes for the the through
a<00:00:13.410> lot<00:00:13.620> us<00:00:13.769> but<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.219> resisted<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.820> well<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.330> were

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
a lot us but we resisted it well we were

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.300 
a lot us but we resisted it well we were
strongly<00:00:15.809> defended<00:00:16.710> well<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.890> thought<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.279> had

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
strongly defended well I thought we had

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.620 
strongly defended well I thought we had
the<00:00:17.490> decent<00:00:17.789> control<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.270> first<00:00:18.449> half

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the decent control of the first half

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.620 
the decent control of the first half
didn't<00:00:19.289> create<00:00:19.529> an<00:00:19.650> off<00:00:19.770> going<00:00:19.980> forward<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.630> no

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
didn't create an off going forward I no

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.120 
didn't create an off going forward I no
longer<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.930> game<00:00:22.170> went<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> more<00:00:22.590> opened<00:00:23.010> up

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
longer the game went the more opened up

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.450 
longer the game went the more opened up
they<00:00:23.580> were<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.000> more<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.330> got<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:25.460> creative

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
they were the more we got a creative

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.950 
they were the more we got a creative
person<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> game<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.510> started<00:00:27.840> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
person to the game and we started to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
person to the game and we started to
look<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.230> threat<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:29.010> almost<00:00:29.519> from

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
look a threat and then almost from

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
look a threat and then almost from
nowhere<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.630> know<00:00:30.750> when<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.349> had<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> good

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
nowhere you know when we had a good

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.229 
nowhere you know when we had a good
control<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> game<00:00:32.399> Cardiff<00:00:32.850> got

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
control of the game Cardiff got

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.030 
control of the game Cardiff got
themselves<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.780> front<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.500> from<00:00:34.739> there<00:00:34.890> it's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
themselves in front and from there it's

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.530 
themselves in front and from there it's
difficult<00:00:35.399> when<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.700> haven't<00:00:36.000> defeat<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
difficult when you haven't defeat and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.569 
difficult when you haven't defeat and
defeat<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.960> defeat<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.829> find<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.280> resolve

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
defeat and defeat to find the resolve

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.069 
defeat and defeat to find the resolve
and<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> resilience<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.629> back<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and the resilience to get back in the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.930 
and the resilience to get back in the
game<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.500> difficult<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.250> players<00:00:41.520> showed<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
game is difficult the players showed it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.139 
game is difficult the players showed it
we<00:00:42.420> created<00:00:42.809> chances<00:00:42.950> by<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> moment<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
we created chances by the moment the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
we created chances by the moment the
bows<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.600> fallin<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:45.930> us<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:47.100> don't

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
bows not fallin for us I just don't

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.549 
bows not fallin for us I just don't
worry<00:00:47.579> when<00:00:47.850> she<00:00:48.750> say<00:00:48.930> there's<00:00:49.170> no<00:00:49.289> doubting

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
worry when she say there's no doubting

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.470 
worry when she say there's no doubting
that<00:00:49.800> we're<00:00:50.070> creating<00:00:50.190> chances<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> ball

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
that we're creating chances but the ball

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.119 
that we're creating chances but the ball
just<00:00:51.660> doesn't<00:00:52.020> seem<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.010> there

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
in the back of the net whether it's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
in the back of the net whether it's

it's<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.550> save<00:00:56.760> whatever<00:00:57.059> each<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.780> just

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it's a one to save whatever each it just

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840 
it's a one to save whatever each it just
won't<00:00:58.109> go<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> moment<00:00:58.829> yeah<00:00:59.489> but

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
won't go in at the moment yeah but

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.630 
won't go in at the moment yeah but
sometimes<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.510> happened<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.640> the

sometimes I happened you know and the
other<00:01:02.789> end<00:01:03.030> reason<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.690> we've<00:01:03.780> been

other end reason that we've been

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.109
