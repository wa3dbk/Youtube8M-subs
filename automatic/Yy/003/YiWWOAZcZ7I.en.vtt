00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.640
 lots to all and welcome to this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.830
 video a bit special today since 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.139
 it will not be new the challenge this 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.179
 will be a little shorter video on 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.610
 yellow pokemon as you can see 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.940
 in fact I would have spoken yesterday in my 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.430
 video 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.960
 like we could get a pokemon 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.759
 level without enough easily 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.259
 such beginning of the game finally speaks early 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.279
 in fact it it comes to the john forest 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.320
 so from the jade forest in 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.880
 do you can 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.390
 and money you can get a 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.730
 pokemon level 100 then there is not bad 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.650
 of things that must have been done 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.720
 before that will not be that much 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.450
 done so there you see I'm in front 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.030
 the jade forest in the jane forest and 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.360
 so you have to see it go through 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.580
 and have already been to argentat once 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.540
 buy a rope out I wanted 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.540
 show that she is there 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.700
 here are the preparations are good and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.980
 especially we should not have beaten this 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.120
 trainer, do not beat him he does not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.760
 do not need the tray to avoid any 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 just spent there and so I'm going to you 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.090
 show how to get this level this 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.070
 does not say that the capture of the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.720
 Russia this because I tried to little 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.190
 before I did not manage the capture 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.330
 I would like to show you anyway 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.220
 to prove to you that it's not 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.080
 bullshit and that bug is pretty funny 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.740
 even if he removes the challenge of 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.430
 game so you put here and you go 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.050
 move left 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.619
 pressing the key at the same time 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.780
 start here is the menu will appear you 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.220
 select the rope exit the trainer 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.860
 will have the exclamation point but 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.520
 you have teleported 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.690
 this is like this so from here we 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.880
 can no longer access the start menu is 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.130
 unable to access the menu 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.659
 so we will go to the right of the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.590
 city ​​for like that to get out of the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.659
 city ​​and you will see 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.670
 already for the first part of the bugue 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.049
 so already there the gentleman you see I 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.789
 pass in front of him normally they will you 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.789
 stop but no he will stop me a little 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.350
 further on he was looking for a 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.509
 adversary I am me he will bring us 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.140
 in front of the queen as expected as 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.860
 before so far nothing of anything 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.860
 particular 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.200
 like this 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.450
 and so hey we do not know where we're going 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.319
 goes from elsewhere to the other side a 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.680
 wall with wooden pylons from elsewhere 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.889
 and so here you go down to the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.769
 jade forest and you will meet 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:35.499
 a wild pokemon any of the 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.480
 first and you go spam and darracq 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:40.150
 roar it takes spam and attac 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.849
 ratatat judgment so I believe that 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.630
 according to the exodus and so badly I want 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.340
 should land on 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.220
 on need hawking then i'm going to speed up 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.620
 just the little part of the fight 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.790
 because it's just roar 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.210
 high level the us menditte acts of the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.150
 housing 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.190
 it's ready, it's okay, it's okay 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.190
 can kill him 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.950
 while to the critics great this more 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.340
 quickly and then where are you going down from the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.569
 jade forest 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.569
 and you're going to have a big surprise 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.790
 hello, you have a pikachu and fight 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.510
 pokemon 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.609
 and annie of wild king appears this 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.689
 very strange as there I confess that 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.650
 I had fallen on it purely by chance 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.799
 I do not even remember how 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.799
 anyway 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.970
 it creates sacred links blog is so 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.670
 according to the excuse me according 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.470
 from pokemon co ba far above the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.700
 forest you will have a variant 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.960
 different to you will be able to fall on 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.730
 flagada svelte obr I think weird air 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.410
 stuff of which two kinds good there I 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.620
 accelerated mini than what we without 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.620
 plug 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.380
 that's defense and a half to the maximum and I 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.380
 diminishes his attack too 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.010
 the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.010
 I was trying pokemon 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.700
 here is the catch is quite complicated 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.120
 capture is quite complicated and does not 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.120
 do not attack you 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.140
 go go go go go go rest 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.140
 in 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.720
 I'm gonna be able to you 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.130
 show how it works before 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.840
 I had not managed to capture so there I 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.130
 I'm pretty happy I just got you 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.240
 to show it's really a sick thing 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.090
 here's want to give you a nickname to 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.330
 nidau who do not have I do not care 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.710
 so I passed I do not want that 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.760
 i call heal i just want to use 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.979
 a small position on a pikachu 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.979
 since these video points 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.970
 here we are going to cure as wet at 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.970
 Kenya 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.110
 you put it in first position 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.440
 and you will fight 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.470
 like this here 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.010
 1st cool ok 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.740
 here is forward nor so free docking 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.930
 it's normally impossible in this game 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.930
 since the minimum is 2.2 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.740
 here 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.660
 3 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.099
 and at the end of the fight if everything happens 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.099
 well he should go up the level seems 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.220
 this is very effective 11 points 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.169
 of exp and lido kingking montoni rise in 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.300
 here 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.529
 have not dreamed this is not a joke 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.289
 that it is a solid level and 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:44.430
 authentic with 295 p v good of course 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.550
 the stats are not terrible because 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.800
 that you do not increase level 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.819
 level but directly so the he 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.499
 is not all that erases the 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.849
 workouts and it's that it goes to the 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:59.639
 minimal trap are xp points 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.560
 here and so as I explained to you 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:05.100
 according to them 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.100
 according to 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.150
 the pokemon that beat early before 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.880
 back in the forest ged you'll 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.930
 a different pokemon to fight does not 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.300
 do not show all variants 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.280
 because there are some I 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.780
 still believe a lot 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.040
 basically that's it too know that if 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.720
 you do not use the tax roars 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.240
 your pokemon will be level 7 and not 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.320
 will not show level 100 so that's a 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.460
 choice that you can do too if 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.150
 you still want to keep a 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.560
 minimum of challenge for the game what's that 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.060
 It is as you want 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.030
 it's up to you to see it's not me who 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.300
 mastery and of the thing so here I 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.800
 wish you a good day or good 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.930
 late evening like that depends where we are 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.930
 watched it video and see you next time
