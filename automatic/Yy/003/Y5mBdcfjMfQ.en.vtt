00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.370
 in the next few minutes let's talk about 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.070
 assessment by magnetic resonance imaging 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 responds in the air to the south paws negative 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.840
 responds by its negative ones aside 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.920
 will be evaluated both by an issue 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.609
 with the role of the image in the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.219
 diagnosis and follow-up of these 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.010
 changes in relation to the definition of 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.750
 sponge four seronegative draws 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.149
 they constitute a group of diseases that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.200
 with low back pain 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.280
 inflammatory sack and spondylitis milk and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.680
 in theory, they have a strong relationship with 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.059
 old on disc human compatibility 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.350
 or hd 27 and they have as a common factor 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.000
 association with rheumatoid factor 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.550
 negative is all of them so they are 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.460
 the seronegative because they have a 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.689
 negative rheumatoid factor 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.770
 traditionally this group of 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.619
 changes is described in different and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.880
 technologies such as spondylitis 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.520
 ankylosing psoriatic arthritis 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.549
 also called arthritis. 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.259
 inflammatory bowel inflammation and 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.200
 juvenile idiopathic arthritis 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.200
 although a new classification 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.140
 has been suggested in 2009 by the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.439
 ss classifying these sponges 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.820
 axial or peripheral arthropathies 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.869
 depending on the focus of the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.840
 inflammatory response of the clinical 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.700
 patient patients can present a 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.829
 change a complaint to the clinic 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.229
 predominantly axial or 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.869
 clinical complaint predominantly in the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.090
 or in the joint in the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.670
 acrylic joints or may 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.210
 submit with a complaint eminently 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.210
 peripheral committing to hands or feet
