00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.070
 and now we propose a championship 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.080
 particular where they run special pilots 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.759
 that not even a serious injury could 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.039
 stop demonstrating how 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.110
 passion, technology and willpower 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.180
 they can do a lot and like godmother 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:29.109
 special there is annalisa minetti raised 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:31.660
 cardona annalisa minetti overalls gloves 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.580
 boots and safety helmet puts the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.550
 usual self-mockery just before getting on 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.500
 riding a kawasaki 600 two-seater ed 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.930
 deal with the world champion manuel poggiali 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.699
 two laps of the track at 200 per hour between 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.340
 curbs of the Roman circuit of 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.410
 vallelunga for her yet another challenge 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.079
 who is blind about things he has done 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.960
 really many and all with success 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.109
 concerts to books from the paralympics to 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.940
 World Cup with gold and records in the 800 and 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.100
 I would like people to take security 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.350
 of their abilities and without having to 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.140
 get to suffer so enormously for 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.700
 a debilitating physical state but 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.320
 to know that the advantage of each of us 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.119
 it is precisely in diversity in being 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.100
 different from each other and have the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.009
 want to show everyone that everything is 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.940
 possible especially when everything 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.979
 seems lost 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.229
 they are taught by the team pilots 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.780
 otherwise disabled at the first one 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.760
 racing experience run on racing cars 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.160
 in two wheels in the classes 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.230
 and 600 to feel the adrenaline of 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.200
 speed and the excitement of the race for 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.480
 challenge the other able-bodied and if 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.580
 same without trying to force the 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.710
 better performance but also just for 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.220
 rediscover the pleasure of returning to 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.530
 saddle 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.820
 if this is the guys team we are in 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.890
 3d members are missing someone 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.650
 so many people so many people 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.120
 approval of respect esteem 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.280
 boarding guys who come to us 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.190
 finding these press for satisfaction 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.530
 the most beautiful is one who does not know who started a 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.960
 year ago as emiliano also enrico e 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.210
 without a leg and as he drives the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.250
 motorcycle with a special prosthesis from 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.240
 profession is a dentist but when 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.119
 gets in motion because passion is this 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.790
 is that of speed is that of 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.209
 detach bend reopen of gas 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.940
 look ahead you must not give up e 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.280
 each of us has an inner grit 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.930
 that must come out and it can be done 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.570
 there is so much passion but above all 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.000
 courage behind their stories and there are those 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.040
 like giuseppe without an arm in 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.470
 following an accident at work has 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.120
 decided to join the group realizing 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.130
 the dream of racing on the track 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.709
 what I failed to do from 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.959
 vida healthy person I can do it 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.200

 tread to determine the grid 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.140
 there are also those starting from vallelunga 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.090

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.830
 precious second place in the class 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.780

 luca rai who has the left arm 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.099
 paralyzed is a genuine talent on 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.959
 track runs like a special glove from 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.670
 a lady and a brake linkage e 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.769
 clutch perfectly aligned 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.080

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.910
 do everything only with your right hand 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.390
 you have to have first of all really 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.959
 so much passion to arm yourself so much 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.819
 patience and try to get some

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.390
 problems that you have to have 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.069
 obviously try to find the 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.049
 best solution is how to get a 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.540
