ways<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.780> i'm<00:01:30.960> using<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> xbox<00:01:32.520> DVR<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
ways if i'm using the xbox DVR and it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.810 
ways if i'm using the xbox DVR and it
shows<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.400> don't<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> go

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
shows up like that you don't have to go

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.219 
shows up like that you don't have to go
into<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> replay<00:01:36.329> mode<00:01:36.479> fret<00:01:36.720> obviously

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
into the replay mode fret obviously

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.080

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
because it'll show the game like kind of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.600 
because it'll show the game like kind of
live<00:01:39.240> ads<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.630> happening<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.549> sure
