correctly we'll be able to spin the

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.689 
correctly we'll be able to spin the
wheel<00:00:29.569> the<00:00:30.259> wheel<00:00:30.529> will<00:00:30.739> return<00:00:31.099> determine

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
wheel the wheel will return determine

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.939 
wheel the wheel will return determine
how<00:00:31.880> many<00:00:31.939> moves<00:00:32.419> up<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.840> ladder<00:00:33.079> each<00:00:33.590> team

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
questions might be about and they give

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.680 
questions might be about and they give
the<00:00:57.500> first<00:00:57.769> team<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.609> red<00:00:58.850> team<00:00:59.149> let's<00:00:59.390> say<00:00:59.600> in

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
the first team the red team let's say in

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.200 
the first team the red team let's say in
this<00:00:59.809> case<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.679> question<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.460> red<00:01:01.640> team<00:01:01.910> in

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
this case the question the red team in

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.119 
this case the question the red team in
this<00:01:02.359> case<00:01:02.600> gets<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.989> question<00:01:03.410> right<00:01:03.710> so

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
this case gets the question right so

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.090 
this case gets the question right so
we're<00:01:04.400> going<00:01:04.579> to<00:01:04.729> click<00:01:04.939> spin<00:01:05.329> the<00:01:05.479> wheel<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
we're going to click spin the wheel the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.910 
we're going to click spin the wheel the
wheel<00:01:07.310> will<00:01:07.549> spin<00:01:07.579> and<00:01:08.299> it<00:01:08.600> lands<00:01:09.020> on<00:01:09.140> move<00:01:09.500> 1

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
wheel will spin and it lands on move 1

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.109 
wheel will spin and it lands on move 1
so<00:01:10.369> I'm<00:01:10.490> going<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:10.850> click<00:01:11.090> move<00:01:11.420> red<00:01:11.750> team<00:01:12.079> once

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
so I'm going to click move red team once

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.120 
so I'm going to click move red team once
by<00:01:14.119> clicking<00:01:14.180> them<00:01:14.720> once<00:01:14.990> their<00:01:15.380> red<00:01:15.619> dot<00:01:15.890> now

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
by clicking them once their red dot now

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.120 
by clicking them once their red dot now
goes<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.490> space<00:01:17.329> 1<00:01:17.750> where<00:01:18.290> they<00:01:18.470> are<00:01:18.590> there<00:01:18.829> I

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
goes to space 1 where they are there I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.240 
goes to space 1 where they are there I
asked<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.210> blue<00:01:20.390> team<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:20.930> go<00:01:21.079> next<00:01:21.560> they<00:01:22.070> get

a question and they get it correct so
I'm<00:01:24.079> going<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.439> also<00:01:24.619> again<00:01:24.920> now<00:01:25.280> hit<00:01:25.460> spin<00:01:25.790> the

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
I'm going to also again now hit spin the

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.410 
I'm going to also again now hit spin the
wheel<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:27.320> will<00:01:27.560> spins<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.969> blue<00:01:29.180> team

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
wheel it will spins and the blue team

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.620 
wheel it will spins and the blue team
gets<00:01:29.930> two<00:01:30.680> moves<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:31.820> I'm<00:01:31.909> going<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.210> click<00:01:32.420> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
gets two moves so I'm going to click the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.289 
gets two moves so I'm going to click the
blue<00:01:32.780> button<00:01:33.079> twice<00:01:33.759> this<00:01:34.759> will<00:01:35.030> cause<00:01:35.270> the

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
blue button twice this will cause the

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.340 
blue button twice this will cause the
blue<00:01:35.780> circle<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.649> move<00:01:36.829> to<00:01:37.040> space<00:01:37.310> 2<00:01:38.350> again

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
blue circle to move to space 2 again

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.760 
blue circle to move to space 2 again
this<00:01:39.590> is<00:01:39.829> basically<00:01:40.130> how<00:01:40.219> it<00:01:40.399> continues<00:01:41.149> until

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
this is basically how it continues until

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.709 
this is basically how it continues until
one<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.159> teams<00:01:43.460> gets<00:01:43.880> their<00:01:44.149> dot<00:01:44.360> all<00:01:44.659> the

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
one of the teams gets their dot all the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.990 
one of the teams gets their dot all the
way<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.710> top<00:01:45.950> where<00:01:46.250> they<00:01:46.399> have<00:01:46.520> performed
