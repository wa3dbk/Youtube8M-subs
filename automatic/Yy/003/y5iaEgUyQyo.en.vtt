right through your backside and that's

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.500 
right through your backside and that's
what's<00:02:24.650> really<00:02:24.740> strange<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.850> don't<00:02:26.000> understand

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
what's really strange I don't understand

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.780 
what's really strange I don't understand
why<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.930> makes<00:02:27.320> such<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> big<00:02:27.830> difference<00:02:28.340> as<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
why it makes such a big difference as to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.120 
why it makes such a big difference as to
what<00:02:29.150> side<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:32.020> copper<00:02:33.020> ground<00:02:33.350> pipe<00:02:33.739> is

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
what side that copper ground pipe is

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.250 
what side that copper ground pipe is
located<00:02:34.820> in<00:02:34.970> unless<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.510> makes<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.810> difference

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
located in unless it makes a difference

located in unless it makes a difference
if<00:02:36.770> it's<00:02:37.010> got<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.580> be<00:02:37.730> centered<00:02:38.060> between<00:02:38.450> those

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
if it's got to be centered between those

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.300 
if it's got to be centered between those
I'm<00:02:41.900> gonna<00:02:42.140> give<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.500> camera<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.950> my<00:02:43.070> dad

right now I'm gonna show you the
difference<00:02:45.050> in<00:02:45.200> results<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:45.950> voltage<00:02:46.459> when<00:02:47.239> I

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
difference in results and voltage when I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.360 
difference in results and voltage when I
move<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:47.900> pipe<00:02:48.230> from<00:02:48.590> one<00:02:48.800> side<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.130> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
move that pipe from one side to the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.840 
move that pipe from one side to the
other<00:02:49.489> right<00:02:49.940> now<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:50.300> in<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.510> front<00:02:50.840> and

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
other right now it's in the front and

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.250 
other right now it's in the front and
right<00:02:52.850> now<00:02:53.060> we've<00:02:53.360> got<00:02:54.130> what<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.400> eighty

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
right now we've got what is it eighty

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.630 
right now we've got what is it eighty
four<00:02:57.260> point<00:02:57.800> eight<00:02:58.100> volts<00:02:59.680> okay

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
four point eight volts okay

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640 
four point eight volts okay
okay<00:03:03.390> I'm<00:03:03.510> gonna<00:03:03.690> hand<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.080> camera<00:03:04.350> over

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
okay I'm gonna hand the camera over

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.790 
okay I'm gonna hand the camera over
should<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.400> good<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.800> don't

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
should be good just like that I don't

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.140 
should be good just like that I don't
think<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.070> have<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.580> many<00:03:08.760> things

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.850 

right<00:03:12.390> here

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.440 

Hey

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
Hey

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.550 
Hey
all<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.170> pipes

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.060 

over<00:03:24.190> over<00:03:24.460> to<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:24.970> left<00:03:25.270> or<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.080> right<00:03:26.200> side

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
over over to the left or the right side

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.070 
over over to the left or the right side
the<00:03:27.700> coil<00:03:27.970> now

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.660 

see<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.770> voltage<00:03:33.250> there<00:03:34.710> maybe<00:03:35.710> four<00:03:36.160> four

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
see the voltage there maybe four four

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.410 
see the voltage there maybe four four
four<00:03:37.480> three<00:03:37.630> two<00:03:38.350> one<00:03:39.010> it's<00:03:39.430> going<00:03:39.730> down<00:03:40.060> down

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
four three two one it's going down down

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
four three two one it's going down down
down<00:03:41.040> down<00:03:42.270> just<00:03:43.270> because<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.540> slightly<00:03:43.930> moved

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
down down just because I slightly moved

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.920 
down down just because I slightly moved
this<00:03:44.880> if<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.000> could<00:03:46.150> show<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.480> camera<00:03:46.840> over

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
this if you could show the camera over

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.730 
this if you could show the camera over
here<00:03:47.230> again<00:03:47.470> death

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:03.620 

backside

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.810 

and<00:04:04.140> it's<00:04:04.290> not<00:04:04.500> from<00:04:04.710> my<00:04:04.830> hands<00:04:05.220> touching<00:04:05.520> it

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
and it's not from my hands touching it

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.910 
and it's not from my hands touching it
because<00:04:06.090> I've<00:04:06.240> checked<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.690> out<00:04:06.810> before<00:04:07.260> I've

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
because I've checked it out before I've

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.290 
because I've checked it out before I've
held<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.400> with<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.640> tape<00:04:09.860> or

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.840 

move<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.690> left<00:04:14.900> side

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.840 

that<00:04:18.660> going<00:04:19.170> down

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.550 

just<00:04:22.480> because<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:23.020> where<00:04:23.320> exactly<00:04:24.300> position

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
just because of where exactly position

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.330 
just because of where exactly position
the<00:04:26.560> ground<00:04:26.860> point<00:04:28.590> we<00:04:29.590> put<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:30.010> right<00:04:30.040> the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
the ground point we put it right the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.640 
the ground point we put it right the
front<00:04:30.700> again<00:04:30.880> in<00:04:31.150> our<00:04:31.240> best<00:04:31.510> position

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.820 

why<00:04:36.330> that's<00:04:37.330> our<00:04:37.570> best<00:04:37.780> position<00:04:38.350> is<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.650> big

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
why that's our best position is the big

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.680 
why that's our best position is the big
question

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:49.689 

so

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.330 

position<00:04:50.699> exactly<00:04:51.300> right

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
position exactly right

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.179 
position exactly right
there's<00:04:53.340> right<00:04:53.699> in<00:04:53.849> the<00:04:53.909> front<00:04:54.210> right<00:04:54.599> there

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:55.189 
there's right in the front right there

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:03.649 
there's right in the front right there
it's<00:04:56.189> gotta<00:04:56.460> be<00:04:56.610> straight<00:04:57.530> also<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:02.509> all<00:05:03.509> right

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
it's gotta be straight also so all right

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:08.220 
it's gotta be straight also so all right
thanks<00:05:04.110> dad

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.710 

oh<00:05:08.520> there<00:05:09.520> is<00:05:09.730> let's<00:05:10.060> give<00:05:10.240> them<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.390> round<00:05:10.540> of

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
oh there is let's give them a round of

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.530 
oh there is let's give them a round of
applause<00:05:14.820> well<00:05:15.820> yeah<00:05:15.940> that's<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.360> big

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
applause well yeah that's the big

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.740 
applause well yeah that's the big
question<00:05:16.690> right<00:05:17.200> now<00:05:17.230> is<00:05:17.650> uh<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.400> if<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.390> try<00:05:19.690> to

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
question right now is uh and if I try to

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.440 
question right now is uh and if I try to
if<00:05:20.380> I<00:05:20.560> get<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:20.950> copper<00:05:21.490> pipe<00:05:21.760> in<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.120> exact

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
if I get that copper pipe in the exact

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.630 
if I get that copper pipe in the exact
the<00:05:22.630> best<00:05:22.900> position<00:05:23.560> like<00:05:23.800> it<00:05:23.980> is<00:05:24.100> right<00:05:24.370> now

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
the best position like it is right now

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.450 
the best position like it is right now
and<00:05:24.910> then<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.660> try<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.080> put<00:05:26.260> other<00:05:26.680> copper<00:05:27.190> rods

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
and then I try to put other copper rods

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.480 
and then I try to put other copper rods
or<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:28.330> ferret<00:05:28.780> rod<00:05:29.020> down<00:05:29.350> inside<00:05:29.860> at<00:05:30.190> this

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
or the ferret rod down inside at this

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.600 
or the ferret rod down inside at this
point<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.930> does<00:05:32.260> not<00:05:32.590> increase<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.730> voltage

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
point it does not increase the voltage

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.890 
point it does not increase the voltage
so<00:05:36.610> that's<00:05:36.820> very<00:05:37.060> strange

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.080 

having<00:05:42.530> a<00:05:42.590> hard<00:05:42.889> time<00:05:43.130> figuring<00:05:43.400> things<00:05:43.850> out

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
having a hard time figuring things out

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.640 
having a hard time figuring things out
here<00:05:44.620> going<00:05:45.620> from<00:05:45.830> 86<00:05:46.340> volts<00:05:46.790> to<00:05:46.970> 126<00:05:47.960> volts<00:05:48.470> I

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
here going from 86 volts to 126 volts I

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.580 
here going from 86 volts to 126 volts I
mean<00:05:49.330> we're<00:05:50.330> all<00:05:50.480> over<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:50.930> place<00:05:50.960> just<00:05:51.200> a

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
mean we're all over the place just a

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.820 
mean we're all over the place just a
matter<00:05:51.830> of<00:05:51.950> fine-tuning<00:05:52.460> this<00:05:53.120> up<00:05:53.330> and<00:05:53.510> down<00:05:53.690> a

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
matter of fine-tuning this up and down a

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.200 
matter of fine-tuning this up and down a
fine-tuning<00:05:54.830> of<00:05:55.040> positioning<00:05:55.910> of<00:05:56.030> that

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
fine-tuning of positioning of that

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.570 
fine-tuning of positioning of that
fine-tuning<00:05:57.080> of<00:05:57.290> the<00:05:57.740> depth<00:05:58.010> of<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.340> rods

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
fine-tuning of the depth of the rods

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.659 
fine-tuning of the depth of the rods
inside<00:05:59.210> there<00:06:00.010> there's<00:06:01.010> a<00:06:01.130> lot<00:06:01.280> of<00:06:01.430> stuff

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
inside there there's a lot of stuff

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.260 
inside there there's a lot of stuff
going<00:06:01.970> on<00:06:02.120> here

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.170 

high<00:06:06.020> humidity<00:06:06.260> today<00:06:07.040> it<00:06:07.250> rained<00:06:07.580> early<00:06:08.000> this

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
high humidity today it rained early this
