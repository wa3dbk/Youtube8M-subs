 I do not know I know him I know him 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.290
 this is the music of my dream 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.900
 I wrote inter movements imagining 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.310
 our repeated encounters in different lives 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.010
 different ages 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.840
 I can't explain it I knew when 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.740
 I opened that door 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.940
 a powerful waking path through the bones 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.370
 I felt it in a dream 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.770
 I was in a terrific coffee and 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.770
 maids all had the same lot 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.809
 you don't have to hide 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.809
 I know who you are sums 4 5 1 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.900
 yesterday my life was going in one direction 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.240
 today it goes towards another 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:20.130
 I never think the universe is against 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.770
 she fear faith love 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.810
 phenomena that determine the course of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.030
 our life 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.399
 these forces begin long before that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.579
 we are born and continue after ours 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.579
 end 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.040
 our life does not belong to us 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.130
 we are linked to others 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.340
 satie 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.659
 and present 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.659
 and from every crime 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.380
 every kindness 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.380
 we generate our future 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.770
 I will not leave you appear so far 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.680
 I believe there is another world that exists 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.550
 awaits a better world 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.550
