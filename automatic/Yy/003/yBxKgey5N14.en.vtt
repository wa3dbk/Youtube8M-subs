00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
by Chris how about the first one I guess

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
by Chris how about the first one I guess
records<00:01:13.710> said<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:13.979> had<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> best<00:01:14.909> fan<00:01:15.330> in

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
records said I had to be the best fan in

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
records said I had to be the best fan in
the<00:01:15.600> history<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> w18<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.799> my<00:01:17.009> opinion<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the history of the w18 a my opinion and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.010 
the history of the w18 a my opinion and
then<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> couple<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.900> minutes

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
then it was just a couple of minutes

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
then it was just a couple of minutes
later<00:01:19.380> when<00:01:19.590> he<00:01:19.650> accomplished<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> same

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
later when he accomplished the same

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
later when he accomplished the same
thing

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
thing

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.960 
thing
I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:22.740> David<00:01:23.130> Young's<00:01:23.370> chance

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I think this was David Young's chance

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
I think this was David Young's chance
whose<00:01:24.270> opportunity<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.440> try<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.800> prove<00:01:26.070> he

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
whose opportunity to try and prove he

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.930 
whose opportunity to try and prove he
was<00:01:26.370> lost

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
was lost

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.110 
was lost
then<00:01:27.210> he<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.690> all<00:01:27.870> I<00:01:28.350> mean<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.940> heavy

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
then he can do it all I mean the heavy

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.500 
then he can do it all I mean the heavy
ones

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510
