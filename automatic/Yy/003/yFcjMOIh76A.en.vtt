00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.040 
of all of these i think bang bang is a
previous<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:43.789> but<00:00:44.789> bella<00:00:45.090> dama<00:00:45.300> two<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.870> more

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
previous one but bella dama two is more

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.590 
previous one but bella dama two is more
pigmented<00:00:46.800> i<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> deal

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
pigmented i don't know what the deal

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.569 
pigmented i don't know what the deal
what<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> whole

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
what that is but I'm because the whole

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.049 
what that is but I'm because the whole
point<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.239> show<00:00:51.300> these<00:00:51.539> two<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:53.059> dark

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
point is just to show these two so dark

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.340 
point is just to show these two so dark
room<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.480> rubble<00:00:55.410> rubble<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.399> satin<00:00:56.910> finish

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
room and rubble rubble if a satin finish

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.160 
room and rubble rubble if a satin finish
so<00:00:58.350> um<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.129> guess<00:00:59.879> are<00:01:00.210> pretty<00:01:00.480> similar<00:01:00.750> even

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
so um I guess are pretty similar even

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
so um I guess are pretty similar even
though<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.559> supposed<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:01.980> matte

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
though these are supposed to be matte

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.980 
though these are supposed to be matte
