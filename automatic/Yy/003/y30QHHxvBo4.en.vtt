 Hi everyone, my name is Max, 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.240
 I work here at the Oriocenter Sport Specialist. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.980
 I'm in the snowboard department and now I'll tell you a little bit about the new buildings 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.600
 and the characteristics of the tables we have on the market, 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.440
 like the ones you find anyway in any other sales point. 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.240
 There are some categories of snowboard boards. 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.640
 Essentially the most versatile are called all-mountain. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.420
 They are boards that I can do a little good in all situations, 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.760
 on the track, off the track maybe a few park jumps 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.080
 and then there are the specific tables. 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.000
 Those for park, for example, which are usually a little bit shorter, 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.420
 they are twin tip so they have the same tip as the tail and have a softer flex. 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.540
 These are suitable for making changes such as jumps and rails. 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.940
 Next to these there are rather freeride boards that are generally longer, 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.100
 they are with other types of shapes so not twin tip, but directional. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.740
 So they are a very distinct tip and a tail 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
 and basically they have a set back ie they are 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.040
 move your feet backwards from the center of the board 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.749
 this to allow greater flotation. 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.529
 Between these two extremes there are in the middle a whole series of tables 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.720
 which are called all-mountain, all-mountain freestyle and so on 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.340
 and there we have a lot of buildings that maybe we can see more in detail 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.980
 and that allow you to do various things with respect to the two extremes. 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.000
 Each table comes up with a shape, let's say a profile. 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.459
 The Camber is essentially the fold with the classic bridge that all the tables have. 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.580
 Alongside the Camber, various constructions have been built in recent years 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.300
 then the Flat which is totally flat and the Rocker which is the exact opposite of the Camber 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.740
 therefore it is practically "sbananata" so called. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.220
 The height of the table is basically a fairly simple parameter to define 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.120
 We go to mix, to mix this information with the weight. 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.060
 Basically all the tables, 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.280
 behind they have a scoreboard depending on the brand. 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.580
 There are weights, there is a range of approx 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.930
 20 kg per table depending on the model. 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.700
 The table should generally reach the nose between the chin. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.460
 Once it's in that range up there 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.420
 then, we go to see if we come back with the weight. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.169
 If these two figures fit it means that the table is right for us. 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.120
 Generally if I have to take a freeride board 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.260
 I take it maybe it tends more towards the nose 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.850
 if it's more freestyle, I'm a few inches shorter and maybe I go to my chin. 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.300
 Qersona is a general rule, it is not always true, especially for very high ones 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.780
 however in general it fits very well. 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.749
 You can easily find the table by following this basic advice already.
