00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.590

 looks economical nimble so that 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.459
 it was easy to park and not 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.400
 bathe in city traffic and what 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:25.720
 choose he can be such 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:28.140
 or such a well or this depends on 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.400
 your mood of lifestyle and of course 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.290
 where can I go without solvency 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.059
 chose a new floor 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.440
 as for me this bottomless blue 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.440
 car is what you need 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.840

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.559
 changed the design of the headlights 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 optionally they can be led 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.260
 but so far this EU is not available in Ukraine 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.150
 promises to appear in time against 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.490
 tumanki settled down a little higher than 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.930
 previously slightly changed the shape of the front 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.070
 also under the marathon of dimensions 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.410
 only the length has changed a little 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.360
 + 2 millimeters this floor masthead 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.790
 complete flash about what constantly 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.470
 resemble all sorts of nameplates and labels 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.060
 besides them here are light alloy 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.800
 15 inch wheels 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.229

 multi-function onboard display 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.240
 there besides all the above, and 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.310
 luxury fichechki for example it's a hatch but for 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.850
 him you will have to unfasten thousands more 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.850
 dollars 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.620
 Salon stylistics remained concise 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.110
 but now most of the elements 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.330
 borrowed from golf for example design 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 steering dashboard fully copies

 lighting control keys by design 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.710
 in one key are not flimsy and beautiful 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.230
 many manufacturers about such little things and 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.870
 do not even soar form auto obscure wow 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.210
 the mirror emphasizes the style of car maps 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.220
 gray inserts in combination with aluminum 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.350
 moldings and door handles look 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 stylishly 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.060

 to place everything on the shelves 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.320
 Envy such an abundance of places 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.790
 storage even our captain practicality 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.010
 I would like to see a duct from the back 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.540
 baffle well and at least the armrest 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.160
 still this grade with 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.980
 additional options cost 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.560
 almost 27,000 and here we see 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.750
 Is that a cup holder direct to me 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.300
 large height and plenty of settings behind 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.400
 it will be comfortable even for a big man 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.480
 driver's seat comfortable in it 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.480

 half glass roof machine 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.530
 It looks so awesome and due to this 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.050
 such sex is not particularly similar to the ordinary 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.000
 everyone is accustomed to steering the d-shaped 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.700

 comfortable leather pleasant to the touch please 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.209
 this whole thing is a line which 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.880
 is also found on the gearbox and 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.440

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.560

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.410
 the screen itself is the design of the system is very 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.310
 simple and i would even call it 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.530
 primitive 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.240
 but she is a comfortable screen docile 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.610

 both behind and in front they go to 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.090
 bundling navigation unfortunately 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.640
 but it can be purchased for 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.360
 extra charge 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.300

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.380
 cars agree this is an important parameter 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.720
 the trunk of a relatively small amount 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.880
 as previously 280 liters that 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.860
 and a little bit and a lot but for me he 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.720
 still turned out to be small but not because 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.640
 volume and because of the width of the car 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.070
 for example I had to carry my guitar 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.870
 in the cabin like that there is a trunk 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.180
 convenient and overlapping which are conventionally 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.060
 divides it into two parts here 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.710
 hide things not 1 obkhodimosti but if 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.530
 planned relocation can be folded 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.630
 seat and volume will increase to 900 50 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.430
 liters they fold into a flat floor and 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.350
 to get it you need to fold 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:40.249
 back sofa 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:43.679
 and in the same place because we need 5s 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:47.580
 from liquorice. 

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:50.500
 analysis of hour asti keda 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.020
 this full blue motion series means 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.300
 his priority is to save fuel under

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.680
 engine 90 horsepower when you sit down 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.210
 behind the wheel of a car with such a small 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.820
 engine capacity of some outstanding 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.950
 characteristics you do not expect from him but 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.950
 This sex was pleasantly surprised in principle 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.919
 as for saves and in my 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.900
 city ​​mode came out about 6 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.800
 half a liter a hundred but that's at 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.419
 quiet ride 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.460
 and if the dynamics are important then be guided 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:27.800
 78 liters per hundred engine running 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.620
 paired with a dsg box and it's already seven 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.750
 steps you want to accelerate it quickly 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.090
 throw turnover for dynamic acceleration 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.099
 and if you want to go smoothly box 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.229
 will shift gears and unnoticed 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.539
 keeping the turn in the range of one and a half 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:44.060
 up to two thousand as for manageability 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:47.169
 roll and fell there but minor in 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.169
 cornering it is stable 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.740
 messi 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.720
 thanks to the turbine and torque 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.639
 160 newton meter creates the feeling that 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.100
 it's not a compact car at all 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.350
 speakers rather sluggish snail this 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.210
 the floor can not be called acceleration to hundreds of 10 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.770
 a penny of seconds is enough 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.539
 for everyday driving 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.520
 speaking of savings worth noting 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:11.530
 start-stop system which is familiar 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.870
 see on cars higher 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.490
 class it saves fuel drowns out 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.470
 engine when stopped at 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.960
 if necessary, the system can be disabled 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.419
 all good new volkswagen polo 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.090
 he is economical moderately smart and most importantly 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:27.190
 very stylish but still it's used class 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.780
 and despite the manufacturer's nameplate 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.820
 front and rear as well as cool 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.080
 complete set I would like the price to be 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.080
 little stones and
