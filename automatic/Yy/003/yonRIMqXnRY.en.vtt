okay Oh slight brace he starts to kind
of<00:02:54.510> wobble<00:02:54.840> let's<00:02:55.590> put<00:02:55.859> this<00:02:56.010> down<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.340> little

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
of wobble let's put this down a little

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.959 
of wobble let's put this down a little
bit<00:02:58.069> hereõs<00:02:59.069> so<00:03:00.230> at<00:03:01.230> least<00:03:01.379> one<00:03:01.680> arm<00:03:01.969> above

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
bit hereõs so at least one arm above

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.679 
bit hereõs so at least one arm above
more<00:03:03.389> than<00:03:03.659> a<00:03:03.750> 45<00:03:04.169> degree<00:03:04.439> angle<00:03:04.709> would<00:03:05.689> make

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
more than a 45 degree angle would make

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.140 
more than a 45 degree angle would make
him<00:03:06.870> stand<00:03:07.079> out<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:08.189> he'd<00:03:08.609> probably<00:03:08.760> stay<00:03:09.030> up

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
him stand out so he'd probably stay up

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.000 
him stand out so he'd probably stay up
just<00:03:09.449> like<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.349> does<00:03:10.530> how<00:03:10.799> about

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
just like that and it does how about

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.670 
just like that and it does how about
that

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.159 
that
