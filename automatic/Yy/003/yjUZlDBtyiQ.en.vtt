00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
engineer weapon in this new DLC because

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.510 
engineer weapon in this new DLC because
we<00:00:40.230> know<00:00:40.379> there's<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.800> vehicles<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
we know there's going to be vehicles and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.160 
we know there's going to be vehicles and
probably<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.940> decent<00:00:42.420> number<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> them<00:00:42.989> some

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
probably a decent number of them some

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.660 
probably a decent number of them some
engineer<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.590> definitely<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
engineer is definitely going to be a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.850 
engineer is definitely going to be a
class<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> lot<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.110> people<00:00:46.260> are<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
class that a lot of people are going to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010 
class that a lot of people are going to
use<00:00:47.090> now<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> weapon<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.600> talking<00:00:48.960> about

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
use now the weapon I'm talking about

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.400 
use now the weapon I'm talking about
today<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:50.039> course<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.870> sg553<00:00:51.870> which<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
today is of course the sg553 which you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.979 
today is of course the sg553 which you
can<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> screen<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> why

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
can see right here on the screen so why

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
can see right here on the screen so why
do<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.199> think<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.590> weapon<00:00:56.070> could<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.820> very

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
do I think this weapon could be very

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
do I think this weapon could be very
good<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.449> aftermath<00:00:58.050> why<00:00:58.289> don't<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> think<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
good in aftermath why don't I think that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.860 
good in aftermath why don't I think that
we<00:00:58.890> might<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.550> weapon<00:01:00.270> pop<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> little

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we might see this weapon pop up a little

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.709 
we might see this weapon pop up a little
bit<00:01:00.960> more<00:01:01.079> because<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
bit more because right now it is

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.359 
bit more because right now it is
probably<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.110> would<00:01:04.290> say<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.280> bit

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
probably I would say just a little bit

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.130 
probably I would say just a little bit
over<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> cube<00:01:05.970> easy<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.420> far<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.990> most

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
over the cube easy as far as the most

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
over the cube easy as far as the most
underused<00:01:07.770> engineer<00:01:08.310> weapon<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.760> would<00:01:09.119> have

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
underused engineer weapon I would have

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.179 
underused engineer weapon I would have
to<00:01:09.360> say<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> q<00:01:09.780> VZ<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.409> most<00:01:10.680> underused

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
to say the q VZ is the most underused

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.710 
to say the q VZ is the most underused
engineer<00:01:11.640> weapon<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.479> see<00:01:12.689> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
engineer weapon you just don't see that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
engineer weapon you just don't see that
gun<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.439> honestly<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.400> sad

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
gun at all and honestly that's a sad

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.920 
gun at all and honestly that's a sad
thing<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> course<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> other<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
thing and of course the other one that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.200 
thing and of course the other one that
goes<00:01:16.020> along<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> G<00:01:17.070> 53<00:01:17.759> but

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
goes along with that is the G 53 but

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.670 
goes along with that is the G 53 but
that's<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.450> because<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.900> weapons<00:01:19.200> role<00:01:19.439> is

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that's just because the weapons role is

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.789 
that's just because the weapons role is
its<00:01:20.509> what<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.630> scroll<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> don't<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
its what if scroll is I don't think it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.219 
its what if scroll is I don't think it
does<00:01:22.920> very<00:01:23.189> well<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.210> cube<00:01:24.479> easy<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.960> I'm

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
does very well but the cube easy as I'm

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
does very well but the cube easy as I'm
just<00:01:25.470> disappointed<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.979> people<00:01:26.310> don't<00:01:26.400> run

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
just disappointed that people don't run

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.950 
just disappointed that people don't run
that<00:01:26.640> more<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> mean<00:01:27.119> I'm<00:01:27.210> person<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.720> don't<00:01:27.869> run

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
that more I mean I'm person I don't run

fantastic<00:01:42.930> hipfire<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.799> not<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> talk

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
fantastic hipfire but not here to talk

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.389 
fantastic hipfire but not here to talk
about<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.210> cube<00:01:45.450> easy<00:01:46.159> here<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.250> talk<00:01:47.369> about

about the cube easy here to talk about

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.639 
about the cube easy here to talk about
the<00:01:47.640> sg553<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.840> why<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.170> think<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.530> this

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the sg553 in why do I think that this

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.160 
the sg553 in why do I think that this
weapon<00:01:50.009> could<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.729> well<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.240> aftermath

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
weapon could do so well in aftermath

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.069 
weapon could do so well in aftermath
well<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:53.009> from<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> trailers<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.659> pictures

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
well just from the trailers the pictures

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.050 
well just from the trailers the pictures
of<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.290> maps<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.219> had<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.969> little

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
of the maps think they had like a little

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.850 
of the maps think they had like a little
trailer<00:01:57.509> flyovers<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:58.409> did<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.829> just

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
trailer flyovers that they did and just

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.280 
trailer flyovers that they did and just
seeing<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> overall<00:01:59.969> layout<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.630> design<00:02:00.659> of

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
seeing the overall layout and design of

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.830 
seeing the overall layout and design of
these<00:02:01.409> aftermath<00:02:02.189> maps<00:02:02.600> that's<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
these aftermath maps that's like a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.539 
these aftermath maps that's like a
tongue<00:02:04.079> twister<00:02:04.110> aftermath<00:02:04.920> maps<00:02:05.219> okay

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
tongue twister aftermath maps okay

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.690 
tongue twister aftermath maps okay
anyway<00:02:06.000> um<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:07.290> seeing<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.920> these<00:02:08.250> these

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
anyway um just seeing this these these

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.780 
anyway um just seeing this these these
maps<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.270> appears<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
maps it appears like that the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.950 
maps it appears like that the
engagements<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.120> speed<00:02:12.360> at<00:02:12.569> all

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
engagements are going speed at all

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.690 
engagements are going speed at all
ranges<00:02:13.290> there's<00:02:13.470> not<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.010> one

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
ranges there's not going to be one

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.610 
ranges there's not going to be one
specific<00:02:15.270> range<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.750> there<00:02:15.930> was<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.380> closed

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
specific range like there was in closed

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.310 
specific range like there was in closed
quarters<00:02:16.860> which<00:02:17.400> was<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:17.880> utterly<00:02:18.600> chaotic

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
quarters which was just utterly chaotic

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.780 
quarters which was just utterly chaotic
and<00:02:19.470> just<00:02:19.710> obviously<00:02:20.130> close<00:02:20.430> quarters

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and just obviously close quarters

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.580 
and just obviously close quarters
engagements<00:02:21.240> an<00:02:21.300> armored<00:02:21.570> kill<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.470> me

engagements an armored kill for me

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.500 
engagements an armored kill for me
honestly<00:02:22.800> was<00:02:23.160> just<00:02:23.460> too<00:02:23.640> big<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:24.060> was<00:02:24.180> too<00:02:24.330> big

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
honestly was just too big it was too big

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640

aspect to it and of course most of your

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.970 
aspect to it and of course most of your
engagements<00:02:29.550> are<00:02:29.670> going<00:02:29.910> speak<00:02:30.120> very<00:02:30.360> open

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
engagements are going speak very open

engagements are going speak very open
his<00:02:31.980> almost<00:02:32.400> reminds<00:02:32.880> me<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.120> back<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.630> karkand

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
his almost reminds me of back to karkand

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.040 
his almost reminds me of back to karkand
maps<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.800> same<00:02:35.100> crossing<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.970> little<00:02:36.840> bit<00:02:36.960> of

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
maps like same crossing a little bit of

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.070 
maps like same crossing a little bit of
cargo<00:02:37.290> island<00:02:37.740> in<00:02:37.830> there<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.820> those<00:02:39.690> maps

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
cargo island in there and on those maps

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.560 
cargo island in there and on those maps
weapons<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.980> gently<00:02:41.460> spire<00:02:41.910> at<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.180> slower<00:02:42.450> rate

weapons it gently spire at a slower rate

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.510 
weapons it gently spire at a slower rate
now<00:02:43.020> I'm<00:02:43.080> not<00:02:43.170> saying<00:02:43.320> this<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.590> one

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
now I'm not saying this is the one

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.070 
now I'm not saying this is the one
hundred<00:02:44.730> percent<00:02:44.790> true<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.600> but

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
hundred percent true in this but

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.360 
hundred percent true in this but
generally<00:02:46.380> weapons<00:02:46.650> at<00:02:46.740> fire<00:02:46.950> at<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.160> slow<00:02:47.340> rate

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
generally weapons at fire at a slow rate

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.940 
generally weapons at fire at a slow rate
do<00:02:47.850> better<00:02:48.270> at<00:02:48.450> range<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.990> just<00:02:49.530> judging<00:02:49.800> by

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
do better at range and just judging by

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.100 
do better at range and just judging by
these<00:02:50.180> pictures<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.210> trailers<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.960> these

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
these pictures and trailers of these

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.510 
these pictures and trailers of these
maps<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:52.650> seeing<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.890> designs<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.370> them

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
maps and just seeing the designs of them

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.950 
maps and just seeing the designs of them
it<00:02:53.940> appears<00:02:54.210> like<00:02:54.300> there's<00:02:54.540> going<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.840> be<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
it appears like there's going to be a

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.290 
it appears like there's going to be a
fair<00:02:55.260> number<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.620> long<00:02:55.980> medium<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.730> even

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
fair number of long medium and even

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.150 
fair number of long medium and even
close<00:02:57.510> range<00:02:57.840> engagements<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.800> because

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
close range engagements and so because

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.490 
close range engagements and so because
of<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.700> need<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.150> weapon<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.600> has<00:03:00.930> good

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
of that you need a weapon that has good

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.610 
of that you need a weapon that has good
accuracy<00:03:02.100> at<00:03:02.280> range<00:03:02.900> easy<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.170> easy<00:03:04.380> to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
accuracy at range easy and easy to

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.290 
accuracy at range easy and easy to
manage<00:03:04.860> recoil<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.610> wear<00:03:05.730> when<00:03:05.940> you're<00:03:06.030> coming

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
manage recoil to wear when you're coming

manage recoil to wear when you're coming
to<00:03:06.450> me<00:03:06.660> into<00:03:06.990> range<00:03:07.170> engagements<00:03:07.380> you're<00:03:07.890> not

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
to me into range engagements you're not

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.550 
to me into range engagements you're not
having<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.550> just<00:03:08.790> like<00:03:08.970> single<00:03:09.900> shot<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.320> order

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
having to just like single shot in order

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.740 
having to just like single shot in order
to<00:03:10.620> maintain<00:03:11.010> your<00:03:11.370> accuracy<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.540> also

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
to maintain your accuracy but you also

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.630 
to maintain your accuracy but you also
need<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.020> gun<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.260> has<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> semi<00:03:14.040> fast<00:03:14.340> fire

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
need a gun that has a semi fast fire

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.430 
need a gun that has a semi fast fire
rate<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.300> keep<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.810> close<00:03:16.020> quarters

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
rate that can keep up in close quarters

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.230 
rate that can keep up in close quarters
now<00:03:17.280> enough<00:03:17.520> some<00:03:17.700> guys<00:03:17.850> probably<00:03:18.090> already

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
now enough some guys probably already

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.300 
now enough some guys probably already
think<00:03:18.540> any<00:03:18.660> what<00:03:18.810> about<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.080> g36c<00:03:19.800> wouldn't

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
think any what about the g36c wouldn't

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.680 
think any what about the g36c wouldn't
that<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:20.670> best<00:03:20.880> one<00:03:21.030> considering<00:03:21.510> it's

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
that be the best one considering it's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.800 
that be the best one considering it's
the<00:03:21.840> all-around<00:03:22.260> engineer<00:03:22.950> weapon<00:03:23.250> as<00:03:23.400> far<00:03:23.610> as

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
the all-around engineer weapon as far as

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.170 
the all-around engineer weapon as far as
its<00:03:24.810> versatility<00:03:25.550> well<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:26.580> think<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.030> is

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
its versatility well I think that is

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.390 
its versatility well I think that is
true<00:03:27.330> opening<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.080> g36c<00:03:28.620> probably<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
true opening the g36c probably is the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.800 
true opening the g36c probably is the
best<00:03:29.580> weapon<00:03:29.940> when<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.180> comes<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.570> just

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
best weapon when it comes to just

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.930 
best weapon when it comes to just
overall<00:03:31.290> versatility<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.070> usage<00:03:32.640> in<00:03:32.820> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
overall versatility and usage in the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.230 
overall versatility and usage in the
game<00:03:33.120> however<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.350> g36c<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.220> feet<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.880> find

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
game however the g36c I feet I find

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.880 
game however the g36c I feet I find
least<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.080> more<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.350> personal<00:03:37.680> thing

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
least this is more of a personal thing

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.680 
least this is more of a personal thing
can<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.430> sometimes<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:39.030> little<00:03:39.210> bit<00:03:39.420> more

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
can be sometimes a little bit more

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.530 
can be sometimes a little bit more
difficult<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.380> control<00:03:41.040> its<00:03:41.430> recoil<00:03:42.030> now<00:03:42.330> it's

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
difficult to control its recoil now it's

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.090 
difficult to control its recoil now it's
not<00:03:42.690> saying<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:43.140> flares<00:03:43.500> out<00:03:43.710> one<00:03:43.920> side

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
not saying that it flares out one side

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.590 
not saying that it flares out one side
the<00:03:44.220> other<00:03:44.310> it's<00:03:44.850> honestly<00:03:45.210> just<00:03:45.300> the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
the other it's honestly just the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.300 
the other it's honestly just the
vertical<00:03:45.990> recoil<00:03:46.170> now<00:03:46.710> I<00:03:46.740> know<00:03:46.860> just<00:03:47.220> really

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
vertical recoil now I know just really

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.740 
vertical recoil now I know just really
pulling<00:03:47.640> back<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.150> thumb<00:03:48.300> stick<00:03:48.510> for<00:03:48.660> me

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
pulling back on the thumb stick for me

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.660 
pulling back on the thumb stick for me
will<00:03:49.230> help<00:03:49.440> control<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.160> help<00:03:50.310> compensate

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
will help control and help compensate

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.070 
will help control and help compensate
for<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.120> Rico<00:03:51.540> however<00:03:51.870> sometimes

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
for that Rico however sometimes

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.840 
for that Rico however sometimes
especially<00:03:52.590> when<00:03:52.830> I'm<00:03:53.010> under<00:03:53.190> suppression<00:03:53.760> I

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
especially when I'm under suppression I

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.940 
especially when I'm under suppression I
feel<00:03:54.090> like<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.360> really<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:55.110> kicks<00:03:55.440> up<00:03:55.650> a

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
feel like it really just kicks up a

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.280 
feel like it really just kicks up a
little<00:03:56.610> bit<00:03:56.730> too<00:03:57.030> much<00:03:57.390> for<00:03:57.690> me<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:58.050> actually

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
little bit too much for me to actually

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.520 
little bit too much for me to actually
get<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:58.800> kill<00:03:59.160> whereas<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.940> sg553<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:01.080> find

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
get a kill whereas the sg553 I find

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.430 
get a kill whereas the sg553 I find
myself<00:04:01.710> still<00:04:02.400> under<00:04:03.090> suppression<00:04:03.810> managing

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
myself still under suppression managing

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.680 
myself still under suppression managing
to<00:04:04.620> get<00:04:04.890> kills<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.820> that<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.090> something<00:04:06.360> that

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
to get kills and that is something that

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.740 
to get kills and that is something that
is<00:04:07.040> definitely<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.370> plus<00:04:08.700> about<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.420> weapon

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
is definitely a plus about this weapon

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.180 
is definitely a plus about this weapon
and<00:04:09.870> honestly<00:04:10.110> that's<00:04:10.260> something<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.710> like

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
and honestly that's something I like

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.890 
and honestly that's something I like
about<00:04:11.220> any<00:04:11.700> gun<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.330> does<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.720> when<00:04:12.810> you

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
about any gun that does that when you

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.450 
about any gun that does that when you
have<00:04:12.990> a<00:04:13.050> gun<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.260> cannot<00:04:13.800> get<00:04:14.010> kills<00:04:14.220> while

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
have a gun that cannot get kills while

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.010 
have a gun that cannot get kills while
you're<00:04:14.580> being<00:04:14.700> suppressed<00:04:15.150> even<00:04:15.780> though<00:04:15.870> your

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
you're being suppressed even though your

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.620 
you're being suppressed even though your
accuracy<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.680> just<00:04:16.710> horrible<00:04:17.670> which<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.270> still

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
accuracy is just horrible which I still

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.390 
accuracy is just horrible which I still
don't<00:04:18.810> understand<00:04:19.140> why<00:04:19.260> but<00:04:19.290> that's<00:04:19.680> okay<00:04:20.010> not

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
don't understand why but that's okay not

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.460 
don't understand why but that's okay not
here<00:04:20.520> to<00:04:20.580> talk<00:04:20.700> about<00:04:20.730> that<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.239> needed<00:04:22.140> when

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
here to talk about that I needed when

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.170 
here to talk about that I needed when
I'm<00:04:22.560> under<00:04:22.740> suppression<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.340> need<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.790> gun<00:04:23.970> that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
I'm under suppression I need a gun that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.720 
I'm under suppression I need a gun that
can<00:04:24.330> kill<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.900> sg553<00:04:25.560> are<00:04:25.950> fine

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
can kill and the sg553 are fine

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.880 
can kill and the sg553 are fine
it<00:04:26.850> can<00:04:27.000> do<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.360> also<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.410> fact<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.740> it

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
it can do that also the fact that it

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.190 
it can do that also the fact that it
still<00:04:29.070> has<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.220> 700<00:04:29.970> RPM<00:04:30.150> means<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:30.990> it<00:04:31.170> can

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
still has a 700 RPM means that it can

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.260 
still has a 700 RPM means that it can
keep<00:04:31.650> up<00:04:31.890> in<00:04:32.160> close<00:04:32.340> quarters<00:04:32.730> now<00:04:32.910> it's<00:04:33.090> not

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
keep up in close quarters now it's not

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.760 
keep up in close quarters now it's not
going<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.510> do<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.750> best<00:04:33.900> in<00:04:34.140> something<00:04:34.650> like

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
going to do the best in something like

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.890 
going to do the best in something like
an<00:04:34.920> mtar<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.850> SG<00:04:36.180> will<00:04:36.390> get<00:04:36.630> destroyed

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
an mtar the SG will get destroyed

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.470 
an mtar the SG will get destroyed
however<00:04:37.770> just<00:04:38.040> having<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:38.790> versatility

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
however just having that versatility

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.560 
however just having that versatility
having<00:04:40.230> a<00:04:40.320> slow<00:04:40.590> rate<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:40.890> fire<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.550> with<00:04:41.970> that

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
having a slow rate of fire and with that

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.660 
having a slow rate of fire and with that
it<00:04:42.780> comes<00:04:43.050> with<00:04:43.170> manageable<00:04:43.800> recoil<00:04:44.220> now<00:04:44.610> the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
it comes with manageable recoil now the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.100 
it comes with manageable recoil now the
recoil<00:04:45.060> numbers<00:04:45.360> on<00:04:45.510> it<00:04:45.540> are<00:04:45.750> actually<00:04:46.080> a

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
recoil numbers on it are actually a

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.230 
recoil numbers on it are actually a
little<00:04:46.320> bit<00:04:46.530> on<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.890> higher<00:04:47.190> end<00:04:47.460> however

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
little bit on the higher end however

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.750 
little bit on the higher end however
because<00:04:49.140> of<00:04:49.410> that<00:04:49.530> slow<00:04:49.740> rate<00:04:49.950> of<00:04:49.980> fire<00:04:50.100> you

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
because of that slow rate of fire you

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.970 
because of that slow rate of fire you
don't<00:04:51.060> notice<00:04:51.510> that<00:04:51.900> recoil<00:04:52.260> as<00:04:52.410> much<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:52.860> so

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
don't notice that recoil as much and so

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.890 
don't notice that recoil as much and so
it's<00:04:53.160> going<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.370> be<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.490> lot<00:04:53.850> easier<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.600> control

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
it's going to be a lot easier to control

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.320 
it's going to be a lot easier to control
and<00:04:55.320> that's<00:04:55.590> where<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.800> think<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.130> sg553<00:04:56.850> could

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
and that's where I think the sg553 could

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
and that's where I think the sg553 could
be<00:04:57.420> a<00:04:57.450> fantastic<00:04:58.170> weapon<00:04:58.830> in<00:04:58.980> aftermath

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
be a fantastic weapon in aftermath

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
be a fantastic weapon in aftermath
another<00:05:01.350> thing<00:05:01.500> about<00:05:01.620> aftermath<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.190> do<00:05:02.310> you

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
another thing about aftermath I do you

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.500 
another thing about aftermath I do you
want<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.550> say<00:05:02.670> though<00:05:02.790> is<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:02.970> believe<00:05:03.330> there's

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
want to say though is I believe there's

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.940 
want to say though is I believe there's
going<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.780> be<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:03.900> patch<00:05:04.200> coming<00:05:04.590> out<00:05:04.680> with<00:05:04.830> it

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
going to be a patch coming out with it

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.020 
going to be a patch coming out with it
and<00:05:05.070> actually<00:05:05.220> that's<00:05:05.430> going<00:05:05.640> to<00:05:05.700> be<00:05:05.760> released

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
and actually that's going to be released

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.930 
and actually that's going to be released
on<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.330> twenty-seventh<00:05:07.050> of<00:05:07.230> November<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:08.010> so

on the twenty-seventh of November and so

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.730 
on the twenty-seventh of November and so
