that's<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.230> first<00:02:18.530> problem<00:02:18.859> with<00:02:19.219> this<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
that's the first problem with this the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.479 
that's the first problem with this the
second<00:02:20.750> problem<00:02:21.049> was<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:22.099> more

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
second problem was this is a more

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.789 
second problem was this is a more
obvious<00:02:22.670> one<00:02:23.239> in<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.510> sense<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.900> they<00:02:24.319> are

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
obvious one in the sense that they are

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.209 
obvious one in the sense that they are
taking<00:02:25.430> away<00:02:25.959> stuff<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.829> we<00:02:27.950> would<00:02:28.129> have

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
taking away stuff that we would have

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.699 
taking away stuff that we would have
normally<00:02:28.400> gotten<00:02:29.120> but<00:02:29.629> they're<00:02:29.840> not<00:02:30.109> lowering

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
normally gotten but they're not lowering

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.729 
normally gotten but they're not lowering
the<00:02:30.890> price<00:02:31.159> tag<00:02:31.519> because<00:02:32.209> trust<00:02:32.510> me<00:02:32.599> not<00:02:33.500> that

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
the price tag because trust me not that

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.030 
the price tag because trust me not that
anyone<00:02:34.159> probably<00:02:34.670> ever<00:02:34.849> paid<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.720> full<00:02:36.040> $45

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
anyone probably ever paid the full $45

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.220 
anyone probably ever paid the full $45
for<00:02:37.220> one<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.430> these<00:02:37.489> blu-ray<00:02:37.879> combo<00:02:38.090> packs<00:02:38.510> but

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
for one of these blu-ray combo packs but

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.339 
for one of these blu-ray combo packs but
they<00:02:39.379> probably<00:02:39.650> at<00:02:39.889> least<00:02:40.069> paid<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.639> 30<00:02:41.389> to<00:02:41.659> 35

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
they probably at least paid the 30 to 35

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.099 
they probably at least paid the 30 to 35
sale<00:02:43.340> price<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.030> when<00:02:44.599> you're<00:02:44.720> paying<00:02:44.959> that

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
sale price and when you're paying that

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.539 
sale price and when you're paying that
kind<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.379> money<00:02:45.439> and<00:02:45.769> you're<00:02:45.889> getting<00:02:46.250> all

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
kind of money and you're getting all

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.990 
kind of money and you're getting all
this<00:02:46.760> stuff<00:02:47.329> in<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.659> it's<00:02:48.379> kind<00:02:48.859> of<00:02:49.040> justifying

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
this stuff in it it's kind of justifying

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.610 
this stuff in it it's kind of justifying
the<00:02:50.180> high<00:02:50.299> cost<00:02:50.629> but<00:02:50.780> when<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:50.989> open<00:02:51.349> up<00:02:51.439> and

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
the high cost but when you open up and

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.569 
the high cost but when you open up and
there's<00:02:51.739> one<00:02:52.189> disc<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.900> takes<00:02:54.409> you<00:02:54.620> off<00:02:54.889> which

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
there's one disc it takes you off which

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.819 
there's one disc it takes you off which
means<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:56.090> second<00:02:56.569> obvious<00:02:56.930> problem<00:02:57.379> is<00:02:57.590> that

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
means the second obvious problem is that

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.940 
means the second obvious problem is that
we<00:02:58.069> are<00:02:58.099> paying<00:02:58.639> a<00:02:58.909> lot<00:02:59.599> of<00:02:59.750> money<00:02:59.780> for<00:03:00.650> less

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
we are paying a lot of money for less

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.780 
we are paying a lot of money for less
value<00:03:01.549> now<00:03:02.060> this<00:03:02.299> was<00:03:02.510> how<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:02.689> story<00:03:03.139> got<00:03:03.530> out

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
value now this was how the story got out

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.369 
value now this was how the story got out
since<00:03:04.790> then<00:03:05.000> there<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.299> been<00:03:05.540> tons<00:03:06.109> of

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
since then there have been tons of

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.440 
since then there have been tons of
complaints<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.129> I<00:03:07.340> think<00:03:07.579> Disney<00:03:07.970> heard<00:03:08.209> them

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
complaints and I think Disney heard them

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.649
