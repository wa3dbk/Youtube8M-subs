ladies<00:01:19.170> love<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.979> kind<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.250> lipstick<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.790> lip

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
ladies love this kind of lipstick or lip

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.210 
ladies love this kind of lipstick or lip
product<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.140> kissable<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.070> not

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
product it's not kissable or it's not

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.300 
product it's not kissable or it's not
kiss<00:01:24.060> off<00:01:24.299> full<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> guess<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.890> kissable

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
kiss off full so I guess it is kissable

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.649 
kiss off full so I guess it is kissable
because<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> doesn't<00:01:26.939> kiss<00:01:27.090> off<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.509> man

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
because it doesn't kiss off on your man

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.810 
because it doesn't kiss off on your man
when<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.470> kiss<00:01:28.650> him<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.070> takes<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.430> couple<00:01:29.549> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
when you kiss him it takes a couple of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
when you kiss him it takes a couple of
seconds<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> dry<00:01:30.659> maybe<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.560> minute

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
seconds to dry maybe like up to a minute

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.990 
seconds to dry maybe like up to a minute
so<00:01:32.009> make<00:01:32.040> sure<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.549> totally<00:01:32.729> dry

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so make sure that it's totally dry

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.609 
so make sure that it's totally dry
before<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.360> start<00:01:33.600> kissing<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.049> men<00:01:34.200> but

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
before you start kissing your men but

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.170 
before you start kissing your men but
the<00:01:34.740> good<00:01:34.829> thing<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.040> even<00:01:35.400> though<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.820> dr

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the good thing is even though it's a dr

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
the good thing is even though it's a dr
formula<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.200> doesn't<00:01:37.500> actually<00:01:37.650> make<00:01:37.890> your

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
formula it doesn't actually make your

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.819 
formula it doesn't actually make your
lips<00:01:38.430> dry<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> moisturizing<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.650> it's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
lips dry so it's a moisturizing but it's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.100 
lips dry so it's a moisturizing but it's
