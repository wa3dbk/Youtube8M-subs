is the three-point sling which is a

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.040 
is the three-point sling which is a
little<00:02:09.729> more<00:02:09.880> complicated<00:02:10.300> there's<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.899> lot

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
little more complicated there's a lot

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.450 
little more complicated there's a lot
more<00:02:11.290> material<00:02:11.440> here<00:02:13.920> looks<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.040> lot<00:02:15.220> more

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
more material here looks a lot more

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.980 
more material here looks a lot more
complicated<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.540> takes<00:02:16.750> some<00:02:16.960> getting

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
complicated and it takes some getting

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.570 
complicated and it takes some getting
used<00:02:17.380> to
