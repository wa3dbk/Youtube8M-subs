00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.040
 and then here is in relation to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.990
 means video I saw a comment that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.850
 said I had tracker I do not have 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.320
 to stalk to I do not have any more 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.000
 tracker this be more when a tracker 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.009
 but the guy does not do the job and tracker 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.200
 it's not true it's wrong I do not have 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.299
 it's stupid that another comment o'shea 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.009
 who made me laugh is actually 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.840
 for those who watched video way 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.270
 I announce at the beginning of video that to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.729
 moments the image is going to jump it's going jerkily 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.380
 that the sound is going to be taking off because 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.450
 my computer had signed the rendering is killed the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.500
 cake there is still a guy who has 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.119
 passed out in the comments 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.520
 videos I love you to a red thumb because 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.600
 that image she jerks 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.180
 I still said at the beginning of the video 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.360
 that here I am sorry but the guy he 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.040
 is still going to be an inch rolls so 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.090
 I will have Tetouan and I will know that 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.720
 was going to piss me off that images 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.310
 they jerks 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.840
 I would not even have watched the video 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.850
 would be barred while there the guy will have 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.799
 wants to put a red thumb in pure mode 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.119
 cassos epigones so this game 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.680
 comments and here too it's two 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.420
 years that I start again the first time 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.020
 I had very well said everything in the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.149
 allotted time 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.460
 and then my phone did not want - 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.780
 strings the second time I hurt you can 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.950
 to hear everything say so there we go 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.300
 try to say everything always be good 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.100
 so now we're going to talk about it said 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.940
 Minecraft 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.260
 lately I 'm not going to a manna 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.520
 crack so we'll come back said I want 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.140
 also risky minecraft 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.960
 so here I was talking about doing by 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.220
 example servers for subscribers 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.590
 everything to play make it all the more 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.670
 bird very well and so here is this 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.850
 would be nice that what we are 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.050
 two servers so a server for them 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.480
 subscribers for everyone what 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.960
 a server style faction your server 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.680
 with money system you can in 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.660
 collecting stuff you can the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.040
 resell or buy for example sells 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.360
 diamond site we bought some 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.970
 diamonds system in approach time 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.460
 earn money and close to the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.500
 credaf action with your pals that creates 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.030
 a base 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.990
 finally, here you are and after you have to 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.450
 beat against others to keep 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.170
 tobacco finally here is a really stylish thing 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.570
 in a little war mode here after with 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.460
 trade systems too 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.930
 I do not remember what I'm going to 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.500
 to be able to know like that a server 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.050
 a friend 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.570
 and then here is tesfran made up with 6 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.860
 with a craft system it was in 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.870
 did there were different trades you 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.940
 choose and by a command that you 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.220
 say in the chosen text bar your 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.460
 trade so three trades of the Thursday where 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.660
 for example who had minor there was 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.560
 the farmer there were two builders 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.730
 learn full of 2.2 kind of craft 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.990
 like that is rather raised up 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.610
 level in this profession there actually you 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.130
 gagnes helix ready to increase in this 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.650
 which is worth at the pit hume or increase 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.000
 high level in level in this 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.950
 business over there the more you earn money 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.780
 so society styles and all so that's it 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.980
 why not make it serve like that and 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.590
 unfortunately it is not done by a 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.760
 machine because I did just 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.980
 to be free servers for 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.150
 do it on normal flights so that's it 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.920
 the thing would be that it would have to be paid 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.170
 to do that a server like that so 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.870
 that's a bit boring it would take loulo 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.790
 rent a server and then pay after 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.140
 so I do not know how much does it cost if I 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.870
 reminds me of course the living room where I was 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.090
 the guy she did serve positive 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.360
 of the case the server was 2 to 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.620
 nimes he had paid three euros a month 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.860
 if I say no nonsense something 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.750
 kind 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.760
 and that's actually they paid compared 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.400
 in fact there were kits that you 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.640
 could get by star because kit 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.549
 vip very could go after 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.590
 best had a better stuff so 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.239
 so that was all-star player posted 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.880
 a Euro 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.220
 and then that's so it allowed her to 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.180
 ba to fund good allocation of the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.340
 server so that would be fine as 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.770
 so if someone who knows how to make 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.150
 faction servers well as I say 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.840
 there it would be style and frankly 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.960
 it would be terrible then that's who 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.289
 contact me by skype 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.849
 so my skype but he contact me by 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.919
 private message youtube after I will give 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.120
 my skype and then that's so if it's 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.509
 really make a server like this after 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.669
 here we can discuss or do 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.169
 that's why not for example make 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.789
 kits stuff like that like this 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.810
 would still be much more convenient 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.930
 to pay that way everyone 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.590
 pitches in when the turns can 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.870
 see the day 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.909
 and here you go, that's me 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.900
 in the comments of the video here 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:13.699
 below you would like and then so here 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.289
 after the second idea would be to do 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.979
 a pic server only do not have but 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.970
 not speak and that would be more of a server 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.580
 with my friends 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.469
 so here is a server x men parra 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.270
 machine so if anyone knows how 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.740
 do who frankly tells me this 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.060
 would be too much so this is the fourth 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.240
 parcels all kinds can be that m 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.990
 this crazy wasp khwaja high it's up to 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.280
 say that there is a one in five chance 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.530
 to have a camp even in packages 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.849
 normal meal that we learn so we will 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.710
 end up simone brick so here's a 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.389
 server if someone refers a 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.469
 server not chewed tray and so here he is 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.599
 here 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:46.370
 I do not want to give myself a 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.680
 month I do not do what the game does to 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.180
 must do everything all by yourself before 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.969
 that's still thanks 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.099
 So that's annoying but here at 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.389
 less it shows that hu to the search 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.680
 go to the shanxi 's asshole 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.539
 voros had nothing to say what I like 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.120
 it's not me too someone would be 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.530
 how to do that so that's me 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.880
 also say or who directed me a 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.669
 video on youtube that explains how 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.590
 do that a server x men by hamachi 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.669
 so what could I do too 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.620
 is that every week the glass 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.509
 is a subscriber to play with us like that 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.550
 or so for example that's why 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:20.030
 not make videos on minecraft after 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.289
 of the two servers if they are made and 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.120
 then there are also advisors 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.889
 me too some softwares for 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.330
 capture minecraft so I have fraps 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.430
 the typing problem is that it 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.900
 record of several files of ten 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.820
 minutes and sari body of an opinion so that 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.580
 made super heavy files was not 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.400
 very well 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.259
 not obvious with sony vegas to use 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.550
 game without the official files so has it 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.099
 if you have any knowledge of 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.750
 free software or that we can crack 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:47.039
 quite easily as strikes what 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.870
 allows to capture in mp4 and make a 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.150
 single file so it would be hostile and 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.219
 frankly more pc has not moved 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.229
 of competition so here it would be good 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:57.270
 software how it would 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.879
 much more convenient and then that's it 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.500
 so there I died like a leave of a 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.789
 learned district if I have no mastery 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.400
 foot but did not take the ball 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:07.199
 and then here in my mouth and then 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.310
 So here you are, tell me little about 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.430
 comments the video what you in 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.020
 think of giving your advisors - 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.669
 not bad software that rice harvesting in 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.900
 africa at one single file tell me 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.610
 what you think about stuff too 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.270
 minecraft to serve our fear that we 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.690
 could do and pivot when and then 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.699
 here 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.009
 and then so here I hope that the video 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.960

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.830
