features all solid capacitors for
improved<00:00:32.550> lifespan<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.840> actually

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
improved lifespan so we can actually

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.959 
improved lifespan so we can actually
find<00:00:34.350> some<00:00:34.590> more<00:00:34.680> details<00:00:35.100> about<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
find some more details about that on the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.299 
find some more details about that on the
back<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.750> ten<00:00:37.110> years<00:00:37.140> ultra<00:00:37.680> long<00:00:37.829> lifetime

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
back so ten years ultra long lifetime

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.639 
back so ten years ultra long lifetime
with<00:00:38.520> no<00:00:38.850> explosion<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.530> they

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
with no explosion I think what they

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.010 
with no explosion I think what they
actually<00:00:40.860> mean<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> say<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.879> no<00:00:42.239> leaking

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
actually mean to say is no leaking

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.020 
actually mean to say is no leaking
because<00:00:43.559> typically<00:00:44.160> capacitors<00:00:44.820> although

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
because typically capacitors although

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.130 
because typically capacitors although
they<00:00:45.180> can't<00:00:45.420> explode

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
they can't explode

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.139 
they can't explode
typically<00:00:46.800> they're<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.219> gonna<00:00:47.370> leak<00:00:47.730> so

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
typically they're just gonna leak so

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.459 
typically they're just gonna leak so
you've<00:00:48.270> also<00:00:48.420> got<00:00:48.690> lower<00:00:48.870> temperatures

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you've also got lower temperatures

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.500 
you've also got lower temperatures
higher<00:00:49.770> efficiency<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.670> bear<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.120> mind<00:00:51.300> your

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
higher efficiency but bear in mind your

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.139 
higher efficiency but bear in mind your
card<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.530> explode<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.430> good<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.000> we've

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
card will not explode very good so we've

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.209 
card will not explode very good so we've
got<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.510> little<00:00:54.899> list<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> features<00:00:55.980> here

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
got a little list of the features here

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.060 
got a little list of the features here
so<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.699> DirectX<00:00:57.180> 11<00:00:57.570> SLI<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
so that is DirectX 11 SLI that is up to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.700 
so that is DirectX 11 SLI that is up to
three<00:00:59.340> way<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.699> even<00:00:59.820> four-way<00:01:00.359> SLI<00:01:00.710> surround

explain<00:03:38.519> why<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.239> don't<00:03:39.870> care<00:03:40.139> about<00:03:40.530> touching

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
explain why I don't care about touching

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.640 
explain why I don't care about touching
the<00:03:41.190> contacts<00:03:41.639> like<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.209> okay<00:03:42.989> here<00:03:43.349> let<00:03:43.620> me

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
the contacts like this okay here let me

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.319 
the contacts like this okay here let me
show<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.889> guys<00:03:44.099> so<00:03:44.639> you<00:03:44.730> see<00:03:44.940> where<00:03:45.180> my<00:03:45.209> finger

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
show you guys so you see where my finger

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.220 
show you guys so you see where my finger
touches<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.410> side<00:03:47.129> of<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.489> PCB<00:03:47.879> I<00:03:48.269> actually

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
touches the side of the PCB I actually

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.280 
touches the side of the PCB I actually
am<00:03:49.799> NOT<00:03:49.829> making<00:03:50.549> contact<00:03:51.299> with<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.109> little

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
am NOT making contact with the little

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.460 
am NOT making contact with the little
golden<00:03:52.889> contacts<00:03:53.870> along<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.079> edge<00:03:55.199> of<00:03:55.379> the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
golden contacts along the edge of the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.470 
golden contacts along the edge of the
PCI<00:03:55.799> Express<00:03:55.829> 16x<00:03:56.609> connector<00:03:57.000> look<00:03:57.239> at<00:03:57.329> that

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
PCI Express 16x connector look at that

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.750 
PCI Express 16x connector look at that
see<00:03:57.780> no<00:03:58.379> matter<00:03:58.500> how<00:03:58.769> hard<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.129> press<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.519> there

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
see no matter how hard I press on there

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.879 
see no matter how hard I press on there
I'm<00:03:59.909> not<00:04:00.209> going<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.449> touch<00:04:00.599> them<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.349> I'm<00:04:01.650> only

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
I'm not going to touch them so I'm only

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.460 
I'm not going to touch them so I'm only
touching<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.609> completely<00:04:03.329> inert<00:04:03.750> part<00:04:04.199> of<00:04:04.349> the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
touching a completely inert part of the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.830 
touching a completely inert part of the
PCB<00:04:04.980> when<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.519> handle<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.030> video<00:04:06.239> card<00:04:06.480> like<00:04:06.690> this

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
PCB when I handle a video card like this

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.379 
PCB when I handle a video card like this
so<00:04:07.019> there<00:04:07.169> you<00:04:07.290> go<00:04:07.440> now<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.370> know<00:04:08.669> let's<00:04:09.299> have

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
so there you go now you know let's have

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.059 
so there you go now you know let's have
a<00:04:09.510> look<00:04:09.690> at<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.930> back<00:04:10.079> of<00:04:10.109> this<00:04:10.319> video<00:04:10.620> card<00:04:10.919> so

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
a look at the back of this video card so

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.439 
a look at the back of this video card so
you<00:04:11.159> can<00:04:11.220> see<00:04:11.459> here<00:04:11.699> where<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.879> GPU<00:04:12.359> is

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
you can see here where the GPU is

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.180 
you can see here where the GPU is
situated<00:04:13.079> so<00:04:13.440> that's<00:04:13.620> going<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:13.799> be<00:04:13.979> where

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
situated so that's going to be where

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.750 
situated so that's going to be where
most<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.209> bulky<00:04:16.049> cooling<00:04:16.709> power<00:04:17.099> is<00:04:17.489> done

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
most of the bulky cooling power is done

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.120 
most of the bulky cooling power is done
now<00:04:18.209> bear<00:04:18.449> in<00:04:18.479> mind<00:04:18.599> the<00:04:18.959> GTX<00:04:19.349> 580<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.039> the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
now bear in mind the GTX 580 and the

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.590 
now bear in mind the GTX 580 and the
reference

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
reference

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.230 
reference
design<00:04:20.840> does<00:04:21.080> use<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.440> vapor<00:04:21.890> chamber<00:04:22.670> design

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
design does use a vapor chamber design

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.060 
design does use a vapor chamber design
so<00:04:23.540> it's<00:04:23.690> not<00:04:23.840> using<00:04:24.200> standard<00:04:24.590> heat<00:04:24.800> pipes

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
so it's not using standard heat pipes

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.560 
so it's not using standard heat pipes
next<00:04:25.850> we<00:04:25.970> have<00:04:26.180> some<00:04:26.480> vrm<00:04:27.050> cooling<00:04:27.560> our<00:04:28.010> VRM

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
next we have some vrm cooling our VRM

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.360 
next we have some vrm cooling our VRM
VRMs<00:04:29.570> here<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.050> that<00:04:30.200> is<00:04:30.470> delivering<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
speaking of power-hungry the GTX 580

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.550 
speaking of power-hungry the GTX 580
improves<00:04:40.940> over<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.330> 480<00:04:41.720> in<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.960> lot<00:04:42.170> of<00:04:42.350> ways

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
improves over the 480 in a lot of ways

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.460 
improves over the 480 in a lot of ways
one<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.220> which<00:04:43.460> is<00:04:43.610> performance<00:04:44.320> another<00:04:45.320> of

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
one of which is performance another of

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.470 
one of which is performance another of
which<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:45.800> heat<00:04:46.040> that<00:04:46.520> is<00:04:46.730> to<00:04:46.940> say<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:47.270> gives

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
which is heat that is to say it gives

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.410 
which is heat that is to say it gives
off<00:04:47.660> less<00:04:48.050> heat<00:04:48.290> than<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.620> 580<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.340> last<00:04:50.240> but

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
off less heat than the 580 and last but

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.270 
off less heat than the 580 and last but
not<00:04:50.570> least<00:04:50.840> is<00:04:51.080> power<00:04:51.380> consumption<00:04:52.010> so<00:04:52.160> the

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
not least is power consumption so the

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.530 
not least is power consumption so the
580<00:04:52.790> performs<00:04:53.420> better<00:04:53.690> runs<00:04:54.500> cooler<00:04:55.010> and

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
580 performs better runs cooler and

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.170 
580 performs better runs cooler and
doesn't<00:04:56.540> consume<00:04:56.960> as<00:04:57.200> much<00:04:57.410> power<00:04:57.740> as<00:04:57.920> the<00:04:58.640> GTX

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
doesn't consume as much power as the GTX

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.900 
doesn't consume as much power as the GTX
480<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:00.800> think<00:05:00.950> we've<00:05:01.250> looked<00:05:01.490> at<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:01.730> back

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
480 so I think we've looked at the back

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.270 
480 so I think we've looked at the back
of<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.150> card<00:05:02.420> fairly<00:05:02.990> in-depth<00:05:03.590> here<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:04.100> oh

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
of the card fairly in-depth here so oh

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.530 
of the card fairly in-depth here so oh
you<00:05:04.610> can<00:05:04.760> actually<00:05:04.820> see<00:05:05.150> there's<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.390> little

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
you can actually see there's a little

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.990 
you can actually see there's a little
vent<00:05:05.840> here<00:05:06.140> so<00:05:06.320> when<00:05:06.470> this<00:05:06.620> fan<00:05:06.890> spins<00:05:07.340> it's

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
vent here so when this fan spins it's

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.820 
vent here so when this fan spins it's
gonna<00:05:08.210> exhaust<00:05:08.570> just<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:09.200> little<00:05:09.470> bit<00:05:09.590> of<00:05:09.680> air

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
gonna exhaust just a little bit of air

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.860 
gonna exhaust just a little bit of air
out<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.100> back<00:05:10.280> cool<00:05:10.610> off<00:05:10.820> those<00:05:11.090> solid<00:05:11.600> caps

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
out the back cool off those solid caps

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.600 
out the back cool off those solid caps
and<00:05:12.320> make<00:05:12.710> sure<00:05:12.860> that<00:05:13.010> they're<00:05:13.190> all<00:05:13.220> staying

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
and make sure that they're all staying

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.990 
and make sure that they're all staying
nice<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:15.010> not<00:05:16.010> toasty

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
nice and not toasty

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.270 
nice and not toasty
so<00:05:17.330> that<00:05:17.480> is<00:05:17.630> performing<00:05:18.110> very<00:05:18.140> well<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:18.830> MSI

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
so that is performing very well so MSI

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.460 
so that is performing very well so MSI
has<00:05:19.550> put<00:05:19.790> on<00:05:19.940> their<00:05:20.270> customized<00:05:20.810> branding<00:05:21.350> on

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
has put on their customized branding on

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.080 
has put on their customized branding on
the<00:05:21.590> card<00:05:21.800> here<00:05:22.010> so<00:05:22.130> we've<00:05:22.250> got<00:05:22.280> an<00:05:22.490> MSI<00:05:22.880> logo

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
the card here so we've got an MSI logo

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.790 
the card here so we've got an MSI logo
to<00:05:23.360> go<00:05:23.510> along<00:05:23.720> with<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.960> GeForce<00:05:24.350> one<00:05:24.560> on<00:05:24.680> the

to go along with the GeForce one on the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.730 
to go along with the GeForce one on the
top<00:05:24.980> and<00:05:25.160> then<00:05:25.610> we've<00:05:25.760> got<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.030> little<00:05:26.740> looks

something what is this here there's a
bigger<00:05:31.730> one<00:05:31.880> here<00:05:32.150> if<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:32.390> guys<00:05:32.540> can<00:05:32.780> tell<00:05:32.990> me

bigger one here if you guys can tell me

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.420 
bigger one here if you guys can tell me
what<00:05:33.290> that<00:05:33.410> is<00:05:33.470> I<00:05:33.710> would<00:05:34.040> very<00:05:34.310> much

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
what that is I would very much

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.620 
what that is I would very much
appreciate<00:05:34.670> it<00:05:35.120> maybe<00:05:35.270> it's<00:05:35.420> like<00:05:35.480> a

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
appreciate it maybe it's like a

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.350 
appreciate it maybe it's like a
spaceship<00:05:36.250> I'm<00:05:37.250> not<00:05:37.460> actually<00:05:37.640> sure<00:05:38.000> anyway

so<00:05:38.420> it's<00:05:38.720> stuck<00:05:38.930> on<00:05:39.050> afterburner<00:05:39.680> branding<00:05:40.220> on

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
so it's stuck on afterburner branding on

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.310 
so it's stuck on afterburner branding on
it<00:05:40.490> as<00:05:40.610> well<00:05:41.060> as<00:05:41.210> MSI<00:05:41.600> branding<00:05:42.020> on<00:05:42.110> it<00:05:42.140> and

it as well as MSI branding on it and

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.300 
it as well as MSI branding on it and
