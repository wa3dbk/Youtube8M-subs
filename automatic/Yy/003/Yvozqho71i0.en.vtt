00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
difference on the connections you make

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
difference on the connections you make
between<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.380> feeling<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.070> what

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
between what you're feeling and what

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.230 
between what you're feeling and what
you're<00:01:44.310> putting<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.759> your<00:01:44.820> body

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you're putting in your body

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.300 
you're putting in your body
a<00:01:45.420> third<00:01:46.409> way<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.860> meet<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.130> doctor

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.819 
a third way you can meet your doctor
halfway<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.180> asking<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:48.869> records<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.590> all

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
halfway is asking for records of all

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.069 
halfway is asking for records of all
your<00:01:50.100> bloodwork<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:51.060> too<00:01:51.509> often<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.930> have

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
your bloodwork all too often I have

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.050 
your bloodwork all too often I have
people<00:01:52.409> come<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:53.009> me<00:01:53.040> talking<00:01:53.790> about

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
people come in to see me talking about

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.899 
people come in to see me talking about
how<00:01:54.329> they<00:01:55.020> had<00:01:55.259> their<00:01:55.649> whole<00:01:55.829> blood<00:01:56.340> work<00:01:56.549> done

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
how they had their whole blood work done

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.969 
how they had their whole blood work done
well<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.840> means<00:01:58.079> completely<00:01:58.560> different

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
well that means completely different

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.920 
well that means completely different
things<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.430> different<00:01:59.610> doctors<00:02:00.090> offices<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
things in different doctors offices and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.870 
things in different doctors offices and
furthermore<00:02:01.829> we're<00:02:02.040> treating<00:02:02.310> people<00:02:02.670> not

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
furthermore we're treating people not

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.730 
furthermore we're treating people not
tests<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.899> your<00:02:04.020> test<00:02:04.259> says<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.530> you're

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
tests so if your test says that you're

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.289 
tests so if your test says that you're
normal<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.310> you're<00:02:05.430> still<00:02:05.640> feeling<00:02:05.969> badly

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
normal but you're still feeling badly

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.600 
normal but you're still feeling badly
wouldn't<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:07.740> exactly<00:02:07.890> what

wouldn't you like to know exactly what

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.190 
wouldn't you like to know exactly what
those<00:02:08.729> test<00:02:09.030> scores<00:02:09.239> mean<00:02:09.509> instead<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.050> having

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
those test scores mean instead of having

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.660 
those test scores mean instead of having
the<00:02:10.319> nurse<00:02:10.470> practitioner<00:02:11.039> call<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.550> tell

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
a lot of people don't know is the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.520 
a lot of people don't know is the
standard<00:02:15.120> deviation<00:02:15.810> or<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.110> way<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.380> they

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
standard deviation or the way that they

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.950 
standard deviation or the way that they
measure<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.980> bell<00:02:17.220> curve<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:18.450> how<00:02:18.630> people

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
measure the bell curve for how people

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.660 
measure the bell curve for how people
are<00:02:19.050> feeling<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.680> lot<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.040> times<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.310> has<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.550> do

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
are feeling a lot of times it has to do

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.130 
are feeling a lot of times it has to do
with<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> last<00:02:21.090> thousand<00:02:21.570> people<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.990> walk

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
with the last thousand people that walk

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.760 
with the last thousand people that walk
through<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.470> door<00:02:22.710> or<00:02:23.240> general<00:02:24.240> trends<00:02:24.780> you

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
through the door or general trends you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.010 
through the door or general trends you
don't<00:02:25.950> want<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.160> be<00:02:26.250> compared<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.300> people

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
don't want to be compared to a people

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.080 
don't want to be compared to a people
that<00:02:28.410> are<00:02:28.590> increasingly<00:02:29.250> having<00:02:29.670> trouble

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
that are increasingly having trouble

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.400 
that are increasingly having trouble
with<00:02:30.180> their<00:02:30.300> health<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:31.110> want<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.320> be

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
with their health you want to be

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.590 
with their health you want to be
compared<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.860> your<00:02:32.310> most<00:02:32.640> optimal<00:02:33.120> health<00:02:33.330> and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
compared to your most optimal health and

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.970 
compared to your most optimal health and
so<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:33.990> why<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.320> really<00:02:34.380> important<00:02:34.890> to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
so that's why it's really important to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.760 
so that's why it's really important to
have<00:02:35.070> your<00:02:35.220> own<00:02:35.280> test<00:02:35.640> scores<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.680> getting<00:02:37.680> a

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
have your own test scores so getting a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.980 
have your own test scores so getting a
full<00:02:38.070> blood<00:02:38.460> work<00:02:38.760> done<00:02:39.090> means<00:02:39.600> very

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
full blood work done means very

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.540 
full blood work done means very
different<00:02:40.350> things<00:02:40.590> depending<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:41.190> who<00:02:41.400> you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
different things depending on who you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.660 
different things depending on who you
see<00:02:41.820> or<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.780> context<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.350> your<00:02:43.470> visit<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.430> for

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
see or the context of your visit so for

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.520 
see or the context of your visit so for
an<00:02:44.760> example<00:02:44.820> if<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.360> get<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.510> hormone<00:02:45.960> test<00:02:46.230> and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
an example if you get a hormone test and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.860 
an example if you get a hormone test and
your<00:02:46.680> cycling<00:02:47.250> woman<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:48.240> might<00:02:48.420> want<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.660> do

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
your cycling woman you might want to do

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.230 
your cycling woman you might want to do
two<00:02:49.290> different<00:02:49.500> tests<00:02:50.160> depending<00:02:50.460> on<00:02:50.850> when

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
two different tests depending on when

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.300 
two different tests depending on when
you<00:02:51.390> are<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.630> your<00:02:51.660> cycle<00:02:51.990> or<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.770> your<00:02:52.980> if

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you are in your cycle or if your if

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.770 
you are in your cycle or if your if
you've<00:02:53.460> had<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> hysterectomy<00:02:54.000> or<00:02:54.390> your

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
you've had a hysterectomy or your

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.930 
you've had a hysterectomy or your
postmenopausal<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:56.070> might<00:02:56.250> be<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.550> fine<00:02:56.820> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
postmenopausal you might be just fine to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.660 
postmenopausal you might be just fine to
do<00:02:57.090> one<00:02:57.270> test<00:02:57.480> score<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.380> getting<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.340> results

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
do one test score so getting the results

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.580 
do one test score so getting the results
of<00:02:59.760> your<00:02:59.850> tests<00:03:00.150> will<00:03:00.330> allow<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.990> take<00:03:01.380> a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
of your tests will allow you to take a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.520 
of your tests will allow you to take a
look<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:01.980> see<00:03:02.570> for<00:03:03.570> example<00:03:03.630> vitamin<00:03:04.080> D

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
look and see for example vitamin D

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.010 
look and see for example vitamin D
scores<00:03:04.950> are<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.490> always<00:03:05.790> measured<00:03:06.690> in

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
scores are not always measured in

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.710 
scores are not always measured in
standard<00:03:07.800> blood<00:03:08.250> work<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.730> those<00:03:09.390> are<00:03:09.540> two

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
standard blood work so those are two

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.530 
standard blood work so those are two
great<00:03:10.080> examples<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:11.040> fourth<00:03:11.940> way<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.390> can

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
great examples a fourth way that you can

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.090 
great examples a fourth way that you can
meet<00:03:12.660> your<00:03:12.780> doctor<00:03:12.960> halfway<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.800> really

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
your own hands is to look for what I

better<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.870> for<00:04:22.200> an<00:04:22.289> example<00:04:22.380> if<00:04:23.100> you're
