00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
straightforward we're going to start off

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.000 
straightforward we're going to start off
here<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.719> front<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> vehicle<00:00:49.350> where

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
here at the front of the vehicle where

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.830 
here at the front of the vehicle where
essentially<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> push<00:00:50.969> bar<00:00:51.270> we've<00:00:51.809> got

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
essentially we have a push bar we've got

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.700 
essentially we have a push bar we've got
a<00:00:52.110> 500<00:00:52.949> series<00:00:53.370> LED<00:00:54.030> linear<00:00:54.570> mounted<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:55.500> a

a 500 series LED linear mounted with a
red<00:00:56.520> lens<00:00:57.180> now<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.170> course<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.500> this

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
red lens now you can of course get this

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
red lens now you can of course get this
with<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.340> clear<00:00:59.879> lens<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> course<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
with a clear lens because of course the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.680 
with a clear lens because of course the
diode<00:01:01.289> inside<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.760> defines<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
diode inside here is what defines the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.719 
diode inside here is what defines the
color<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.350> case<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> client<00:01:04.890> wanted

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
color but in this case the client wanted

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.140 
color but in this case the client wanted
to<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.360> red<00:01:07.110> lens<00:01:07.320> over<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.549> also<00:01:08.729> in

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
to have a red lens over it we also in

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.320 
to have a red lens over it we also in
Oregon<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:11.100> states<00:01:11.400> allowed<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
use red and blue on fire apparatus and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.370 
use red and blue on fire apparatus and
as<00:01:14.850> obviously<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> fire<00:01:15.780> rescue<00:01:16.200> rig

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
as obviously this is a fire rescue rig

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.249 
as obviously this is a fire rescue rig
we<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.100> blue<00:01:17.430> also<00:01:18.030> mounted<00:01:18.390> opposite<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
we have blue also mounted opposite to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.469 
we have blue also mounted opposite to
red<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:19.830> again<00:01:20.130> they've<00:01:20.549> decided<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.090> use

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
red then again they've decided to use

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.590 
red then again they've decided to use

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
then red on the corners and again this

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.729 
then red on the corners and again this
is<00:02:09.509> something<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:10.020> been<00:02:10.229> typically

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
is something that's been typically

well<00:02:13.920> let's<00:02:14.070> take<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.280> look<00:02:14.580> at<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.540> light

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
well let's take a look at the go light

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.020 
well let's take a look at the go light
controller<00:02:16.710> units<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.250> as<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.610> see<00:02:17.790> here

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
controller units and as you can see here

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.910 
controller units and as you can see here
basically<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.510> turn<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> unit<00:02:19.050> on<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
basically you turn the unit on and you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.070 
basically you turn the unit on and you
have<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.160> ability<00:02:20.250> using<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:20.940> joystick<00:02:21.450> to

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
have the ability using this joystick to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.660 
have the ability using this joystick to
move<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.740> light<00:02:22.920> around<00:02:23.070> with<00:02:23.580> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
move the light around with the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.250 
move the light around with the
respective<00:02:24.210> direction<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.870> want<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
respective direction that you want it to

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.800 
respective direction that you want it to
turn<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:26.100> again<00:02:26.340> there<00:02:26.490> are<00:02:26.550> obviously<00:02:26.760> r2<00:02:27.210> so

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
turn now again there are obviously r2 so

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.090 
turn now again there are obviously r2 so
again<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.140> get<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> two<00:02:28.560> different<00:02:28.920> lights

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
again you get a two different lights

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.650 
again you get a two different lights
doing<00:02:29.490> two<00:02:29.640> different<00:02:30.000> functions<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.510> going

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
doing two different functions I'm going

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.640 
doing two different functions I'm going
to<00:02:30.720> play<00:02:30.870> around<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.290> little<00:02:31.350> bit<00:02:31.500> but

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
to play around a little bit but

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.310 
to play around a little bit but
basically<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.820> see<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.300> quite<00:02:33.870> clearly

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
basically you can see that quite clearly

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.580 
basically you can see that quite clearly
also<00:02:34.920> inside<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.450> area<00:02:36.810> inside<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.350> cab

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
also inside in this area inside the cab
