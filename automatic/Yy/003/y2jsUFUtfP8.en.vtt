so<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> will<00:00:24.660> first<00:00:24.930> launch<00:00:26.000> evil<00:00:27.000> befall<00:00:27.300> into

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
so I will first launch evil befall into

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.330 
so I will first launch evil befall into
the<00:00:27.810> bb10<00:00:28.230> attack<00:00:28.500> type<00:00:28.680> stadium<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.189> this

launcher here bottle B best of five and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:42.770 
launcher here bottle B best of five and
I<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.489> alternate<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.180> launch<00:00:33.390> sequence<00:00:41.780> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
I will alternate the launch sequence and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.130 
I will alternate the launch sequence and

once again I still failed to launch
properly<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.070> I'll<00:00:47.219> restart<00:00:49.550> poison<00:00:50.550> ro<00:00:50.730> it

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.090 

and<00:01:12.299> strong<00:01:12.840> attacks<00:01:13.170> from<00:01:13.350> galaxy<00:01:13.680> Pegasus

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and strong attacks from galaxy Pegasus

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.760 
and strong attacks from galaxy Pegasus
may<00:01:14.369> look<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> end<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.140> evil<00:01:16.470> befall

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
may look like at the end for evil befall

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.410 
may look like at the end for evil befall
that<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.130> most<00:01:17.400> likely<00:01:17.580> not<00:01:17.909> because<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.330> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that is most likely not because it is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.370 
that is most likely not because it is
going<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:20.640> does<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.570> evil<00:01:22.080> befall

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
going down and it does so evil befall

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.210 
going down and it does so evil befall
takes<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> win<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.369> round<00:01:23.610> 1<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:25.220> will

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
takes the win for round 1 and I will

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.639 
takes the win for round 1 and I will
launch<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.330> second<00:01:27.840> grounded<00:01:28.200> Oh<00:01:33.649> failed

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.280 

different<00:02:30.120> way<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.239> launching<00:02:30.510> them<00:02:30.930> into<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.710 
stadium
this<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.700> third<00:02:32.940> round<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.359> you<00:02:33.480> didn't

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
this is the third round if you didn't

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.560 
this is the third round if you didn't
already<00:02:33.780> hear<00:02:34.200> me<00:02:34.320> say<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.420> guys<00:02:36.420> who

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
already hear me say that and guys who

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.960 
already hear me say that and guys who
takes<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.930> circles<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.470> will<00:02:37.620> fall<00:02:38.010> which

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
takes in circles you will fall which

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.210 
takes in circles you will fall which
sits<00:02:39.329> in<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.840> center

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
sits in the center

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.220 
sits in the center
so<00:02:42.700> once<00:02:42.880> again<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.330> should<00:02:43.630> say<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:46.570> closing<00:02:47.110> in

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
so once again I should say so closing in

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.590 
so once again I should say so closing in
for<00:02:47.410> contact<00:02:47.890> goes<00:02:48.070> galaxy<00:02:48.520> Pegasus<00:02:49.060> makes<00:02:49.390> a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
for contact goes galaxy Pegasus makes a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.750 
for contact goes galaxy Pegasus makes a
few<00:02:50.020> attacks<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.950> does<00:02:51.130> not<00:02:51.340> look<00:02:51.520> like

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
few attacks but it does not look like

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.140 
few attacks but it does not look like
it's<00:02:51.940> gonna<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.360> anything<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:53.020> evil<00:02:53.410> befall<00:02:54.150> so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
it's gonna do anything to evil befall so
