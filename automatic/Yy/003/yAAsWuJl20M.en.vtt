that<00:01:01.249> we've<00:01:01.370> seen<00:01:01.579> on<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:01.789> show<00:01:01.820> before<00:01:02.260> this

that we've seen on the show before this

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.049 
that we've seen on the show before this
is<00:01:03.469> essentially<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.100> same<00:01:04.339> engine<00:01:04.790> now<00:01:04.909> it's

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
is essentially the same engine now it's

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.240 
is essentially the same engine now it's
been<00:01:05.239> it's<00:01:05.570> more<00:01:05.720> of<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.900> DBS<00:01:06.350> engine<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:07.070> is

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
been it's more of the DBS engine this is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.030 
been it's more of the DBS engine this is
the<00:01:07.400> v12<00:01:07.940> shoved<00:01:08.630> into<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.020> smaller<00:01:09.320> car<00:01:09.680> it

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
the v12 shoved into the smaller car it

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.520 
the v12 shoved into the smaller car it
makes<00:01:10.250> 510<00:01:11.060> horsepower<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.810> I<00:01:12.260> think<00:01:12.440> it's

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
makes 510 horsepower and I think it's

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.070 
makes 510 horsepower and I think it's
about<00:01:12.620> 420<00:01:13.340> foot-pounds<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:14.240> torque<00:01:14.300> Wow<00:01:14.870> and

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
about 420 foot-pounds of torque Wow and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.320 
about 420 foot-pounds of torque Wow and
it<00:01:15.380> just<00:01:15.620> feels<00:01:16.160> amazing<00:01:16.490> what's<00:01:17.090> great<00:01:17.300> about

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
it just feels amazing what's great about

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.240 
it just feels amazing what's great about
is<00:01:17.660> because<00:01:18.020> it's<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.320> smaller<00:01:18.590> car

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
is because it's the smaller car

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.770 
is because it's the smaller car
it<00:01:19.760> weighs<00:01:19.910> 143<00:01:20.780> pounds<00:01:21.080> less<00:01:21.590> than<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:22.130> DBS

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
it weighs 143 pounds less than the DBS

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.720 
it weighs 143 pounds less than the DBS

all this aggressive venting on the hood

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.330 
all this aggressive venting on the hood
is<00:01:25.910> absolutely<00:01:26.570> necessary<00:01:26.890> this<00:01:27.890> car<00:01:28.100> here

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
is absolutely necessary this car here
