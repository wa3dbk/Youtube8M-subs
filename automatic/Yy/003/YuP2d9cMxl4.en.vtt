00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.629

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.920
 minutes I feel like it got lost and I go in and 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.359
 unfortunately it was against 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.309
 we who have gone against them 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.690

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.180
 I had marked the ones I marked there 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.210

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.909
 entered as a soda and then it ended 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.559
 losing that mark gregory man of the 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.360
 selection of martinique mer technique le 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.990

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.990
 Gregor did this look he said 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.899
 of position number 7 cristian martínez 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.200

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.740
 it has now 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.720
 now 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.880
 If these things happen in another court, 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.170
 I know what this is 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.730
 and he liked it I repeat it a lot but 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.670
 gustavo I would not speak because 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.670
 the campaign of santa fe has been very good 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.020
 put number six and besides that equal him 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.210
 when he talks about Colombia he has authority 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.190
 He is very respected in Colombia for his great 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.450
 sergio work mira de macará days 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.450
 several to the hundreds 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.609
 and I 'm not in him 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.679
 have a friend about it but one 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.500
 it's wrong that you say something mario is not 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.710
 bad you say something what makes yes it 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.360
 Mario of himself as power to power 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.410
 nominator of Peru 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.290
 mauro sports power very well placed 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.620
 number 5 matheus america de minas gerais 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.120
 Let's go to the Brasilirao Abri Marcelo Bielsa 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.040
 in which there was talk that he was going to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.670
 direct to facility or is encouraged to 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.240
 talk now that operates in sense 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:36.150
 otherwise the objective pursued is 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.980
 agree with position number 4 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.140
 It's Ney from Vasco da Gama 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.380
 but I tell you the football things and there are 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.410
 to resign yourself and you have to 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.410
 and sometimes these things happen in front 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.319
 Carlos Galvan so the Caesar Vallejo 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.189
 play 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.189
 it's bad 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:32.760
 but we continue in Peru diego penny man 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.550
 of sporting crystal looks 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.450
 not for 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.520
 inside 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.520
 nothing at all 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.780
 hot can without things 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.240
 of shortening 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.990
 michael the number 1 place 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.959
 this boy mauri is a great goal but 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.970
 you know what this unconscious and 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:22.740
 responsible is not worth that you do not want 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.700
 help you to a precipice also for 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.700
 celebrate the world outside 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.000
 it does not have to happen if it's going to happen to you but 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.650
 at least reduce margin of error 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.760
 because we are going to agree with this that what 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.760
 what did madrid is poor
