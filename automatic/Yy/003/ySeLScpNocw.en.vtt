00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.070 
whim but from the first day of design
school<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.089> just<00:00:15.210> felt<00:00:15.509> like<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.750> was<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:15.990> the

school I just felt like I was in the
right<00:00:16.199> place<00:00:16.410> doing<00:00:16.859> maybe<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.490> needs<00:00:17.760> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
right place doing maybe this needs to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.390 
right place doing maybe this needs to
move<00:00:18.119> back<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.770> only<00:00:19.920> gotten<00:00:20.279> better

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
move back and it's only gotten better

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
is the execution part of things there's

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.300 
is the execution part of things there's
a<00:00:27.720> lot<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.080> moving<00:00:28.230> parts<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.740> every<00:00:29.070> project

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and just executing things seamlessly can

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.670 
and just executing things seamlessly can
sometimes<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> challenge<00:00:33.840> were

what<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.800> achieve<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.160> try<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
what they want to achieve and try to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.330 
what they want to achieve and try to
interpret<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.780> then<00:00:52.320> bring<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
interpret that and then bring that to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.709 
interpret that and then bring that to
life<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:53.969> definitely<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> my

favorite<00:00:55.110> parts<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.829> design<00:00:56.100> process<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
favorite parts of the design process I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.510 
favorite parts of the design process I
was<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:58.109> excited<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:58.590> house<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> home

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
was really excited when house and home

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490 
was really excited when house and home
asked<00:00:59.850> me<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.090> create<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.359> space<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:00.870> Elte<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
asked me to create a space at Elte and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.540 
asked me to create a space at Elte and
when<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:01.710> told<00:01:01.920> me<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.039> could<00:01:02.309> choose

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
when they told me I could choose

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
when they told me I could choose
whatever<00:01:02.789> room<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.660> wanted<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.500> thought

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
whatever room I wanted to I thought

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.120 
whatever room I wanted to I thought
about<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:06.060> was<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> least<00:01:06.689> likely

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
about what what was the least likely

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.560 
about what what was the least likely
room<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.430> me<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> opportunity<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
room for me to have the opportunity to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.750 
room for me to have the opportunity to
design<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:11.040> thought<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> cocktail

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
design and I just thought a cocktail

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
design and I just thought a cocktail
room<00:01:11.939> would<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.479> much<00:01:12.630> fun<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.260> allow

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
room would be so much fun and what allow

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.920 
room would be so much fun and what allow
us<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.159> creative<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> pieces<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
us to be creative with the pieces and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.570 
us to be creative with the pieces and
the<00:01:16.020> lighting<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.590> chose<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:17.310> really

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the lighting that we chose we really

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.130 
the lighting that we chose we really
just<00:01:17.700> wanted<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.360> something<00:01:18.509> warm

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
just wanted to go with something warm

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.130 
just wanted to go with something warm
and<00:01:19.670> monochromatic<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:21.840> wanted<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and monochromatic we really wanted to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
and monochromatic we really wanted to
create<00:01:22.290> some<00:01:22.680> focal<00:01:23.040> areas<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:23.820> lighting

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
create some focal areas from lighting

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.499 
create some focal areas from lighting
and<00:01:24.570> artwork<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.770> did<00:01:25.950> here

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
and artwork and that's what we did here

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.270 
and artwork and that's what we did here
when<00:01:27.509> Lydia<00:01:27.780> Chantel<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.710> first<00:01:28.979> came<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
when Lydia Chantel and I first came to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.840 
when Lydia Chantel and I first came to
Alti<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:30.360> came<00:01:31.290> upstairs<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.220> saw<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> space

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
Alti we came upstairs and saw the space

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.130 
Alti we came upstairs and saw the space
that<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.180> had<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> work<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.079> was

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that we had to work with and it was

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.950 
that we had to work with and it was
really<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.470> blank<00:01:34.799> canvas<00:01:35.310> unpainted<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.450> we

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
really a blank canvas unpainted and we

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
really a blank canvas unpainted and we
sat<00:01:37.409> down<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.920> figured<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> paint<00:01:38.880> color

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
sat down and figured out a paint color

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.880 
sat down and figured out a paint color
and<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.659> drew<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> floor<00:01:40.229> plan<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
and then we drew up a floor plan and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.050 
and then we drew up a floor plan and
then<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.250> walked<00:01:41.490> through<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> store<00:01:42.030> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
then we walked through the store and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.780 
and accessories one of my favorite
things<00:02:08.350> that<00:02:08.440> we<00:02:08.619> did<00:02:08.800> in<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.070> space<00:02:09.340> was<00:02:09.610> how

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
things that we did in the space was how

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.330 
things that we did in the space was how
we<00:02:09.850> paired<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.720> horse<00:02:11.200> photography<00:02:11.890> with<00:02:12.130> the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
we paired the horse photography with the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.940 
we paired the horse photography with the
three<00:02:13.000> mirrors<00:02:13.840> going<00:02:14.350> vertically<00:02:14.800> on<00:02:14.920> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
three mirrors going vertically on the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.650 
three mirrors going vertically on the
wall<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.280> just<00:02:15.460> think<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.940> really<00:02:16.150> gives<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
wall I just think it really gives the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.330 
wall I just think it really gives the
room<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.110> sense<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.560> luxury<00:02:17.830> and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
room that sense of luxury and

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.510 
room that sense of luxury and
lusciousness<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.770> also<00:02:21.100> love<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
lusciousness and I just also love the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.010 
lusciousness and I just also love the
chartreuse<00:02:22.000> ottoman<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.660> could<00:02:22.840> picture

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
chartreuse ottoman I could picture

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.840 
chartreuse ottoman I could picture
myself<00:02:23.290> sitting<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.070> blast<00:02:24.310> chair<00:02:24.640> with

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
myself sitting on the blast chair with

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.110 
myself sitting on the blast chair with
my<00:02:25.000> feet<00:02:25.420> up<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.780> having<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.170> glass<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.590> wine

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
my feet up and having a glass of wine

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.880 
my feet up and having a glass of wine
and<00:02:28.120> another<00:02:28.720> thing<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.170> loved<00:02:29.560> are<00:02:29.770> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
and another thing that I loved are the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.830 
and another thing that I loved are the
gold<00:02:30.160> balls<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.940> we<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.240> placed<00:02:31.510> on<00:02:31.720> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
gold balls that we just placed on the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.260 
gold balls that we just placed on the
floor<00:02:31.990> I<00:02:32.350> just<00:02:32.680> think<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.010> creates<00:02:33.520> an<00:02:33.790> awesome

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
floor I just think it creates an awesome

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.060 
floor I just think it creates an awesome
focal<00:02:34.690> area<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:35.380> gives<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.709> room<00:02:35.830> that

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
focal area and just gives the room that

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.580 
focal area and just gives the room that
punch<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.700> needs<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.350> think<00:02:38.350> about<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
punch that it needs I think about a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.660 
punch that it needs I think about a
cocktail<00:02:38.860> room<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:40.050> envision<00:02:41.050> men<00:02:41.920> getting

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
cocktail room I envision men getting

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.760 
cocktail room I envision men getting
together<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.330> socializing<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.350> drinking

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
together and socializing and drinking

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.160 
together and socializing and drinking
whiskey<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.490> such<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.270> that's<00:02:46.720> where<00:02:46.990> the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
whiskey and such so that's where the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.260 
whiskey and such so that's where the
inspiration<00:02:47.560> came<00:02:48.130> from<00:02:48.190> for<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.910> design<00:02:49.240> of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
inspiration came from for the design of

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.960 
inspiration came from for the design of
this<00:02:49.540> room<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:50.110> think<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:51.100> gravitate<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.940> a

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
this room I think I gravitate to a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.180 
this room I think I gravitate to a
design<00:02:52.300> style<00:02:52.690> that's<00:02:52.990> modern<00:02:53.560> but<00:02:53.830> at<00:02:54.070> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
design style that's modern but at the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.070 
design style that's modern but at the
same<00:02:54.370> time<00:02:54.640> timeless<00:02:55.300> with<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.570> little<00:02:55.870> bit<00:02:55.989> of

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
same time timeless with a little bit of

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.590 
same time timeless with a little bit of
edge<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:57.010> room<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.430> not<00:02:57.610> complete<00:02:58.150> without<00:02:58.390> a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
edge the room is not complete without a

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.860 
edge the room is not complete without a
dog<00:03:00.600> gosh

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
dog gosh

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.070 
dog gosh
heavy<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.530> really<00:03:03.280> try<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.580> lay<00:03:04.540> our<00:03:04.660> different

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
heavy I really try to lay our different

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.050 
heavy I really try to lay our different
textures<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.739> introduce<00:03:06.130> new<00:03:06.160> materials<00:03:06.880> and

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
textures and introduce new materials and

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.699 
textures and introduce new materials and
we're<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.330> always<00:03:07.750> looking<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.260> do<00:03:08.440> new

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
we're just always looking to do new

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.300 
we're just always looking to do new
things<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.220> push<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.670> design<00:03:10.000> envelope<00:03:11.310> my

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
things and push the design envelope my

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.820 
things and push the design envelope my
favorite<00:03:12.790> color<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.360> don't<00:03:14.050> love<00:03:14.260> color

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
favorite color I don't love color

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.550 
favorite color I don't love color
I<00:03:15.070> don't<00:03:15.910> mind<00:03:16.209> introducing<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.200> in<00:03:17.350> very

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
I don't mind introducing it in very

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.610 
I don't mind introducing it in very
small<00:03:17.680> ways<00:03:18.690> but<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.930> don't<00:03:20.140> like<00:03:20.290> color

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
small ways but I don't like color

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.509 
small ways but I don't like color
I<00:03:20.800> think<00:03:21.730> I'm<00:03:21.880> drawn<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.269> more<00:03:22.750> tone-on-tone

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
I think I'm drawn to more tone-on-tone

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.150 
I think I'm drawn to more tone-on-tone
things<00:03:24.519> better<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:26.320> then<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.620> like<00:03:27.040> to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
things better and then I like to

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.580 
things better and then I like to
introduce<00:03:27.430> color<00:03:27.910> in<00:03:28.239> very<00:03:28.540> small<00:03:28.660> ways<00:03:28.900> for

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
introduce color in very small ways for

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.530 
introduce color in very small ways for
example<00:03:30.070> in<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:30.489> room<00:03:30.670> we<00:03:31.120> use<00:03:31.330> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
example in this room we use the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.600 
example in this room we use the
chartreuse<00:03:31.930> ottoman<00:03:32.530> just<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.920> introduce<00:03:33.280> a

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
chartreuse ottoman just to introduce a

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.330 
chartreuse ottoman just to introduce a
pop<00:03:33.820> of<00:03:34.000> color<00:03:34.209> or<00:03:34.330> an<00:03:34.720> artwork<00:03:35.050> but<00:03:35.860> I<00:03:35.890> think
