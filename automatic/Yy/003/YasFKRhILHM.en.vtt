all right lads this is fana from

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.349 
all right lads this is fana from
frenetic<00:00:06.430> array<00:00:06.580> and<00:00:06.759> this<00:00:06.880> is<00:00:07.090> Venice

frenetic array and this is Venice
fundamentals<00:00:08.080> this<00:00:08.380> is<00:00:08.590> the<00:00:08.889> start<00:00:09.160> of<00:00:09.250> the

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
fundamentals this is the start of the

leagues if I'm to be honest like these
leaked<00:00:14.680> sections<00:00:15.220> they're<00:00:15.430> not<00:00:15.610> you<00:00:16.359> don't

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
leaked sections they're not you don't

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.750 
leaked sections they're not you don't
need<00:00:16.810> to<00:00:16.869> do<00:00:17.230> them<00:00:17.500> um<00:00:17.710> you<00:00:18.400> know<00:00:18.519> the<00:00:18.609> whole

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
need to do them um you know the whole

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.700 
need to do them um you know the whole
bowl<00:00:19.179> of<00:00:19.210> this<00:00:19.599> guide<00:00:19.839> is<00:00:19.869> just<00:00:20.289> to<00:00:20.409> improve

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
bowl of this guide is just to improve

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.560 
bowl of this guide is just to improve
your<00:00:20.769> mechanics<00:00:21.339> the<00:00:21.970> thing<00:00:22.210> about<00:00:22.390> these

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
your mechanics the thing about these

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.540 
your mechanics the thing about these
league<00:00:22.839> things<00:00:23.169> is<00:00:23.470> that<00:00:23.499> they're<00:00:24.369> going<00:00:24.489> to

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
league things is that they're going to

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.399 
league things is that they're going to
give<00:00:24.699> you<00:00:24.849> bills<00:00:25.119> that<00:00:25.509> allow<00:00:25.779> you<00:00:25.839> to<00:00:26.050> like

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:26.409 
give you bills that allow you to like

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.009 
give you bills that allow you to like
have<00:00:26.710> stepping<00:00:27.159> stones<00:00:27.460> little<00:00:27.909> goals<00:00:28.150> where

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
have stepping stones little goals where

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.200 
have stepping stones little goals where
you<00:00:29.140> can<00:00:29.319> impress<00:00:30.249> like<00:00:30.429> go<00:00:30.640> up<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.880> ladders

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
you can impress like go up the ladders

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.090 
you can impress like go up the ladders
but<00:00:31.720> if<00:00:31.989> you<00:00:32.140> just<00:00:32.320> want<00:00:32.380> you<00:00:32.619> to<00:00:32.739> improve<00:00:33.070> your

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
but if you just want you to improve your

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.889 
but if you just want you to improve your
mechanics<00:00:33.610> you<00:00:33.790> could<00:00:33.940> just<00:00:34.120> do<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.540> what

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
mechanics you could just do the what

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.709 
mechanics you could just do the what
what<00:00:35.289> you<00:00:35.440> did<00:00:35.620> last<00:00:35.890> in<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:36.879> last<00:00:37.030> video<00:00:37.269> you

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
what you did last in the last video you

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.500 
what you did last in the last video you
know<00:00:38.079> just<00:00:38.260> practice<00:00:38.649> everything<00:00:39.010> at<00:00:39.250> once

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
know just practice everything at once

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.930 
know just practice everything at once
with<00:00:40.649> harder<00:00:41.649> and<00:00:41.769> harder<00:00:41.920> builds<00:00:42.370> so<00:00:42.550> instead

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
with harder and harder builds so instead

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.130 
with harder and harder builds so instead
of<00:00:43.000> just<00:00:43.149> doing<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.449> two<00:00:43.570> base<00:00:43.750> build<00:00:44.019> you

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
of just doing the two base build you

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.389 
of just doing the two base build you
could<00:00:44.260> just<00:00:44.379> do<00:00:44.469> a<00:00:44.500> three<00:00:44.769> base<00:00:44.920> build<00:00:45.219> in

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
could just do a three base build in

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.069 
could just do a three base build in
single<00:00:45.760> player<00:00:45.789> but<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.750> thing<00:00:46.929> is<00:00:46.960> about

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
single player but the thing is about

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.410 
single player but the thing is about
that<00:00:47.559> like<00:00:47.739> that<00:00:47.949> is<00:00:48.100> incredibly<00:00:48.550> tedious

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
that like that is incredibly tedious

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.139 
that like that is incredibly tedious
it's<00:00:50.379> not<00:00:50.620> very<00:00:50.800> exciting<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.609> doesn't<00:00:51.910> give

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
it's not very exciting it doesn't give

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.200 
it's not very exciting it doesn't give
you<00:00:52.179> actual<00:00:52.660> goals<00:00:53.199> to<00:00:53.710> aspire<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.820> whereas

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
you actual goals to aspire to whereas

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.000 
you actual goals to aspire to whereas
this<00:00:55.390> like<00:00:55.600> you<00:00:55.749> can<00:00:55.929> try<00:00:56.289> and<00:00:56.379> do<00:00:56.530> this<00:00:56.559> and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
this like you can try and do this and

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.049 
this like you can try and do this and
then<00:00:57.370> you're<00:00:57.550> going<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.699> get<00:00:57.789> a<00:00:57.850> promotion

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
then you're going to get a promotion

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.090 
then you're going to get a promotion
which<00:00:58.899> is<00:00:59.019> going<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.230> be<00:00:59.289> really<00:00:59.440> nice<00:00:59.710> so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
which is going to be really nice so

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.189 
which is going to be really nice so
we're<00:01:00.969> going<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.149> jump<00:01:01.390> straight<00:01:01.809> into<00:01:01.989> this

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
we're going to jump straight into this

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.720 
we're going to jump straight into this
build<00:01:02.499> here<00:01:02.769> let<00:01:02.949> me<00:01:03.039> get<00:01:03.159> it<00:01:03.219> up<00:01:03.399> on<00:01:03.579> this

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
build here let me get it up on this

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.930 
build here let me get it up on this
monitor<00:01:04.199> yep<00:01:05.199> there<00:01:05.620> we<00:01:05.680> go<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.100> I've<00:01:06.910> just

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
monitor yep there we go and I've just

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.360 
monitor yep there we go and I've just
got<00:01:07.270> me<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.420> nice<00:01:07.630> fresh<00:01:08.080> new<00:01:08.560> bronze<00:01:08.920> account

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
got me a nice fresh new bronze account

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.070 
got me a nice fresh new bronze account
and<00:01:10.150> so<00:01:10.450> we'll<00:01:10.660> be<00:01:10.810> doing<00:01:11.050> this<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:12.510> yeah<00:01:13.510> so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
and so we'll be doing this and yeah so

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.860 
and so we'll be doing this and yeah so
these<00:01:14.590> builds<00:01:15.130> are<00:01:16.000> just<00:01:16.210> gonna<00:01:16.330> be<00:01:16.540> we're

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
these builds are just gonna be we're

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.330 
these builds are just gonna be we're
still<00:01:17.080> gonna<00:01:17.200> be<00:01:17.320> focusing<00:01:17.530> purely<00:01:18.040> on

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
still gonna be focusing purely on

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.240 
still gonna be focusing purely on
mechanics<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:20.110> bilge<00:01:20.350> just<00:01:20.800> give<00:01:21.010> you<00:01:21.220> a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
mechanics the bilge just give you a

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.810 
mechanics the bilge just give you a
point<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:23.410> they're<00:01:23.680> just<00:01:23.890> they're<00:01:24.340> soo

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
point that they're just they're soo

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.760 
point that they're just they're soo
they're<00:01:25.690> just<00:01:25.720> good<00:01:25.990> builds<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.440> you<00:01:26.560> don't

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
they're just good builds that you don't

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.340 
they're just good builds that you don't
need<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.070> scout<00:01:27.370> with<00:01:27.610> so<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.930> don't<00:01:29.110> need<00:01:29.200> to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
need to scout with so you don't need to

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.570 
need to scout with so you don't need to
scout<00:01:29.620> with<00:01:29.770> these<00:01:29.890> builds<00:01:30.220> that's<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:30.460> whole

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
scout with these builds that's the whole

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.550 
scout with these builds that's the whole
point<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.210> whole<00:01:31.390> focus<00:01:31.900> is<00:01:32.020> just<00:01:32.230> to<00:01:32.380> focus

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
point the whole focus is just to focus

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.680 
point the whole focus is just to focus
on<00:01:32.860> yourself<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.430> won't<00:01:33.640> get<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.150> hundred

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
on yourself you won't get a hundred

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.480 
on yourself you won't get a hundred
percent<00:01:34.900> win<00:01:35.470> rate<00:01:35.680> with<00:01:35.830> these<00:01:35.980> builds<00:01:36.340> but

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
percent win rate with these builds but

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.220 
percent win rate with these builds but
again<00:01:36.970> that's<00:01:37.210> not<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.540> point<00:01:37.690> like<00:01:38.050> the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
again that's not the point like the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.850 
again that's not the point like the
point<00:01:38.500> is<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:39.480> focus<00:01:40.480> on<00:01:40.720> mechanics<00:01:41.230> whilst

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
point is to focus on mechanics whilst

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.490 
point is to focus on mechanics whilst
achieving<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.850> new<00:01:43.060> league<00:01:43.330> so<00:01:43.750> we're<00:01:44.290> going<00:01:44.440> to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
achieving a new league so we're going to

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.080 
achieving a new league so we're going to
focus<00:01:44.650> on<00:01:44.890> these<00:01:45.040> mechanics<00:01:45.550> first<00:01:45.910> of<00:01:46.030> all

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
focus on these mechanics first of all

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.840 
focus on these mechanics first of all
we've<00:01:46.270> got<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.420> 9<00:01:46.630> Overlord<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.290> then<00:01:47.850> yeah

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
we've got a 9 Overlord and then yeah

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.090 
we've got a 9 Overlord and then yeah
nice<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.330> easy<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:49.750> again<00:01:50.500> we<00:01:50.680> want<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:50.980> focus

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
nice and easy so again we want to focus

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.380 
nice and easy so again we want to focus
on<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.460> mechanics<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:51.940> we've<00:01:52.120> learned

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
on the mechanics that we've learned

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.690 
on the mechanics that we've learned
before<00:01:52.540> so<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.440> seems<00:01:53.650> we<00:01:53.740> build<00:01:53.950> no<00:01:54.100> board<00:01:54.370> we

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
before so it seems we build no board we

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.040 
before so it seems we build no board we
want<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.970> spread<00:01:55.120> him<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.660> doesn't<00:01:55.960> matter

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
want to spread him it doesn't matter

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.980 
want to spread him it doesn't matter
where<00:01:56.350> let's<00:01:56.770> put<00:01:56.950> him<00:01:57.040> on<00:01:57.130> this<00:01:57.280> ledge<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.840> we

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
where let's put him on this ledge but we

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.590 
where let's put him on this ledge but we
want<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.290> do<00:02:00.130> all<00:02:00.460> mechanics<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.120> will<00:02:01.420> learn

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
want to do all mechanics that will learn

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.300 
want to do all mechanics that will learn
so<00:02:01.870> far<00:02:02.140> because<00:02:02.710> it's<00:02:02.950> going<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.160> give<00:02:03.280> us

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
so far because it's going to give us

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.340 
so far because it's going to give us
such<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.700> good<00:02:03.970> habit<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.390> again<00:02:04.630> once<00:02:05.110> we<00:02:05.200> get

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
such a good habit and again once we get

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.260 
such a good habit and again once we get
to<00:02:05.410> 10<00:02:05.680> supply<00:02:06.010> just<00:02:06.340> set<00:02:06.610> those<00:02:06.820> camera

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
to 10 supply just set those camera

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.330 
to 10 supply just set those camera
hotkeys<00:02:07.660> um<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:08.560> won't<00:02:08.709> need<00:02:08.830> them<00:02:08.950> too<00:02:09.160> much

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
hotkeys um you won't need them too much

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.570 
hotkeys um you won't need them too much
in<00:02:09.489> this<00:02:09.610> one<00:02:09.819> clue<00:02:10.030> 21<00:02:10.390> base<00:02:10.599> bill<00:02:10.869> but<00:02:11.140> they

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
in this one clue 21 base bill but they

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.730 
in this one clue 21 base bill but they
will<00:02:12.580> help<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.970> injecting<00:02:13.480> later<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.620> can

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
will help the injecting later on you can

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.260 
will help the injecting later on you can
also<00:02:14.860> try<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.250> do<00:02:15.430> some<00:02:15.700> grown<00:02:15.940> start

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
also try to do some grown start

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.310 
also try to do some grown start
and<00:02:16.360> if<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.510> want<00:02:16.660> if<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.020> going<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
and if you want if this is going to be a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.690 
and if you want if this is going to be a
bit<00:02:17.500> too<00:02:17.650> easy<00:02:17.830> like<00:02:18.130> you've<00:02:18.310> been<00:02:18.340> practicing

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
bit too easy like you've been practicing

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.660 
bit too easy like you've been practicing
the<00:02:19.060> last<00:02:19.300> section<00:02:20.260> quite<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.710> bit<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.100> think

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
the last section quite a bit you think

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.010 
the last section quite a bit you think
of<00:02:21.760> one<00:02:21.910> based<00:02:22.120> bills<00:02:22.330> too<00:02:22.510> easy<00:02:22.660> do<00:02:22.840> some

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
of one based bills too easy do some

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.620 
of one based bills too easy do some
drone<00:02:23.260> stock<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.710> you<00:02:24.520> just<00:02:24.700> stuck<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.420> drone

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
drone stock in you just stuck the drone

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.180 
drone stock in you just stuck the drone
on<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.810> closest<00:02:26.260> mineral<00:02:26.530> pouch<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:26.980> get

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
on the closest mineral pouch and you get

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.620 
on the closest mineral pouch and you get
a<00:02:27.220> bit<00:02:27.400> more<00:02:27.580> mining<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.150> way<00:02:28.270> something

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
a bit more mining that way something

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.690 
a bit more mining that way something
it's<00:02:28.720> only<00:02:28.900> really<00:02:29.110> small<00:02:29.470> but<00:02:29.740> it's<00:02:30.490> what<00:02:30.670> all

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
it's only really small but it's what all

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.120 
it's only really small but it's what all
the<00:02:30.970> good<00:02:31.210> players<00:02:31.390> do<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:31.960> next<00:02:32.770> up<00:02:32.890> we've<00:02:33.100> got

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
the good players do so next up we've got

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.360 
the good players do so next up we've got
a<00:02:33.250> 15<00:02:33.610> spawning<00:02:33.940> pool<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:36.100> we're<00:02:36.190> going<00:02:36.280> to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
a 15 spawning pool so we're going to

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.160 
a 15 spawning pool so we're going to
throw<00:02:36.460> that<00:02:36.670> down<00:02:36.880> as<00:02:37.300> soon<00:02:37.420> as<00:02:37.510> we<00:02:37.570> get<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.750> 15

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
throw that down as soon as we get to 15

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.850 
throw that down as soon as we get to 15
supply<00:02:39.030> there<00:02:40.030> we<00:02:40.150> go<00:02:40.300> move<00:02:40.900> him<00:02:41.020> down<00:02:41.320> let's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
supply there we go move him down let's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.460 
supply there we go move him down let's
go<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.250> spawning<00:02:42.490> pool<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:44.050> then<00:02:44.230> we're<00:02:44.380> going

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
go is spawning pool and then we're going

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.490 
go is spawning pool and then we're going
to<00:02:44.530> get<00:02:44.710> hazed<00:02:44.920> 16<00:02:45.520> gasps<00:02:45.760> 15<00:02:46.630> overload<00:02:47.050> 15

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
to get hazed 16 gasps 15 overload 15

to get hazed 16 gasps 15 overload 15
Queen<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:48.820> zerglings<00:02:49.300> road<00:02:49.690> horn<00:02:51.120> what<00:02:52.120> did<00:02:52.240> I

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
Queen to zerglings road horn what did I

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.200 
Queen to zerglings road horn what did I
say<00:02:52.480> 16<00:02:53.020> gasps<00:02:53.230> you're<00:02:53.500> 16<00:02:53.890> gasps<00:02:56.100> come<00:02:57.100> on<00:02:57.370> it

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
say 16 gasps you're 16 gasps come on it

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.370 
say 16 gasps you're 16 gasps come on it
always<00:02:58.450> seems<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:58.780> slow<00:02:59.910> 16<00:03:00.910> gas<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:02.260> we're

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
always seems so slow 16 gas then we're

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.920 
always seems so slow 16 gas then we're
going<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.530> wait<00:03:02.800> for<00:03:02.830> this<00:03:03.660> we're<00:03:04.660> gonna<00:03:04.750> get<00:03:04.870> a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
going to wait for this we're gonna get a

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.450 
going to wait for this we're gonna get a
15<00:03:05.260> overload<00:03:05.590> first<00:03:05.830> we're<00:03:06.010> going<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.160> spread

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
15 overload first we're going to spread

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.170 
15 overload first we're going to spread
him<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:08.190> yeah<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.610> just<00:03:09.790> having<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.090> look

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
him and yeah this is just having a look

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.550 
him and yeah this is just having a look
at<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.390> bill<00:03:10.510> like<00:03:10.690> keep<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.050> nice<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.260> simple

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
at the bill like keep it nice and simple

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.890 
at the bill like keep it nice and simple
like<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:11.950> don't<00:03:12.130> want<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.370> waste<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.970> p.m.<00:03:13.450> so

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
like you don't want to waste a p.m. so

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.660 
like you don't want to waste a p.m. so
that's<00:03:14.380> why<00:03:14.530> I'm<00:03:14.650> not<00:03:14.830> spamming<00:03:15.220> right<00:03:15.520> now

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
that's why I'm not spamming right now

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.130 
that's why I'm not spamming right now
which<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.090> might<00:03:16.240> see<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> lot<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.660> pro<00:03:16.870> players

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
which you might see a lot of pro players

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.290 
which you might see a lot of pro players
do<00:03:17.380> we<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:18.100> not<00:03:18.310> really<00:03:18.640> good<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.970> get<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.210> the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
do we it's not really good to get in the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.730 
do we it's not really good to get in the
habit<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.780> like<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.080> don't<00:03:20.230> need<00:03:20.530> to

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
habit of that like you don't need to

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.590 
habit of that like you don't need to
spam<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.100> all<00:03:21.190> put<00:03:21.760> these<00:03:21.910> guys<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.420> gas

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
spam it all put these guys on the gas

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.300 
spam it all put these guys on the gas
then<00:03:23.410> we're<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.680> wait<00:03:23.770> for<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.010> Queen

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
then we're going to wait for the Queen

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.130 
then we're going to wait for the Queen
and<00:03:24.610> then<00:03:25.150> we<00:03:25.240> need<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.390> get<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.540> queen<00:03:25.840> to

zerglings a drone and a road warrior

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.940 
zerglings a drone and a road warrior
here<00:03:29.800> we<00:03:29.860> go<00:03:29.980> Queen<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:32.110> zerglings<00:03:32.590> put<00:03:32.830> them

here we go Queen to zerglings put them
in<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.130> control<00:03:33.490> group<00:03:33.520> and<00:03:34.320> then<00:03:35.320> we're

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
in the control group and then we're

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.260 
in the control group and then we're
going<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.830> get<00:03:35.980> one<00:03:36.160> more<00:03:36.190> drone<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:36.820> then

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
going to get one more drone and then

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.990 
going to get one more drone and then
we're<00:03:37.390> going<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.570> get<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.690> roach<00:03:37.900> warren<00:03:39.000> yep

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
we're going to get a roach warren yep

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.390 
we're going to get a roach warren yep
that's<00:03:40.570> what<00:03:40.810> we're<00:03:40.959> gonna<00:03:41.050> do<00:03:41.350> come<00:03:42.010> on<00:03:42.160> a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
that's what we're gonna do come on a

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.390 
that's what we're gonna do come on a
roach<00:03:42.790> horan<00:03:43.209> on<00:03:43.390> 20<00:03:43.810> supply<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.860> then<00:03:45.130> we<00:03:45.250> may

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
roach horan on 20 supply and then we may

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.240 
roach horan on 20 supply and then we may
yet<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.970> biloba<00:03:46.209> lot<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:47.380> then<00:03:48.100> we're<00:03:48.220> just

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
yet to biloba lot and then we're just

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.620 
yet to biloba lot and then we're just
going<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.520> spam<00:03:48.760> roaches<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.360> we're<00:03:49.480> just

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
going to spam roaches and we're just

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.020 
going to spam roaches and we're just
going<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.780> go<00:03:49.959> at<00:03:50.320> his<00:03:50.470> base<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.730> point<00:03:51.760> of

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
going to go at his base so the point of

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.090 
going to go at his base so the point of
this<00:03:52.090> is<00:03:52.450> we<00:03:52.600> don't<00:03:52.810> need<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.050> scout<00:03:53.350> we<00:03:53.950> can

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
this is we don't need to scout we can

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.550 
this is we don't need to scout we can
practice<00:03:54.250> very<00:03:54.730> basic<00:03:55.180> mechanics<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:55.930> again

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
practice very basic mechanics so again

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.740 
practice very basic mechanics so again
this<00:03:56.709> is<00:03:56.890> bronze<00:03:57.130> leak<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:57.730> obviously<00:03:58.570> it

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
this is bronze leak so obviously it

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.740 
this is bronze leak so obviously it
doesn't<00:03:58.900> need<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.170> be<00:03:59.320> very<00:03:59.560> complex<00:03:59.920> at<00:04:00.130> all

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
doesn't need to be very complex at all

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.360 
doesn't need to be very complex at all
we<00:04:01.750> just<00:04:01.930> need<00:04:02.110> to<00:04:02.350> build<00:04:02.590> roaches<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.220> kill

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
we just need to build roaches and kill

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.430 
we just need to build roaches and kill
them<00:04:03.550> which<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.300> really<00:04:04.480> good<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:04.990> we've<00:04:05.290> got

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
them which is really good so we've got

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.860 
them which is really good so we've got
the<00:04:05.590> wings<00:04:06.220> in<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.610> control<00:04:07.300> group<00:04:07.330> we've<00:04:07.750> got

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
the wings in the control group we've got

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.510 
the wings in the control group we've got
this<00:04:07.900> on<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.470> don't<00:04:08.560> want<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.800> miss<00:04:08.920> any<00:04:09.160> Inga

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
this on we don't want to miss any Inga

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.400 
this on we don't want to miss any Inga
injects<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:10.990> is<00:04:11.080> one<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.350> most

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
injects and that is one of the most

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.830 
injects and that is one of the most
important<00:04:12.010> things<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.580> then<00:04:13.450> we're<00:04:13.810> just

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
important things and then we're just

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.289 
important things and then we're just
going<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.140> rally<00:04:14.410> roaches<00:04:15.060> we're<00:04:16.060> just<00:04:16.120> going

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
going to rally roaches we're just going

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.490 
going to rally roaches we're just going
to<00:04:16.330> put<00:04:16.540> them<00:04:16.630> all<00:04:16.900> in<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.140> control<00:04:17.470> group

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
to put them all in the control group

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.400 
to put them all in the control group
remember<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.280> shift<00:04:18.580> egg<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.180> roaches<00:04:19.630> it's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
remember to shift egg the roaches it's

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.409 
remember to shift egg the roaches it's
extremely<00:04:21.010> important<00:04:21.609> it's<00:04:21.730> such<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.120> good

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
extremely important it's such a good

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.870 
extremely important it's such a good
mechanic<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:23.050> learn<00:04:23.230> and<00:04:23.500> get<00:04:24.070> as<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.280> habit<00:04:24.640> so

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
mechanic to learn and get as a habit so

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.520 
mechanic to learn and get as a habit so
here<00:04:25.060> we<00:04:25.150> go<00:04:25.270> again<00:04:25.360> roaches<00:04:25.900> shift<00:04:26.229> AG<00:04:26.380> in

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
here we go again roaches shift AG in

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.290 
here we go again roaches shift AG in
them<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:27.190> they're<00:04:27.400> straight<00:04:27.729> in<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:27.940> control

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
them so they're straight in the control

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.080 
them so they're straight in the control
group

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
group

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.090 
group
get<00:04:29.210> ready<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.510> inject<00:04:29.810> again<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.380> make<00:04:30.980> sure

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
get ready to inject again and make sure

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.650 
get ready to inject again and make sure
you<00:04:31.190> don't<00:04:31.340> get<00:04:31.460> supply<00:04:31.790> blocked<00:04:32.120> make<00:04:32.630> sure

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
you don't get supply blocked make sure

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.120 
you don't get supply blocked make sure
you<00:04:32.960> spread<00:04:33.169> all<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.440> applause<00:04:33.740> make<00:04:33.980> sure

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
you spread all the applause make sure

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.250 
you spread all the applause make sure
you<00:04:34.250> inject<00:04:34.669> and<00:04:34.940> that'll<00:04:35.570> all<00:04:35.720> be<00:04:35.750> good<00:04:36.020> so

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
you inject and that'll all be good so

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.340 
you inject and that'll all be good so
here<00:04:36.410> we<00:04:36.470> go<00:04:36.500> come<00:04:36.770> in<00:04:36.889> with<00:04:37.040> an<00:04:37.130> injects<00:04:38.350> and

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
here we go come in with an injects and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.070 
here we go come in with an injects and
then<00:04:39.800> build<00:04:40.040> in<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.220> roaches<00:04:40.699> and<00:04:41.030> put<00:04:41.960> them

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
then build in the roaches and put them

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.800 
then build in the roaches and put them
in<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.229> control<00:04:42.590> group<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:43.010> then<00:04:43.669> as<00:04:44.449> soon<00:04:44.630> as

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
in the control group and then as soon as

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.390 
in the control group and then as soon as
these<00:04:44.960> five<00:04:45.260> eggs<00:04:45.500> pop<00:04:45.770> we're<00:04:46.010> going<00:04:46.160> to<00:04:46.220> go<00:04:46.280> an

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
these five eggs pop we're going to go an

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.700 
these five eggs pop we're going to go an
attack<00:04:46.669> on<00:04:46.699> then<00:04:47.540> one<00:04:48.020> of<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.169> most<00:04:48.320> important

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
attack on then one of the most important

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.379 
attack on then one of the most important
things<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:48.979> look<00:04:49.190> at<00:04:49.340> here<00:04:49.520> as<00:04:49.669> well<00:04:49.850> is<00:04:50.150> the

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
things to look at here as well is the

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.930 
things to look at here as well is the
timing<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.220> let's<00:04:52.220> see<00:04:52.400> when<00:04:52.550> these<00:04:52.729> five

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
timing so let's see when these five

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.640 
timing so let's see when these five
roaches<00:04:53.150> pop<00:04:53.540> and<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:53.810> should<00:04:53.990> be<00:04:54.080> aiming<00:04:54.260> to

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
roaches pop and you should be aiming to

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.530 
roaches pop and you should be aiming to
hit<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.949> same<00:04:55.160> timing<00:04:55.639> as<00:04:55.760> well<00:04:55.940> here<00:04:56.330> we<00:04:56.419> go

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
hit the same timing as well here we go

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.939 
hit the same timing as well here we go
fire<00:04:56.810> roaches<00:04:57.169> are<00:04:57.260> going<00:04:57.380> to<00:04:57.440> pop<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:57.919> the

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
fire roaches are going to pop and the

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.390 
fire roaches are going to pop and the
timing<00:04:58.910> is<00:04:59.000> about<00:04:59.210> 5<00:04:59.570> 10<00:04:59.900> on<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.110> clock<00:05:00.410> so<00:05:01.040> now

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
timing is about 5 10 on the clock so now

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.590 
timing is about 5 10 on the clock so now
we're<00:05:01.550> going<00:05:01.639> to<00:05:01.700> move<00:05:01.760> across<00:05:01.970> them<00:05:02.270> up<00:05:02.389> we're

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
we're going to move across them up we're

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.790 
we're going to move across them up we're
going<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:02.780> keep<00:05:02.930> building<00:05:03.139> roaches<00:05:03.650> we're

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
going to keep building roaches we're

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.860 
going to keep building roaches we're
going<00:05:03.919> to<00:05:03.979> shift<00:05:04.220> egged<00:05:05.060> them<00:05:05.300> into<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.660> group

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
going to shift egged them into the group

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.780 
going to shift egged them into the group
and<00:05:06.080> we're<00:05:06.260> on<00:05:06.350> 37<00:05:07.040> supply<00:05:07.310> now<00:05:07.490> so<00:05:07.610> I'm<00:05:07.669> going

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
and we're on 37 supply now so I'm going

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.310 
and we're on 37 supply now so I'm going
to<00:05:07.820> go<00:05:07.970> ahead<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.210> get<00:05:08.600> another<00:05:08.870> Overlord

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
to go ahead and get another Overlord

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.890 
to go ahead and get another Overlord
after<00:05:09.590> this<00:05:09.710> inject<00:05:10.180> there<00:05:11.180> we<00:05:11.270> go<00:05:11.419> and<00:05:11.690> I'm

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
after this inject there we go and I'm

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.450 
after this inject there we go and I'm
going<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.110> spread<00:05:12.860> him<00:05:13.010> somewhere<00:05:13.340> let's

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
going to spread him somewhere let's

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.450 
going to spread him somewhere let's
stick<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:13.820> donia<00:05:14.180> build<00:05:14.900> some<00:05:15.080> more<00:05:15.229> roaches

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
stick and donia build some more roaches

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.680 
stick and donia build some more roaches
shift<00:05:16.460> egg<00:05:16.639> them<00:05:16.850> into<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.180> group<00:05:17.389> keep

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
shift egg them into the group keep

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.680 
shift egg them into the group keep
building<00:05:17.960> them<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.639> just<00:05:19.639> no<00:05:19.820> shift<00:05:20.270> egg<00:05:20.450> and

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
building them and just no shift egg and

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.600 
building them and just no shift egg and
build<00:05:21.139> roaches<00:05:21.590> just<00:05:21.800> as<00:05:21.950> fast<00:05:22.220> as<00:05:22.340> you<00:05:22.430> can

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
build roaches just as fast as you can

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.279 
build roaches just as fast as you can
like<00:05:22.820> this<00:05:23.360> is<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.630> whole<00:05:23.750> point<00:05:23.960> like<00:05:24.139> we're

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
like this is the whole point like we're

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.580 
like this is the whole point like we're
getting<00:05:24.560> good<00:05:24.740> mechanics<00:05:25.220> from<00:05:25.340> this<00:05:26.590> and

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
getting good mechanics from this and

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.810 
getting good mechanics from this and
yeah<00:05:27.740> that's<00:05:27.860> pretty<00:05:28.010> much<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.310> build<00:05:28.580> now<00:05:28.760> we

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
yeah that's pretty much the build now we

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.990 
yeah that's pretty much the build now we
just<00:05:29.120> go<00:05:29.240> kill<00:05:29.449> them<00:05:29.630> make<00:05:30.020> sure<00:05:30.050> to<00:05:30.229> a<00:05:30.440> move

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
just go kill them make sure to a move

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.159 
just go kill them make sure to a move
and<00:05:32.000> we're<00:05:32.180> going<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.330> need<00:05:32.419> another<00:05:32.570> Overlord

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
and we're going to need another Overlord

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:39.940 
and we're going to need another Overlord
as<00:05:33.289> well<00:05:34.360> overlord<00:05:36.430> yes<00:05:38.229> so<00:05:39.229> there<00:05:39.500> we<00:05:39.590> go<00:05:39.620> and

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
as well overlord yes so there we go and

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.969 
as well overlord yes so there we go and
now<00:05:40.669> we<00:05:41.060> just<00:05:41.210> make<00:05:41.479> sure<00:05:41.660> a<00:05:41.840> move<00:05:42.139> make<00:05:42.740> sure

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
now we just make sure a move make sure

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.650 
now we just make sure a move make sure
to<00:05:43.190> keep<00:05:43.340> adding<00:05:43.760> roaches<00:05:44.120> into<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.450> group

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
to keep adding roaches into the group

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.659 
to keep adding roaches into the group
make<00:05:44.870> sure<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.320> don't<00:05:45.470> miss<00:05:45.740> injects<00:05:46.250> like<00:05:46.520> I

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
make sure you don't miss injects like I

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.730 
make sure you don't miss injects like I
just<00:05:46.729> did<00:05:46.970> actually<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:47.780> didn't<00:05:48.050> but<00:05:50.620> keep<00:05:51.620> on

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
just did actually I didn't but keep on

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.260 
just did actually I didn't but keep on
it<00:05:51.889> into<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.220> group<00:05:52.370> and<00:05:52.580> there<00:05:52.760> you<00:05:52.820> go<00:05:52.849> naive

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
it into the group and there you go naive

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.390 
it into the group and there you go naive
won<00:05:53.450> the<00:05:53.570> game<00:05:53.750> no<00:05:54.349> bronzy<00:05:54.830> will<00:05:55.039> be<00:05:55.190> able<00:05:55.250> to

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
won the game no bronzy will be able to

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.180 
won the game no bronzy will be able to
hold<00:05:55.550> this<00:05:55.760> bill<00:05:56.349> well<00:05:57.349> they<00:05:57.620> might<00:05:57.800> do<00:05:57.950> like

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
hold this bill well they might do like

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.070 
hold this bill well they might do like
some<00:05:58.700> bronzes<00:05:59.120> will<00:05:59.270> do<00:05:59.389> some<00:05:59.630> weird<00:05:59.810> stuff

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
some bronzes will do some weird stuff

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.320 
some bronzes will do some weird stuff
where<00:06:00.380> they<00:06:00.530> go<00:06:00.680> like<00:06:00.889> just<00:06:01.460> mask<00:06:01.760> on<00:06:02.060> and<00:06:02.090> on

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
where they go like just mask on and on

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.850 
where they go like just mask on and on
one<00:06:02.510> base<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:03.139> you<00:06:03.289> won't<00:06:03.470> be<00:06:03.500> able<00:06:03.560> to<00:06:03.710> kill

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
one base and you won't be able to kill

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.710 
one base and you won't be able to kill
them<00:06:04.039> but<00:06:04.160> like<00:06:04.610> I<00:06:04.639> said<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:05.120> goal<00:06:05.300> isn't<00:06:05.510> to

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
them but like I said the goal isn't to

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.150 
them but like I said the goal isn't to
get<00:06:06.020> one<00:06:06.260> hundred<00:06:06.500> percent<00:06:06.530> win<00:06:06.860> rate<00:06:07.039> with

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
get one hundred percent win rate with

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.070 
get one hundred percent win rate with
this<00:06:07.280> build<00:06:07.520> but<00:06:07.789> it<00:06:07.910> will<00:06:08.120> give<00:06:08.360> you<00:06:08.539> a<00:06:08.570> win

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
this build but it will give you a win

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.790 
this build but it will give you a win
rate<00:06:09.289> that<00:06:09.950> will<00:06:10.130> allow<00:06:10.400> you<00:06:10.460> to<00:06:10.700> win<00:06:11.450> so<00:06:11.870> will

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
rate that will allow you to win so will

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.670 
rate that will allow you to win so will
allow<00:06:13.010> you<00:06:13.070> to<00:06:13.190> get<00:06:13.460> promoted<00:06:14.320> so<00:06:15.320> yeah<00:06:15.470> that's

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
allow you to get promoted so yeah that's

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.200 
allow you to get promoted so yeah that's
the<00:06:15.830> building<00:06:16.160> now<00:06:16.700> I'm<00:06:16.789> going<00:06:16.940> to<00:06:17.000> go<00:06:17.090> and

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
the building now I'm going to go and

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.940 
the building now I'm going to go and
show<00:06:17.389> you<00:06:17.479> an<00:06:17.570> example<00:06:17.690> game<00:06:18.169> so<00:06:18.380> have<00:06:18.800> a<00:06:18.860> look

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
show you an example game so have a look

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.650 
show you an example game so have a look
at<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:19.130> example<00:06:19.550> example<00:06:19.760> game<00:06:20.270> if<00:06:20.419> you<00:06:20.510> want

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
at the example example game if you want

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.290 
at the example example game if you want
i<00:06:20.840> recommend<00:06:21.349> practice<00:06:21.889> in<00:06:22.070> this<00:06:22.300> until

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
i recommend practice in this until

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.029 
i recommend practice in this until
you've<00:06:23.450> got<00:06:23.570> the<00:06:23.660> time<00:06:23.840> is<00:06:24.020> down<00:06:24.169> so<00:06:24.410> those

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
you've got the time is down so those

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.000 
you've got the time is down so those
roaches<00:06:25.310> popped<00:06:25.820> at<00:06:26.030> five<00:06:26.300> ten<00:06:26.710> you<00:06:27.710> want<00:06:27.889> to

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
roaches popped at five ten you want to

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.920 
roaches popped at five ten you want to
try<00:06:28.370> and<00:06:28.520> get<00:06:28.639> them<00:06:28.789> pop<00:06:29.000> in<00:06:29.150> at<00:06:29.240> 5<00:06:29.419> 10<00:06:29.660> as<00:06:29.810> well

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
try and get them pop in at 5 10 as well
