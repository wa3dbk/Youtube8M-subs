00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:06.986
Why is Internet the kingdom of cats ?

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:12.141
At a given moment, I start with that hypothesis but I think we all agree with the fact that Internet is the kingdom of cats.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.120
It's so much the kingdom of cats that if I would, I could, during all my videos,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.440
insert in some corner of the screen some videos of cats without repeating the same video twice

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.640
Except this one. I like this one.

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.148
It's funny.

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:30.322
So don't worry, this episode will be treated like the others, scientifically

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:34.958
Just understand where it come from. It comes from a feelings of frustration and jealousy

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:41.324
We are a certain number who make videos on the Internet, try to learn the meaning, knowledge, depth,

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:43.386
and we come across that !

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:46.105
No, not on that, on THIS !

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.445
So when we see that, we think there must be an explanation.

00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:50.590
And obviously, there is one.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.326
What do you know about toxoplasmosis ?

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.643
Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection, and who says parasitic, says parasite.

00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:02.784
The parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis is a protozoan called toxoplasma gondii.

00:01:02.977 --> 00:01:08.709
The principle of a parasite is that it's an organism which, in order to survive, needs another organism in which it's going to live.

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:10.733
This organism is called a host.

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.797
In the case of toxoplasma gondii, the host can be just about any warm-blooded animal. Exactly this is homeotherm.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:22.057
But warm-blooded, it works. So dogs, cats, rabbits, lice,

00:01:22.177 --> 00:01:24.829
what we wan't, including human.

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:29.333
Now, what we need to know is that toxoplasma gondii can live in our cells.

00:01:29.562 --> 00:01:30.916
but it can't breed in it.

00:01:32.438 --> 00:01:37.528
Tosgo plasma ... can only breed in a particular type of host of the felidae family.

00:01:37.648 --> 00:01:41.880
also known as felines, also known as cats, cats, cats,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.894
cats, cats, caaaats, cats. *meow*

00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:52.120
This is what makes us, poor humans, so-called intermediate hosts, while felines are said to be definitive hosts.

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:57.639
It is only in these felines that this parasite will be able to breed.

00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:02.013
And a parasite must breed, because it is not eternal, it dies.

00:02:02.268 --> 00:02:06.192
Until then you will say to me: "What is the relationship with the Internet? " I'm coming. And very precisely I am almost there.

00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:10.273
Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that has a number of peculiarities.

00:02:10.393 --> 00:02:17.239
First, the infection for which it is responsible - toxoplasmosis - is an infection which in the majority of cases has no symptoms.

00:02:17.764 --> 00:02:24.037
It is absolutely benign, causes no damage, no trouble, nothing at all. In most of the cases.

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.494
This parasite will therefore be housed in the heart of our cells, where it is safe from our immune systems.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:32.154
Where it can live perfectly, but he can't breed.

00:02:32.274 --> 00:02:35.349
He will notably stay in a region of the brain called the amygdala.

00:02:35.587 --> 00:02:40.134
who is, but not only, the middle of fear, smells

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:46.744
And also responsible for the release of this neurotransmitter - or neurohormone - called dopamine,

00:02:46.864 --> 00:02:48.789
that we also call the hormon of pleasure.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:53.513
What is not great as a name, because it's not really the hormone of pleasure, it should be the hormone of desire.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.875
From there it will do a number of things that we do not yet quite understand that we can just observe

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:04.519
In particular, it can be observed that the rats infected with toxoplasma gondii no longer feel fear by smelling urine of the cats,

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:11.783
Because rats are afraid of cats, it is a millennial natural defense, because a healthy rat knows that if he meets a cat, he will be eaten.

00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:18.424
The rats are no longer afraid when they feel the urine of a cat. On the contrary, they feel ... a sexual excitation.

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:20.771
I know, it is disgusting.

00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:27.958
Wich means that a rat infested with this parasite (toxoplasma gondii) will go in front of the cat.

00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:31.113
It will, so to speak, throw itself into the cat's den

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.095
What we notice is that this alteration of behavior is not only reserved for rats

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.054
No

00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:48.378
This alteration of behavior is provocated on any organism infected by this parasite - toxoplasma gondii

00:03:48.498 --> 00:03:57.223
In particular, infected humans will feel the desire to be in contact with cats, to observe cats,

00:03:57.343 --> 00:04:00.408
to own a cat, to caress a cat

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.357
And all this is scientific !

00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:09.292
You are manipulated by a parasite, know it !

00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:18.539
This parasite infection affects twenty to fifty percent of the world's human population

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:22.387
And I regret it, but it makes sense that it makes views on YouTube

00:04:22.507 --> 00:04:23.698
Even if it's really unfair !

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.060
So next time it takes you the urge to share a video of a little cat looking in a mirror

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.600
or who is trying to catch his own tail, tell yourself that maybe it is not you who want to share this

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.080
but... that parasite, the toxoplasma gondii.

00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:40.423
Thank you all for being more and more wanting to think about it ! (=e-penser)

00:04:40.543 --> 00:04:43.359
The three logos you see here, it's not for making an advertisement and it's not for making pretty,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.280
These are just links to YouTube, Facebook and Twitter on which you can react, comment, ask questions, do whatever you want.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.640
Meanwhile, of course, stay curious and take time to think it ! (=e-penser)
