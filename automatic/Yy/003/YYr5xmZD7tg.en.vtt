of<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.630> toenails<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:45.650> also<00:02:46.040> takes<00:02:46.790> care<00:02:47.180> of

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
of the toenails it also takes care of

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.780 
of the toenails it also takes care of
any<00:02:47.599> peeling<00:02:47.989> of<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.860> beak<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.280> may<00:02:49.579> have

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
any peeling of the beak that may have

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.630 
any peeling of the beak that may have
the<00:02:50.000> beak<00:02:50.480> again<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.989> like<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.170> nail<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.860> appeals

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
the beak again is like a nail it appeals

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.120 
the beak again is like a nail it appeals
especially<00:02:53.630> when<00:02:53.780> they<00:02:53.840> go<00:02:53.989> through<00:02:54.200> malts<00:02:54.590> so

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
especially when they go through malts so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.800 
especially when they go through malts so
that's<00:02:55.459> why<00:02:55.700> we<00:02:55.910> go<00:02:56.060> ahead<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.329> we<00:02:56.480> file<00:02:56.780> it

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
that's why we go ahead and we file it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.509 
that's why we go ahead and we file it
down<00:02:57.200> just<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.590> get<00:02:57.709> rid<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.069> rough<00:02:58.250> fits

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
down just to get rid of the rough fits

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.360 
down just to get rid of the rough fits
we<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:58.910> not<00:02:59.090> take<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.599> points<00:03:00.019> off<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:01.130> beaks

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
we do not take the points off the beaks

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.559 
we do not take the points off the beaks
they<00:03:02.180> need<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.840> points<00:03:03.079> on<00:03:03.410> their<00:03:03.590> bigs<00:03:03.829> for

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
they need the points on their bigs for

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.699 
they need the points on their bigs for
breaking<00:03:05.569> open<00:03:05.690> nuts<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.470> hard<00:03:07.370> substances

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.520 

and<00:03:12.709> now<00:03:12.920> he's<00:03:13.370> finished<00:03:13.989> he's<00:03:14.989> all<00:03:15.230> groomed

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
and now he's finished he's all groomed

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.020 
and now he's finished he's all groomed
and<00:03:15.799> ready<00:03:15.859> to<00:03:16.130> go<00:03:16.310> we<00:03:16.340> do<00:03:16.639> this<00:03:16.819> procedure

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
and ready to go we do this procedure

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.210 
and ready to go we do this procedure
because<00:03:17.359> we<00:03:18.139> obviously<00:03:18.350> don't<00:03:18.769> want<00:03:18.889> the<00:03:19.040> bird

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
because we obviously don't want the bird

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.539 
because we obviously don't want the bird
to<00:03:19.370> fly<00:03:19.400> away<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.209> also<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.380> bird<00:03:21.590> maintains

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
to fly away and also the bird maintains

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.590 
to fly away and also the bird maintains
some<00:03:23.420> form<00:03:23.780> of<00:03:23.870> tameness<00:03:25.269> knowing<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.359> fact

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
some form of tameness knowing the fact

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.809 
some form of tameness knowing the fact
that<00:03:26.690> he<00:03:26.780> cannot<00:03:27.170> fly<00:03:27.500> away<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:28.220> if<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.609> have

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
that he cannot fly away so if you have

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.259 
that he cannot fly away so if you have
an<00:03:29.030> unruly<00:03:29.840> parrot<00:03:30.680> at<00:03:30.799> home<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.370> he<00:03:32.000> hasn't

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
an unruly parrot at home and he hasn't

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.910 
an unruly parrot at home and he hasn't
been<00:03:32.359> clipped<00:03:32.630> for<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.870> long<00:03:33.049> time<00:03:33.350> our

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
been clipped for a long time our

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.979 
been clipped for a long time our
suggestion<00:03:34.549> is<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.030> cook<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.420> wings<00:03:35.569> and

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
suggestion is is to cook the wings and

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.470 
suggestion is is to cook the wings and
that<00:03:36.560> helps<00:03:36.950> with<00:03:37.160> taming<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.670> bird<00:03:37.880> down<00:03:38.180> so

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
that helps with taming the bird down so

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.420 
that helps with taming the bird down so
you<00:03:38.540> can<00:03:38.780> go<00:03:38.930> ahead<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:39.530> play<00:03:39.920> with<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.190> bird

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
you can go ahead and play with the bird

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
you can go ahead and play with the bird
and<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.750> bird<00:03:41.989> will<00:03:42.829> again<00:03:43.819> be<00:03:44.030> friendly<00:03:44.420> to

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
and the bird will again be friendly to

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.430 
and the bird will again be friendly to
you<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.819> it<00:03:46.819> makes<00:03:47.030> for<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.329> nicer<00:03:47.660> bird<00:03:47.900> also

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
you and it makes for a nicer bird also

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.930 
you and it makes for a nicer bird also
it<00:03:48.620> makes<00:03:48.799> for<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.160> fact<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.670> doesn't

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
it makes for the fact that it doesn't

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.550 
it makes for the fact that it doesn't
fly<00:03:50.120> away<00:03:50.389> and<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:50.690> lose<00:03:50.870> your<00:03:51.019> bird<00:03:51.139> outside

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
fly away and you lose your bird outside

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.870 
fly away and you lose your bird outside
if<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.859> door<00:03:52.069> should<00:03:52.220> be<00:03:52.280> open<00:03:52.370> very

and unfortunately they don't know how to

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.309 
and unfortunately they don't know how to
come<00:04:10.970> down<00:04:11.209> because<00:04:11.389> they've<00:04:11.630> never<00:04:11.810> flown

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
come down because they've never flown

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.899 
come down because they've never flown
that<00:04:12.349> high<00:04:12.650> before<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:14.980> most<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.190> time<00:04:16.519> I

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:16.909 
that high before so most of the time I

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.430 
that high before so most of the time I
would<00:04:16.940> say<00:04:17.209> probably<00:04:17.390> eighty<00:04:17.900> percent<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.349> the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
would say probably eighty percent of the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.860 
would say probably eighty percent of the
time

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
time

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.840 
time
a<00:04:18.900> bird<00:04:19.229> is<00:04:19.440> loose<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:20.130> will<00:04:20.310> never<00:04:20.459> see<00:04:20.699> this

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
a bird is loose you will never see this

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.240 
a bird is loose you will never see this
bird<00:04:21.090> again<00:04:21.359> eventually<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.530> may<00:04:22.710> land<00:04:23.010> on

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
bird again eventually it may land on

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.159 
bird again eventually it may land on
somebody<00:04:23.760> maybe<00:04:24.180> two<00:04:24.479> or<00:04:24.510> three<00:04:24.570> days<00:04:24.900> later

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
somebody maybe two or three days later

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.260 
somebody maybe two or three days later
because<00:04:25.560> remember<00:04:25.919> we<00:04:26.280> there<00:04:26.550> are<00:04:26.669> hand<00:04:26.940> fed

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
because remember we there are hand fed

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.990 
because remember we there are hand fed
by<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.229> as<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.770> human<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:29.699> they<00:04:29.850> do<00:04:29.910> not

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
by you as a human and so they do not

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.420 
by you as a human and so they do not
know<00:04:30.300> how<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.449> forge<00:04:30.840> for<00:04:31.139> their<00:04:31.260> food<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:32.220> they

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
know how to forge for their food so they

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.060 
know how to forge for their food so they
will<00:04:32.669> sometimes<00:04:33.330> find<00:04:33.690> families<00:04:34.350> or<00:04:34.650> land<00:04:34.889> on

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
will sometimes find families or land on
