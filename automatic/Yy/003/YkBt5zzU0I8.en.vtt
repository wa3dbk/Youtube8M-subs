 our cake is almost ready and for now 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.530
 we make glaze for it for this we 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.310
 melt 50 grams candle in a separate 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.700

 what we separately hear as ohhh sugar 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.510
 if we matched cocoa 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.680
 directly in the pan, we could 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.680
 would rely lumps 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.030
 pre-mix sugar not 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.890
 will be after the oil is full 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.269

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:03.260
 now neatly pour our here 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.260
 how funny and sugar is mixed 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.590
 Now we need to completely sugar 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.870
 dissolved 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.959
 so that our trump is obtained folk 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:25.110
 eye recipes are very easy to remember by 4 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.110
 tablespoons take milk sugar and 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.710
 50 grams of oil you need to climb 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:37.510
 bring to a boil but do not let 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:44.860
 now we bring to the boil we take everything 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:47.050
 our eyes are ready to turn off and well here 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.450
 we have already baked everything now we reach ours 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.280
 multicooker cake 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.590
 beautiful ruddy cake we have turned 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.590
 now pour glaze 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.370
 Here is our cake, in principle, ready to put 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.910
 his briefly in the fridge to 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.290
 frosting froze 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.810
 the cake stood in the fridge completely 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.460
 a bit because there is no patience 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.460
 he wants to try the case 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:42.780
 that's how it looks inside is so lush 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:47.220
 biscuit cherries here you can see with chocolate 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.220
 very very appetizing 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.350
 yummy 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.740
 In my opinion, excess chocolate is one of 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:01.680
 such classic combinations are obtained 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.910
 very tasty done as they saw at all 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:10.010
