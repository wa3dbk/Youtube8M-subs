00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.400
 again today we are going to make a curry 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.020
 strawberry to give the ingredients the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.220
 ingredients for strawberry curry 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.790
 We are going to need half a kilo of strawberries 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.160
 these had them frozen then this 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.439
 I took them out and since I did not know what to do 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.960
 with them then well let's do 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.880
 a culin and they are cool and the cool and 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.239
 it's being a cold sauce that 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.640
 We normally use for desserts to 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.800
 snow to make the base of the snow 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.500
 of the shovel all that then 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.500
 we need half a kilo of strawberry 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.860
 in a cup of sugar 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.740
 and a cup of water or liquor of 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.280
 strawberry then this time I have 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.309
 here a little water that I left over from the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.500
 strawberries that thaw two parts the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.360
 next step right now so you can see 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.160
 as the procedure for our curl 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.680
 and what are we going to do we are going to put 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.680
 our strawberries in a pan 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.979
 from cooking to boiling more than anything and you 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.979
 let's incorporate our sugar 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.610
 I would say about sugar 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.940
 and we 're going to boil it because 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.000
 then we are going to incorporate the sugar 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.710
 that dissolves and we are going to add the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.480
 water that had equipment strawberry liqueur 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.990
 at the same time 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.650
 We'll let boil for 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.650
 approximately 20 minutes 25 minutes 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.470
 and since I'm laughing we're going to lower it 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.900
 the fire simmering so that it does not 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.270
 we do the rebatinga of burning 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.830
 and this one right now so you can see how it's going to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.110
 be this point already when you see that 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.770
 is boiling our strawberries with the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.890
 juli we are going to lower the temperature 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.840
 then we are going to reduce it and we are going to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.330
 let it cook for approximately 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.120
 about 15 minutes already when it's ready 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.560
 to show you how it is then like this 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.349
 is how you want the jam to be 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.590
 then from here we are going to liquefy it for 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.569
 that is a culín then is the same 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.730
 procedure to make a jam and 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.940
 to replace the culin besides the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.150
 liquefied crop good then what 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.600
 let's make it we're going to liquefy and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.620
 then we're going to 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.760
 calculate 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.870
 and then you can use it for a 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.760
 decoration sauce or to make a snow 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.730
 of strawberry 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.200
 this in the next chapter I'm going to do 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.230
 a strawberry ring so you're 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.310
 pending then what are we going to do 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.239
 we are going to strain it 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.239
 with a spatula 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.060
 you will not go through with the colander 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.160
 okay 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.900
 and that's how we get our curry from 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.100
 strawberry this is the culín then as you 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.430
 I can already use it for 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.500
 snow lining you can use 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.970
 to make snow exclusively is what 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.480
 what are we going to do with the next one 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.160
 chapter a strawberry snow then 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.260
 so that you are aware so that 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.060
 see how we are going to make the snow of 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.060
 strawberries let's go to the next
