undeveloped silver resources in the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.360 
undeveloped silver resources in the
world<00:01:17.530> we<00:01:18.530> still<00:01:18.770> think<00:01:18.800> there's<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.190> lot<00:01:19.340> of

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
world we still think there's a lot of

world we still think there's a lot of
room<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.640> grow<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:20.090> we've<00:01:20.659> moved<00:01:20.900> the

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
room to grow that we've moved the

assessment stage into a pre-feasibility
stage<00:01:24.830> which<00:01:24.979> is<00:01:25.100> what<00:01:25.250> we're<00:01:25.400> working<00:01:25.550> on<00:01:25.760> now

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
stage which is what we're working on now

stage which is what we're working on now
on<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:26.990> project<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:27.620> that<00:01:27.650> remains<00:01:28.070> our<00:01:28.610> our

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
on that project so that remains our our

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.210 
on that project so that remains our our
leading<00:01:29.240> project<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:30.740> big<00:01:30.890> one<00:01:31.040> we<00:01:31.190> think

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
leading project and a big one we think

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.250 
leading project and a big one we think
there's<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.549> lot<00:01:31.760> of<00:01:31.820> potential<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.900> update

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
there's a lot of potential the update

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.450 
there's a lot of potential the update
that<00:01:33.380> we<00:01:33.440> put<00:01:33.620> out<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.920> engineering<00:01:34.250> on

there that Bolivia is no problem well I
mean<00:03:44.480> it's<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.930> developing<00:03:45.470> economy<00:03:45.739> yeah<00:03:46.580> it's

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
mean it's a developing economy yeah it's

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.180 
mean it's a developing economy yeah it's
it's<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.330> any<00:03:47.750> time<00:03:48.050> any<00:03:48.410> mining<00:03:48.709> this<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.040> very

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
it's so any time any mining this is very

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.830 
it's so any time any mining this is very
common<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.640> we're<00:03:49.790> working<00:03:49.910> in<00:03:50.209> fairly

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
common that we're working in fairly

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.560 
common that we're working in fairly
challenging<00:03:51.080> locations<00:03:52.180> but<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:53.390> is<00:03:53.540> a

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
challenging locations but this is a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.420 
challenging locations but this is a
place<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.560> second<00:03:54.920> largest<00:03:55.040> sector

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
place that the second largest sector

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.670 
place that the second largest sector
after<00:03:55.730> oil<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.000> gas<00:03:56.150> is<00:03:56.360> mining<00:03:56.690> you've<00:03:57.500> had

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
after oil and gas is mining you've had

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.650 
after oil and gas is mining you've had
three<00:03:58.100> major<00:03:58.459> new<00:03:58.760> mines<00:03:59.000> built<00:03:59.300> down<00:03:59.480> there

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
three major new mines built down there

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.080 
three major new mines built down there
by<00:03:59.780> large<00:04:00.140> companies<00:04:00.440> in<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.190> last<00:04:01.430> four

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
largest silver producing mine in the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.270 
largest silver producing mine in the
world<00:04:05.570> is<00:04:05.810> there<00:04:05.989> with<00:04:06.350> soma<00:04:06.650> tomo<00:04:06.860> right

we've got Coeur d'Alene second largest
asset<00:04:09.290> right<00:04:09.860> people<00:04:10.190> think<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.370> them<00:04:10.459> as

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
biggest glass of litter sure and you've

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.490 
biggest glass of litter sure and you've
got<00:04:13.670> pan<00:04:13.880> american<00:04:14.270> silver<00:04:14.570> a<00:04:14.600> name<00:04:14.870> brand<00:04:15.110> and

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
got pan american silver a name brand and

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.380 
got pan american silver a name brand and
silver<00:04:15.890> is<00:04:15.920> also<00:04:16.400> operating<00:04:16.820> down<00:04:16.970> there<00:04:17.150> so

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
silver is also operating down there so

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.300 
silver is also operating down there so
this<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:18.020> a<00:04:18.049> this<00:04:18.290> is<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.500> place<00:04:18.770> where<00:04:18.799> mines

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
this is a this is a place where mines

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.710 
this is a this is a place where mines
are<00:04:19.520> being<00:04:19.669> built<00:04:19.940> there's<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.270> long<00:04:20.480> history

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
are being built there's a long history

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.420 
are being built there's a long history
of<00:04:21.020> mining<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.620> we<00:04:22.070> think<00:04:22.160> there's<00:04:22.370> a

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
of mining and we think there's a

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.970 
of mining and we think there's a
tremendous<00:04:22.640> opportunity<00:04:23.440> in<00:04:24.440> terms<00:04:24.500> of

active as you are Greg down and Chile
you<00:04:35.720> know<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:35.990> just<00:04:36.110> that's<00:04:36.380> just<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.680> icing

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
you know that just that's just the icing

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.660 
you know that just that's just the icing
on<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.220> cake<00:04:37.400> and

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
on the cake and

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.160 
on the cake and
my<00:04:37.730> opinion<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.480> me<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.720> gives<00:04:38.870> us<00:04:38.990> two

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
my opinion to me it gives us two

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.570 
my opinion to me it gives us two
projects<00:04:39.680> that<00:04:39.770> are<00:04:39.860> solid<00:04:40.220> project

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
projects that are solid project

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.640 
projects that are solid project
advancing<00:04:41.150> you<00:04:41.360> know<00:04:41.450> this<00:04:41.630> is<00:04:41.750> really<00:04:41.900> adding

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
advancing you know this is really adding

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.020 
advancing you know this is really adding
value<00:04:42.800> as<00:04:43.070> we<00:04:43.190> advance<00:04:43.460> this<00:04:43.610> project<00:04:43.970> from

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
value as we advance this project from

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.610 
value as we advance this project from
resource<00:04:44.480> stage<00:04:44.750> through<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.200> engineering

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
resource stage through the engineering

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.100 
resource stage through the engineering
phase<00:04:45.800> right<00:04:46.390> construction<00:04:47.390> decisions<00:04:47.810> and

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
phase right construction decisions and

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.660 
phase right construction decisions and
with<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.440> second<00:04:48.830> asset<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.310> me<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:49.550> really

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
with the second asset to me it really

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.280 
with the second asset to me it really
underpins<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.300> value<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.750> first<00:04:50.960> one<00:04:51.140> and

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
underpins the value of the first one and

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.320 
underpins the value of the first one and
