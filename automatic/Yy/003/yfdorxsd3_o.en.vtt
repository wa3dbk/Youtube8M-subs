you have a mac download those pictures
into<00:01:30.360> iphoto<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.229> take<00:01:31.439> them<00:01:31.590> from

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
into iphoto and then take them from

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.980 
into iphoto and then take them from
iPhoto<00:01:32.250> into<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> gallery<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.540> find<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
iPhoto into the gallery I find that the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
iPhoto into the gallery I find that the
integration<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.650> particularly<00:01:35.159> good<00:01:35.340> with

integration is particularly good with

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.730 
integration is particularly good with
iPhoto<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.960> when<00:01:37.079> you're<00:01:37.200> adding<00:01:37.380> an

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
you will it does struggle a little bit i

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.249

of<00:01:43.290> my<00:01:43.439> pictures<00:01:43.829> synced<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.000> 1200

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
of my pictures synced up out of the 1200

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.569 
of my pictures synced up out of the 1200
that<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.500> particular<00:01:46.740> folder<00:01:47.310> so

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
that I have in this particular folder so

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.219 
that I have in this particular folder so
it<00:01:47.670> synced<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> first<00:01:48.299> 10<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:48.659> 12<00:01:48.899> but

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it synced up the first 10 or 12 but

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.899 
it synced up the first 10 or 12 but
wouldn't<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> rest<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.369> imagine<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
wouldn't do the rest but I imagine if I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
wouldn't do the rest but I imagine if I
bring<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.210> into<00:01:51.299> high<00:01:51.479> photo<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.439> would<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
bring it into high photo it would do it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.230 
bring it into high photo it would do it
now<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> didn't<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.670> chance<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
now I didn't have chance to do that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
now I didn't have chance to do that
before<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:55.049> shot<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.470> video<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.250> keep<00:01:56.700> that
