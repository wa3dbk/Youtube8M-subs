00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.450 

so<00:01:21.049> when<00:01:21.320> we<00:01:21.409> get<00:01:21.560> people<00:01:21.710> out<00:01:21.920> on<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.130> water<00:01:22.310> i

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
so when we get people out on the water i

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.160 
so when we get people out on the water i
think<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.119> best<00:01:23.360> part<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.719> these<00:01:23.840> trips

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
think the the best part of these trips

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.100 
think the the best part of these trips
is<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:24.860> first<00:01:25.130> five<00:01:25.460> minutes<00:01:25.729> as<00:01:26.719> soon<00:01:26.840> as

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
is is that first five minutes as soon as

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.249 
is is that first five minutes as soon as
you<00:01:27.320> leave<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.520> landing<00:01:29.179> and<00:01:29.299> your<00:01:29.840> third<00:01:30.110> or

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
you leave the landing and your third or

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.480 
you leave the landing and your third or
fourth<00:01:30.469> paddle<00:01:30.860> stroke<00:01:31.070> is<00:01:31.250> you're<00:01:31.399> getting

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
fourth paddle stroke is you're getting

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.550 
fourth paddle stroke is you're getting
on<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.789> water<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.539> leave<00:01:32.750> everything<00:01:33.289> you

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
on the water you leave everything you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.469 
on the water you leave everything you
were<00:01:33.679> thinking<00:01:33.950> about<00:01:34.009> on<00:01:34.250> land<00:01:34.429> behind<00:01:34.610> but

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
were thinking about on land behind but

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.940 
were thinking about on land behind but
it's<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.020> silence<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.590> Mars<00:01:36.799> that

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
it's the the silence of the Mars that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.679 
it's the the silence of the Mars that
sometimes<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.460> loudest<00:01:37.789> thing<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.210> can<00:01:38.390> you

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
sometimes the loudest thing you can you

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.870 
sometimes the loudest thing you can you
can<00:01:38.869> hear<00:01:39.110> because<00:01:39.520> because<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.670> really

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
can hear because because it really

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.490 
can hear because because it really
forces<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.810> be<00:01:41.929> in<00:01:42.020> touch<00:01:42.170> with<00:01:42.319> that<00:01:42.350> it

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
forces you to be in touch with that it

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.230 
forces you to be in touch with that it
forces<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:42.950> understand<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:43.460> on<00:01:43.549> a<00:01:43.789> simpler

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
forces you to understand it on a simpler

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.600 
forces you to understand it on a simpler
level<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.869> it's<00:01:45.259> just<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.740> that's<00:01:46.069> smooth

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
level and it's just that that's smooth
