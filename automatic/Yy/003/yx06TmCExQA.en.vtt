 hello friends with you project ferrum com and 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.160
 I'm Sergey Mikhailov today we will 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.740
 open the box which is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 cubot x12 before going 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.630
 directly to unpacking I will remind 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.920
 to everyone and everyone that our unboxing we 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.020
 we shoot not only to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.990
 show you the contents of the boxes 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.080
 but also for everyone to have 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.149
 opportunity to leave a question on 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.079
 unpack the mind of the device in this 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.050
 The moment is cubot x12, like all 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.239
 Immediately I will say that this device 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.180
 quite interesting since she 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.420
 stuck between the concepts of budget and 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.710
 the middle peasant during unpacking will tell 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.140
 why go 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.910
 open the box made it in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.980
 this form of envelope and another 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.350
 we have the top cover too 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.289
 first thing on the smartphone itself 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:12.509
 meets further we have instructions 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:15.659
 manual for a second on and 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.170
 so many languages ​​i'm here and english 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.340
 I see 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.609
 and I see Arabic and even see Russian 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.999
 you can make a call in mode 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:29.909
 call log interface in mode 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.840
 standby press and hold empty 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.159
 region 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:40.579
 but great cubot so far pleases 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:44.249
 farther farther we have cable micro sd 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:51.300
 how white we have the cubot emblem 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:55.690
 we have it and so we 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:02.700
 come on power adapter 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.700
 again with a cubot emblem for 1 amp and 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.970
 the battery is basically all 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:16.060
 battery set we have to say on 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:21.100
 2200 milliampere hours back to 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.410
 the smartphone that I watch here immediately I 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.130
 I observe on the front panel immediately 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.100
 pasted on 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.060
 protective film for that in ender thanks 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.450
 and protective case transparent all of 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.870
 myself 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.400
 bumper case call whatever you want when 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:44.130
 this internal part of it they look like 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:47.530
 strange at least has such a rough 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.270
 perhaps even ribbed surface well, 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.000
 thanks for that too 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:58.890
 og and by the way the back of the smartphone too 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.380
 musical ball ridiculous all things 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.239
 let's get right in appearance 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.670
 front panel supposedly 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.760
 tempered glass earpiece 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.150
 three touch sensor front camera 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.690
 hardware buttons here we have 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.680
 microphone screen we have five inches 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.030
 960 by 540 pixels resolution 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.450
 it is this part of the smartphone 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.299
 IMHO is its weak point because 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.180
 that permission for our times already 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.330
 not at all fiction 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.680
 back of the camera flash 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.410

 home appliances control shoot 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.049
 backdrop 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.650
 a victory here we see two SIM card slots 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.680
 and one for the memory card 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.310
 install the battery and at this time 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.630
 while I turn on the smartphone by the way not 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.390
 squeaks well while it is new it and not 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.700
 strange yes but does not creak and it 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:22.700
 very very like so iron 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.440
 quad 64 bit processor mtk 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.790

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.870
 m work and dough 2 1 gigahertz video core 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.870
 mali t720 one gigabyte of RAM 8 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.310
 built-in as seen card slot 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:44.180
 memory there is generally iron not a rocket 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.820
 but it is not bad but the screen here while 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.090
 a little bit here by the numbers it upsets 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:55.100
 although now let's check how he behaves 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.750
 in practice, the brightness to the maximum and I tell you 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.960
 I want to say that the brightness 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.280
 even despite the fact that in this room 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.470
 not real bright 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.010
 the brightness is very very ok the screen is very 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.530
 clearly seen on this corner question 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:16.430
 grit only at working distance 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.910
 in principle, not bad and even very possible 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.550
 if you stare well yes if 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.620
 peer a little bit noticeable 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.770
 Well, in principle, pleased 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.260
 I thought everything would be us. I am already here. 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.890
 I observe that the play market we have Ji 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.590

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.020
 I do not notice the principle of the left software yet 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.940
 it is also happy that the truth is a little bit 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.569
 icons as you can see were still 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:09.990
 redrawn 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:14.759
 Check if there is Russian Russian 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:19.999
