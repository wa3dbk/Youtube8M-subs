00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.839
When I first heard about Yamaha's
all-new super vortex high output engines

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.430
I knew I had to get my hands on it

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.519
but unfortunately that doesn't always
happen when you want it to

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.860
so here it is almost November and I
finally got my hands on it

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.370
but it's a machine that's so hot, it
doesn't matter how cold it is

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.880
so in this Profile we're gonna take a
look at the 2014

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.370
Yamaha WaveRunner FX Cruiser Super
Vortex

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.740
High Output. The FX Cruiser SHO

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.470
was Yamaha's best-selling luxury
performance waverunner for good reason

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.790
it back and better than ever for 2014

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.130
with some familiar features and a few
fresh changes

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.790
sitting in the new black metallic paint
the new

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.940
SVHO has a don't mess with me look
even when it's sitting still

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.260
but this is first and foremost a luxury
model

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.350
and has the features to back it up. The
helm on the SVHO is first-rate

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.030
right in front of you is storage with removable
cup holders

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.219
and adjustable ergonomic handle bars let
you customize your ride

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.229
the handlebars have all your controls

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.780
like cruise-assist and trim right at your
fingertips

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.889
a digital and analog gauge keep all your
engine data in clear view

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:21.159
and a watertight storage bin is not only great
for valuables

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.520
but also holds the learner remote that
limits the RPM

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.840
the storage bin up front is a great spot
for larger items and your safety gear

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.299
and of course you can't forget Yamaha's
exclusive

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.429
pop-up cleats . The seat compartment lifts
up for easy access to water tight

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:39.109
storage

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:45.520
that you can easily take with you and
also gives you access to the bilge

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.479
so powering this FX Cruiser SVHO

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.380
is Yamaha's brand new super vortex
high output marine engine

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.950
this happens to be the most powerful
engine they've ever put in a waverunner

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.050
they've taken their 1.8 liter and tweaked it a
little

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.670
while increasing air intake by 20
percent and the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.840
boost by 60 percent not only that

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.140
there's a whole new 160
millimeter jet pump

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.790
to really give you some get up and go.
Now since the FX Cruiser SVHO

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.290
is Yamaha's new flagship for their
luxury segment it's important that they keep

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.640
ergonomics in mind and with that they
certainly do. First this is still the only

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.330
true

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.670
three seater with their theater style
seating but not only that, I love how

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.160
if you're the third person you have
great ergonomic handles

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.390
but not only that, since this is great for water
sports you have handles

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.640
for when you're facing behind
watching the action. This is a watercraft

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.800
that can do a lot

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.570
thanks to features like an extended rear
deck, towline storage,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.360
and an extra-wide re-boarding ladder but
enough talking

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.530
for me it was all about the new SVHO
engine. I was ready to see what it was

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.320
all about

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.590
and if it was worth all the hype. Thanks to that new 160 mm jet pump,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.090
when you put the throttle down it's like getting slapped in the face with power

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.150
I love it.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.220
Another thing about the FX Cruiser SVHO is that it is still a comfortable touring

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.580
machine. When you engage cruise-assist

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.070
you can now not worry about the throttle, just set out

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.630
for an awesome day trip, but then you just
release the throttle

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.040
and you have all the power still right at your fingertips

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.099
Something you have to remember about the FX Cruiser SVHO is that

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.370
as a true three-seater, this is a sizable watercraft but

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.090
the hull is still so responsive and so

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.320
lightweight, and thanks to that Nano Excel hull technology

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.680
it has incredible power to weight ratio

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.040
And you know I've received emails

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.650
from viewers that say,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.349
"All I like to do is drive fast and burn gas"

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.009
and with a machine like the FX Cruiser SVHO how could you blame me

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.200
So now that I've had a chance to put
the new SVHO to the test I must say it was

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.329
certainly worth the wait and worth
putting the wet suit on for

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.210
this new super vortex high output 1.8
liter engine

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.840
has so much power it's incredible and
thanks to that new 160

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.060
millimeter jet pump there's so much get
up and go

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.260
but remember at the core this is still
an FX cruiser

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.470
it's a luxury comfort model and it has
all the great ergonomics and features you'd

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.370
expect from a high end Yamaha product.
This new flagship

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.190
is certainly something they can be proud
to put their name on.
