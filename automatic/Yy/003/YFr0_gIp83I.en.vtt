00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
battlefield hardline will not now be

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.139 
battlefield hardline will not now be
releasing<00:00:33.559> in<00:00:33.710> October<00:00:34.340> as<00:00:34.460> we<00:00:34.670> were<00:00:34.940> led<00:00:35.120> to

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
releasing in October as we were led to

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.150 
releasing in October as we were led to
believe<00:00:35.329> that<00:00:36.020> was<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.500> initial<00:00:36.680> release

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
believe that was the initial release

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.849 
believe that was the initial release
date<00:00:37.460> but<00:00:38.210> for<00:00:38.510> three<00:00:38.719> reasons<00:00:38.989> it's<00:00:39.589> now

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
date but for three reasons it's now

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.810 
date but for three reasons it's now
being<00:00:40.160> postponed<00:00:40.850> until<00:00:41.120> early<00:00:42.160> 2015<00:00:43.160> so<00:00:43.760> I'm

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
being postponed until early 2015 so I'm

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.229 
being postponed until early 2015 so I'm
thinking<00:00:43.910> possibly<00:00:44.890> january-february<00:00:45.890> time

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
thinking possibly january-february time

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.660 
thinking possibly january-february time
so<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.329> reasons<00:00:47.719> are<00:00:47.870> number<00:00:48.170> one

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
so the reasons are number one

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.579 
so the reasons are number one
multiplayer<00:00:49.719> innovation<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.409> they<00:00:51.559> say

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
multiplayer innovation so they say

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.189 
multiplayer innovation so they say
coming<00:00:52.159> out<00:00:52.249> of<00:00:52.280> III<00:00:52.909> beta<00:00:53.210> internal<00:00:53.929> focus

particularly<00:01:59.600> enamored<00:02:00.079> with<00:02:00.320> single<00:02:01.070> player

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
particularly enamored with single player

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.429 
particularly enamored with single player
in<00:02:01.490> battlefield<00:02:02.000> anyway<00:02:02.479> but<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.020> think<00:02:03.289> I'm

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
in battlefield anyway but I think I'm

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.200 
in battlefield anyway but I think I'm
quite<00:02:03.649> open-minded<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.789> battlefield

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
quite open-minded to the battlefield

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.330 
quite open-minded to the battlefield
hardline<00:02:05.630> single<00:02:06.140> player<00:02:06.350> because<00:02:07.009> we<00:02:07.159> know

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
hardline single player because we know

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.240 
hardline single player because we know
visceral<00:02:07.759> games<00:02:08.050> did<00:02:09.050> very<00:02:09.289> well<00:02:09.380> with<00:02:09.590> dead

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
visceral games did very well with dead

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.610 
visceral games did very well with dead
space<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.880> personally<00:02:11.810> I<00:02:11.900> quite<00:02:12.200> enjoyed<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
space and personally I quite enjoyed the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.589 
space and personally I quite enjoyed the
battlefield<00:02:13.070> bull<00:02:13.310> campaign<00:02:13.820> but<00:02:14.150> I'm<00:02:14.360> not

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
battlefield bull campaign but I'm not

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.759 
battlefield bull campaign but I'm not
sure<00:02:14.629> how<00:02:14.930> many<00:02:14.989> people<00:02:15.379> will<00:02:15.500> agree<00:02:15.590> with

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
sure how many people will agree with

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.550 
sure how many people will agree with
that<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.280> don't<00:02:16.879> really<00:02:17.599> know<00:02:17.930> why<00:02:18.260> we<00:02:18.440> were

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
that I don't really know why we were

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.080 
that I don't really know why we were
forced<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.980> play<00:02:19.129> it<00:02:19.280> through<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.640> many<00:02:19.730> tell

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
forced to play it through so many tell

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.360 
forced to play it through so many tell
too<00:02:20.510> well<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.900> last<00:02:21.050> mission<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.830> unlock<00:02:22.160> all

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
too well the last mission to unlock all

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.559 
too well the last mission to unlock all
the<00:02:22.400> different<00:02:22.760> weapons<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.269> there<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.540> go

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
the different weapons but there you go

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.530 
the different weapons but there you go
so<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.500> third<00:02:24.709> one<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.190> stability<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:26.420> has

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so the third one is stability this has

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.390 
so the third one is stability this has
been<00:02:26.569> a<00:02:26.720> focus<00:02:26.959> for<00:02:27.290> our<00:02:27.349> team<00:02:27.620> since<00:02:27.920> day<00:02:28.129> one

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
been a focus for our team since day one

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.830 
been a focus for our team since day one
and<00:02:28.430> we're<00:02:28.670> going<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.849> be<00:02:28.940> using<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.420> extra

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and we're going to be using the extra

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.199 
and we're going to be using the extra
time<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.620> continue<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:31.220> optimize<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.030> game

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
time to continue to optimize the game

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.690 
time to continue to optimize the game
for<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.510> stable<00:02:32.930> launch<00:02:33.620> we've<00:02:34.280> learned<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.580> lot

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
for a stable launch we've learned a lot

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.580 
for a stable launch we've learned a lot
from<00:02:34.760> battlefield<00:02:35.330> 4<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.750> are<00:02:35.810> continuing<00:02:36.110> to

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
from battlefield 4 and are continuing to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.140 
from battlefield 4 and are continuing to
learn<00:02:36.980> from<00:02:37.220> our<00:02:37.370> community<00:02:37.610> test

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
learn from our community test

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.180 
learn from our community test
environment<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.989> we<00:02:39.440> will<00:02:39.560> learn<00:02:39.739> more<00:02:39.980> from

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
environment and we will learn more from

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.759 
environment and we will learn more from
another<00:02:40.580> hardline<00:02:41.120> beta<00:02:41.150> more<00:02:42.140> time<00:02:42.379> allows

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
another hardline beta more time allows

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.890 
another hardline beta more time allows
us<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.160> surface<00:02:43.640> issues<00:02:43.849> that<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> team<00:02:44.870> can

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
us to surface issues that a team can

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.710 
us to surface issues that a team can
attempt<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.590> fix<00:02:45.830> prior<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.670> launch<00:02:46.879> now<00:02:47.390> this

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
attempt to fix prior to launch now this

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.350 
attempt to fix prior to launch now this
is<00:02:47.959> of<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.530> free<00:02:48.890> things<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.060> main

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
is of the free things this is the main

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.120 
is of the free things this is the main
thing<00:02:50.750> for<00:02:50.780> me<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.260> course<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.769> want<00:02:51.950> more

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
thing for me of course I want more

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.009 
thing for me of course I want more
multiplayer<00:02:52.670> innovation<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.599> course<00:02:53.840> if

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
multiplayer innovation and of course if

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.420 
multiplayer innovation and of course if
they<00:02:54.170> can<00:02:54.349> make<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.590> single-player<00:02:55.010> even

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
they can make the single-player even

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.250 
they can make the single-player even
better<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.790> more<00:02:55.940> enjoyable<00:02:56.269> that's<00:02:56.959> great

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
better and more enjoyable that's great

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.009 
better and more enjoyable that's great
but<00:02:57.739> number<00:02:58.069> three<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.519> stability<00:02:59.269> could

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
but number three the stability could

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.050 
but number three the stability could
there<00:03:00.200> be<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.650> more<00:03:00.709> important<00:03:01.519> reason<00:03:01.700> to

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
there be a more important reason to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.150 
there be a more important reason to
delay<00:03:02.239> again<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.260> think<00:03:03.290> many<00:03:03.769> people

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
delay again and I think many people

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160 
delay again and I think many people
would<00:03:04.340> agree<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.640> battlefield<00:03:05.120> 4<00:03:05.569> should

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
would agree that battlefield 4 should

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.199 
would agree that battlefield 4 should
have<00:03:06.290> had<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.680> same<00:03:06.920> delay<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.610> its<00:03:07.819> release

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
have had the same delay in its release

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.910 
have had the same delay in its release
so<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.480> they<00:03:08.690> could<00:03:08.930> increase<00:03:09.590> or<00:03:09.890> improve

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
so that they could increase or improve

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.509 
so that they could increase or improve
the<00:03:10.910> stability<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.079> game<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:12.860> for<00:03:13.069> me<00:03:13.280> that

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
the stability of the game so for me that

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.910 
the stability of the game so for me that
one<00:03:14.120> there<00:03:14.360> number<00:03:14.810> three<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.319> like<00:03:15.560> yes

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
one there number three is like yes

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.789 
one there number three is like yes
definitely<00:03:16.519> do<00:03:17.390> not<00:03:17.690> release<00:03:17.989> this<00:03:18.260> game<00:03:18.560> if

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799

anyway but let me know I think this is a
positive<00:04:21.049> thing<00:04:21.320> right<00:04:21.650> let's<00:04:22.010> not<00:04:22.190> try<00:04:22.370> to

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
positive thing right let's not try to

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.279 
positive thing right let's not try to
force<00:04:22.849> a<00:04:23.030> game<00:04:23.060> out<00:04:23.450> if<00:04:23.660> we're<00:04:23.960> not<00:04:24.110> one

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
force a game out if we're not one

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.050 
force a game out if we're not one
hundred<00:04:24.320> percent<00:04:24.860> sure<00:04:25.190> it's<00:04:25.580> going<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.910> be

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
hundred percent sure it's going to be

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.610 
hundred percent sure it's going to be
absolutely<00:04:26.240> great<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.229> loved<00:04:27.410> by<00:04:27.560> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
community let's just take the time

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.750 
community let's just take the time
needed<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.080> make<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.560> right<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.729> other

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
needed to make it right and the other

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.580 
needed to make it right and the other
thing<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.180> was<00:04:32.330> thinking<00:04:32.360> about<00:04:32.930> this<00:04:33.080> final

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
thing I was thinking about this final

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.879 
thing I was thinking about this final
state

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
state

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.589 
state
being<00:04:34.219> delayed<00:04:34.490> is<00:04:34.759> it<00:04:34.879> kind<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.180> makes<00:04:35.330> sense

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
being delayed is it kind of makes sense

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.499 
being delayed is it kind of makes sense
with<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.139> too<00:04:36.499> because<00:04:37.159> dragon's<00:04:37.909> teeth<00:04:38.210> was

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
with that too because dragon's teeth was

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.350 
with that too because dragon's teeth was
delayed<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:40.189> initial<00:04:40.490> release<00:04:40.969> date<00:04:41.240> of

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
delayed so the initial release date of

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.659 
delayed so the initial release date of
final<00:04:41.599> stands<00:04:42.110> was<00:04:42.229> always<00:04:42.590> put<00:04:43.189> down<00:04:43.460> as

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
final stands was always put down as

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.230 
final stands was always put down as
summer<00:04:44.120> 2014<00:04:45.159> but<00:04:46.159> really<00:04:46.639> it<00:04:46.849> wouldn't<00:04:47.150> make

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
summer 2014 but really it wouldn't make

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.390 
summer 2014 but really it wouldn't make
sense<00:04:47.300> if<00:04:47.779> final<00:04:48.169> stand<00:04:48.439> came<00:04:48.710> out<00:04:48.860> next<00:04:49.159> month

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
sense if final stand came out next month

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.610 
sense if final stand came out next month
August<00:04:50.029> because<00:04:50.300> we're<00:04:50.990> only<00:04:51.110> just<00:04:51.349> going<00:04:51.560> to

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
August because we're only just going to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.499 
August because we're only just going to
be<00:04:51.680> getting<00:04:51.800> our<00:04:52.039> teeth<00:04:52.340> into<00:04:52.580> excuse<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.330> pun

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
be getting our teeth into excuse the pun

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.260 
be getting our teeth into excuse the pun
dragon's<00:04:54.080> teeth<00:04:54.349> so<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:55.310> does<00:04:55.610> make<00:04:55.639> a<00:04:55.909> little

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
dragon's teeth so it does make a little

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.640 
dragon's teeth so it does make a little
bit<00:04:56.360> more<00:04:56.539> sense<00:04:56.779> that<00:04:56.960> we<00:04:57.020> have<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.169> few<00:04:57.469> months

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
bit more sense that we have a few months

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.219 
bit more sense that we have a few months
to<00:04:57.889> enjoy<00:04:58.249> dragon's<00:04:58.789> teeth<00:04:59.029> before<00:04:59.659> they

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
to enjoy dragon's teeth before they

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.989 
to enjoy dragon's teeth before they
release<00:05:00.650> final<00:05:01.219> stand<00:05:01.460> which<00:05:01.639> you<00:05:01.879> know

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:01.999 
release final stand which you know

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:04.629 
release final stand which you know
October<00:05:02.689> is<00:05:02.840> probably<00:05:03.319> not<00:05:04.009> going<00:05:04.249> to<00:05:04.340> be<00:05:04.460> too

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
October is probably not going to be too

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.129 
October is probably not going to be too
far<00:05:04.909> away<00:05:05.060> it's<00:05:05.330> funny<00:05:05.539> how<00:05:05.779> quickly<00:05:06.050> time

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
far away it's funny how quickly time

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.439 
far away it's funny how quickly time
flies<00:05:06.340> because<00:05:07.340> it's<00:05:07.520> now<00:05:07.669> almost<00:05:07.969> august

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
flies because it's now almost august

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.209 
flies because it's now almost august
anyway<00:05:08.960> so<00:05:09.020> we're<00:05:09.199> talking<00:05:09.379> really<00:05:09.800> two

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:10.219 
anyway so we're talking really two

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:12.339 
anyway so we're talking really two
months<00:05:10.610> maybe<00:05:10.879> until<00:05:11.300> we<00:05:11.449> see<00:05:11.659> final<00:05:12.080> stand

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
months maybe until we see final stand

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.379 
months maybe until we see final stand
