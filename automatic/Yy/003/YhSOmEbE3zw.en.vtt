00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
because I mean there were the most

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.789 
because I mean there were the most
subscribe<00:04:18.359> plan<00:04:18.600> for<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.870> while<00:04:18.900> then<00:04:19.380> phase<00:04:19.620> of

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
subscribe plan for a while then phase of

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.380 
subscribe plan for a while then phase of
course<00:04:20.010> just<00:04:20.580> kind<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.910> blew<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.180> out<00:04:21.239> the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
course just kind of blew it out the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.540 
course just kind of blew it out the
water<00:04:21.570> but<00:04:21.870> we'll<00:04:22.830> see<00:04:22.950> what's<00:04:23.100> gonna<00:04:23.220> happen

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
water but we'll see what's gonna happen

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.130 
water but we'll see what's gonna happen
of<00:04:23.640> course<00:04:23.669> we<00:04:23.910> see<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.690> know<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.900> optic

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
of course we see that you know the optic

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.870 
of course we see that you know the optic
channel<00:04:25.440> has<00:04:25.530> kind<00:04:25.740> of<00:04:25.800> died<00:04:25.950> off<00:04:25.979> they<00:04:26.729> don't

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
channel has kind of died off they don't

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.280 
channel has kind of died off they don't
really<00:04:27.090> post<00:04:27.270> anything<00:04:27.570> in<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.900> there<00:04:28.110> anymore

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
really post anything in it there anymore

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.020 
really post anything in it there anymore
like<00:04:28.560> they<00:04:28.650> used<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.010> they<00:04:29.100> have<00:04:29.310> no<00:04:29.490> snipers

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
like they used to they have no snipers

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.210 
like they used to they have no snipers
so<00:04:30.270> I'm<00:04:30.870> thinking<00:04:31.440> that<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.770> reason<00:04:32.070> why

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
so I'm thinking that the reason why

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.250 
so I'm thinking that the reason why
people<00:04:32.460> were<00:04:32.669> even<00:04:32.940> subscribe<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.479> optic<00:04:34.050> was

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
people were even subscribe to optic was

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.200 
people were even subscribe to optic was
more<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.419> sniping<00:04:36.419> montage

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
more the sniping montage

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.390 
more the sniping montage
they<00:04:37.330> did<00:04:37.539> because<00:04:37.690> for<00:04:38.319> the<00:04:38.470> longest<00:04:38.620> time<00:04:38.889> I

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
they did because for the longest time I

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.059 
they did because for the longest time I
think<00:04:39.520> that<00:04:40.000> optic<00:04:40.569> has<00:04:40.750> had<00:04:41.289> some<00:04:41.889> of<00:04:41.979> the

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
think that optic has had some of the

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.600 
think that optic has had some of the
best<00:04:42.300> editing<00:04:43.300> on<00:04:43.710> YouTube<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.919> then<00:04:45.520> of

best editing on YouTube and then of

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.100 
best editing on YouTube and then of

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
just see the same thing over and over

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.390 
just see the same thing over and over
again<00:05:25.030> you<00:05:25.990> can't<00:05:26.199> really<00:05:26.410> miss<00:05:26.650> my<00:05:26.979> PA's<00:05:27.220> much

as<00:05:27.520> you<00:05:27.580> used<00:05:27.849> to<00:05:27.970> on<00:05:28.270> go<00:05:28.870> so<00:05:29.229> people<00:05:29.530> go<00:05:29.710> on

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
as you used to on go so people go on

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.040 
as you used to on go so people go on
black<00:05:30.340> ops<00:05:30.520> 2<00:05:30.729> or<00:05:31.150> in<00:05:31.360> other<00:05:31.539> you<00:05:31.810> know<00:05:31.840> odor

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
black ops 2 or in other you know odor

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.379 
black ops 2 or in other you know odor
games<00:05:32.380> and<00:05:32.740> it's<00:05:33.370> just<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.610> same<00:05:33.820> environment

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
games and it's just the same environment

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:35.640 
games and it's just the same environment
the<00:05:34.449> same<00:05:34.630> things<00:05:34.840> over<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.169> over<00:05:35.289> again<00:05:35.500> I

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
the same things over and over again I

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.170 
the same things over and over again I
mean<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.919> reason<00:05:36.340> why<00:05:36.580> people<00:05:36.759> go<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:37.000> black

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
mean the reason why people go to black

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.120 
mean the reason why people go to black
ops<00:05:37.360> 2<00:05:37.539> more<00:05:37.780> because<00:05:38.080> it's<00:05:38.199> much<00:05:38.349> easier<00:05:38.650> to

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
ops 2 more because it's much easier to

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.279 
ops 2 more because it's much easier to
snipe<00:05:39.729> in<00:05:40.000> my<00:05:40.389> opinion<00:05:40.720> they're<00:05:41.020> a<00:05:41.050> little<00:05:41.139> bit

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
snipe in my opinion they're a little bit

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.779 
snipe in my opinion they're a little bit
more<00:05:41.409> of<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.590> power<00:05:41.800> thought<00:05:42.070> the<00:05:42.340> guns<00:05:42.550> there

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
more of a power thought the guns there

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.300 
more of a power thought the guns there
and<00:05:43.000> uh<00:05:43.199> one<00:05:44.199> let<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.650> guns<00:05:44.830> put<00:05:45.009> the<00:05:45.099> sniper

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
and uh one let the guns put the sniper

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.800 
and uh one let the guns put the sniper
gun<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:45.789> it's<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.419> little<00:05:46.599> bit<00:05:46.690> more

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
gun and it's a little bit more

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.320 
gun and it's a little bit more
close-quarter<00:05:47.440> than<00:05:47.650> other<00:05:48.070> maps<00:05:48.940> on<00:05:49.120> ghost

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
close-quarter than other maps on ghost

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.870 
close-quarter than other maps on ghost
and<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.990> think<00:05:50.169> that's<00:05:50.320> the<00:05:50.349> reason<00:05:50.620> why<00:05:50.880> it's

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
and I think that's the reason why it's

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.089 
and I think that's the reason why it's
more<00:05:52.120> popular<00:05:52.630> there<00:05:52.810> so<00:05:53.169> I<00:05:53.440> don't<00:05:54.070> really

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
more popular there so I don't really

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:55.649 
more popular there so I don't really
keep<00:05:54.370> up<00:05:54.490> with<00:05:54.639> I<00:05:54.669> get<00:05:54.909> bored<00:05:55.210> of<00:05:55.300> it<00:05:55.389> really

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
keep up with I get bored of it really

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.959
