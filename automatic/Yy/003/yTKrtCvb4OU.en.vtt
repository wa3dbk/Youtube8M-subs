00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.370
 I do not understand 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.430
 so the first thing is not normal to be 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.349
 to thank equally and is to tell 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.029
 that we could keep their patients by 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:25.310
 before two so unfortunately 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.740
 the tigra see it because president but 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.390
 as we are all we all follow here and 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.330
 now friends but not to inform what 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.970
 We talk about the chiqui I think everything 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.030
 everything is still the same, the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.190
 Monday we had said Thursday and Monday the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.110
 unemployment continues tomorrow we have a meeting 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.970
 with the doctor from every corner doctor 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.850
 Rodriguez and Dr. Montes will go to 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.610
 see the vineyard theme that are also 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.309
 trying to solve it but if the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.579
 things are still as it has been 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.390
 now 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.390
 it comes 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.799
 as we said last week 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.869
 we had a meeting with vice-rectory in 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.390
 which they said they were going to send a 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.540
 proposal of the number of students the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.140
 proposal 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.950
 in truth it is history 170 students 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.950
 mens 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:46.600
 away from wind 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.600
 while it is not contemplated 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.320
 and it's a joke considering that there's 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.500
 no room that exists that you have for 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.510
 170 students then how are they going to start 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.340
 to study branches and especially 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.520
 despised years is beginning to change the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.860
 mesh and the student number is still high and the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.920
 coordination will not improve 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.540
 That is why, as I told you, 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.180
 mobilizations are going to continue 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.400
 let's continue in conversations because 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.580
 we can not close the door to the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.580
 conversation or we have the answer 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.980
 that we were going to come those above 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.020
 but this means continuing the energy 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.970
 they do not have to fall we have to 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.940
 keep making noise and we have to 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.970
 keep making it listen today was 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.400
 spectacular us in meeting and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.030
 he felt in the same of the authorities 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.030
 easy 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.489
 activity is how opposes the day 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.500
 but just we want to motivate 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.209
 they organize themselves make canvas at 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.799
 songs that especially songs that 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.280
 it was quite short that's pretty 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.280
 good 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:26.110
 is that there is a theme on the subject of bathroom 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.320
 that is to say 60 of man but there is a cap 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.580
 of overbooking that is super important 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.120
 last year between 180 men and they are 240 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.120
 in first 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:54.940
 information because it says 70 and 130 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.900
 maximum clear that you do not want to get the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.440
 pump from 250 to 170 but then in the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.020
 good path 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.020
 are 170 to 180 inside then 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.560
 what 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.100
 you have to maintain the energy because there 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.480
 two very important topics and there is a theme 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.670
 of school that we have to solve 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.530
 with the doctor he stated mainly and 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.410
 there is a there is a vice-rectory theme 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.600
 academic then what it costs us 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.300
 is to coordinate the presence or we are 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.710
 them and academic vice-rectory then 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.030
 we have to stay like this until 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.220
 we receive a response from both 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.930
 authorities that's why it costs so much 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.310
 receive an answer because you have to 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.830
 coordinate what both school says 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.270
 because for example vicerrectorÃ­a gives a 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.880
 response and school activity in a 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.170
 against answer already but that does not 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.940
 never coordinates why we delayed 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.480
 so much does not get an answer and now 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.580
 It has to be like this until the many 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.320
 already have a meeting with let and no 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.500
 I still do not have the rectory that 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.570
 important most important of the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.630
 motivation of us the subject of the 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:11.920
 songs the canvases 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:15.660
 at 12 o'clock tomorrow and march things and so 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.160
 keep growing and until we have 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.900
 we have satisfactory answers both 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.940
 for the number of students and things that 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.860
 they are in the vice-rectory as much as 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.400
 us who are from clinics tomorrow 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.160
 also tomorrow quoted the heads of 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.040
 inspiration greeting the delegate of 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.240
 generation tomorrow have been critical to the 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.700
 eleven 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.700
 so to your generation delegate 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.700
 so tomorrow what are preclinical 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.650
 boy, we remind you of the unemployment 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.430
 theoretical activities laboratory 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.430
 preclinical 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.250
 no one is going to kill their comrades 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:14.550
 in the concept of the clinic concept 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.259
 that continues is the concept of criticism 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.449
 that has a program to fulfill that 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.999
 has patients the third party clinic 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.639
 they do not have patients not by program like this 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:25.710
 that there is no unemployment of clinics of 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.099
 third parties so that you also have 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.099
 clear 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:37.580
 act such 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.580
 cameron 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.330
 why 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:07.690
 for what information 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:17.879
 but a goalkeeper family 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:25.659
 It is the motivation of the day
