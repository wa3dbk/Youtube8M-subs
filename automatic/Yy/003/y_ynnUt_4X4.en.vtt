00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
scooters were to rip out which could

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.120 
scooters were to rip out which could
happen<00:02:11.709> in<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.130> hard<00:02:13.000> landing<00:02:13.540> will<00:02:13.720> say<00:02:14.130> they

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
happen in a hard landing will say they

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.770 
happen in a hard landing will say they
could<00:02:15.310> easily<00:02:15.430> be<00:02:15.730> put<00:02:15.970> back<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.510> slightly

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
could easily be put back in a slightly

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.180 
could easily be put back in a slightly
different<00:02:16.930> position<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:17.950> wouldn't

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
different position and it wouldn't

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.229 
different position and it wouldn't
really<00:02:18.280> affect<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> way<00:02:18.940> they<00:02:19.090> are<00:02:19.209> playing

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
really affect the way they are playing

off<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.160> like<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.329> style<00:02:25.630> of

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
or prop hub nut adapter because you can

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.350 
or prop hub nut adapter because you can

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
use a small allen wrench or small

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.960 
use a small allen wrench or small
screwdriver<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.860> field<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.550> remove<00:02:34.820> the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
of hard wood into the stabilizer so I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.070 
of hard wood into the stabilizer so I
just<00:02:54.890> put<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.100> zip<00:02:55.400> tie<00:02:55.580> through<00:02:55.940> there<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.330> fix

the struts when I want them I can take

the struts when I want them I can take

them off easily for transport most of
the<00:03:02.330> time<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.660> don't<00:03:02.690> even<00:03:02.930> bother<00:03:03.200> putting

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
the time I don't even bother putting

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.670 
the time I don't even bother putting
them<00:03:03.770> on<00:03:03.890> though<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.310> use<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:05.120> Z<00:03:05.510> bend<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:06.140> my

them on though I use a Z bend in my

them on though I use a Z bend in my
elevator<00:03:06.980> control<00:03:07.640> board<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.630> the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
elevator control board so that the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.530 
elevator control board so that the
stabilizer<00:03:09.470> can<00:03:09.830> come<00:03:10.040> off<00:03:10.220> complete<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.420> be

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
stabilizer can come off complete and be

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.380 
stabilizer can come off complete and be
disconnected<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.440> with<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.650> twist<00:03:13.330> now<00:03:14.330> you

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
disconnected just with a twist now you

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.000 
disconnected just with a twist now you
have<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.630> bunch<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.960> parts<00:03:15.290> laying<00:03:15.530> around<00:03:15.680> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
have a bunch of parts laying around and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.590 
have a bunch of parts laying around and
it<00:03:16.130> looks<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:16.460> a<00:03:16.490> scene<00:03:16.850> from<00:03:16.880> air<00:03:17.300> crash

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
it looks like a scene from air crash

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.080 
it looks like a scene from air crash
investigation<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.310> have<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:19.610> kind<00:03:19.970> of

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
investigation so you have to kind of

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.510 
investigation so you have to kind of
rearrange<00:03:20.420> them<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.140> see<00:03:21.740> how<00:03:21.770> best<00:03:22.250> they<00:03:22.370> can

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
rearrange them and see how best they can

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.580 
rearrange them and see how best they can
fit<00:03:22.880> together<00:03:23.270> so<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.050> can<00:03:24.230> fit<00:03:24.440> in<00:03:24.530> a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
fit together so that you can fit in a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.770 
fit together so that you can fit in a
box<00:03:24.860> I'll<00:03:25.730> show<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.030> how<00:03:26.240> I<00:03:26.270> did<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.570> for<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
box I'll show you how I did it for the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.870 
box I'll show you how I did it for the
Skywalker<00:03:27.350> as<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:27.950> can<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.460> parts<00:03:28.730> have

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
Skywalker as you can see the parts have

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.400 
Skywalker as you can see the parts have
been<00:03:28.970> arranged<00:03:29.420> as<00:03:29.570> compact<00:03:30.020> as<00:03:30.290> possible

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
been arranged as compact as possible

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.040 
been arranged as compact as possible
even<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.760> elevator<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.420> propeller<00:03:32.840> are

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
even the elevator and the propeller are

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.979 
even the elevator and the propeller are
inside<00:03:33.500> they're<00:03:33.739> tucked<00:03:34.040> in<00:03:34.810> next<00:03:35.810> you'll

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
inside they're tucked in next you'll

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.229 
inside they're tucked in next you'll
need<00:03:36.020> to<00:03:36.170> get<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.320> tape<00:03:36.560> measure<00:03:36.970> see<00:03:37.970> what<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
need to get a tape measure see what the

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.180 
need to get a tape measure see what the
total<00:03:38.630> length<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:39.050> everything<00:03:39.530> together<00:03:39.680> is

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
total length of everything together is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.580 
total length of everything together is
and<00:03:40.810> remember<00:03:41.810> when<00:03:42.110> you're<00:03:42.140> cutting<00:03:42.440> the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
and remember when you're cutting the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.010 
and remember when you're cutting the
foam<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.910> dimensions<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.570> took<00:03:44.780> for<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
foam the dimensions you took for the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.540 
foam the dimensions you took for the
airplane<00:03:45.410> will<00:03:45.620> need<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.860> match<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.340> inside

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
airplane will need to match the inside

airplane will need to match the inside
dimensions<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.630> box<00:03:47.980> it's<00:03:48.980> probably<00:03:49.340> good

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
dimensions of the box it's probably good

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.820 
dimensions of the box it's probably good
when<00:03:49.850> you're<00:03:49.970> building<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.420> box<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:51.440> build<00:03:51.650> in
