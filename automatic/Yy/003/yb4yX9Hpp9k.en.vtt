00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.420
You can do this exercise standing in front
of a mirror or sitting in a comfortable chair.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.220
Just take a moment to tune into your body.
Noticing how it feels.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 Noticing how you look.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.130
And then place your hands over your eyes

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.350
. 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.020
With the intention to let the reiki healing flow

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.060
And just repeat after me. 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.260
Just for today
I let go of anger.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.120
 I allow my feelings and memories

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.260
 to flow out with each breath. 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.440
Just
for today I let go of fear. 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.560
I let all fearful memories flow out with each breath.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.340
 Just for
today I give thanks for my many blessings.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.870
I allow myself to feel gratitude.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.740
 With gratitude
I find forgiveness in my heart.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.840
 I allow myself to find forgiveness for those who have wronged
me.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.160
 Just for today I ask for forgiveness from anyone I may have hurt.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.940
 Just for today I nurture
myself and honour my feelings.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.360
 I remember a time when I was young and filled with joy.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.300
I notice how that feels in my body.  

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.720
 I remember my goals.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.600
 I see myself achieving them...

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.780
and
notice how that feels.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.580
 I make a commitment to do something today

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.780
 towards achieving one
of those goals. 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.920
I make a commitment today to help others. 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.620
I remember a time when I accomplished
something important.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.320
.. that felt empowering and joyful. 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.100

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.100

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:54.440
And now place your hands in the
gasso position - the prayer position. 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.680
Give thanks for the Reiki

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.580
And when your ready

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.860
Open your eyes

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.120
Noticing how you feel

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.860
and how you look

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.500
Have a fantastic day.
