00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
would just be like sit or written like

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.899 
would just be like sit or written like
just<00:02:00.570> they're<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.590> written<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.310> I'm<00:02:02.700> gonna

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
just they're just written and I'm gonna

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.090 
just they're just written and I'm gonna
read<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.570> keep<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.229> reading<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.530> black<00:02:04.770> away

read it and keep on reading a black away

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.960 
read it and keep on reading a black away
what<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.180> what<00:02:06.689> what<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
what was that what what and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.400 
what was that what what and
I<00:02:09.060> think<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.869> was<00:02:09.930> so<00:02:10.170> much<00:02:10.350> better

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
I think that it was so much better

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.770 
I think that it was so much better
because<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.940> didn't<00:02:12.210> have<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
because it didn't have that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.560 
because it didn't have that
embellishment<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.970> know<00:02:15.060> if<00:02:15.270> there<00:02:15.450> was

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
embellishment like you know if there was

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.290 
embellishment like you know if there was
more<00:02:15.810> kind<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.410> drama<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.700> certain<00:02:18.150> things

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
more kind of drama for certain things

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.470 
more kind of drama for certain things
and<00:02:18.630> more<00:02:18.840> um<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:20.670> stuff<00:02:21.060> surrounding

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and more um just stuff surrounding

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.170 
and more um just stuff surrounding
certain<00:02:22.350> events<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> would<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.220> clouded

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
certain events it would have clouded

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.350 
certain events it would have clouded
them<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.990> made<00:02:25.170> them<00:02:25.200> not<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:25.770> just<00:02:26.730> intense

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360

bit romanticized I didn't really think

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.129 
bit romanticized I didn't really think
about<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.210> while<00:04:43.540> reading<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:44.020> bit

afterwards like I was kind of like yeah
it<00:04:46.810> was<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.990> little<00:04:47.139> bit<00:04:47.260> undersized<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.950> really

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
it was a little bit undersized I really

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.409 
it was a little bit undersized I really
have<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.370> problem<00:04:48.580> with<00:04:48.790> that<00:04:48.820> but<00:04:49.000> if<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.240> do

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
have a problem with that but if you do

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.600 
have a problem with that but if you do
then<00:04:49.720> maybe<00:04:49.900> might<00:04:50.680> not<00:04:50.860> want<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.340> read<00:04:51.520> this

book<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.060> then<00:04:52.660> also<00:04:53.010> if<00:04:54.010> you<00:04:54.220> don't<00:04:54.430> like<00:04:54.610> the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
book and then also if you don't like the

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.219

and<00:04:59.350> kind<00:04:59.650> of<00:04:59.710> intense<00:05:00.130> then<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:00.970> probably

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
and kind of intense then you probably

ocean<00:06:01.330> in<00:06:01.480> dialogue<00:06:01.930> which<00:06:02.110> I<00:06:02.230> thought

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
ocean in dialogue which I thought

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.870 
ocean in dialogue which I thought
reflected<00:06:03.010> the<00:06:03.130> book<00:06:03.280> really<00:06:03.460> well<00:06:03.699> because

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
reflected the book really well because

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.390 
reflected the book really well because
you<00:06:04.090> know<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.750> book<00:06:04.930> was<00:06:05.139> not<00:06:05.440> really<00:06:06.040> focused

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
you know the book was not really focused

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.640 
you know the book was not really focused
on<00:06:06.460> dialogue<00:06:06.820> and<00:06:07.000> more<00:06:07.180> focused<00:06:07.570> on<00:06:07.750> the<00:06:08.380> mood

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
on dialogue and more focused on the mood

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.080 
on dialogue and more focused on the mood
and<00:06:09.070> that<00:06:09.100> emotions<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:09.790> things<00:06:09.850> like<00:06:10.030> that

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
and that emotions and things like that

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.240 
and that emotions and things like that
the<00:06:10.810> one<00:06:11.020> thing<00:06:11.260> that<00:06:11.320> I<00:06:11.470> didn't<00:06:11.710> like<00:06:11.800> but<00:06:11.979> the

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
the one thing that I didn't like but the

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.340 
the one thing that I didn't like but the
movie<00:06:12.610> was<00:06:12.820> it<00:06:13.000> I<00:06:13.150> thought<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.360> over<00:06:13.660> simplify

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
movie was it I thought it over simplify

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.080 
movie was it I thought it over simplify
the<00:06:14.410> reason<00:06:14.919> that<00:06:15.130> the<00:06:15.550> girls<00:06:15.760> committed

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
the reason that the girls committed

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.730 
the reason that the girls committed
suicide<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.690> kind<00:06:16.840> of<00:06:16.960> felt<00:06:17.229> like<00:06:17.290> it<00:06:17.500> was<00:06:17.620> like

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
suicide I kind of felt like it was like

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.400 
suicide I kind of felt like it was like
as<00:06:18.010> a<00:06:18.699> viewer<00:06:19.090> you<00:06:19.389> would<00:06:19.510> be<00:06:19.660> like<00:06:19.810> that

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
as a viewer you would be like that

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.870 
as a viewer you would be like that
that's<00:06:20.830> the<00:06:21.010> reason<00:06:21.130> that<00:06:21.310> they<00:06:21.520> committed<00:06:21.699> to

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
that's the reason that they committed to

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.180 
that's the reason that they committed to
is<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:22.000> ok<00:06:22.380> whereas<00:06:23.380> the<00:06:23.530> book<00:06:23.710> was<00:06:23.919> much

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
is that ok whereas the book was much

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.010 
is that ok whereas the book was much
much<00:06:24.400> more<00:06:24.580> complicated<00:06:24.940> than<00:06:25.300> that<00:06:25.360> but

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
much more complicated than that but

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.750 
much more complicated than that but
other<00:06:26.199> than<00:06:26.590> that<00:06:26.650> I<00:06:26.800> really<00:06:26.979> really<00:06:27.310> like<00:06:27.639> the

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760

other than that I really really like the
