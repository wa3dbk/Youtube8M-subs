to back them all up on on on hard drives
it<00:01:15.570> does<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> little<00:01:15.990> expensive<00:01:16.380> after<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it does get a little expensive after a

information Google has places we can
dump<00:01:57.600> information<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.530> um<00:01:59.040> think<00:01:59.399> about

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
dump information to so um think about

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.310 
dump information to so um think about
also<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:00.899> probably<00:02:01.079> where<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
also that that's probably where the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.420 
also that that's probably where the
future<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.590> gonna<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.250> far<00:02:02.369> as

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
future is gonna be going as far as

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.679 
future is gonna be going as far as
keeping<00:02:02.729> your<00:02:03.060> information<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.630> cloud

keeping your information in the cloud

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.420 
keeping your information in the cloud
that<00:02:04.110> way<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> house<00:02:04.680> fire<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.040> you'll

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that way if you a house fire or you'll

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.980 
that way if you a house fire or you'll
lose<00:02:05.549> your<00:02:05.610> laptop<00:02:06.240> or<00:02:06.420> someone<00:02:06.600> steals<00:02:06.840> it

lose your laptop or someone steals it
you're<00:02:07.320> still<00:02:07.560> gonna<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.740> information

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
you're still gonna have information

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.119 
you're still gonna have information
there<00:02:09.450> you're<00:02:09.690> gonna<00:02:09.780> really<00:02:10.200> get<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.619> um

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
there you're gonna really get it so um

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.090 
there you're gonna really get it so um
the<00:02:11.400> first<00:02:11.430> thing<00:02:11.700> about<00:02:12.000> our

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
the first thing about our

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.940 
the first thing about our
work<00:02:13.190> flow<00:02:13.760> we've<00:02:14.120> got<00:02:14.360> um<00:02:14.770> first<00:02:15.770> of<00:02:15.890> all

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
work flow we've got um first of all

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.900 
work flow we've got um first of all
workflow<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.670> our<00:02:17.770> shooting<00:02:18.770> workflow<00:02:19.220> so

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
workflow is our shooting workflow so

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.180 
workflow is our shooting workflow so
before<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:20.810> actually<00:02:20.990> take<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.920> photograph

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
before we actually take a photograph

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.440 
before we actually take a photograph
there's<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> couple<00:02:22.820> things<00:02:22.940> we<00:02:23.060> want<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.360> think

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
there's a couple things we want to think

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.700 
there's a couple things we want to think
about<00:02:23.570> we<00:02:23.810> talked<00:02:24.050> about<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.530> last

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
about we talked about it in the last

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.360 
about we talked about it in the last
video<00:02:24.920> or<00:02:25.310> scuse<00:02:25.610> me<00:02:25.700> video<00:02:25.910> for<00:02:26.410> about<00:02:27.410> white

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
video or scuse me video for about white

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.600 
video or scuse me video for about white
balance<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.270> think<00:02:29.810> about<00:02:29.990> white<00:02:30.170> balance

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
balance so think about white balance

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.460 
balance so think about white balance
it's<00:02:31.610> not<00:02:31.940> always<00:02:32.660> essential<00:02:32.960> I<00:02:33.140> wouldn't<00:02:33.350> say

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
it's not always essential I wouldn't say

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.000 
it's not always essential I wouldn't say
stop<00:02:33.860> taking<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.340> photograph<00:02:34.520> but<00:02:35.060> think<00:02:35.750> about

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
stop taking a photograph but think about

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.930 
stop taking a photograph but think about
using<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.100> settings<00:02:37.460> in<00:02:37.580> your<00:02:37.610> white<00:02:37.820> balance

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
using the settings in your white balance

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.240 
using the settings in your white balance
or<00:02:38.390> learn<00:02:38.720> how<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.990> set<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.350> manual<00:02:39.740> white

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
or learn how to set a manual white

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.380 
or learn how to set a manual white
balance<00:02:40.280> again<00:02:40.790> I'm<00:02:40.880> not<00:02:40.970> gonna<00:02:41.120> get<00:02:41.240> into

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
balance again I'm not gonna get into

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.630 
balance again I'm not gonna get into
that<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:41.780> but<00:02:42.050> but<00:02:42.650> go<00:02:42.800> on<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.160> youtube<00:02:43.460> if<00:02:43.550> you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
that but but but go on to youtube if you

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.530 
that but but but go on to youtube if you
don't<00:02:43.790> know<00:02:43.850> what<00:02:43.940> I'm<00:02:44.000> talking<00:02:44.330> about

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
don't know what I'm talking about

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.970 
don't know what I'm talking about
so<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.050> go<00:02:45.110> set<00:02:45.260> up<00:02:45.290> white<00:02:45.500> balance<00:02:45.860> under

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
so you go set up white balance under

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.310 
so you go set up white balance under
your<00:02:46.130> camera<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.730> that'll<00:02:47.300> adequately<00:02:47.870> give

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
your camera and that'll adequately give

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.220 
your camera and that'll adequately give
you<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:49.340> correct<00:02:49.700> color<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.780> can<00:02:50.900> go<00:02:51.020> in<00:02:51.140> and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
you the correct color you can go in and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.960 
you the correct color you can go in and
do<00:02:51.320> colors<00:02:51.650> later<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.190> when<00:02:52.310> we<00:02:52.400> start<00:02:52.700> off<00:02:52.820> we

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
do colors later but when we start off we

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.700 
do colors later but when we start off we
want<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.240> have<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.510> right<00:02:53.720> color<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.380> when

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
want to have the right color and when

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.530 
want to have the right color and when
you<00:02:54.740> shoot<00:02:55.040> RAW<00:02:55.370> we're<00:02:55.910> always<00:02:56.030> gonna<00:02:56.300> shoot

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
you shoot RAW we're always gonna shoot

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.720 
you shoot RAW we're always gonna shoot
around<00:02:56.840> here<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:57.650> can<00:02:58.010> go<00:02:58.220> back<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.640> adjust

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
around here you can go back and adjust

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.060 
around here you can go back and adjust
that<00:02:59.180> however<00:02:59.450> start<00:03:00.410> off<00:03:00.530> by<00:03:00.710> shooting<00:03:00.980> the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
that however start off by shooting the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.830 
that however start off by shooting the
right<00:03:01.280> white<00:03:01.520> balance<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.120> you're<00:03:02.540> gonna<00:03:02.630> be

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
right white balance and you're gonna be

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.510 
right white balance and you're gonna be
miles<00:03:03.080> ahead<00:03:03.260> learn<00:03:04.130> about<00:03:04.310> white<00:03:04.490> balance

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
miles ahead learn about white balance

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.120 
miles ahead learn about white balance
and<00:03:05.000> how<00:03:05.090> important<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.750> because<00:03:06.130> it's

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
and how important that is because it's

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
and how important that is because it's
really<00:03:07.340> gonna<00:03:07.460> be<00:03:07.520> able<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.760> make<00:03:07.850> sure<00:03:08.000> that

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
really gonna be able to make sure that

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.560 
really gonna be able to make sure that
you<00:03:08.420> what<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.020> see<00:03:09.530> color<00:03:10.520> wise<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:11.090> actually

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
you what you see color wise is actually

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.330 
you what you see color wise is actually
what<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.870> get<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:12.380> feel<00:03:12.800> important<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.220> work

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
what you get so feel important to work

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.710 
what you get so feel important to work
on<00:03:13.460> white<00:03:13.610> balance<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.300> next<00:03:14.510> thing<00:03:14.630> I'm

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
on white balance the next thing I'm

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.810 
on white balance the next thing I'm
going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.900> talk<00:03:15.020> about<00:03:15.050> here<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.440> your<00:03:16.130> sensor

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
going to talk about here is your sensor

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.180 
going to talk about here is your sensor
your<00:03:17.120> CMOS<00:03:17.540> or<00:03:17.750> your<00:03:17.870> CCD<00:03:18.350> sensor<00:03:18.740> depending

your CMOS or your CCD sensor depending

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.160 
your CMOS or your CCD sensor depending
on<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.430> type<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.670> manufacturer<00:03:20.300> you<00:03:20.420> have<00:03:20.570> can

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
on the type of manufacturer you have can

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.680 
on the type of manufacturer you have can
get<00:03:21.350> dirty<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:22.100> those<00:03:22.250> spots<00:03:22.670> will<00:03:23.030> show<00:03:23.420> up

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
get dirty and those spots will show up

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.210 
get dirty and those spots will show up
on<00:03:23.870> your<00:03:23.990> images<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.620> you'll<00:03:24.770> either<00:03:24.860> have<00:03:25.070> to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
on your images and you'll either have to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.420 
on your images and you'll either have to
remove<00:03:25.400> them<00:03:25.490> through<00:03:25.910> Photoshop<00:03:26.300> later<00:03:27.430> but

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
remove them through Photoshop later but

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.300 
remove them through Photoshop later but
it's<00:03:28.790> it's<00:03:29.420> much<00:03:29.660> better<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.230> always<00:03:30.380> do

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
it's it's much better to always do

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.700 
it's it's much better to always do
things<00:03:31.550> right<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.030> first<00:03:32.300> time<00:03:32.500> instead<00:03:33.500> of

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
things right the first time instead of

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.420 
things right the first time instead of
doing<00:03:34.640> things<00:03:35.620> four<00:03:36.620> or<00:03:36.740> five<00:03:36.860> times<00:03:37.100> later

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
doing things four or five times later

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.040 
doing things four or five times later
and<00:03:37.640> sometimes<00:03:37.970> removing<00:03:38.270> spots<00:03:38.480> can<00:03:38.840> be<00:03:39.020> a

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
and sometimes removing spots can be a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.910 
and sometimes removing spots can be a
real<00:03:39.410> drag

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
real drag

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.320 
real drag
now<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.460> lot<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.640> different<00:03:40.910> cameras<00:03:41.210> have

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
now a lot of different cameras have

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.940 
now a lot of different cameras have
automatic<00:03:41.810> sensor<00:03:42.080> cleaning<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.770> there's

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
automatic sensor cleaning and there's

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.860 
automatic sensor cleaning and there's
various<00:03:43.340> ways<00:03:43.400> some<00:03:44.000> there's<00:03:44.210> some<00:03:44.360> wipes<00:03:44.630> out

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
various ways some there's some wipes out

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.680 
various ways some there's some wipes out
there<00:03:45.140> there's<00:03:45.710> these<00:03:45.980> little<00:03:46.280> tools<00:03:47.270> we<00:03:47.570> can

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
there there's these little tools we can

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.750 
there there's these little tools we can
grab<00:03:47.990> since<00:03:48.320> there's<00:03:48.470> spots<00:03:48.680> out<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.340> you

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
grab since there's spots out of it you

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.330 
grab since there's spots out of it you
can<00:03:49.940> use<00:03:50.300> canned<00:03:50.870> air<00:03:51.230> I'm<00:03:51.710> not<00:03:51.950> gonna<00:03:52.070> tell

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
can use canned air I'm not gonna tell

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.620 
can use canned air I'm not gonna tell
you<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.520> right<00:03:52.850> way<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.150> suppose<00:03:53.270> I<00:03:53.480> use

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
you the right way to I suppose I use

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.790 
you the right way to I suppose I use
canned<00:03:53.870> air<00:03:53.990> I<00:03:54.050> think<00:03:54.140> actually<00:03:54.440> works<00:03:54.590> kind

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
canned air I think actually works kind

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.690 
canned air I think actually works kind
of<00:03:54.860> good<00:03:55.040> as<00:03:55.160> long<00:03:55.280> as<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.400> know<00:03:55.490> from<00:03:55.640> an

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
of good as long as you know from an

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.580 
of good as long as you know from an
angle<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.330> don't<00:03:56.570> make<00:03:56.810> sure<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.140> like

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
angle and don't make sure you like

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.470 
angle and don't make sure you like
sometimes<00:03:58.160> we<00:03:58.310> need<00:03:58.370> Duke<00:03:58.550> and<00:03:58.760> air<00:03:58.940> it'll<00:03:59.090> fog

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
sometimes we need Duke and air it'll fog

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.990 
sometimes we need Duke and air it'll fog
and<00:03:59.840> it'll<00:03:59.990> shoot<00:04:00.170> out<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.350> bunch<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.710> like

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
and it'll shoot out a bunch of like

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.130 
and it'll shoot out a bunch of like
liquid<00:04:02.000> chemical<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:02.840> don't<00:04:02.960> want<00:04:03.080> to

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
liquid chemical and you don't want to

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.410 
liquid chemical and you don't want to
put<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.380> on<00:04:03.470> your<00:04:03.560> CCD<00:04:03.980> or<00:04:04.100> your<00:04:04.640> sensor<00:04:05.060> so

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
put that on your CCD or your sensor so

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.690 
put that on your CCD or your sensor so
um<00:04:05.780> I<00:04:05.930> usually<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.290> hold<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.830> my<00:04:06.980> cam<00:04:07.220> like<00:04:07.460> this

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
um I usually I hold it my cam like this

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.820 
um I usually I hold it my cam like this
take<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.240> lens<00:04:08.420> off<00:04:08.600> there's<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.350> setting<00:04:09.710> on

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
take the lens off there's a setting on

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.590 
take the lens off there's a setting on
your<00:04:09.860> camera<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.520> will<00:04:10.580> they'll<00:04:11.030> pop<00:04:11.360> the

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
your camera that will they'll pop the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.750 
your camera that will they'll pop the
mirror<00:04:11.930> up<00:04:12.080> so<00:04:12.620> it'll<00:04:12.830> actually<00:04:13.070> be<00:04:13.490> able<00:04:13.580> to

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
mirror up so it'll actually be able to

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.700 
mirror up so it'll actually be able to
expose<00:04:14.210> your<00:04:14.480> sensor<00:04:14.930> when<00:04:15.260> you<00:04:15.320> look<00:04:15.500> at<00:04:15.590> it

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
expose your sensor when you look at it

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.800 
expose your sensor when you look at it
it's<00:04:15.830> kind<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.130> looks<00:04:16.850> rainbowy<00:04:17.270> like<00:04:17.600> or

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
it's kind of looks rainbowy like or

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.390 
it's kind of looks rainbowy like or
whatever<00:04:18.080> you'll<00:04:18.320> see<00:04:18.470> what<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.739> but<00:04:19.190> I

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
whatever you'll see what it is but I

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.920 
whatever you'll see what it is but I
kind<00:04:19.730> of<00:04:19.760> hit<00:04:19.880> an<00:04:20.090> angle<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.480> make<00:04:20.630> sure<00:04:20.810> I'm

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
kind of hit an angle and make sure I'm

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.860 
kind of hit an angle and make sure I'm
not<00:04:21.109> shooting<00:04:21.530> down<00:04:21.950> with<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:23.300> canned<00:04:23.570> air

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
not shooting down with the canned air

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.360 
not shooting down with the canned air
and<00:04:24.110> that's<00:04:24.260> usually<00:04:24.440> when<00:04:24.680> all<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.979> bump

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
and that's usually when all the bump

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.990 
and that's usually when all the bump
comes<00:04:25.610> out<00:04:25.729> of<00:04:25.850> it

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
comes out of it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.790 
comes out of it
you<00:04:26.060> want<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.270> hit<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.480> at<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.660> side<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.320> not

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
you want to hit it at the side and not

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.070 
you want to hit it at the side and not
do<00:04:28.040> not<00:04:28.400> do<00:04:28.550> air<00:04:28.790> directly<00:04:29.060> at<00:04:29.420> it<00:04:29.600> that's<00:04:29.900> one

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
do not do air directly at it that's one

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.870 
do not do air directly at it that's one
way<00:04:30.230> of<00:04:30.260> doing<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.680> there's<00:04:31.040> various<00:04:31.490> ways<00:04:31.700> of

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
way of doing it there's various ways of

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.980 
way of doing it there's various ways of
cleaning<00:04:32.030> your<00:04:32.210> sensor<00:04:32.540> but<00:04:32.690> make<00:04:32.810> sure<00:04:32.900> you

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
cleaning your sensor but make sure you

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.320 
cleaning your sensor but make sure you
get<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.110> clean<00:04:33.350> sensor<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:34.160> more<00:04:34.490> wide-open

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
get a clean sensor the more wide-open

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.730 
get a clean sensor the more wide-open
you<00:04:35.450> are<00:04:35.630> so<00:04:35.810> if<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:35.960> shoot<00:04:36.140> on<00:04:36.230> that<00:04:36.410> 50

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
you are so if you shoot on that 50

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.080 
you are so if you shoot on that 50
millimeter<00:04:37.070> lens<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.430> we're<00:04:37.550> talking<00:04:37.880> about

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
millimeter lens that we're talking about

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.530 
millimeter lens that we're talking about
you're<00:04:38.660> gonna<00:04:38.810> see<00:04:39.140> less<00:04:39.470> sensor<00:04:39.860> spots<00:04:40.540> the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
you're gonna see less sensor spots the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.270 
you're gonna see less sensor spots the
more<00:04:41.960> closed<00:04:42.560> down<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:42.980> are<00:04:43.010> if<00:04:43.190> you're

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
more closed down you are if you're

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.560 
more closed down you are if you're
shooting<00:04:43.400> like<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.640> have<00:04:43.730> 22<00:04:44.090> you're<00:04:44.210> gonna<00:04:44.300> see

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
shooting like I have 22 you're gonna see

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.420 
shooting like I have 22 you're gonna see
a<00:04:44.600> lot<00:04:44.930> more<00:04:44.990> sensor<00:04:45.980> spots<00:04:46.280> so<00:04:48.430> something

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
a lot more sensor spots so something

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.280 
a lot more sensor spots so something
just<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.670> always<00:04:49.820> be<00:04:50.000> aware<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.300> clean<00:04:51.020> your

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
just to always be aware of clean your

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.770 
just to always be aware of clean your
sensor<00:04:51.740> keep<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.190> clean<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.670> you'll<00:04:53.510> save

sensor keep it clean and you'll save

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.160 
sensor keep it clean and you'll save
yourself<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:54.170> lot<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.350> work<00:04:54.970> before<00:04:55.970> or<00:04:56.720> after

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
yourself a lot of work before or after

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.920 
yourself a lot of work before or after
you're<00:04:57.290> done<00:04:57.410> shooting<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:58.630> one<00:04:59.630> thing<00:04:59.750> to<00:04:59.810> do

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
you're done shooting so one thing to do

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.810 
you're done shooting so one thing to do
is<00:05:00.169> especially<00:05:00.980> if<00:05:01.190> you're<00:05:01.310> gonna<00:05:01.430> buy<00:05:01.669> an

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
is especially if you're gonna buy an

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.780 
is especially if you're gonna buy an
older<00:05:02.240> camera<00:05:02.870> one<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:04.070> is<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.250> 6<00:05:04.520> megapixel

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
older camera one that is a 6 megapixel

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.360 
older camera one that is a 6 megapixel
item<00:05:05.270> 8<00:05:05.419> megapixel<00:05:06.020> camera<00:05:06.050> shoot<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:07.250> I

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
item 8 megapixel camera shoot and I

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.190 
item 8 megapixel camera shoot and I
don't<00:05:07.520> see<00:05:07.760> this<00:05:07.880> for<00:05:08.120> any<00:05:08.390> camera<00:05:08.780> but

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
don't see this for any camera but

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.320 
don't see this for any camera but
especially<00:05:09.590> if<00:05:10.220> it's<00:05:10.370> an<00:05:10.430> older<00:05:10.580> camera<00:05:10.940> make

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
especially if it's an older camera make

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.570 
especially if it's an older camera make
sure<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:11.630> shoot<00:05:11.960> at<00:05:12.200> the<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:14.660> slowest<00:05:15.580> ISO

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
sure you shoot at the the slowest ISO

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.780 
sure you shoot at the the slowest ISO
possible<00:05:17.419> that<00:05:17.660> you<00:05:17.750> can<00:05:18.110> get<00:05:18.380> away<00:05:18.470> with<00:05:18.830> that

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
possible that you can get away with that

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.360 
possible that you can get away with that
that<00:05:20.270> means<00:05:20.540> that<00:05:20.900> back<00:05:21.830> in<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.100> film<00:05:22.310> days

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
that means that back in the film days

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.710 
that means that back in the film days
ISO<00:05:23.180> was<00:05:23.750> how<00:05:23.960> sensitive<00:05:24.590> your<00:05:25.490> film<00:05:26.030> was<00:05:26.360> to

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
ISO was how sensitive your film was to

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.110 
ISO was how sensitive your film was to
light<00:05:26.990> but<00:05:27.950> the<00:05:28.070> thing<00:05:28.250> about<00:05:28.280> that<00:05:28.550> also<00:05:28.940> is

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
light but the thing about that also is

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.590 
light but the thing about that also is
it<00:05:29.270> took<00:05:29.480> a<00:05:29.570> lot<00:05:29.840> more<00:05:30.290> for<00:05:31.190> example<00:05:31.600> one

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
it took a lot more for example one

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.920 
it took a lot more for example one
hundred<00:05:33.050> speed<00:05:33.410> film<00:05:33.440> or<00:05:34.040> 50<00:05:34.580> speed<00:05:34.970> film<00:05:35.330> it

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
hundred speed film or 50 speed film it

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.490 
hundred speed film or 50 speed film it
would<00:05:36.080> take<00:05:36.320> lot<00:05:36.710> more<00:05:36.890> light<00:05:37.220> to<00:05:37.250> expose<00:05:37.790> that

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
would take lot more light to expose that

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.330 
would take lot more light to expose that
then<00:05:39.500> it<00:05:39.680> would<00:05:39.950> like<00:05:40.669> 3200<00:05:41.600> speed<00:05:41.900> of<00:05:42.020> film

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
then it would like 3200 speed of film

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.920 
then it would like 3200 speed of film
the<00:05:43.340> what<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.180> get<00:05:44.450> when<00:05:44.630> you're<00:05:44.750> dealing

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
the what you get when you're dealing

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.969 
the what you get when you're dealing
with<00:05:45.050> ISO<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:47.360> smaller<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.530> number<00:05:48.560> the

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
with ISO the the smaller the number the

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.750 
with ISO the the smaller the number the
less<00:05:49.490> grain<00:05:49.940> typically<00:05:50.930> and<00:05:51.140> the<00:05:52.070> higher<00:05:52.370> the

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
less grain typically and the higher the

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.490 
less grain typically and the higher the
number<00:05:52.790> like<00:05:53.600> a<00:05:53.630> thirty<00:05:53.870> two<00:05:54.020> hundred<00:05:54.050> speed

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
number like a thirty two hundred speed

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.719 
number like a thirty two hundred speed
film<00:05:54.530> you're<00:05:54.800> gonna<00:05:54.890> get<00:05:55.040> a<00:05:55.070> lot<00:05:55.370> of<00:05:55.400> grain

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
film you're gonna get a lot of grain

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.330 
film you're gonna get a lot of grain
with<00:05:55.940> that<00:05:56.120> so<00:05:56.830> grain<00:05:57.830> is<00:05:57.950> not<00:05:58.040> always<00:05:58.160> a<00:05:58.250> bad

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
with that so grain is not always a bad

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.620 
with that so grain is not always a bad
thing

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
thing

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.800 
thing
it<00:06:00.140> can<00:06:00.650> be<00:06:00.830> cool<00:06:01.100> you<00:06:01.970> want<00:06:02.210> to<00:06:02.330> start<00:06:02.630> off

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
it can be cool you want to start off

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.390 
it can be cool you want to start off
however<00:06:03.169> for<00:06:03.710> the<00:06:03.770> most<00:06:04.100> part<00:06:04.520> use<00:06:05.390> the<00:06:06.400> he's

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
however for the most part use the he's

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.010 
however for the most part use the he's
the<00:06:07.430> lowest<00:06:07.729> possible<00:06:08.090> eyes<00:06:08.450> so<00:06:08.720> you<00:06:08.780> can't

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
the lowest possible eyes so you can't

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.860 
the lowest possible eyes so you can't
have<00:06:09.080> you<00:06:09.169> shoot<00:06:09.380> 50<00:06:09.800> great<00:06:10.610> if<00:06:11.270> you<00:06:11.450> can<00:06:11.570> shoot

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
have you shoot 50 great if you can shoot

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.469 
have you shoot 50 great if you can shoot
but<00:06:12.620> those<00:06:13.400> other<00:06:13.550> factors<00:06:13.760> involved<00:06:14.270> to<00:06:14.360> you

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
but those other factors involved to you

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.510 
but those other factors involved to you
don't<00:06:14.600> a<00:06:14.690> blurry<00:06:14.930> image<00:06:15.080> you<00:06:15.950> don't<00:06:16.100> want<00:06:16.400> to

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
don't a blurry image you don't want to

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.850 
don't a blurry image you don't want to
have<00:06:17.060> to<00:06:17.180> not<00:06:17.660> all<00:06:17.870> images<00:06:18.169> you<00:06:18.440> want<00:06:18.590> to<00:06:18.680> shoot

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
have to not all images you want to shoot

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.920 
have to not all images you want to shoot
at<00:06:18.979> one<00:06:19.130> eight<00:06:19.400> it<00:06:19.669> might<00:06:19.880> be<00:06:19.970> it<00:06:20.240> might<00:06:20.270> be<00:06:20.390> too

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
at one eight it might be it might be too

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.530 
at one eight it might be it might be too
shallow<00:06:21.229> depth<00:06:22.070> of<00:06:22.160> field<00:06:22.220> so<00:06:22.910> consider<00:06:23.419> what

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
shallow depth of field so consider what

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.159 
shallow depth of field so consider what
you're<00:06:23.630> doing<00:06:23.810> there<00:06:23.930> I<00:06:24.080> would<00:06:24.560> go<00:06:24.740> up<00:06:24.950> to<00:06:25.160> 400

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
you're doing there I would go up to 400

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.670 
you're doing there I would go up to 400
maximum<00:06:28.419> I've<00:06:29.419> got<00:06:29.660> some<00:06:29.840> newer<00:06:29.990> cameras<00:06:30.500> and

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
maximum I've got some newer cameras and

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.159 
maximum I've got some newer cameras and
man<00:06:30.950> I<00:06:30.979> even<00:06:31.100> think<00:06:31.430> it<00:06:31.520> like<00:06:31.640> 640<00:06:32.270> or<00:06:32.300> 800

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
man I even think it like 640 or 800

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:34.690 
man I even think it like 640 or 800
sometimes<00:06:33.530> a<00:06:33.620> thousand<00:06:34.070> they're<00:06:34.190> acceptable

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
sometimes a thousand they're acceptable

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.990 
sometimes a thousand they're acceptable
but<00:06:34.970> but<00:06:35.590> don't<00:06:36.590> do<00:06:36.919> that<00:06:37.130> don't<00:06:37.460> start<00:06:37.820> off

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
but but don't do that don't start off

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.940 
but but don't do that don't start off
that<00:06:38.150> way<00:06:38.210> shoot<00:06:39.110> it<00:06:39.200> a<00:06:39.289> hundred

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
that way shoot it a hundred

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.280 
that way shoot it a hundred
and<00:06:40.130> at<00:06:40.250> least<00:06:40.430> some<00:06:40.940> cameras<00:06:41.210> lady<00:06:41.480> fifty<00:06:41.810> so

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
and at least some cameras lady fifty so

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.690 
and at least some cameras lady fifty so
um<00:06:42.560> do<00:06:42.860> that<00:06:44.530> on<00:06:45.530> your<00:06:45.830> camera<00:06:46.340> you're<00:06:46.580> gonna

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
um do that on your camera you're gonna

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.630 
um do that on your camera you're gonna
notice<00:06:46.970> that<00:06:47.620> you're<00:06:48.620> on<00:06:48.740> your<00:06:48.860> lens<00:06:49.100> excuse

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
notice that you're on your lens excuse

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.220 
notice that you're on your lens excuse
me<00:06:49.760> there's<00:06:50.600> gonna<00:06:50.720> be<00:06:50.810> different<00:06:50.870> sweet

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
me there's gonna be different sweet

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.870 
me there's gonna be different sweet
spots<00:06:51.440> in<00:06:51.560> the<00:06:51.650> lens<00:06:51.860> you<00:06:52.100> can<00:06:52.430> you<00:06:52.730> can

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 
spots in the lens you can you can

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.880 
spots in the lens you can you can
investigate<00:06:53.390> I'm<00:06:53.750> kind<00:06:54.020> of<00:06:54.080> where<00:06:54.320> you<00:06:54.590> want

those a little more wide open which
gives<00:07:03.860> you<00:07:04.160> a<00:07:04.520> shallower<00:07:05.390> depth<00:07:05.630> of<00:07:05.750> field

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
gives you a shallower depth of field

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.290 
are gonna be in focus I want to say
planes<00:07:24.320> then<00:07:25.070> the<00:07:25.280> narrow<00:07:25.550> or<00:07:25.760> the<00:07:25.910> plane<00:07:26.180> is

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.300 
planes then the narrow or the plane is

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.970 
planes then the narrow or the plane is
that's<00:07:26.450> gonna<00:07:26.570> be<00:07:26.720> in<00:07:26.780> focus<00:07:26.990> so<00:07:27.620> things<00:07:27.890> like

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:27.980 
that's gonna be in focus so things like

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.860 
that's gonna be in focus so things like
how<00:07:28.190> is<00:07:28.400> this<00:07:28.430> landscape<00:07:29.300> things<00:07:29.600> like<00:07:29.720> that

how is this landscape things like that

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.910 
how is this landscape things like that
you're<00:07:29.990> probably<00:07:30.020> gonna<00:07:30.320> want<00:07:30.530> to<00:07:30.590> shoot<00:07:30.800> it

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:30.920 
you're probably gonna want to shoot it

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.350 
you're probably gonna want to shoot it
at<00:07:31.010> least<00:07:31.250> f8<00:07:31.940> to<00:07:32.510> f-22<00:07:34.090> objects<00:07:35.090> you're<00:07:35.270> gonna

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
at least f8 to f-22 objects you're gonna

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.120 
at least f8 to f-22 objects you're gonna
have<00:07:35.570> a<00:07:35.600> little<00:07:35.930> more<00:07:36.200> latitude<00:07:36.620> with<00:07:36.950> that

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130 
have a little more latitude with that

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.980 
have a little more latitude with that
and<00:07:37.370> again<00:07:38.330> you're<00:07:38.420> gonna<00:07:38.510> be<00:07:38.660> able<00:07:38.720> to<00:07:38.840> have

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:38.990 
and again you're gonna be able to have

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.770 
and again you're gonna be able to have
more<00:07:39.760> less<00:07:40.760> light<00:07:41.060> you'll<00:07:41.270> be<00:07:41.390> able<00:07:41.450> to<00:07:41.570> shoot

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
more less light you'll be able to shoot

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.230 
more less light you'll be able to shoot
wider<00:07:42.470> open<00:07:42.920> you<00:07:43.280> can<00:07:43.430> learn<00:07:43.610> about<00:07:43.670> some<00:07:43.940> of

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 
wider open you can learn about some of

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.300 
wider open you can learn about some of
these<00:07:44.300> things<00:07:44.360> how<00:07:44.840> your<00:07:45.050> shutter<00:07:45.350> speed<00:07:45.440> cut

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.310 
these things how your shutter speed cut

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.150 
these things how your shutter speed cut
your<00:07:46.430> f-stop<00:07:46.610> and<00:07:47.300> how<00:07:47.840> your<00:07:48.020> ISO<00:07:48.530> all<00:07:48.770> relate

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.160 
your f-stop and how your ISO all relate

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.470 
your f-stop and how your ISO all relate
to<00:07:49.190> each<00:07:49.490> other<00:07:49.700> by<00:07:49.970> going<00:07:50.150> on<00:07:50.240> some<00:07:50.360> other

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:50.480 
to each other by going on some other

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.550 
to each other by going on some other
videos<00:07:50.780> if<00:07:50.930> you<00:07:51.020> don't<00:07:51.200> know<00:07:51.260> anything<00:07:51.470> about
