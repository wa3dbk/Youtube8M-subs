 Makeup does bad to the skin let's know

 everything is alright all about it 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.920
 For women, makeup is 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.410
 fundamental an aesthetic tool 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.149
 further enhancing female beauty is 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.559
 It is important to know that the makeup that has expired 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.500
 it's bad for your health 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.049
 so always follow the expiration of the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.700
 makeup and the act of checking the date 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.340
 of validity of makeup items 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.470
 unfortunately is not common is true 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.780
 according to the research 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.229
 Great Britain by college 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.240
 of alternative 39 women in a group 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.430
 of 10 make use of makeup 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 It's over, this is not in Brazil. 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.600
 different to the national agency 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.729
 sanitary surveillance measures the average of 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.890
 life of the product that is closed if 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.619
 summed up to 24 months two years 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 is the tip buy labels for 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.540
 put on your makeup with date 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.340
 Validity comes to you always check the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.090
 date of assessing the validity or 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.210
 big even for you that quote right is 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.329
 a classic involves the product of 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.430
 makeup is often printed on the 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.150
 delete this date from 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.000
 shelf life 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.890
 This is stupid of the manufacturer because 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.780
 it has expired you will do 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.939
 play outside and buy another be the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.560
 manufacturer will sell more 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.079
 I do not know why he puts that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.319
 expiration date door there anyone 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.459
 you see after the expiration date 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.579
 expired products become more 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.280
 bacterial fungi and even 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:18.769
 virus the herpes virus is the greatest risk 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.049
 to be transmitted by expired makeup 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.780
 so if it contains all this in makeup 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.939
 people do not share makeup is right 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.030
 the product after the expiry date 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.489
 may be toxic to the skin 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.040
 still fall into the bloodstream 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.799
 People I did not know, and you're not reading. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.900
 here and it really is not impressive 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.969
 I wear expired makeup the look all 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.519
 Boys, the deadline for 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.919
 Validity of makeup shadows blushes is 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.449
 from 18 to 24 months if this product changes 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:51.799
 leather look black 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:53.780
 ash can be fungi is right the lipstick 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.909
 It's two years, everybody 's two years old. 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.680
 way overdue product can leave 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.159
 dry lips cause blisters 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.189
 burns the river but the river does not 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.870
 Nothing 's going on for three to six months. 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.340
 color change shows that they 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.019
 they are worn 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.790
 according to the organ standard the date 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.620
 shall be printed on the packaging but 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.819
 many printed copies do not meet the 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.659
 by the next 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.609
 bottle and only display is by carton 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.189
 sealing everything else 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:25.329
 the use of items of makeup after 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:28.430
 loses risk of skin irritation 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.310
 considered to be serious and likely to 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.280
 interfere with proliferating bacteria and fungi 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.379
 after it's opened then it's really does 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.579
 products would be presented by the 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.319
 expiry date on the packaging 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.680
 easily identified when 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.199
 are on time 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.150
 so watch out for the ones that 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.370
 those products that are not there in the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.340
 validity that the product is never 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.780
 nobody knows if you 're right 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.049
 this period of the vacancy of the 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.000
 the bacteria that develop 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.620
 develops bad odor are responsible 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.479
 by the formation of colonies 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.389
 therefore it is practical to note that the 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.889
 makeup is no longer suitable for application 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.719
 cases of 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.669
 makeup within the validity but with the 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.539
 change in driver's consistency 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.780
 cosmetic 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:16.489
 the recommendation is to eliminate the throw away 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.760
 creams that have this change 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.010
 so be careful with that, right? 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.930
 bacterial people 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.600
 with the presentation of colony that's it 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.640
 will cause chipped poorly and then to 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.830
 caring people out is terrible that 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.690
 medicine that hurts the stomach and everything else 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.940
 because after developing colonies of 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.030
 fungi bacteria and everything else to 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.240
 happens if something so long 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.700
 date these things makes it tough and there 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.490
 It is heavy medication that is usually 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.710
 man then it's a disorder that nobody 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.690
 want to have and the care is not 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.000
 only the expiration date and commits more 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.680
 also a storage of these items is 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.340
 It is very common to keep the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.070
 bathroom 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.780
 this is not ideal because of the 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.610
 excess moisture temperature 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.220
 poor ventilation, contributing to 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.080
 prolific glorification of bacteria 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.270
 so if you have to save your 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.300
 make-up in the bathroom to 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.660
 habit because there is the worst place is there 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.160
 is by melting the temperature and 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.650
 everything else is the best place to store 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.720
 fresh local produce. 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.540
 trepidation as a drawer that opens and closes 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.690
 it's a certain place with little light heat 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.540
 intense is also ideal low light 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.640
