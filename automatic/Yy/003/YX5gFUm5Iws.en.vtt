 protect the dryness and leave there 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.920
 some 10 or 15 minutes just to be 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.690
 a little after the mass 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.190

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.670
 then way to go limp line is not 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.560

 but it does not open very thin because 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.860
 This mass is very delicate and will not 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.759
 be difficult for you to put into shape 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.759

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.470
