00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
to grid it you get your actual window

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.019 
to grid it you get your actual window
seven<00:00:25.769> disk<00:00:26.010> or<00:00:26.160> not<00:00:26.369> even<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.880> want

windows 8 when i say disk and dear yeah
it's<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.550> miles<00:00:29.730> better<00:00:29.910> building<00:00:30.240> your<00:00:30.390> own

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
it's just miles better building your own

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.150 
it's just miles better building your own
because<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.869> save<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.289> money<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.769> just

gaming<00:02:24.340> from<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.090> CAD<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.900> there<00:02:26.140> since<00:02:26.350> it

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
gaming from this CAD and there since it

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.260 
gaming from this CAD and there since it
only<00:02:26.680> ate<00:02:26.890> two<00:02:26.920> counts<00:02:27.340> put<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.640> back<00:02:27.820> it's<00:02:28.210> a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
only ate two counts put it back it's a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.830 
only ate two counts put it back it's a
pretty<00:02:28.480> big<00:02:28.630> bargain<00:02:29.020> if<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:29.980> ask<00:02:30.220> me<00:02:30.840> so

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
pretty big bargain if you ask me so

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.120 
pretty big bargain if you ask me so
moving<00:02:32.020> on<00:02:32.230> for<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.590> RAM<00:02:32.740> we're<00:02:32.890> going<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.070> be

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
moving on for the RAM we're going to be

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.270 
moving on for the RAM we're going to be
getting<00:02:33.220> some<00:02:33.460> costly<00:02:33.820> XMS<00:02:34.750> free<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:36.160> is

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
getting some costly XMS free this is

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.950 
getting some costly XMS free this is
going<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.490> be<00:02:36.550> four<00:02:36.880> gigabytes<00:02:37.240> yeah<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.780> think

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
going to be four gigabytes yeah I think

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.630 
going to be four gigabytes yeah I think
vogel<00:02:38.530> race<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.830> what<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.070> need<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.250> think<00:02:39.340> two

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
vogel race is what you need I think two

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.730 
vogel race is what you need I think two
gigs<00:02:39.880> just<00:02:40.180> seriously<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.080> lose<00:02:41.260> ridiculous

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
gigs just seriously to lose ridiculous

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.650 
gigs just seriously to lose ridiculous
so<00:02:42.160> we're<00:02:42.250> gonna<00:02:42.340> get<00:02:42.520> in<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.850> two<00:02:43.180> gigabyte

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
so we're gonna get in to two gigabyte

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.000 
so we're gonna get in to two gigabyte
sticks<00:02:43.990> of<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.370> ddr3<00:02:45.750> memory<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:47.140> 1333

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
sticks of this ddr3 memory it's 1333

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.100 
sticks of this ddr3 memory it's 1333
megahertz<00:02:48.460> not<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.210> fastest<00:02:49.600> ever<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:49.990> it's

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
megahertz not the fastest ever but it's

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.140 
megahertz not the fastest ever but it's
a<00:02:50.170> it's<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.190> dual<00:02:51.430> channel<00:02:51.700> kit<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.120> you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
a it's like a dual channel kit so you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.220 
a it's like a dual channel kit so you
can<00:02:52.300> put<00:02:52.450> both<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.660> them<00:02:52.900> into<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
can put both of them into the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.930 
can put both of them into the
motherboard<00:02:53.410> home<00:02:53.740> run<00:02:54.280> nice<00:02:54.490> and<00:02:54.700> fast

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
motherboard home run nice and fast

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.590 
motherboard home run nice and fast
Castle<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:55.960> see<00:02:56.110> on<00:02:56.230> this<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.530> 9<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.600> yeah

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
Castle it and see on this is 9 and yeah

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.660 
Castle it and see on this is 9 and yeah
1.5<00:02:59.170> volts<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.650> you<00:03:00.250> actually<00:03:00.400> get<00:03:00.640> a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
1.5 volts and you actually get a

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.370 
1.5 volts and you actually get a
lifetime<00:03:00.910> warranty<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.510> course<00:03:01.870> they're<00:03:02.080> also

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
lifetime warranty of course they're also

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.410 
lifetime warranty of course they're also
pretty<00:03:02.680> good<00:03:02.890> with<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.340> yeah<00:03:04.150> they<00:03:04.300> do

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
pretty good with that and yeah they do

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.960 
pretty good with that and yeah they do
make<00:03:04.600> some<00:03:04.840> nice<00:03:05.050> ramp<00:03:05.830> talking<00:03:06.760> about

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
make some nice ramp talking about

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.400 
make some nice ramp talking about
