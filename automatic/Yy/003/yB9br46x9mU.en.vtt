Franklin<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.280> whatever<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.670> got<00:01:58.610> because<00:01:59.610> later

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
Franklin or whatever I got because later

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.710 
Franklin or whatever I got because later
on<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> season<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:02.960> will<00:02:03.960> let<00:02:04.969> females<00:02:05.969> go

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.490 

this<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> female<00:02:11.480> but<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.989> gives<00:02:13.230> me<00:02:13.380> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
this is not a female but it gives me the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.760 
this is not a female but it gives me the
opportunity<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:15.020> making<00:02:16.020> certain<00:02:16.500> that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
opportunity of making certain that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.820 
opportunity of making certain that
they're<00:02:16.950> not<00:02:17.099> injured<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:19.260> gives<00:02:19.470> me<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
they're not injured and gives me the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.530 
they're not injured and gives me the
opportunity<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.640> release<00:02:21.030> them

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
opportunity to release them

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.880 
opportunity to release them
so<00:02:21.870> another<00:02:22.620> set<00:02:22.950> up<00:02:23.099> another<00:02:23.370> good<00:02:23.610> location

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
so another set up another good location

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.780 
so another set up another good location
look<00:02:25.890> for<00:02:26.160> large<00:02:28.069> objects<00:02:29.069> particularly

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
look for large objects particularly

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.690 
look for large objects particularly
windblown<00:02:30.510> trees<00:02:30.569> are<00:02:31.050> uprooted<00:02:31.290> trees<00:02:31.769> and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
windblown trees are uprooted trees and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.250 
windblown trees are uprooted trees and
that's<00:02:33.030> where<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.360> want<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.660> focus<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.230> and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that's where you want to focus it and

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.009 
that's where you want to focus it and
then<00:02:34.590> come<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.370> multi-purpose<00:02:36.030> dirt<00:02:36.239> hole<00:02:36.480> set

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
then come in multi-purpose dirt hole set

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.340 
then come in multi-purpose dirt hole set
it<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> piece<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.500> muskrat<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.510> more<00:02:40.260> to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
it with a piece of muskrat so more to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.530 
it with a piece of muskrat so more to
come
