new card after they play one and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.720 
new card after they play one and
eventually<00:02:01.920> somebody's<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.430> break<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
eventually somebody's going to break the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.340 
eventually somebody's going to break the
camel's<00:02:02.910> back<00:02:03.240> they're<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.140> score

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
camel's back they're not going to score

camel's back they're not going to score
any<00:02:04.500> points<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.950> everyone<00:02:05.250> else<00:02:05.430> will<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.740> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
any points and everyone else will so the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.730 
any points and everyone else will so the
weight<00:02:07.890> limit<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.369> always<00:02:08.640> 50<00:02:09.290> that's<00:02:10.290> just<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
weight limit is always 50 that's just a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.380 
weight limit is always 50 that's just a
reminder<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> middle<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.120> play<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
reminder in the middle so you play a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.860 
reminder in the middle so you play a
card<00:02:12.720> we've<00:02:13.080> got<00:02:13.320> a<00:02:13.560> six<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.610> say<00:02:14.910> six<00:02:15.300> I'll

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
card we've got a six so I say six I'll

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.860 
card we've got a six so I say six I'll
draw<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.110> card<00:02:16.440> next<00:02:17.250> player<00:02:17.430> goes<00:02:17.730> they<00:02:18.420> put<00:02:18.690> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
draw a card next player goes they put a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.690 
draw a card next player goes they put a
three<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.530> negative<00:02:19.710> three<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.520> now<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
three and negative three so now the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.030 
three and negative three so now the
current<00:02:21.270> weights<00:02:21.420> three<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:22.830> keep

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
current weights three and you just keep

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.600 
current weights three and you just keep
going<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.670> five<00:02:23.850> six<00:02:24.120> seven<00:02:24.450> eight<00:02:25.610> seven

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
going so five six seven eight seven

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280 
going so five six seven eight seven
obviously<00:02:27.180> players<00:02:27.510> wouldn't<00:02:27.780> play<00:02:28.050> them<00:02:28.200> in

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
obviously players wouldn't play them in

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.200 
obviously players wouldn't play them in
this<00:02:28.380> order<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.340> gonna<00:02:29.490> ramp<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:29.970> pretty

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
this order but it's gonna ramp up pretty

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.300 
this order but it's gonna ramp up pretty
quickly<00:02:30.510> usually<00:02:31.050> get<00:02:31.530> up<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.830> maybe<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.160> mid

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
quickly usually get up to maybe the mid

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.060 
quickly usually get up to maybe the mid
40s<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.060> then<00:02:33.180> somebody<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.200> going<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.830> have

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
40s and then somebody is going to have

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.350 
40s and then somebody is going to have
to<00:02:35.250> play<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.459> card<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:35.910> going<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> break<00:02:36.240> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
to play a card that's going to break the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.390 
to play a card that's going to break the
camel's<00:02:36.570> back<00:02:36.840> taking<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.530> 51<00:02:38.040> or<00:02:38.160> higher

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
camel's back taking it to 51 or higher

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.820 
camel's back taking it to 51 or higher
at<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.390> point<00:02:39.660> everyone<00:02:40.050> else<00:02:40.380> will<00:02:40.620> score

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
at that point everyone else will score

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.100 
at that point everyone else will score
points<00:02:41.250> their<00:02:41.430> hand<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.540> case<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.989> would

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
points their hand in this case you would

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.140 
points their hand in this case you would
get<00:02:43.350> 10<00:02:44.040> 13<00:02:45.030> 14<00:02:45.450> 18<00:02:46.320> points<00:02:46.860> now<00:02:47.550> let's<00:02:47.940> say<00:02:48.090> you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
get 10 13 14 18 points now let's say you

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.790 
get 10 13 14 18 points now let's say you
actually<00:02:48.390> had<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> negative<00:02:49.200> card<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.709> your

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
actually had a negative card in your

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.300 
actually had a negative card in your
hand<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.280> does<00:02:51.080> impact<00:02:52.080> your<00:02:52.560> score<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.220> in

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
hand that does impact your score so in

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.729 
hand that does impact your score so in
this<00:02:53.400> case<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.790> would<00:02:53.850> have<00:02:54.000> 15<00:02:54.239> minus<00:02:55.230> 3<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
this case you would have 15 minus 3 and

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.610 
this case you would have 15 minus 3 and
only<00:02:55.830> scored<00:02:56.220> 12<00:02:56.489> points<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.930> idea<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.500> you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
only scored 12 points the idea is you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.990 
only scored 12 points the idea is you
want<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.860> balance<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.310> cards<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.820> have

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
want to balance the cards that you have

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.270 
want to balance the cards that you have
in<00:03:00.150> your<00:03:00.239> hand<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.810> not<00:03:01.320> always<00:03:01.530> keep<00:03:01.950> all<00:03:02.130> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
in your hand and not always keep all the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.160 
in your hand and not always keep all the
large<00:03:02.520> ones<00:03:02.880> because<00:03:03.330> what<00:03:03.540> if<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.780> gets<00:03:03.900> too

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
large ones because what if it gets too

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.990 
large ones because what if it gets too
close<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.590> 50<00:03:05.040> then<00:03:05.430> you're<00:03:05.550> gonna<00:03:05.670> break<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
close to 50 then you're gonna break the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
close to 50 then you're gonna break the
camel's<00:03:06.330> back<00:03:06.510> cause<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.110> all<00:03:07.230> large

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
camel's back cause you have all large

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.199 
camel's back cause you have all large
cards<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.220> somebody<00:03:08.459> passed<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.120> at

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
cards and somebody passed it to you at

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.080 
cards and somebody passed it to you at
like<00:03:09.330> 47<00:03:10.110> or<00:03:10.230> something<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:11.640> let's<00:03:11.880> take<00:03:12.060> a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
like 47 or something so let's take a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.280 
like 47 or something so let's take a
look<00:03:12.239> some<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.540> special<00:03:12.900> cards<00:03:13.140> real

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
look some of the special cards real

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.410 
look some of the special cards real
quick

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
quick

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.540 
quick
there's<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.690> Aladdin's<00:03:16.680> lamp<00:03:16.739> when<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.310> play

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
there's the Aladdin's lamp when you play

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.100 
there's the Aladdin's lamp when you play
this<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.880> get<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.060> pick<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> number<00:03:18.450> up<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.780> ten

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
this you get to pick a number up to ten

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.920 
this you get to pick a number up to ten
one<00:03:19.770> through<00:03:19.980> ten<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:21.150> if<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.480> was<00:03:21.720> at

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
one through ten so if this was at

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.260 
one through ten so if this was at
fifteen<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.860> can<00:03:23.010> say<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.459> gonna<00:03:23.580> add<00:03:23.820> five

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
fifteen you can say I'm gonna add five

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.590 
fifteen you can say I'm gonna add five
so<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.200> twenty<00:03:25.709> there's<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.430> copy<00:03:26.820> copy

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
so it's that twenty there's a copy copy

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.690 
so it's that twenty there's a copy copy
will<00:03:27.900> copy<00:03:28.140> whatever<00:03:28.560> number<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.580> it

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
will copy whatever number is that it

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.060 
will copy whatever number is that it
just<00:03:29.880> landed<00:03:30.209> on<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:30.690> if<00:03:30.900> there<00:03:31.380> was<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.530> three

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
just landed on so if there was a three

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.400 
just landed on so if there was a three
it's<00:03:32.550> gonna<00:03:32.730> copy<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.330> three<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.870> make<00:03:34.290> the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
it's gonna copy that three and make the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
point scoring cards but this does get

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.390

you<00:03:51.600> out<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.810> trouble<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.620> reverse<00:03:52.980> plays

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
you out of trouble so the reverse plays

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.090 
you out of trouble so the reverse plays
it's<00:03:53.700> your<00:03:53.910> card<00:03:54.150> for<00:03:54.300> your<00:03:54.390> turn<00:03:54.660> but<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.900> also

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
it's your card for your turn but it also

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.800 
it's your card for your turn but it also
changes<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.160> direction<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.670> play<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.270> then

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
changes the direction of play and then

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.260 
changes the direction of play and then

winner
now<00:04:34.140> there's<00:04:34.380> also<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.710> think<00:04:35.010> older<00:04:35.250> printings

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
now there's also I think older printings

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.670 
now there's also I think older printings
of<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.820> game<00:04:36.000> where<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.720> play<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.380> point

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
of the game where you play to a point

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.560 
of the game where you play to a point
limit<00:04:37.980> so<00:04:38.160> let's<00:04:38.340> say<00:04:38.490> four<00:04:38.790> hundred<00:04:38.820> points

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
limit so let's say four hundred points

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.970 
limit so let's say four hundred points
or<00:04:39.690> something<00:04:39.900> like<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.500> then<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:40.950> just

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
or something like that and then you just

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.830 
or something like that and then you just
keep<00:04:41.340> playing<00:04:41.610> rounds<00:04:42.120> until<00:04:42.270> somebody<00:04:42.660> gets

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
keep playing rounds until somebody gets

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.020 
keep playing rounds until somebody gets
the<00:04:43.050> score<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.710> that's<00:04:44.460> pretty<00:04:44.730> much<00:04:44.850> how

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
the score and that's pretty much how

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.080 
the score and that's pretty much how
balls<00:04:45.690> played<00:04:45.960> and<00:04:46.669> there<00:04:47.669> you<00:04:47.760> go<00:04:47.910> that's

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
balls played and there you go that's

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.360 
balls played and there you go that's

because<00:05:10.680> it's<00:05:10.830> constant<00:05:11.310> your<00:05:11.400> turn<00:05:11.700> and

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
because it's constant your turn and

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.580 
because it's constant your turn and
you're<00:05:12.030> trying<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.300> cycle<00:05:12.840> cards<00:05:13.260> out<00:05:13.410> and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
you're trying to cycle cards out and

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.740 
you're trying to cycle cards out and
have<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:13.890> right<00:05:14.160> combination<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:14.880> cards<00:05:15.360> to

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
have that right combination of cards to

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.770 
have that right combination of cards to
be<00:05:15.930> safe<00:05:16.320> be<00:05:17.160> able<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.640> put<00:05:18.000> other<00:05:18.240> players<00:05:18.540> in

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
be safe be able to put other players in

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.320 
be safe be able to put other players in
danger<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:20.460> score<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.820> max<00:05:21.000> amount<00:05:21.210> of

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
danger and to score the max amount of

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.670 
danger and to score the max amount of
points<00:05:21.570> because<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:21.990> don't<00:05:22.260> want<00:05:22.410> a<00:05:22.470> ton<00:05:22.500> of

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
points because you don't want a ton of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.010 
points because you don't want a ton of
good<00:05:23.040> cards<00:05:23.490> or<00:05:23.669> high<00:05:24.030> cards<00:05:24.540> because<00:05:24.870> it's

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
good cards or high cards because it's

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.170 
good cards or high cards because it's
not<00:05:25.140> gonna<00:05:25.290> do<00:05:25.440> anything<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:26.160> when<00:05:26.790> it

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
not gonna do anything to you when it

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.030 
not gonna do anything to you when it
gets<00:05:27.240> back<00:05:27.479> to<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:27.720> now<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:28.229> a<00:05:28.530> six<00:05:28.800> player

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
gets back to you now in a six player

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.909 
gets back to you now in a six player
game<00:05:29.280> maybe<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.729> five<00:05:30.030> player<00:05:30.330> game<00:05:30.600> it<00:05:31.590> comes

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
game maybe a five player game it comes

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.159 
game maybe a five player game it comes
around<00:05:32.040> to<00:05:32.310> your<00:05:32.490> turn<00:05:32.729> less<00:05:33.120> so<00:05:33.600> that<00:05:33.960> those

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
around to your turn less so that those

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.840 
around to your turn less so that those
tactical<00:05:34.710> decisions<00:05:35.130> aren't<00:05:35.340> there<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.610> mean

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
tactical decisions aren't there I mean

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.969 
tactical decisions aren't there I mean
you<00:05:36.030> basically<00:05:36.600> have<00:05:37.350> some<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.800> same

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
you basically have some of the same

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.010 
you basically have some of the same
cards<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:38.430> started<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:39.000> game<00:05:39.180> with<00:05:39.240> usually

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
cards you started the game with usually

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.080 
cards you started the game with usually
so<00:05:40.290> I<00:05:40.500> like<00:05:41.100> it<00:05:41.250> better<00:05:41.370> with<00:05:41.520> lower<00:05:41.700> amount<00:05:42.030> of

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
so I like it better with lower amount of

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.640 
so I like it better with lower amount of
players<00:05:42.330> even<00:05:42.660> though<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:42.960> is<00:05:43.080> kind<00:05:43.290> of<00:05:43.410> fun

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
players even though it is kind of fun

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.590 
players even though it is kind of fun
and<00:05:43.890> light<00:05:44.100> with<00:05:44.400> with<00:05:44.850> higher<00:05:45.240> amount<00:05:45.510> of

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
and light with with higher amount of

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.010 
and light with with higher amount of
players<00:05:45.870> so<00:05:46.460> it's<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.580> great<00:05:47.760> game<00:05:47.940> I<00:05:48.020> totally

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
the there in the previous versions like

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.890 
the there in the previous versions like
I<00:06:12.139> said<00:06:12.349> in<00:06:12.529> the<00:06:12.860> overview<00:06:13.159> there's<00:06:13.849> a<00:06:13.969> scoring

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
I said in the overview there's a scoring

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.689 
I said in the overview there's a scoring
net<00:06:15.080> that<00:06:15.199> you<00:06:15.259> can<00:06:15.529> do<00:06:15.650> instead<00:06:16.129> I<00:06:16.189> think<00:06:16.550> that

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
net that you can do instead I think that

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.179 
net that you can do instead I think that
kind<00:06:16.909> of<00:06:16.999> works<00:06:17.240> I<00:06:17.509> mean<00:06:18.169> I<00:06:18.259> kind<00:06:18.860> of<00:06:18.889> like<00:06:19.009> both

ways I think maybe the points is cool
but<00:06:22.610> just<00:06:23.120> playing<00:06:23.419> for<00:06:23.719> each<00:06:23.840> player<00:06:24.139> to<00:06:24.319> be
