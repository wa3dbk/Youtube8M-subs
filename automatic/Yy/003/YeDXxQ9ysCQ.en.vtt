tire<00:00:21.760> cutter<00:00:22.090> for<00:00:22.600> making<00:00:22.660> our<00:00:23.020> playgrounds

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
tire cutter for making our playgrounds

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.820 
tire cutter for making our playgrounds
this<00:00:24.460> is<00:00:24.640> prototype<00:00:25.090> to<00:00:25.300> have<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:25.990> cut<00:00:26.230> often

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
this is prototype to have to cut often

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.359 
this is prototype to have to cut often
hundreds<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.340> car<00:00:27.490> tires<00:00:27.869> every<00:00:29.369> playground

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
hundreds of car tires every playground

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.180 
hundreds of car tires every playground
that<00:00:30.490> we<00:00:30.580> do

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 

and<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:35.940> we're<00:00:36.090> trying<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.330> work<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.750> how<00:00:37.170> to

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
and so we're trying to work out how to

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.090 
and so we're trying to work out how to
cut<00:00:37.530> car<00:00:37.800> tires<00:00:38.180> more<00:00:39.180> easily<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:42.890> we've<00:00:43.890> got<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
cut car tires more easily so we've got a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
cut car tires more easily so we've got a
Stanley<00:00:44.670> knife<00:00:44.700> blade<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.810> currently

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
Stanley knife blade which is currently

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.600 
Stanley knife blade which is currently
in<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.410> tanner<00:00:46.650> what<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.950> may<00:00:47.100> make<00:00:47.310> it<00:00:47.490> without

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in a tanner what we may make it without

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.810 
in a tanner what we may make it without
that<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:49.350> idea<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:50.220> that<00:00:50.250> we'd<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.640> able<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that the idea is that we'd be able to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.010 
that the idea is that we'd be able to
cut<00:00:51.410> car<00:00:52.410> truck<00:00:52.830> tires<00:00:53.510> using<00:00:54.510> very<00:00:54.750> simple

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
cut car truck tires using very simple

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.690 
cut car truck tires using very simple

again<00:01:17.970> through<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.540> working<00:01:22.250> it's<00:01:23.250> good<00:01:23.400> cut

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
again through it's working it's good cut

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.670 
again through it's working it's good cut
like<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.060> quality<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.479> good<00:01:24.660> nice<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.320> clean

soft<00:01:26.600> smooth<00:01:29.479> that's<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.660> first<00:01:30.869> tire<00:01:31.080> ever

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
soft smooth that's the first tire ever

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.550 
soft smooth that's the first tire ever
well<00:01:32.040> done<00:01:32.220> Margaux

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.240 

what<00:01:38.560> are<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.710> problems<00:01:39.010> that<00:01:39.100> we're<00:01:39.220> having

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
what are the problems that we're having

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.910 
what are the problems that we're having
right<00:01:39.490> now<00:01:42.450> getting<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.870> cut<00:01:44.080> I<00:01:44.350> guess<00:01:44.710> on<00:01:44.890> a

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
right now getting it to cut I guess on a

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.280 
right now getting it to cut I guess on a
consistent<00:01:45.220> line<00:01:45.550> I'm<00:01:45.840> angle<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.050> tire<00:01:47.260> I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
consistent line I'm angle the tire I

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.350 
consistent line I'm angle the tire I
think<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:47.890> dragging<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:48.400> blade<00:01:48.700> all<00:01:49.000> around

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
think is dragging the blade all around

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.250 
think is dragging the blade all around
as<00:01:49.720> if<00:01:50.130> yeah<00:01:51.130> yeah<00:01:52.120> so<00:01:52.810> when<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:53.020> say<00:01:53.140> the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
as if yeah yeah so when you say the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.930 
as if yeah yeah so when you say the
angle<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.620> blade<00:01:53.860> we've<00:01:54.550> got<00:01:54.730> this<00:01:54.820> little

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
angle of the blade we've got this little

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.940 
angle of the blade we've got this little
handle<00:01:55.450> which<00:01:55.960> were<00:01:56.080> using<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.470> tweak<00:01:56.740> the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
handle which were using to tweak the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.040 
handle which were using to tweak the
angle<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.270> can<00:01:58.390> see<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.630> body<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.900> the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
angle so and you can see the body of the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.530 
angle so and you can see the body of the
blade<00:01:59.260> moving<00:01:59.590> there<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:01.030> even<00:02:01.270> without<00:02:01.360> that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
blade moving there but even without that

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.700 
blade moving there but even without that
the<00:02:02.140> blade<00:02:02.380> seems<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:03.250> want<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.060> kind<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.710> need

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
the blade seems to want to kind of need

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.010 
the blade seems to want to kind of need
to<00:02:05.800> go<00:02:05.950> inside<00:02:06.430> or<00:02:06.490> outside<00:02:06.700> yeah<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:07.840> also

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
to go inside or outside yeah and also

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.850 
to go inside or outside yeah and also
yet<00:02:08.730> bending<00:02:11.790> twisting<00:02:12.790> yeah<00:02:13.680> we're<00:02:14.680> getting

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
yet bending twisting yeah we're getting

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.170 
yet bending twisting yeah we're getting
there<00:02:14.950> we're<00:02:15.160> getting<00:02:15.370> there

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
there we're getting there

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.160 
there we're getting there
