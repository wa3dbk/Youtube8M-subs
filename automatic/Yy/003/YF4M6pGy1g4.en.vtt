inside the fortress proper let's proceed

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.980 
inside the fortress proper let's proceed
with<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.510> infiltration<00:00:11.300> by<00:00:12.300> going<00:00:12.599> up<00:00:12.750> left

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
with the infiltration by going up left

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.140 
with the infiltration by going up left
here<00:00:13.320> now<00:00:13.860> something<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.670> might<00:00:14.849> not

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
here now something that you might not

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.070 
here now something that you might not
it's<00:00:15.450> good<00:00:15.660> idea<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.080> protect<00:00:16.440> your<00:00:16.590> head<00:00:16.800> here

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
it's good idea to protect your head here

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.290 
it's good idea to protect your head here
like<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.369> going<00:00:20.369> up<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> right<00:00:20.820> side<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
like so going up the right side is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
like so going up the right side is
usually<00:00:21.779> far<00:00:22.020> easier<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.980> press<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
usually far easier because the press is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.429 
usually far easier because the press is
absolutely<00:00:23.939> no<00:00:24.090> problem<00:00:24.480> at<00:00:24.600> all<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.410> I

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
absolutely no problem at all but I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.960 
absolutely no problem at all but I
wanted<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> give<00:00:25.920> fair<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> shuttle<00:00:26.640> bit<00:00:26.789> more

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
wanted to give fair a shuttle bit more

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.970 
wanted to give fair a shuttle bit more
time<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.210> shine<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.260> amazing<00:00:28.560> i<00:00:28.920> do

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
time to shine it's really amazing i do

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.160 
time to shine it's really amazing i do
not<00:00:29.189> use<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.550> too<00:00:29.760> often<00:00:30.000> though<00:00:30.300> because<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
not use it too often though because the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
not use it too often though because the
prefer<00:00:31.500> weapons<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.040> bit<00:00:32.189> more<00:00:32.309> variety<00:00:32.550> but

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
they amended her rushed at segment and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
they amended her rushed at segment and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.639 
it shows off just how badly rush jet has
been<00:00:53.520> nerved<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.360> will<00:00:54.629> always<00:00:54.989> throw<00:00:55.140> forward

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
been nerved it will always throw forward

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.959 
been nerved it will always throw forward
at<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> set<00:00:56.070> speed<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.789> no<00:00:56.940> longer

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
at a set speed and it will no longer

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.990 
at a set speed and it will no longer
follow<00:00:57.420> mega<00:00:57.780> wherever<00:00:58.140> he<00:00:58.320> goes<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.850> only

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
follow mega wherever he goes so the only

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.910 
follow mega wherever he goes so the only
thing<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.899> adjust<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.379> upwards

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
thing you can do is adjust it upwards

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
thing you can do is adjust it upwards
and<00:01:02.039> downwards<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.789> by<00:01:02.940> go<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.539> jump

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and downwards and by go to do not jump

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.509 
and downwards and by go to do not jump
because<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.379> will<00:01:04.530> travel<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.010> boards<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.489> you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
because it will travel on boards and you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.550 
because it will travel on boards and you
will<00:01:05.700> follow<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.180> spikes<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.409> this

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
will follow to the spikes not that this

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.140 
will follow to the spikes not that this
would<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.979> happened<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> mean<00:01:08.640> an<00:01:08.850> early

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
would have happened to mean an early

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.230 
would have happened to mean an early
attempt<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.720> anything<00:01:10.400> it's<00:01:11.400> still<00:01:11.700> ok<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
attempt or anything it's still ok to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.280 
attempt or anything it's still ok to
just<00:01:13.369> to<00:01:14.369> skip<00:01:14.640> those<00:01:14.820> platforms<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.720> it's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
just to skip those platforms but it's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.109 
just to skip those platforms but it's
really<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.680> too<00:01:16.740> bad<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:17.700> jump<00:01:17.970> in

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
really not too bad if you don't jump in

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.630 
really not too bad if you don't jump in
the<00:01:18.330> spikes<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.750> an<00:01:18.960> idiot<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.460> look

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640

me and are really bad at timing your

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.280 
me and are really bad at timing your
chums<00:03:52.319> correctly<00:03:53.329> yeah<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.870> good<00:03:55.049> thing

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
chums correctly yeah the good thing

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.599 
chums correctly yeah the good thing
about<00:03:55.319> it<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:56.099> cannot<00:03:56.370> actually

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
about it is that it cannot actually

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.539 
about it is that it cannot actually
crush<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.239> even<00:03:57.480> if<00:03:57.569> it<00:03:57.660> attempts<00:03:58.199> to<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:59.280> will

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
crush you even if it attempts to it will

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.550 
crush you even if it attempts to it will
deal<00:03:59.760> damage<00:04:00.000> but<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.660> won't<00:04:00.900> be<00:04:01.109> an<00:04:01.169> instant

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
deal damage but it won't be an instant

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.559 
deal damage but it won't be an instant
kill<00:04:01.769> fortunately<00:04:02.609> enough<00:04:02.669> it<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.359> also

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
kill fortunately enough it is also

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.270 
kill fortunately enough it is also
somewhat<00:04:03.959> fun<00:04:04.139> to<00:04:04.260> play<00:04:04.470> around<00:04:04.620> with<00:04:04.980> in<00:04:05.160> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
somewhat fun to play around with in the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.069 
somewhat fun to play around with in the
meantime<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:06.000> doesn't<00:04:06.329> make<00:04:06.389> it<00:04:06.540> too<00:04:06.780> tedious

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
meantime it doesn't make it too tedious

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.830 
meantime it doesn't make it too tedious
but<00:04:07.470> still<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:08.579> somewhat<00:04:09.090> flawed<00:04:09.299> concept<00:04:09.510> in

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
but still a somewhat flawed concept in

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.449 
but still a somewhat flawed concept in
my<00:04:09.930> opinion<00:04:10.230> not<00:04:10.440> nearly<00:04:10.680> as<00:04:10.829> bad<00:04:11.099> as<00:04:11.280> any

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
my opinion not nearly as bad as any

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.920 
my opinion not nearly as bad as any
other<00:04:11.760> things<00:04:12.329> though

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
other things though

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.219 
other things though
that's<00:04:14.799> done<00:04:15.040> with<00:04:15.219> just<00:04:16.209> crusher<00:04:16.570> obviously

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
that's done with just crusher obviously

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:31.969 
that's done with just crusher obviously
its<00:04:17.320> weakness<00:04:17.680> really<00:04:18.250> good<00:04:18.400> against<00:04:18.759> it

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.360 

and<00:04:32.979> so<00:04:33.460> we<00:04:33.610> go<00:04:33.759> up<00:04:33.790> just<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.930> bit<00:04:35.020> further<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.680> a

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
and so we go up just a bit further to a

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.300 
and so we go up just a bit further to a
tower<00:04:36.940> of<00:04:37.090> sorts<00:04:38.220> all<00:04:39.449> rather<00:04:40.449> outside<00:04:41.310> you'll

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
tower of sorts all rather outside you'll

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.189 
tower of sorts all rather outside you'll
see<00:04:42.550> what<00:04:42.699> it<00:04:42.820> holds<00:04:42.940> for<00:04:43.270> us<00:04:43.300> next<00:04:43.720> time<00:04:43.960> for

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
see what it holds for us next time for

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.140
