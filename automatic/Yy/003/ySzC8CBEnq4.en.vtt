00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.060 
the southern portion of Frost's core
sound<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.240> big<00:01:45.509> large<00:01:45.840> area<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.290> I've

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
sound this big large area here I've

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
sound this big large area here I've
never<00:01:47.579> heard<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> spawning<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
never heard of it spawning there and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.420 
never heard of it spawning there and
people<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.200> said<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.619> never<00:01:49.829> spawn<00:01:50.220> there

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
people have said it's never spawn there

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.819 
people have said it's never spawn there
before<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.659> pretty<00:01:51.899> sure<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> only<00:01:52.500> spawns

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
before so I'm pretty sure it only spawns

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.580 
before so I'm pretty sure it only spawns
in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> northern<00:01:53.990> portion<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> frost<00:01:55.350> Gorge

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
in the northern portion of frost Gorge

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.459 
in the northern portion of frost Gorge
sound<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.850> much<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.299> area<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:58.079> which

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
sound pretty much this area here which

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.230 
sound pretty much this area here which
is<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.710> higher-level<00:01:59.219> portion<00:02:00.030> which<00:02:00.210> is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
is the higher-level portion which is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.880 
is the higher-level portion which is
probably<00:02:00.630> why<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.810> doesn't<00:02:01.079> spawn<00:02:01.350> down<00:02:01.590> south

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
probably why it doesn't spawn down south

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.359 
probably why it doesn't spawn down south
now<00:02:02.520> we'll<00:02:02.700> take<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.909> look<00:02:03.119> at<00:02:03.210> malkor<00:02:03.659> sleep

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
now we'll take a look at malkor sleep

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
now we'll take a look at malkor sleep
let's<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:05.610> once<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.000> map<00:02:06.180> gets<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.570> Blair<00:02:07.079> II

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
let's see once the map gets on Blair II

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.330 
let's see once the map gets on Blair II
come<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.710> map

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.800 

so<00:02:11.340> we'll<00:02:11.790> take<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> look<00:02:12.120> at<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.330> blurry<00:02:12.569> map

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so we'll take a look at the blurry map

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.250 
so we'll take a look at the blurry map
here's<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.379> jumping<00:02:14.340> puzzle<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:15.050> or<00:02:16.050> each

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
jump and puzzle area you can reach it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.830 
jump and puzzle area you can reach it
from<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.250> area<00:02:20.640> there's<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.480> bridge<00:02:21.690> you

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
from this area there's the bridge you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.930 
from this area there's the bridge you
can<00:02:21.989> reach<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.440> right<00:02:22.650> there<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.099> also

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
can reach it like right there and also

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.089 
can reach it like right there and also
if<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.390> jump<00:02:24.660> off<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.110> here<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.379> land<00:02:25.739> here

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.620 
if you jump off of here and land here
you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.400> kind<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.730> maneuver<00:02:27.060> your<00:02:27.239> way<00:02:27.300> down

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
you can kind of maneuver your way down

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.900 
you can kind of maneuver your way down
there<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.019> get<00:02:28.590> into<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:28.950> big<00:02:29.190> area<00:02:29.489> here

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
I've also seen over each outcome spawn

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.410 
I've also seen over each outcome spawn
where<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:41.069> little<00:02:41.340> right<00:02:41.819> up<00:02:41.970> here<00:02:42.299> is

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
where is it a little right up here is

where is it a little right up here is
another<00:02:42.930> common<00:02:43.380> location<00:02:43.860> for<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.250> I'll

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
another common location for it and I'll
