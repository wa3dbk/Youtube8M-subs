this<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.369> quieter<00:00:26.789> cab<00:00:27.000> we've<00:00:27.689> moved<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
this a quieter cab we've moved a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.689 
this a quieter cab we've moved a
hydraulic<00:00:28.439> pump<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:29.220> top<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
hydraulic pump from on top of the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.370 
hydraulic pump from on top of the
transmission<00:00:30.179> which<00:00:30.720> meant<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> was<00:00:31.140> right

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
transmission which meant it was right

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.990 
transmission which meant it was right
under<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.740> cab<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.130> previous<00:00:32.579> tractor

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
under the cab on the previous tractor

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.360 
under the cab on the previous tractor
and<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.570> moved<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> over<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.380> side<00:00:34.680> so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and we moved it over on the side so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
and we moved it over on the side so
hydraulic<00:00:35.969> pumps<00:00:36.300> always<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> little

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
hydraulic pumps always have a little

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.750 
hydraulic pumps always have a little
buzzing<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.399> their<00:00:38.550> noises

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
buzzing and they have their noises

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.510 
buzzing and they have their noises
that's<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:39.899> they<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:41.010> down<00:00:41.250> over

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
that's what they do so it's down over

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.280 
that's what they do so it's down over
here<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> side<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.719> noise<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.200> go

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
here on the side and the noise can go

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.560 
here on the side and the noise can go
down<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.680> ground<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.579> helped<00:00:45.420> us

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
down to the ground so that helped us

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.470 
down to the ground so that helped us
lower<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.020> DBA<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> cab<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.300> very

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
lower the DBA in the cab so it's very

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.170 
lower the DBA in the cab so it's very
comfortable<00:00:48.870> very<00:00:49.170> roommate<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.760> whole<00:00:50.910> side

all<00:01:46.150> by<00:01:47.150> itself<00:01:47.479> for<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.320> basically<00:01:48.800> no

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
all by itself for you so basically no

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.400 
all by itself for you so basically no
operator<00:01:49.430> input<00:01:49.820> required<00:01:50.210> once<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.200> set<00:01:51.380> it

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
operator input required once you set it

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.020 
operator input required once you set it
up<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.650> it'll<00:01:52.010> shift<00:01:52.280> down<00:01:52.490> at<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.729> end<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.940> a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
up you it'll shift down at the end of a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.600 
up you it'll shift down at the end of a
row<00:01:53.240> make<00:01:54.140> your<00:01:54.290> turn<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.190> you<00:01:55.220> drop<00:01:55.460> your

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
row make your turn and you drop your

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.120 
row make your turn and you drop your
implement<00:01:56.000> it'll<00:01:56.360> dead<00:01:56.510> ship<00:01:56.750> back<00:01:56.960> up<00:01:57.130> you

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
implement it'll dead ship back up you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.830 
implement it'll dead ship back up you
can<00:01:58.250> set<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:58.520> up<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.850> shift<00:01:59.119> up<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.570> down<00:01:59.660> on

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
can set it up to shift up and down on

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.290 
can set it up to shift up and down on
the<00:01:59.869> road<00:02:00.170> pulling<00:02:00.470> loads<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:02.030> kind

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the road pulling loads so you can kind

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.960 
the road pulling loads so you can kind
of<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.479> go<00:02:03.290> for<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.530> ride<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.460> guide<00:02:04.790> the

button so if I working with my throttle

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.870 
button so if I working with my throttle
I<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:21.110> still<00:02:21.290> shift<00:02:21.470> my<00:02:21.709> tractor<00:02:22.160> like<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.580> I

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
I can still shift my tractor like that I

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.420 
I can still shift my tractor like that I
don't<00:02:23.720> have<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.350> just<00:02:24.560> move<00:02:24.739> my<00:02:24.800> hand<00:02:25.160> over

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
don't have to just move my hand over

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.020 
don't have to just move my hand over

here the shifter each time now the
unique<00:02:29.360> thing<00:02:29.420> about<00:02:29.660> our<00:02:30.140> em<00:02:30.320> series

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
unique thing about our em series

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.910 
unique thing about our em series
tractors<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.660> big<00:02:32.660> grand<00:02:32.900> x<00:02:33.200> models<00:02:33.680> which

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
tractors on the big grand x models which

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.160 
tractors on the big grand x models which
we've<00:02:34.130> had<00:02:34.370> four<00:02:34.850> on<00:02:35.209> two<00:02:35.930> previous

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
we've had four on two previous

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
our x speed turn first we'll just do a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.750 
our x speed turn first we'll just do a
turn<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:42.019> two-wheel<00:02:42.709> drive<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.190> can<00:02:43.310> see<00:02:43.549> it

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
turn in two-wheel drive you can see it

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.240 
turn in two-wheel drive you can see it
turns<00:02:44.030> very<00:02:44.690> respective<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.709> turns<00:02:45.920> still

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
turns very respective it turns still

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.020 
turns very respective it turns still
very<00:02:46.760> short<00:02:47.180> for<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.900> big<00:02:48.080> tractor<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.910> then

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
very short for a big tractor and then

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.009 
very short for a big tractor and then
when<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.660> put<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.080> regular<00:02:51.470> four-wheel

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
when we put it in regular four-wheel

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.009 
when we put it in regular four-wheel
drive<00:02:54.019> four-wheel<00:02:55.420> drive<00:02:56.420> will<00:02:56.840> have<00:02:56.989> a

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
drive four-wheel drive will have a

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.110 
drive four-wheel drive will have a
tendency<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.560> push<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.010> front<00:02:58.250> end<00:02:58.489> we're

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
tendency to push the front end we're

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.759 
tendency to push the front end we're
writing<00:02:59.299> about<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.600> three<00:02:59.870> percent<00:03:00.200> over<00:03:00.560> right

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
writing about a three percent over right

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.539 
writing about a three percent over right
now<00:03:00.799> on<00:03:01.220> our<00:03:01.370> front<00:03:01.549> wheels<00:03:01.760> so<00:03:02.570> when<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.840> turn

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
now on our front wheels so when you turn

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.250 
now on our front wheels so when you turn
you'll<00:03:04.549> feel<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.120> front<00:03:05.450> ends<00:03:05.720> kind<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:06.019> slow

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
you'll feel the front ends kind of slow

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.840 
you'll feel the front ends kind of slow
down<00:03:06.290> because<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:07.100> back<00:03:07.250> wheels<00:03:07.519> want<00:03:07.760> to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
down because the back wheels want to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.360 
down because the back wheels want to
walk<00:03:08.000> up<00:03:08.209> over<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.600> top<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.140> see<00:03:09.380> so<00:03:10.160> there

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
walk up over the top of you see so there

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.160 
walk up over the top of you see so there
but<00:03:10.880> there's<00:03:11.030> no<00:03:11.060> jumping<00:03:11.600> because<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.989> gear

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
but there's no jumping because the gear

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.220 
but there's no jumping because the gear
ratio<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.650> right<00:03:12.860> on<00:03:13.600> but<00:03:14.600> now<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.750> unique

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
ratio is right on but now the unique

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.190 
ratio is right on but now the unique
thing<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:16.370> what<00:03:16.700> we<00:03:16.790> call<00:03:17.000> by<00:03:17.180> speed<00:03:17.540> turn<00:03:17.840> and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
thing is what we call by speed turn and

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.070 
thing is what we call by speed turn and
I'll<00:03:18.560> kick<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.459> just

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
I'll kick that in and just

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.290 
I'll kick that in and just
woman<00:03:20.350> here<00:03:20.620> tell<00:03:21.220> me<00:03:21.340> about<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.640> components

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
woman here tell me about the components

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.270 
woman here tell me about the components
of<00:03:22.420> iced<00:03:22.600> tea<00:03:22.630> turn<00:03:23.200> down<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.860> left<00:03:24.040> wheel

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
of iced tea turn down on the left wheel

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.840 
of iced tea turn down on the left wheel
and<00:03:24.700> right<00:03:25.300> now<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:26.110> see<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.350> wire

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
and right now you can see that wire

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.340 
and right now you can see that wire
that's<00:03:27.850> got<00:03:28.150> an<00:03:28.240> electrical<00:03:28.660> wire<00:03:28.690> inside

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
that's got an electrical wire inside

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.380 
that's got an electrical wire inside
that<00:03:29.650> that's<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:30.070> protection<00:03:30.790> on<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.060> cover

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
that that's a protection on the cover

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.000 
that that's a protection on the cover
outside<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.080> but<00:03:32.230> there's<00:03:32.380> electrical<00:03:32.830> wire

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
outside it but there's electrical wire

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.130 
outside it but there's electrical wire
in<00:03:33.190> there<00:03:33.280> there's<00:03:33.490> a<00:03:33.580> sensor<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.690> when<00:03:34.840> I

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
in there there's a sensor so when I

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
now you see how the wheel went a lot

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.540 
now you see how the wheel went a lot
faster<00:03:56.680> sure<00:03:57.400> at<00:03:58.390> 35<00:03:58.900> degrees<00:03:58.980> by<00:03:59.980> speed<00:04:00.280> kicks

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.390 
faster sure at 35 degrees by speed kicks
in<00:04:00.790> see<00:04:01.120> that's<00:04:01.420> 35<00:04:01.930> degrees<00:04:02.320> because<00:04:03.160> now

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
in see that's 35 degrees because now

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.750 
in see that's 35 degrees because now
it's<00:04:03.550> slowed<00:04:03.760> down<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.140> window<00:04:05.650> between<00:04:05.860> 35

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
it's slowed down so a window between 35

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.349 
it's slowed down so a window between 35

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.680 
a narrower tire
and<00:05:31.169> they<00:05:31.379> still<00:05:31.650> run<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.520> between<00:05:33.210> 30<00:05:33.509> inch

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
and they still run the between 30 inch

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.649 
and they still run the between 30 inch
rows<00:05:33.900> with<00:05:34.169> no<00:05:34.319> problem<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:36.240> backs<00:05:36.449> are

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
rows with no problem and the backs are

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.899 
rows with no problem and the backs are
exactly<00:05:37.169> on<00:05:37.289> 60<00:05:38.039> inch<00:05:38.190> centers<00:05:38.460> so<00:05:38.759> we're

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
exactly on 60 inch centers so we're

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:39.890 
exactly on 60 inch centers so we're
going<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.090> be<00:05:39.210> able<00:05:39.389> to<00:05:39.479> fit<00:05:39.750> those

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
going to be able to fit those

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.710 
going to be able to fit those

the previous cab had a box that would

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.249 
the previous cab had a box that would
interfere<00:05:48.090> with<00:05:48.389> the<00:05:48.449> tire<00:05:48.659> lugs<00:05:48.960> when<00:05:49.169> we

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
interfere with the tire lugs when we

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.140 
interfere with the tire lugs when we
narrowed<00:05:49.560> them<00:05:49.710> up<00:05:49.830> that<00:05:50.490> problems<00:05:50.970> we've

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
narrowed them up that problems we've

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.180 
narrowed them up that problems we've

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
control on the valves and you really

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.649 
control on the valves and you really
need<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.560> pressure<00:06:07.830> compensated<00:06:08.520> system<00:06:08.940> we

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
need a pressure compensated system we

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:11.570 
need a pressure compensated system we
have<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.860> 20-point<00:06:10.860> seven<00:06:11.159> gallon<00:06:11.460> per<00:06:11.550> minute

open center pump on this tractor but

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.399 
open center pump on this tractor but
like<00:06:14.460> some<00:06:14.969> competitors<00:06:15.449> for<00:06:15.990> many<00:06:16.169> years

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
like some competitors for many years

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.930 
like some competitors for many years
have<00:06:16.620> been<00:06:16.710> using<00:06:16.919> closed<00:06:17.280> center<00:06:17.580> remotes

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
have been using closed center remotes

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.540 
have been using closed center remotes
and<00:06:18.240> there's<00:06:18.960> some<00:06:19.110> special<00:06:19.530> requirements<00:06:20.460> in

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
and there's some special requirements in

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.879 
and there's some special requirements in
the<00:06:20.639> valves<00:06:21.090> and<00:06:21.270> we<00:06:21.870> can<00:06:22.050> do<00:06:22.169> that<00:06:22.379> so<00:06:22.590> we<00:06:22.740> have

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
the valves and we can do that so we have

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.430 
the valves and we can do that so we have
a<00:06:22.919> dash<00:06:23.400> F<00:06:23.729> configurated<00:06:24.479> from<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:24.960> factory

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
a dash F configurated from the factory

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.270 
a dash F configurated from the factory

on the 26 to the 135 grand X to where

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
on the 26 to the 135 grand X to where
you<00:06:29.520> can<00:06:29.699> have<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:31.800> two<00:06:31.979> valves<00:06:32.460> that<00:06:32.639> come

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
you can have the two valves that come

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.689 
you can have the two valves that come
standard<00:06:33.539> will<00:06:33.960> have<00:06:34.169> flow<00:06:34.919> controls<00:06:35.340> on<00:06:35.490> each

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
standard will have flow controls on each

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.999 
standard will have flow controls on each
valve<00:06:36.029> there's<00:06:36.900> an<00:06:36.990> unloading<00:06:37.440> valve<00:06:37.650> in<00:06:37.860> it
