00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.540 
it looks very little bit right but
that's<00:00:55.469> all<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> need<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.329> fire<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.690> high<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
that's all you need is a fire on high I

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.369

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
put about a teaspoon of our extract and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.380 
put about a teaspoon of our extract and
we're<00:01:02.280> also<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> taste<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.239> smell

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
we're also going to taste it and smell

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
we're also going to taste it and smell
it<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.809> need<00:01:03.840> more<00:01:04.110> we'll<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.409> more<00:01:04.589> about

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it if we need more we'll put more about

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.609 
it if we need more we'll put more about
about<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> teaspoon<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.610> enough<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:07.380> don't

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
about a teaspoon is enough and I don't

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.140 
about a teaspoon is enough and I don't
put<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> dye<00:01:08.100> right<00:01:08.369> away<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
put the dye right away because I want to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.109 
put the dye right away because I want to
watch<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.900> sugar<00:01:10.110> dissolves

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
watch and see that the sugar dissolves

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.410 
watch and see that the sugar dissolves
so<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.689> right<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.200> my<00:01:13.380> spatula

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
so all I get right here is my spatula

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.999 
so all I get right here is my spatula
and<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.990> don't<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:16.290> need<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> stir<00:01:16.860> this

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and you don't really need to stir this

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.530 
and you don't really need to stir this
okay<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.340> move<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.790> around<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.360> sugar

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
okay just move it around so the sugar

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.399 
okay just move it around so the sugar
can<00:01:18.950> separate<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> water<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.409> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
can separate here in the water and it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.749 
can separate here in the water and it
smells<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:23.040> good<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> Bubblegum

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
smells really good of the Bubblegum

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:24.740 
smells really good of the Bubblegum
right<00:01:23.970> now<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.420> know<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.659> we're

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
right now so I don't know that we're

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
right now so I don't know that we're
going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> need<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.110> we're<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
going to need more we're just going to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.070 
going to need more we're just going to
let<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> sit<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> dissolve<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.869> takes

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
let it sit there and dissolve it takes

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.899 
let it sit there and dissolve it takes
about<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.380> minute<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> minute<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.549> half<00:01:29.579> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
about a minute to a minute and a half to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.179 
about a minute to a minute and a half to
dissolve<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.509> come<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> boil<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.470> I'll

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
dissolve and then come to a boil so I'll

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.850 
dissolve and then come to a boil so I'll
be<00:01:32.369> back<00:01:32.579> when<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> boil<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.290> we're

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
be back when this is at a boil and we're

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.370 
be back when this is at a boil and we're
going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> time<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.759> minute<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:37.350> now

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
going to time it for one minute so now

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.560 
going to time it for one minute so now
that<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.920> sugar<00:01:38.100> has<00:01:38.369> pretty<00:01:38.640> much<00:01:38.759> dissolved

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that the sugar has pretty much dissolved

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.960 
that the sugar has pretty much dissolved
I<00:01:39.720> mean<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.380> totally<00:01:41.220> totally<00:01:41.579> gone<00:01:41.759> but

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
I mean it's not totally totally gone but

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.630 
I mean it's not totally totally gone but
it's<00:01:42.259> getting<00:01:43.259> there<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.340> see

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it's getting there and if you can see

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.280 
it's getting there and if you can see
bubbles<00:01:44.820> are<00:01:45.119> forming<00:01:45.450> around<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.930> edge<00:01:46.079> but

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
bubbles are forming around the edge but

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.690 
bubbles are forming around the edge but
this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.560> not<00:01:46.710> when<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> start<00:01:47.399> timing

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this is not when we want to start timing

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
this is not when we want to start timing
it<00:01:47.790> okay<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.329> time<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.630> when<00:01:48.750> bubbles

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it okay we want a time it when bubbles

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.410 
it okay we want a time it when bubbles
are<00:01:49.259> totally<00:01:49.860> engulfing<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.520> pot<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:51.329> we

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
would say the die is right at about a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.359 
would say the die is right at about a
tablespoon<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.930> never<00:01:58.409> measure<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.950> because<00:01:59.100> we

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
tablespoon I never measure it because we

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.399 
tablespoon I never measure it because we
just<00:01:59.520> kind<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.820> eyeball<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
just kind of eyeball it and get it to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.560 
just kind of eyeball it and get it to
the<00:02:01.590> color<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:03.450> know

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
flu you might want a lighter blue so you

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.850 
flu you might want a lighter blue so you
put<00:02:06.869> less<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.110> added<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.560> dye

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
put less so there we added a dye

put less so there we added a dye
I'm<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.310> leave<00:02:12.460> it<00:02:12.580> alone<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:13.440> we're
