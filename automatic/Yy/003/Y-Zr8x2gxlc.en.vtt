okay today we are changing the

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.430 
okay today we are changing the
transmission<00:00:03.510> fluid<00:00:04.009> the<00:00:05.009> 9900<00:00:05.670> exciting<00:00:06.029> SOT

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
transmission fluid the 9900 exciting SOT

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.339 
transmission fluid the 9900 exciting SOT
and<00:00:08.150> I'm<00:00:09.150> currently<00:00:09.360> looking<00:00:09.660> at<00:00:09.960> right<00:00:10.320> now

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
and I'm currently looking at right now

and I'm currently looking at right now
is<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.070> transmission<00:00:11.580> pan<00:00:12.019> very<00:00:13.019> easy<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.530> get

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
is the transmission pan very easy to get

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.890 
is the transmission pan very easy to get
down<00:00:13.830> well<00:00:14.370> fairly<00:00:14.700> easy<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.240> did<00:00:15.660> spill

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
down well fairly easy I did spill

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.800 
down well fairly easy I did spill
transmission<00:00:16.410> fluid<00:00:16.680> all<00:00:16.740> over<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.039> floor

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
transmission fluid all over the floor

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.990 
transmission fluid all over the floor
but<00:00:19.550> this<00:00:20.550> particular<00:00:20.820> pan<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.810> crack

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
but this particular pan I have a crack

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.560 
but this particular pan I have a crack
crack<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.990> bottom<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> pan<00:00:26.420> you<00:00:27.420> can

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
crack on the bottom of the pan you can

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.109 
crack on the bottom of the pan you can
see<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> dent<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.470> there<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.789> hit

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
see a dent right there not there I hit

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.700 
see a dent right there not there I hit
rock<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> pretty<00:00:32.579> much<00:00:32.669> just

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
rock got it so I pretty much just

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.380 
rock got it so I pretty much just
drained<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.860> out<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.760> drain<00:00:36.180> plug

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
drained it out of here that drain plug

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.130 
drained it out of here that drain plug
right<00:00:36.690> there

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
right there

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.049

but what I really wanted to point out is

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.260 
but what I really wanted to point out is
the<00:00:39.239> mental<00:00:39.450> shavings<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.129> this<00:00:41.129> pan<00:00:41.780> has<00:00:42.780> a

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
the mental shavings this this pan has a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.889 
the mental shavings this this pan has a
freaking<00:00:45.270> treatment<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.129> has<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> hundred

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
freaking treatment on that has a hundred

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.119 
freaking treatment on that has a hundred
well<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.170> changed<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.449> change<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.660> fluid

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
well I changed the I change the fluid

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.869 
well I changed the I change the fluid
there's<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> cat

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
there's a cat

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.080 
there's a cat
I<00:00:54.170> changed<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> fluid<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.739> 25,000<00:00:56.670> miles<00:00:56.820> on

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I changed the fluid at 25,000 miles on

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.560 
I changed the fluid at 25,000 miles on
this<00:00:57.270> will<00:00:57.449> exciting<00:00:58.699> dude<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.850> an<00:00:59.940> air<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
this will exciting dude in an air and

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.020 
this will exciting dude in an air and
then<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> haven't<00:01:02.309> changed<00:01:02.579> its<00:01:02.670> sense<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
then I haven't changed its sense of the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.750 
then I haven't changed its sense of the
cars<00:01:03.210> had<00:01:03.359> 190,000<00:01:04.350> miles<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
cars had 190,000 miles on it so this is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.969 
cars had 190,000 miles on it so this is
essentially<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> hundred<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.049> sixty-five

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
essentially a hundred and sixty-five

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
essentially a hundred and sixty-five
thousand<00:01:08.490> miles<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:10.350> oil<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> can

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
thousand miles on this oil and you can

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.440 
thousand miles on this oil and you can
see<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> metal<00:01:11.640> clippings<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.470> magnets

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.990 

see<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:18.930> yeah<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> I'd<00:01:20.670> probably

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
see that there yeah so I'd probably

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.469 
see that there yeah so I'd probably
recommend<00:01:21.799> changing<00:01:22.909> more<00:01:23.909> often<00:01:24.330> than

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
recommend changing more often than

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
recommend changing more often than
160,000<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.750> bet<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> hey<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.189> could<00:01:29.310> probably

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
160,000 I bet you hey you could probably

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.080 
160,000 I bet you hey you could probably
get<00:01:29.610> by<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> change<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.119> ever<00:01:30.270> 100,000<00:01:30.960> miles

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
get by a change in ever 100,000 miles

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.310 
get by a change in ever 100,000 miles
tronic<00:01:33.090> still<00:01:33.299> works<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.720> I'll<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:33.990> how<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
tronic still works good I'll see how it

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.670 
tronic still works good I'll see how it
works<00:01:34.470> after<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.860> put<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.939> fluid<00:01:36.500> put<00:01:37.500> fresh

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
works after I put in the fluid put fresh

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.249 
works after I put in the fluid put fresh
fluid<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.340> got<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> new<00:01:39.060> filter<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.750> actually

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
fluid in I got a new filter I actually

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.929 
fluid in I got a new filter I actually
ordered<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:41.009> through<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.810> blah<00:01:42.810> parts

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
ordered this all through a blah parts

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.580 
ordered this all through a blah parts
and<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.420> seems<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> pretty<00:01:46.079> comprehensive

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and it seems like a pretty comprehensive

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.569 
and it seems like a pretty comprehensive
kit<00:01:47.990> I'll<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.439> another<00:01:49.649> report<00:01:50.070> after<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.430> get

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
kit I'll do another report after I get

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.569 
kit I'll do another report after I get
it<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> filled<00:01:51.119> up<00:01:51.270> new<00:01:52.250> gasket<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.369> don't

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
it all I filled up new gasket I don't

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.880 
it all I filled up new gasket I don't
know<00:01:53.670> why<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.119> says<00:01:54.270> obsolete<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.290> top

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
know why but it says obsolete on the top

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.840 
know why but it says obsolete on the top
hmm<00:01:56.850> not<00:01:57.360> giving<00:01:57.840> me<00:01:57.899> much<00:01:58.020> confidence<00:01:58.590> tear

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
hmm not giving me much confidence tear

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.569 
hmm not giving me much confidence tear
this<00:01:59.850> kit<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:01.130> hundred<00:02:02.130> dollars<00:02:02.430> they

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
this kit was a hundred dollars they

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.340 
this kit was a hundred dollars they
actually<00:02:02.850> gave<00:02:03.000> me<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> pump<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> pump<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.170> there

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
actually gave me a pump to pump in there

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.260 
actually gave me a pump to pump in there
well

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
well

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.890 
well
and<00:02:09.590> inside<00:02:10.590> here<00:02:10.649> -<00:02:11.069> are<00:02:11.220> all<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.900> o-rings

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and inside here - are all the o-rings

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.699 
and inside here - are all the o-rings
that<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.319> need<00:02:14.420> some<00:02:15.420> fresh<00:02:15.720> hex<00:02:16.170> bolts<00:02:16.590> I

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
that we need some fresh hex bolts I

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.229 
that we need some fresh hex bolts I
guess<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.980> most<00:02:20.190> expensive<00:02:20.730> part<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.150> it

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
guess and the most expensive part of it

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.289 
guess and the most expensive part of it
is<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.840> Ravenel<00:02:24.260> ATF<00:02:25.260> fluid<00:02:25.670> which<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.819> got<00:02:26.970> six

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
is the Ravenel ATF fluid which I got six

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.100 
is the Ravenel ATF fluid which I got six
quarts<00:02:27.629> of<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:29.540> took<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.569> while<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.080> to

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
quarts of that took a while for it to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.710 
quarts of that took a while for it to

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
cleaner edge let's see can't even really

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.500 
cleaner edge let's see can't even really
till<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.269> had<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:07.430> four<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.519> morning<00:03:08.730> I'm<00:03:09.329> gonna

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
till I had a four this morning I'm gonna

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.340 
till I had a four this morning I'm gonna
split<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:10.880> filter<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:12.090> mean<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:12.690> gasket<00:03:13.019> I

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
split this filter I mean this gasket I

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.090 
split this filter I mean this gasket I
already<00:03:14.310> put<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.549> filter<00:03:14.910> on<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:16.100> tighten

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
already put the filter on and tighten

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.860 
already put the filter on and tighten
everything<00:03:17.130> down<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.760> fill<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.150> up<00:03:18.239> see<00:03:18.750> how

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
everything down and fill it up see how

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.940 
everything down and fill it up see how
it<00:03:18.930> goes<00:03:19.700> and

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.920 

this<00:03:23.550> has<00:03:23.760> been<00:03:23.910> pretty<00:03:24.120> easy<00:03:24.240> actually<00:03:24.690> to

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
this has been pretty easy actually to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.040 
this has been pretty easy actually to
this<00:03:25.140> filter<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.950> mean<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.940> transmission<00:03:27.720> put

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
this filter I mean that transmission put

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.740 
this filter I mean that transmission put
so<00:03:28.560> far<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.980> guess<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> hard<00:03:30.239> parts<00:03:30.510> when<00:03:30.660> you

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
so far I guess the hard parts when you

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.790 
so far I guess the hard parts when you
fill<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.080> up<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.290> got<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.440> get<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.650> at<00:03:31.770> a

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
fill it up you got to get it at a

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.339 
fill it up you got to get it at a
certain<00:03:31.920> temperature<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.750> I'll<00:03:34.080> be<00:03:34.230> working

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
certain temperature so I'll be working

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.460 
certain temperature so I'll be working
on<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.830> no<00:03:35.099> I'll<00:03:35.310> report<00:03:35.580> back

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
on that no I'll report back

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.960 
on that no I'll report back
okay<00:03:37.470> I'm<00:03:37.739> filling<00:03:38.220> up<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> transmission

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
okay I'm filling up the transmission

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.410 
okay I'm filling up the transmission
with<00:03:39.650> Ravan<00:03:40.650> all<00:03:40.800> HTF<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:44.209> put<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.270> in<00:03:45.330> the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
with Ravan all HTF and put it in the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.750 
with Ravan all HTF and put it in the
instructions<00:03:46.940> training<00:03:47.940> needs<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.209> be<00:03:49.760> 85

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
instructions training needs to be 85

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.620 
instructions training needs to be 85
degrees<00:03:51.800> but<00:03:52.800> it's<00:03:52.950> cold<00:03:53.310> here<00:03:53.640> in<00:03:53.700> sac<00:03:54.150> now

it's<00:04:36.450> easy<00:04:36.720> working<00:04:37.260> and

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.220

oil pump this little pump thing works
out<00:04:52.980> pretty<00:04:53.130> good

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
out pretty good

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.040 
out pretty good
being<00:04:54.750> with<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.050> kid<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:56.600> he's<00:04:57.600> gotta<00:04:57.810> follow

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
being with the kid and he's gotta follow

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.240 
being with the kid and he's gotta follow
instructions<00:04:58.860> I<00:04:58.980> started<00:04:59.310> see<00:04:59.520> an<00:04:59.790> inspection

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.750 

at<00:05:03.550> first<00:05:03.850> built<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.540> bunch

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
at first built the bunch

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.670 
at first built the bunch
but<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.270> change<00:05:07.510> not<00:05:07.720> leaking<00:05:08.140> that's<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.530> good

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
but the change not leaking that's a good

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.670 
but the change not leaking that's a good
sign<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.450> it<00:05:10.450> should<00:05:10.690> be<00:05:10.780> two<00:05:10.930> years<00:05:11.290> at<00:05:11.650> least

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
sign and it should be two years at least

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.310 
sign and it should be two years at least
and<00:05:13.110> hopefully

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.830 

now<00:05:20.580> take<00:05:21.580> that<00:05:21.610> give<00:05:21.940> my<00:05:22.090> good<00:05:22.270> fresh<00:05:22.570> bread

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
now take that give my good fresh bread

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.719 
now take that give my good fresh bread
and<00:05:23.440> ninety<00:05:24.070> thousand<00:05:24.610> miles<00:05:24.790> on<00:05:25.150> this<00:05:25.270> car

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
and ninety thousand miles on this car

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.500 
and ninety thousand miles on this car
runs<00:05:27.729> good<00:05:28.060> I<00:05:28.300> just<00:05:29.229> recently<00:05:29.620> changed

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
runs good I just recently changed
