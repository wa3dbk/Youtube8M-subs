00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 and that's it they came to the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.429
 writing 01net tv you are the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.160
 first to see them for real these are 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.599
 the galaxies to and there is something in 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.769
 these galaxies to you will see this is 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.630
 almost the same in three copies 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.170
 except that even small 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.609
 differences 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:26.010
 yes it's not quite so much so 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.199
 to say it right away samsung continues 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.820
 its momentum by producing 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.770
 smartphones and we will say to the weight finally 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.660
 or kg km same name but it's true that 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.640
 samsung we know has had a year a little 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.379
 complicated for the year 2014 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.350
 they did not achieve their goals of 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.610
 sale including regarding galaxy s 5 and 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.860
 so try to catch up with 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.090
 phones prettier and especially to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.410
 more affordable prices 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.539
 because the problem of galaxy s 5 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.789
 it was very expensive so there 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.469
 it's three galaxies support if there is any 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.350
 three that we will introduce you have the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.570
 particularity of having tariffs 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.440
 near correct in relation to their design 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.690
 and their power 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.119
 so you may have liked the galaxy 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.600
 alpha this very nice smartphone from samsung 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.970
 who is 36th with the others and classy 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.979
 with this slice a little square finally 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.909
 good a little bit think about the look of 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.310
 the iphone must say it well 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.780
 and especially with this metallic look and 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.189
 well here are these galaxies keep it a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 little bit this metallic look 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.009
 exit the plastic the samsung plays on 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.320
 aluminum you have to know that in fact 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.210
 the back shell of the phone is fine 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.829
 it's aluminum even if for this 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.090
 white model I have in my hands is 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.590
 do not feel it feels like it's 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.420
 plastic that's what is a pity there 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.340
 could have just made an effort to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.229
 value this metal there we feel 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.329
 that it's plastic but it exists 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.979
 also in black version or there we feel a 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.899
 little more vital aspect offers when 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.140
 even we like it we appreciate this design 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.119
 ultra-fine very classy and very classy 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.659
 are all three four g20 where the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.189
 smartphones 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.420
 so why three good everything 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.710
 just because I get drunk 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.719
 distinguishes by three screen sizes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.780
 different and by the three sizes on 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.770
 going to say market stars 4.5 inches this is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.500
 the 3 5 inches is the 5 and the age and the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.060
 which has a screen of 5.5 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.870
 otherwise it's almost the same screen 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.810
 everywhere super amoled with this from aulaqi 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.750
 are in hd and the little one who enjoys 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.600
 a QHD resolution camera side 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.670
 again a little difference the a3 and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.060
 of 8 megapixels then on the back of 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.340
 the device 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.180
 because to the advanced 5 megapixel 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.130
 for the three models 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.470
 and then after for a5 alas it is 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.440
 goes up to 13 bigger pix good side 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.650
 processor on the little one and that of 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.120
 middle one has quad core 1.2 gigahertz 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.160
 the one in his hands enjoys 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.840
 a slightly more powerful processor 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.870
 quad core also but in two 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.380
 versions either 5 or 1.8 gr on the side 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.770
 memory 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.770
 same fight for the 3 16 giga plus one 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.750
 micro SD adapter that can increase 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.970
 the memory of your phone up to 64 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.120
 giga and look good on the slice 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.820
 Well, it looks like a 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.580
 some American brand look good 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.050
 and yes to actually m both the map 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.959
 sim and add the memory card 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.130
 you have to use a small tool then 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.180
 it is not unique to the iphone 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.680
 since glg for quite a few years 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.850
 integrates this little what I was talking about 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.260
 the hair pinned well the end of 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.299
 the hair year and its systems of 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.920
 push button to be able to integrate in 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.019
 do either the sim card or the card 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.690
 rather discreet memory 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.090
 good a word of the battery the batteries 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.739
 are different to one is on 1900 2300 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.060
 of 1600 million eur pair but 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.060
 obviously this will be offset by the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.829
 screen size and the power the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.959
 processor frequency so roughly speaking 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.790
 we can imagine that after the tests 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.010
 which have not yet taken place in the lab on 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.810
 will arrive at performances and in 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.310
 autonomy that will be substantially the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.290
 even here we will see well anyway 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.200
 the full test soon on 01net tv 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.450
 after obviously from the android 4.4 small 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.070
 cat and we can imagine that very quickly 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.440
 phone will pass on the new 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.720
 lollipop version a special selphy 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.340
 since we had 5 megapixels in the front we 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.860
 will be able to make saddles girl in 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.930
 wide screen that is to say we are not 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.190
 obliged to have an arm of 18 kilometers 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.170
 of laon to be able to all be on the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.380
 photo here is otherwise we also find 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.640
 the ultra power saving mode of samsung 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.440
 in other words, battery saving 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.030
 when at the end of the roll you cut 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.370
 all that is useless or keep that 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.859
 the essential thing is practical and then the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.819
 multi mode 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.669
 missing fonelle has been around for a long time 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:26.860
 on smartphones android revamped 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.479
 samsung that's it for these galaxies so 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.060
 the three class basins is they 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.280
 have to position themselves between there we go 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.639
 say 300 and 500 euros for the three 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.159
 models 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.780
 we do not have the final prices yet 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.120
 will get there very quickly at 3 2 to 5 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.189
 are already available and the 7 arrives 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.509
 I believe running of March 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.219
 FranÃ§ois, we have the impression with his 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.830
 smartphones that samsung approaches 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.659
 almost a sort of grail that will be 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.699
 maybe one day the smartphone on 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.169
 custom measurement 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.669
 you will choose almost your 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.500
 configuration and you will have exactly 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.430
 what you need because there 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.060
 differences are still in a 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.529
 pocket-handkerchief 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.300
 and then it's mostly an aperitif in 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.659
 waiting for the famous galaxy what will be 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.400
 ad 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.050
 we talked about it last week without 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.610
 doubt on the occasion of the mobile world 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.120
 congress that will take place at the beginning of March 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.740
 barcelona 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.199
 Here smartphones and we like it 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.590
 eat them kiss them hello to all 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.900
 and see you tomorrow 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.099
 yes finally I leave it in play it's 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.099
 just someone is like that
