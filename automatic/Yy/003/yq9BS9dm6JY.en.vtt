00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.230
 This video explains to you that you are 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:20.910
 ssd and I'm also going to make a good 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:23.340
 my little quickie just so you see that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.990
 as it is with s sp works you have to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.289
 common knowledge is that hdz works here 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.420
 It's an idea it's old but the new ones have to 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.840
 same entry here this one I 'm going to show 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.840
 It's called the bag for you. 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:49.140
 the ssds are smaller than the time has 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:54.600
 large also if the mother is smaller the size 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.699
 of a notebook hd and the new hdds have 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.350
 the same entry sata 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.320
 this here is a then an hd how it works 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:10.049
 His life has a big record here. 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.799
 spinning metal 11 more am and have a 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.470
 a vinyl disc hog head that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.870
 almost on it, I'm going to put a 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.180
 photo and 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:27.540
 and he will go reading by writing on 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.260
 Life then argue is waking up and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.610
 It's okay, now, it works. 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.530
 he is made that neither memory he is only of 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.300
 central means that it has nothing to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.160
 my daughter in he's done with 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.610
 memory is philips 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.040
 so this here is better many ways 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.130
 this one it has nothing stirring 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:56.010
 in then it does not make noise nor the fact 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.410
 nothing to move is also the case. 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.350
 Do you have a laptop? 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.350
 the hds of this size but that are so 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.680
 this topic you raise lapa case 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.950
 have a normal hd in there you go 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.150
 hear a scratched type as if it were a 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.240
 CD 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.000
 one of these you might miss testing the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.160
 data and lost hd 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.890
 here you will have no problem do not have 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.709
 nothing moving it will not vibrate it 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:38.000
 no matter the way it was moving, right? 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.000
 while he is writing reading from 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.880
 consumption much less energy and less 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.650
 energy 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:56.610
 it is more reliable and will last longer 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:59.580
 with the strongest point of it is speed 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.090
 it is much much faster than one 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.790
 hd mechanic and most people a 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:17.130
 desktop bought a small one for 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:21.239
 put the system and 60 gb and put the 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.880
 rest of the data in normal hd because the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.320
 The only weak point of this here is that it is 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.690
 much more expensive than a normal ht 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.490
 I get ad 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:39.360
 small so said 60 gigs and 160 gigs 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.880
 you can buy a car below 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.760
 memory if you buy a flag 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.100
 so it 's much more expensive even if he is 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.240
 much faster to consume less 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.020
 energy does not make noise and neither does it 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.360
 call and that's it for you to have 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:03.800
 understood if you have any questions 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.800
 we let you sign up and I went
