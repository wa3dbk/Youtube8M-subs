hello<00:00:01.050> YouTube<00:00:01.530> friends<00:00:01.560> I've<00:00:02.220> decided<00:00:02.879> to

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hello YouTube friends I've decided to

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.360 
hello YouTube friends I've decided to
start<00:00:03.360> looking<00:00:03.720> into<00:00:04.069> bitcoin<00:00:05.069> litecoin

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
start looking into bitcoin litecoin

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.390 
start looking into bitcoin litecoin
mining<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:07.740> started<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.340> play<00:00:09.000> with<00:00:09.179> it

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
mining and I started to play with it

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.640 
mining and I started to play with it
started<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.750> experiment<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.320> set<00:00:13.559> up

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
started to experiment with it I set up

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.689 
started to experiment with it I set up
all<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.160> computers<00:00:14.610> i<00:00:14.790> had<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:16.010> mine<00:00:17.010> litecoin

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
all the computers i had to mine litecoin

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.550 
all the computers i had to mine litecoin
check<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.510> out<00:00:19.730> alright<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:20.910> here<00:00:21.090> i<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.180> my

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
check this out alright so here i have my

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.710 
check this out alright so here i have my
actual<00:00:22.560> desktop<00:00:23.390> it's<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> quad-core

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
actual desktop it's a quad-core

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.950 
actual desktop it's a quad-core
processor<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.830> outdated<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.760> got<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> 9500

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
processor it's outdated it's got a 9500

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.870 
processor it's outdated it's got a 9500
GT<00:00:27.990> video<00:00:28.560> card<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.010> know<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.369> old<00:00:29.609> as

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
GT video card and I know it's old as

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.400 
GT video card and I know it's old as
hell<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.769> its<00:00:31.769> mining<00:00:32.160> right<00:00:32.369> now<00:00:32.660> I'm<00:00:33.660> cpu

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
hell and its mining right now I'm cpu

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.959 
hell and its mining right now I'm cpu
mining<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.340> using<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.730> hundred<00:00:35.940> percent

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
mining it's using one hundred percent

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.369 
mining it's using one hundred percent
CPU<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.710> using<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.100> four<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> quad<00:00:38.820> cores

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
CPU so using all four to the quad cores

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.250 
CPU so using all four to the quad cores
each<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.100> pushing<00:00:42.140> 5<00:00:44.840> kill<00:00:45.840> hashes<00:00:46.230> per

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
each one is pushing 5 kill hashes per

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
each one is pushing 5 kill hashes per
second<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.239> it's

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
second all right I don't know if it's

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.330 
second all right I don't know if it's
called<00:00:51.510> kilo<00:00:51.899> hash<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> forgot<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> name<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
called kilo hash or I forgot the name of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.619 
called kilo hash or I forgot the name of
that<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.090> i<00:00:54.149> mean<00:00:54.300> ok<00:00:54.600> so

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that but you know what i mean ok so

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.529 
that but you know what i mean ok so
those<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.500> processors<00:00:56.160> that's<00:00:56.969> processor

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
those are my processors that's processor

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.119 
those are my processors that's processor
zero<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.320> two<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.210> three<00:01:00.590> that<00:01:01.590> makes<00:01:01.829> four

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
zero one two and three that makes four

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.250 
zero one two and three that makes four
four<00:01:02.670> processors<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:04.350> i<00:01:05.189> am<00:01:05.750> using<00:01:06.750> my<00:01:07.020> video

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
four processors and i am using my video

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679 
four processors and i am using my video
card<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.100> geforce<00:01:08.520> 9500<00:01:08.939> GT<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
card which is the geforce 9500 GT and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.830 
card which is the geforce 9500 GT and
that's<00:01:10.320> pushing<00:01:10.970> four-point-oh<00:01:11.970> killa<00:01:12.600> hash

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that's pushing four-point-oh killa hash

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.550 
that's pushing four-point-oh killa hash
per<00:01:13.080> second<00:01:13.530> all<00:01:14.520> right<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.049> I<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.409> know

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
per second all right and I don't know

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.990 
per second all right and I don't know
what<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> boost

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
what this is but I think you get a boost

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.380 
what this is but I think you get a boost
once<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.450> once<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.900> awhile<00:01:19.340> 21-point<00:01:20.340> 73<00:01:21.030> this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
once it once in awhile 21-point 73 this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.940 
once it once in awhile 21-point 73 this
is<00:01:21.630> even<00:01:21.869> yay<00:01:22.110> right<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> mean<00:01:22.890> that

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
is even yay right there I mean that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.880 
is even yay right there I mean that
looks<00:01:23.280> good<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.170> trading<00:01:25.470> machine

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
looks good and I have my trading machine

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.289 
looks good and I have my trading machine
this<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> machine<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.880> trades

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
this is the machine that I do trades

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.120 
this is the machine that I do trades
with<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.229> foreign<00:01:28.770> exchange<00:01:29.159> trades<00:01:29.930> stock

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
with I do foreign exchange trades stock

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.450 
with I do foreign exchange trades stock
stock<00:01:32.130> trades<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.570> dual<00:01:33.780> core<00:01:33.990> processor

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
stock trades it's a dual core processor

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.510 
stock trades it's a dual core processor
using<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.640> cpu<00:01:36.210> two<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:36.930> each<00:01:37.829> processor

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
using all cpu two of them each processor

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
using all cpu two of them each processor
is<00:01:38.729> pushing<00:01:39.770> 11<00:01:40.770> k<00:01:41.460> hashes<00:01:41.909> per<00:01:41.939> second<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.869> i

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
is pushing 11 k hashes per second and i

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.999 
is pushing 11 k hashes per second and i
got<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:43.950> laptop<00:01:44.130> over<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:46.350> also<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.770> dual

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
got my laptop over here it's also a dual

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.490 
got my laptop over here it's also a dual
core<00:01:47.310> pushing<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:47.850> hundred<00:01:48.060> percent<00:01:48.259> cpu<00:01:49.259> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
core pushing one hundred percent cpu and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.679 
core pushing one hundred percent cpu and
this<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.340> pushing<00:01:50.700> 1.7<00:01:51.509> per<00:01:51.810> core<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.189> 01<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
this is pushing 1.7 per core so 01 and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.230 
this is pushing 1.7 per core so 01 and
over<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.200> also<00:01:55.380> 0<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.189> 1<00:01:56.670> dual-core

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
over here it's also 0 and 1 dual-core

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.440 
over here it's also 0 and 1 dual-core
processors<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.619> i'm<00:01:58.770> pushing<00:01:59.189> around<00:01:59.310> 70<00:02:00.149> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
processors so i'm pushing around 70 to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.819 
processors so i'm pushing around 70 to
75<00:02:01.140> k<00:02:01.829> hashes<00:02:02.280> per<00:02:02.310> second<00:02:03.619> let's<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.740> ahead

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
75 k hashes per second let's go ahead

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.760 
75 k hashes per second let's go ahead
and<00:02:04.950> look<00:02:05.130> at<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> calculator

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.470 

so<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:12.220> is<00:02:12.340> just<00:02:12.430> an<00:02:12.610> experiment<00:02:13.000> wanted<00:02:13.420> to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
so this is just an experiment wanted to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.930 
so this is just an experiment wanted to
see<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> calculator<00:02:15.400> here<00:02:15.640> where<00:02:15.850> we

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
see this is a calculator here where we

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.420 
see this is a calculator here where we
can<00:02:15.970> see<00:02:16.330> what's<00:02:16.510> going<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:17.070> we<00:02:18.070> can<00:02:18.220> see<00:02:18.340> how

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
can see what's going on we can see how

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.590 
can see what's going on we can see how
much<00:02:18.580> we're<00:02:18.730> earning<00:02:18.850> i'm<00:02:19.120> going<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.300> type<00:02:19.450> in

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
much we're earning i'm going to type in

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.340 
much we're earning i'm going to type in
75<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.890> we're<00:02:21.010> making<00:02:21.280> 75<00:02:21.870> k<00:02:22.870> hashes<00:02:23.260> per

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
75 so we're making 75 k hashes per

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.170 
75 so we're making 75 k hashes per
