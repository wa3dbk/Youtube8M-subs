00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.800
 to free 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.019
 The story is relatively much built on the question of whether by simple way too 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.119
 Xstrata has been so many little details that you can do 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.890

 some chances are blind 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.350

 Again it is unbelievable 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.220
 After a while, the beer industry keeps science up to date 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.600
 try to catch up but then the right direction 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.660
 b can be 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.660

 the trade visitors and everything has 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 which is driven 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.600
 Oh you shit that should be relieved for now as soon as possible 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 the hotel in Rheda waste dump 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.819
 we made it the book has been saved for scientists 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.569
 Take in euros 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.509

 I can only say 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:54.279
 our game 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.279
 it's worth it I still have to save
