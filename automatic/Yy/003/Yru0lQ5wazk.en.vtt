 [Music] 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.180
 If they do not taze dry hair 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.209
 damaged or punished with the tips 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.190
 crisp open 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.200
 today is your day because we are going to 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.779
 teach to make here a mask for 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.000
 the ideal hair for all those who 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.739
 suffer from these consequences 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.710
 consequences of the sun from the water of 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:29.079
 you already know the dryer of the 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.029
 hair the iron to smooth it 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.890
 Permanent chemicals 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.780
 they spoil us so much this 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.940
 Mask is the mask that you go 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.770
 do at home with very few elements is 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.900
 very easy and it will replace those 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.460
 treatments that you can also do in 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.800
 the beauty salons and that works 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.900
 very good but kids the price is 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.030
 quite different, not that we're going to 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.100
 for our mask for our 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.260
 damaged hair that can also be damaged 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.990
 put with any type of dry hair 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.820
 normal fat because it works for everything 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.140
 type of hair we go with the elements 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.870
 what we need is the most important thing 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.920
 of ingredients here we have 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.920
 a ripe banana already cut into pieces 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.030
 medium 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.659
 a quarter cup of plain yogurt and one 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.430
 spoonful of olive oil and with those 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.040
 three simple elements we are going to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.930
 make our hair mask 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 punished but before you know that I 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.080
 I like to tell you those secrets that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.200
 has each of the products that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.539
 let's use for example the banana 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.080
 or banana the banana Havana what we're going 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.659
 to use has tryptophan which is a 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.060
 Essential amino acid essential for 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.819
 maintain a healthy pH balance 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.649
 of the skin we also have the yogurt the 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.899
 yogurt stimulates blood circulation 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.880
 and therefore it also unites the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.039
 healthier hair growth and about 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 everything also faster and that I'm going to 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.490
 say the olive oil that I know we 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.420
 It will leave soft smooth soft hair 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.819
 moisturized silky and good is very seductive 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.319
 So let's mix these elements 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:08.090
 here and to beat us very well 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.090
 very important very well shakes 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.390
 banana 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.190
 and yogurt 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.360
 and now our friend's olive oil 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.360
 olive oil 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.909
 and now nothing but beat it and beat it 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.280
 with patience and tranquility because 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.080
 it turns out that the banana sometimes costs 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.730
 a little bit and what it is about is 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.099
 that the banana is very very well 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.720
 very finite chopped but if not 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.610
 we are all banana in the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.150
 hair that would not make us any illusion or 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.150
 be that someone 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.539
 [Applause] 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.349
 Well, here we are, we have our 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.510
 mask for damaged hair and 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.940
 prepared and now a couple of little things 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.770
 about that mask a trick 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.840
 example if you do not want to use a 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.940
 banana if so by the braves that 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.640
 I say, you can simply use 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.290
 also a little pot of those mashed 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.390
 banana that is used so that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.459
 babies eat well it is also will work and 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.310
 it will be faster and easier and now you 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.590
 let's explain how to place it 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.970
 so that it works better in our 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.400
 hair 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.200
 let's take that mask and let's go 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.210
 to put on the hair we are going to 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.630
 massage everything a little if you have the 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.370
 long hair is rolled up jce 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.010
 around the head and then you apply 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.020
 over you put on a plastic cap 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.180
 those of shower and if you do not have at hand a 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.770
 shower cap because it also works 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.740
 film is transparent to wrap 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.990
 food then turn your head with 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.750
 the transparent film and then you wait 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.330
 about half an hour for it to take effect and 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.340
 so that the hair gets soaked 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.470
 well all the nutrients that 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.920
 has our mask at the end of that 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.270
 half an hour you remove the hat or the film 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.070
 transparent and the time has come for 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.410
 wash our head wash our 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.600
 head with your usual field to 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.840
 be possible to be smooth and then what 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.240
 clarifies jce well well well clarified and 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.860
 then you can simply apply the 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.200
 conditioner that you have by habit 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.330
 and then nothing to comb you to your liking 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.620
 that you will be beautiful this mask 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.500
 you can put it whenever the 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.419
 necesitÃ©is no problem over 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.720
 once a week when you sit down is that 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.060
 the hair is 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.800
 it is not to your liking the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.630
 time to use that mask and that 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.110
 amount that we have done is for a 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.550
 single application that is the application 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.740
 mask mixes everything together with a 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.490
 I only agree, I hope it leaves you 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.720
 the silky hair bright and very seductive 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.720

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:56.189
