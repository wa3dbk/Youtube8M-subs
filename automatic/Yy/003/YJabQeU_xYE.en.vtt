actually not my knife this is my
father's<00:00:18.330> knife<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.140> am<00:00:19.470> doing<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.100> review

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
father's knife but I am doing a review

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.439 
father's knife but I am doing a review
on<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:21.650> because<00:00:22.650> he<00:00:23.340> never<00:00:23.519> uses<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.359> it

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
on it because he never uses it and it

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.179 
on it because he never uses it and it
just<00:00:24.480> sits<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:24.900> his<00:00:25.019> dresser<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.650> figure<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
just sits on his dresser so I figure I

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.650 
just sits on his dresser so I figure I
might<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.640> well<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:26.939> something<00:00:27.000> useful<00:00:27.420> with

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
might as well do something useful with

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.710 
might as well do something useful with
it<00:00:27.779> before<00:00:28.230> its<00:00:28.380> life<00:00:28.590> span<00:00:28.769> ends<00:00:29.720> whatever

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
it before its life span ends whatever

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.450 
it before its life span ends whatever
that<00:00:30.810> might<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:33.000> blade<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
that might be all right the blade is

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.340 
that might be all right the blade is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
to be better than pointed serrations

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430

pocket you don't accidentally open it up

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.970 
pocket you don't accidentally open it up
and<00:02:20.160> cut<00:02:20.370> yourself<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.030> got<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.990> lock<00:02:22.560> right

and cut yourself it's got a lock right
here<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> tip<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.240> all<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.320> a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
here in the tip and all it is is a

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.190 
here in the tip and all it is is a
little<00:02:25.620> screw<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:27.150> slide<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.870> slide

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
little screw and a slide and you slide

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.420 
little screw and a slide and you slide
it<00:02:28.380> down<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.800> barely

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
it down and this so you can see barely

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.300 
it down and this so you can see barely
the<00:02:32.550> screw<00:02:33.050> moves<00:02:34.050> down<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.620> front<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.100> tip

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the screw moves down in front of the tip

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.949 
the screw moves down in front of the tip
of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.520> blade<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.800> can't<00:02:38.130> open<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
of the blade so you can't open it and

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.400 
of the blade so you can't open it and
you<00:02:39.959> want<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.230> undo<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:41.340> slide<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.670> up

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
you want to undo it just slide that up

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.410 
you want to undo it just slide that up
and<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.830> opens<00:02:44.160> now<00:02:44.459> obviously<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.209> break

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
and it opens now obviously if you break

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.350 
and it opens now obviously if you break
the<00:02:45.600> tip<00:02:45.810> off<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.200> knife<00:02:46.670> which<00:02:47.670> would

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
the tip off this knife which would

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.330 
the tip off this knife which would
happen<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:48.959> you're<00:02:49.230> unintelligent<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.190> try

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
happen if you're unintelligent and try

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.510 
happen if you're unintelligent and try
to<00:02:50.400> pry<00:02:50.730> something<00:02:51.180> with<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:52.430> then<00:02:53.430> obviously

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
to pry something with it then obviously

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.270 
to pry something with it then obviously
if<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.030> break<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.450> far<00:02:55.110> enough<00:02:55.230> down<00:02:55.410> then

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
if you break it far enough down then

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.550 
if you break it far enough down then
that<00:02:56.670> lock<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.330> not<00:02:57.570> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.959> lock<00:02:58.170> anymore

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
that lock is not going to lock anymore

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.170 
that lock is not going to lock anymore
it's<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.250> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.520> for<00:03:00.000> design<00:03:00.390> I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
it's just going to be for design I

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.310 
it's just going to be for design I
haven't<00:03:03.180> been<00:03:03.300> able<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.660> carry<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.080> nice
