00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.940
 what's up with is welcome back 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.250
 here the star wars battlefront 2 one thing 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.439
 that I just realized is that to Asia 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.210
 how silly the game loads faster than 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.529
 we are battle front 1 but also 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.720
 making ours to phone 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.630
 much nicer in a matter of interface 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.429
 yes I feel it in nothing else to play I am already 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.449
 criticizing the game and making mistakes 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.339
 but well this is good because in addition 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.349
 I want to use these gameplays to 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.570
 continue commenting for all 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 differences between 1 and 2 and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.000
 good what there is to wait for 3 not 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.650
 to start telling you why, why? 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.820
 Many of you ask me when it goes up 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.290
 the 3 well the 3 will be in 2015 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 calculates good it is calculated what 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.990
 announced that it will be together with the output 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.500
 of the new state films then 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.210
 well first in the pc version of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.220
 spend us battlefront 2 has a menu 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.770
 horrible I do not record it because it cuts the 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.780
 recording between battles then not 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.790
 you can see what the menu is but 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.260
 I say that it has a painful menu in which 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.050
 the fund is nothing else 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.700
 of conceptual art then you say but 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.040
 what the hell that little has been worked on 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.420
 however this is curious I have 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 bought this game I bought it in your 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.400
 time for both pc and for ps2 and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.960
 in heavy however you do have a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.970
 Pretty handsome menu I do not know what they did 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.490
 with the pc version I did not like 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.020
 absolutely nothing but another one of the other 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.380
 of the details a little curious that no 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.900
 they improved nothing of him battlefront 2 was 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.090
 the fact that the elite troops 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.720
 they appeared much more in battle and that's why 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.160
 the battles seemed much more unreal 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.520
 let's say that a dark soldier is the 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.110
 elite of the galactic empire is not a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.990
 soldier who do not see each other for three 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.400
 but here in the battlefront 2 the front 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.070
 batting front or even had his 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.620
 large percentage of elite raised him a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.200
 lots of the types of troops and we see a 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.570
 awesome hodgepodge that they call 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.400
 army or this is chaos you do not have 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.110
 an army that are all soldiers of 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.850
 white color of part of the empire but 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.910
 that I do not know about each one is from his father his 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.360
 mother for every soldier you have a 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.130
 engineer a special soldier I do not know of 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.860
 40 thousand things 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.690
 let's say you do not notice how polished or 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.300
 so realistic within what is the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.390
 world of star wars month and I'm 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.070
 putting a little bit purist with 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.220
 all this but it's the good thing though 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.780
 it's also true there are good things 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.480
 the battle backgrounds like for example these 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.630
 light effects not that cool mallet here 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 at the table or some silly detail that does not 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.410
 had the bat the front 1 for example 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.270
 also that is everything much more dynamic 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.860
 see how the windows open and everything 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.890
 that and how it looks all this one won it 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.410
 but still the star wars battlefront 2 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.510
 it's clearly based on water states 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.400
 for one the sense that it's nothing more 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.080
 that something that should have been sold 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.970
 as an expansion plan that is not 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.040
 they had to do from my point of view 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.580
 a second game have changed part 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.930
 of the gameplay to worse for me to seem 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.360
 when really these maps that now 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.010
 same you are seeing really ruland of 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.660
 ruland in the being are going third no 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.400
 because in fact in the states it's going 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.800
 phone I get to download a series of 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.540
 pack of maps that gave you maps of 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.130
 bucket of funds and it was the same 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.890
 uncle or the doors 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.770
 everything was cool I do not understand why 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.560
 demons had to make another game 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.930
 for good for nothing or is there some 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.210
 graphic detail as the lights are 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.030
 some roll of lighting that is 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.000
 some more cool but I really do not think 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.010
 worthy not worth it to 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.020
 the long I was very disappointed with 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.810
 this game but good is also true 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.940
 that came out in 2005 that is, I had a lot 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.490
 of time for years to get them out 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.530
 failures if they had taken another one in 2006 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.300
 Well, who knows, maybe there was 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.220
 finished as call of duty and if you 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.750
 He would have put even more poser or what 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.060
 better would not have ended up improving in 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.780
 something and I would have been forgetting 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.820
 progressively from the failures that have 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.940
 each game and would have enjoyed just what 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.040
 new but the fact is that if I finish it 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.140
 catching a little mania and good and 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.730
 you have seen on my channel that if I record 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.020
 something is this 2 battle frank 1 but now 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.060
 You asked me to beat the front 2 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.130
 well come up I know that also to 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.110
 many people like there are also some 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.110
 Space battle although many people 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.580
 thinks and I at the beginning defended them 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.889
 but in the end I ended up giving the same opinion 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.639
 that are pretty boring 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.990
 They put the trailers as if they are 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.240
 the game trailer of these four 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.069
 photos as if they were to be milk like 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.620
 if I could catch you any ship enter 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.150
 in the cruise and messing in but 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.620
 then you went inside and they were four 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.749
 rooms was not really a ship 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.400
 complete the smaller ships that 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.469
 as in the movies being the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.050
 same model be the same ship was 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:51.529
 really smaller I do not know I could not 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.249
 really feel inside 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:57.619
 of that game experience and what the fuck 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.269
 already a defeat is good because here ends 

00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:01.099
 the gameplay even after having 

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:02.749
 because I do not understand quite well in 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.889
 what to do here to win the 2 at 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:05.179
 better is harder even than 1 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.409
 I also feel that I will have put on 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:10.989
 difficult because I still hope that I have 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.989
 liked all said and until next time
