00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.190
 Hello everyone Hello how are you 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.719
 welcome back to the good channel in 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.730
 this video what I bring you are the 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.800
 favorites of the month of November is worth 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.230
 every month I have chosen as always 5 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.000
 products and nothing else I do not roll up and 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.410
 we started with them comes the first 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.840
 product that I teach you is a product of 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.800
 treatment how good because of my skin 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.359
 super dry I'm having 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.340
 lately you know that I have 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.410
 commented on several videos that I have the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.699
 extremely dry skin good many me 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.890
 you have asked and I take advantage of 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.870
 tell me you asked me what 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.250
 base I use for my dry skin good 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.140
 looking I'm using this face and 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.450
 mac body is the base that best suits me 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.300
 because as you know it has a high 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.640
 percentage of water and that's the least 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.070
 dry is the one that works best for me 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.440
 that less marks me the enzymes or 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.090
 mushrooms that I'm having on the skin and 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.649
 great so the base that I am 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.989
 using and the one that better me right now 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.020
 is this and if I'm not using too 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.149
 is bibi cream the skin 79 that also 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.170
 I'm doing pretty well worth bone that these 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.320
 are the two products that I am 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.330
 using for my skin and good apart 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.490
 of this that these are not favorites but 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.900
 that was just a clarification I'm 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.040
 using a treatment product 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.840
 to embroider 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.130
 to be able to condition my skin and 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.260
 get up with her a little bit more 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.930
 hydrated what I'm using is 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.670
 this baby pad mask that is a 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.820
 Good apple-shaped mask 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.500
 I showed you in a summer hall or something 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.500
 that's how good it comes 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.650
 and see if I can open the mask 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.990
 it's like this is a mask that smells 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.110
 very much very much very much apple 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.260

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.500
 very look at you is a very 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.240
 ligerita is like a gel let's say and this 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.550
 what I do with it is apply what 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.110
 all over my face I do not extend it to 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.770
 of cream but I'm applying it 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.479
 leaving the one that remains product is worth what 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.510
 I'm applying as well as tapping 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.619
 allowing the product to remain worth 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.090
 without extending and this goes dry and we 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 we left it all night since 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.899
 agreement then in the morning when 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.520
 we get up we clear our skin and 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.320
 the skin is super soft and super 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.540
 hydrated to me the truth is that it is not 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.940
 working superbien is going 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.100

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.930
 that from here I send a kiss because 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.450
 I already took it in a video and well she 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.220
 advised me he gave me a hand because I did not know 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.840
 whether to buy it or not and in the end I finished 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.600
 convincing and really that the best 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.340
 What can you do for dry skin 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.410
 sensitive and 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.720
 of this great guy is going great 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.750
 because on top of that it does not take anything away 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.640
 to the skin is very respectful and nothing that 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.709
 it's great so this is the first 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.239

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.569
 continuous third favorite let's go to the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.000
 makeup side according to the third 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.480
 favorite of this month is this brush of the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.300
 real techniques is the blazer 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.040
 and good is favorite this month because he 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.840
 has resumed a bit I usually 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.330
 I usually apply both outline 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.659
 blush as an illuminator with this brush 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.340
 from here that is the 35 sigma that yes 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.409
 it's pretty tiny to apply the 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.629
 Blusher but I is that I've made 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.360
 she has accustomed me to apply it with 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.459
 this brush and I love it but 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.750
 lately, well, I have taken this 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.819

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.349
 happy with her as you see the hair what 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.700

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:15.250
 similar is worth both have in the form of 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.350
 tear or so and it 's good as a 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.789
 You see, it's huge, the truth is that 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.829
 when I bought it, it surprised me in size 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.970
 because I imagined it smaller and 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.000
 good for blusher is great 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.100
 Singing is super soft it blends very 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.810
 well the product with her and I'm 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.539

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.560
 sleep of all kinds I love this 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.410
 I also think that aesthetics 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.840
 It is very beautiful also that is the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.849
 mango rose, well, we always like it 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.800
 plus 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.959
 and nothing I tell you that super hair 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.849
 soft I love no favorite room 

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:49.469
 this month is a gel lainer that I've 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.110
 tried a little bit ago that he gave it to me 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:54.920
 garage and thank you so much dad and it's the 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.580
 headliner from here 3 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.960
 It is a gel line to super super creamy 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.450
 pretty pretty black man yes that is 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.030
 true that now as it is just 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.590
 started that is super creamy I have it 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.180
 have to take a couple of passes for me 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.130
 is the intensity of black that I 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.100
 I want because I like that the delineated 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.690
 it is quite black but still it is 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.280
 a product that I love is very very 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.650
 similar to that is what happens is that 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.090
 the medium of that is already super dry and the 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.880
 truth is that this one has enchanted me 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.190
 I really like it and I tell you super creamy 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.910
 easy to apply what I usually apply with a 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.730
 beveled brush of this type or that of 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.890
 essence is worth nothing and very charming with him 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.920
 I think the price is something higher than 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.890
 the essence but the quality out there 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.270
 They walk great this gel diner and the last 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.400
 product that I recommend this month 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.080
 last favorite are the powders for 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.210
 outline which ones are you used 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.940
 practically throughout the month they are 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.540
 the hoola powders of benefit that the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.360
 I bought created in October if I 'm not 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.009
 wrong and nothing that is store nothing with 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.860

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.469
 right now I'm not wearing it I take it to 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.210
 banic but these in particular I like 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:08.149
 very much because they are totally matte 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.430
 for clear skins go great because no 

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:12.710
 There was so much difference in the tone of the 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.169
 Contour to the tone of the skin are blurred 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.790
 perfectly and it's a super super tone 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.400
 natural 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.220

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.830
 Very thin very easy to apply easy to 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.350
 blur and packaging for what to say 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.540
 from him the paganinis of benefit all me 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.960
 chiflan seems to me super monkeys with his 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.940
 brochita and with its mirror and yes they are 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.400
 something expensive but I think it deserves 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.050
 Sorry, I recommend it and nothing 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.900
