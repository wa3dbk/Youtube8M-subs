00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
i'm recording this in my PVR so it

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.200 
i'm recording this in my PVR so it
captures<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:42.020> whole<00:01:42.200> screen<00:01:42.880> as<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.060> see

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210

they<00:01:44.360> do<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.990> same<00:01:46.030> pass<00:01:47.030> rush<00:01:47.330> every<00:01:48.080> time

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.570 

some<00:01:51.590> people<00:01:51.619> thought<00:01:52.130> that<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.400> was

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
some people thought that I was

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.410 
some people thought that I was
controlling<00:01:53.710> Leslie<00:01:54.710> O'Neill<00:01:55.070> but<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:56.270> is

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
controlling Leslie O'Neill but that is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.990 
controlling Leslie O'Neill but that is
not<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.630> case

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.890 

as<00:02:02.600> we<00:02:02.840> can<00:02:02.990> clearly<00:02:03.230> see<00:02:03.620> here<00:02:03.950> excuse<00:02:04.670> me

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
as we can clearly see here excuse me

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.770 
as we can clearly see here excuse me
they<00:02:05.900> will<00:02:06.110> do<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.470> same<00:02:07.179> animation<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.539> same

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
they will do the same animation the same

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.220 
they will do the same animation the same
type<00:02:09.229> of<00:02:09.729> pass<00:02:10.729> rush<00:02:12.490> again<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.700> again<00:02:14.230> this

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
type of pass rush again and again this

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.100 
type of pass rush again and again this
does<00:02:15.500> not<00:02:15.680> happen<00:02:15.950> on<00:02:16.220> every<00:02:16.820> play<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:17.960> it

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
does not happen on every play but it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.580 
does not happen on every play but it
does<00:02:18.320> happen<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:19.610> this<00:02:20.570> game<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.170> I'm<00:02:21.320> showing

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
does happen in this game and I'm showing

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.010 
does happen in this game and I'm showing
that<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.640> happening<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:25.720> think<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.870> only

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
that it it's happening I think it only

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.280 
that it it's happening I think it only
happens<00:02:27.620> when<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:28.420> crashed<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.690> certain<00:02:30.020> size

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
happens when you crashed a certain size

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.860 
happens when you crashed a certain size
but<00:02:30.709> this<00:02:30.920> crash<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.610> unrealistic<00:02:32.480> no

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
but this crash is unrealistic no

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.580 
but this crash is unrealistic no
defensive<00:02:33.590> line<00:02:33.880> crashes<00:02:34.880> like<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.390> as<00:02:35.590> you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
defensive line crashes like this as you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.729 
defensive line crashes like this as you
see<00:02:36.770> everyone<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.280> in<00:02:37.459> man<00:02:38.270> coverage<00:02:38.739> some

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
there they go again and they will get

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.640 
there they go again and they will get
the<00:04:35.690> sack<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:38.210> let's<00:04:38.479> see<00:04:38.720> exactly<00:04:39.020> how<00:04:39.409> they

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
got the sack let's look at the offensive

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.649 
got the sack let's look at the offensive
line<00:04:42.680> it's<00:04:43.069> not<00:04:43.220> not<00:04:43.430> just<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:44.180> defensive

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659 
line it's not not just the defensive

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:51.670 
line it's not not just the defensive
line<00:04:44.919> but<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.099> offensive<00:04:46.580> line<00:04:50.500> both<00:04:51.500> the

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
line but the offensive line both the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.420 
line but the offensive line both the
offensive<00:04:52.099> and<00:04:52.460> defensive<00:04:53.060> line<00:04:53.330> is

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
offensive and defensive line is

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:02.409 
offensive and defensive line is
unrealistic<00:04:55.430> on<00:04:55.759> this<00:04:56.120> play<00:05:00.849> there's<00:05:01.849> no<00:05:02.150> way

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
unrealistic on this play there's no way

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.809 
unrealistic on this play there's no way
a<00:05:03.460> defensive<00:05:04.460> line<00:05:05.409> crashes<00:05:06.409> like<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:06.979> they

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
a defensive line crashes like this they

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.279 
a defensive line crashes like this they
can<00:05:08.060> cries<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.569> the<00:05:08.690> right<00:05:08.870> or<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.169> left

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
can cries to the right or to the left

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.610 
can cries to the right or to the left
but<00:05:09.620> not<00:05:09.650> like<00:05:10.099> this<00:05:10.130> they<00:05:10.460> don't<00:05:10.639> do<00:05:10.819> this<00:05:11.060> and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
but not like this they don't do this and

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.140 
but not like this they don't do this and
the<00:05:12.620> offensive<00:05:13.039> line<00:05:13.190> don't<00:05:13.639> just<00:05:13.849> stand

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150
