00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.540
 hi everyone how about in today's video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.400
 I want to show you two orders that I made to 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.500
 a web page called kawaii 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.679
 sochiapan and the truth is that the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.690
 I recommend a lot because the expenses of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.800
 shipping are quite cheap taking 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.810
 notice that the material arrives 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.780
 directly from japan a girl takes him 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.430
 very nice that is called mickey and the truth 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.820
 what is the web page and especially 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.120
 stickers and memo pads at a super price 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.470
 well so I recommend it to start 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.730
 in the first order 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.710
 I got this already stuffed expert from 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.840
 a character that I love and the truth 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.060
 that I do not have any material from him 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.630
 because it's pretty hard to get 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.470
 is how we shrink is a character of 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.790
 sant ex and as you can see it is a budgie 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.790
 not too big 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.890
 a chain 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.840
 and he has a tango in his mouth 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.370
 and good 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.370
 I saw it on the website 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.600
 we were very good at a good price 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.600
 I decided to buy it 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.450
 then I asked for four minimum maps for 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.830
 you 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.830
 this would be the first 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.170
 with this design 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.390
 these same packs are not from xanax are from 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.570
 other companies and the truth is that I had 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.890
 want to have memo pads from another 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.910
 company not to advance the former 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.000
 because the truth that they also have 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.500
 very nice designs 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.730
 and other characters 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.730
 this would be the second 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.130
 with this design 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.220
 make me maps of kittens 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.530
 in this design 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.720
 and the last pair that is my favorite 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.720
 it's funny 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.780
 here it's supposed to put 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.870
 what I have to do better I do it 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.470
 morning siesta bunny like that with very very 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.910
 tired 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.910
 this is the king of design 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.730
 and the second 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.900
 then in this first period I also 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:04.330
 you order five bags of stickers that now 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.810
 I really wanted to have some 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.790
 22 bags and they are precious all 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.079
 this is the first 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.290
 from the company mine wave which is the 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.420
 true that he has the designs for me 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.849
 most beautiful taste 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.920
 and these are all the stickers that 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.650
 they come in normally in this 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.370
 format usually come a big sticker 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.569
 what is this and then five designs 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.500
 normal let's say paper and five 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.640
 bright designs 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.770
 I do not know if with the light of day 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.570
 but this is one of my favorite topics 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.900
 this is the second one that is also my 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.900
 way 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.910
 these are the ones in this one do not sell the 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.400
 designs 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.890
 but it's very similar to the one I showed you 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.280
 right now 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.280
 This is the third packet of bunnies 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.040
 and these are the designs 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.010
 I hope you can appreciate it well 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.630
 and this is not the fourth 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.709
 of kittens 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.930
 you are a company called 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.960
 very strong that also has some designs 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.639
 very cute kittens 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.639
 and the last one is this 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.930
 Why so many animals and Estes 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.580
 also with all the lost this girl 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.590
 It usually includes a lot of 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.349
 look at the cue that includes me in 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.490
 this first order a lot of pages 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:52.759
 of very varied maps with many 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.379
 characters like the mummy when to teach 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.370
 all because it would take a lot but 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.849
 burning 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.789
 a good taco 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.789
 and this would be your card 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.610
 anyway I leave the link in the 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.710
 description box 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.449
 it made just a week after 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.910
 another request on this page because the 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.520
 girl 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:20.070
 with new ones 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.680
 map models and I fell in love with these 2 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.410
 it is a character of sanz ex that 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.960
 it would be called a little is a super cat 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.810
 garden as you can see and good the truth 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.330
 I love it and I really want it 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.350
 of having these maps a long time ago and not 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.130
 I could resist asking for them 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.130
 design 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.930
 This is the one that I love 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.320
 As you can see, there is a heart stain on 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.639
 the back 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.409
 Super good 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.409
 and this other 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.960
 this design 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:08.220
 the part I asked also 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.600
 and four other bags of stickers because 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.190
 You will see that it has a super price 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.690
 cheap on the fish website 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.790
 they are in dollars but if you do the 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.100
 conversion on any page of 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.810
 internet conversion you will see that it is that 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.370
 They are super good prices compared to 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.249
 the prices that other websites have 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:27.600
 then it's really worth it 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:31.430
 this will be the first bag 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.430
 yes god if the companies 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.630
 I think it's japan change but I do not see it 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.260
 now 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.260
 these are the designs 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.050
 and then ask for this other 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:56.009
 super sweet with pastel colors and these 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:58.220
 are the designs I love very varied 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.770
 This is a walk 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:04.230
 the other company I say in case I do not know what 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.620
 they look at you out there 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:09.240
 this is another design 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.310
 this very strong 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.610
 and so with musical notes and different 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.360
 very funny animals 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.360
 and this is the last 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:24.440
 that the change is already damme 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.440

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.620

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.400
 paper - you recorded earlier I suppose 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.180

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.180
 I dont know 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.080
 could put less weight in the package or 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:49.129
 something like that but good as well 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.360

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:51.949
