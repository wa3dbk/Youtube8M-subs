00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello everyone I wanted to talk to you about 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.040
 him at ps that I showed to some 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.199
 made from a min combo so 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.070
 we sail finished with the little 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.820
 suspends security the scratch hollow 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.820
 the antenna that is protected 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:49.790
 so we will turn on both screens will be 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:56.960
 by the invisibility to the wells in the 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:58.940
 so moon modification to the miners 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.940
 on a mini combo just disassemble it 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.500
 and solder a little gps chip that gets 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.630
 order for twenty euros on 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.850
 on ebay ca weld ensure one on one 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.330
 port that is provided a serial port that is 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.590
 above you have to know how to weld me 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.420
 just that he did it I asked 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.000
 to duke to do it 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 and then after just get out 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.619
 this chip to put it there I led 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.909
 in a silicone paste date brand 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.930
 sugrue is about his followers this is 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.580
 beefy so that's it there is another 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 debate is not hack case on 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.689
 falls directly on the window 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.970
 start up on the start screen in 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.320
 so has four buttons down nickel 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.140
 it's to go back to the configuration 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.539
 original kobo min but when it is 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.850
 restart the restart on your dough 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.310
 still roofs is to manage 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.899
 wifi networks and boots and for the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.340
 restart when it is blocked by 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.899
 example that power of it's for 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.310
 turn it off 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:08.459
 so we're going to fly and load them 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.649
 files a mole hatsune version 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.649
 of excess goes out for black and white 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.620
 which is that was originally developed 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.730
 for the nook and then its developer 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.900
 adapt it to the kobo so there we fall 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.139
 on the window the space o'shea so we 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:36.219
 will say to the foot today that he did 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:36.219
 fixed gps one is a black background 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.599
 so your dough is a little different from 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:48.049
 top level accessories makes them the 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:52.250
 menus the key mc2 menu so that allows 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:55.489
 to have quick access to the menu with 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.669
 windows that are more intuitive we're going 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.669
 say 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.810
 this is the zoom plus me all 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.370
 simply 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.359
 and then sc can see that the map 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.010
 and when we come back to her 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.310
 had me the settings for the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.750
 program but here I said there space 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.310
 Arian much meantime we 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.159
 does not advance there is no milk from these 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.970
 thigh norms yohan the display of 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.500
 capitalism tags that and contradicts 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.780
 when we do cros for example 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.199
 distance ibres the free distance from 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.379
 the takeoff point is displayed here 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:36.579
 So here here so you can 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.579
 see in super brightness 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.770
 I found all the information on 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.800
 informally I can put the link 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.200
 if there are any who are interested I can 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.569
 you also list the components 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.700
 have things to do tasks to 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.489
 realize to restart the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.230
 system it's a bit complicated 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.459
 when we see a lot of time 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.900
 to understand once it's done 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.180
 in fact it's pretty simple and fast if 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.590
 I had to do it again starting from 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.209
 zero the blind if I think I can the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.510
 to go in a quarter of an hour 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.590
 it's over these cases not too much of 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.319
 hack once it's done there 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.739
 more hack at all the updates to 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.970
 day are done on the map sd 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.100
 just plug it on 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.990
 computer for access to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.720
 files and gc it's great it's top 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.190
 in terms of drums the guys who have me 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.870
 used me I've never used 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.070
 a long time but apparently you 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.190
 original battery we hold this 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.530
 hour 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.610
 to confirm with the temperature too 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.200
 in any case you can connect a 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.520
 additional battery his little paul 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.450
 explained here and then he went back to 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.650
 a number of hours what so 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.080
 so here are all at his request 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.150
 attested but it's something that me 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.130
 seems that they seemed a lot of 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.260
 all so that's why I did 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.950
 a video for to uninterested 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.450
 possible if we have especially compared 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.020
 at prices in fact one must know that a 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.740
 group vomits its 50 euros we find them 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.470
 more to the fnac 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.330
 we still find them on amazon if we do not 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.760
 also finds them a mahatma locker 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.170
 not bad on the many have them 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.420
 means to find also in the 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.700
 easy cash and company stores I think 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.960
 for not very expensive we will say between 30 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:29.150
 and 50 euros on mini cobo today 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.680
 the smart gps and twenty euros 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.320
 so just the assault of the on a 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.000
 port and that with kaka of yarn she was 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.800
 electric and a fifth son who is going 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.340
 on a place my hand share it's not 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.200
 mandatory 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.430
 I issued anyway but it's up to 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.560
 crying it will not be required 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.680
 after that you have to close everything with 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.200
 daring holes to shoulder him son and 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.520
 the gps chip and then with this little 4 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.550
 seems well adapted 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.700
 since the story and is curly so 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.220
 So here is an axis interested 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.240
 do not hesitate to ask me questions 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.020
 and then I wish you a good Sunday 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.020
 Hi
