you know this but our sello bags have a

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.990 
you know this but our sello bags have a
ribbing<00:04:41.740> on<00:04:41.830> one<00:04:42.100> side<00:04:42.370> where<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.790> bag<00:04:42.970> is

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
ribbing on one side where the bag is

ribbing on one side where the bag is
closed<00:04:43.540> and<00:04:43.900> then<00:04:44.470> it's<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.800> solid<00:04:45.130> on<00:04:45.580> the

closed and then it's a solid on the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.210 
closed and then it's a solid on the
other<00:04:45.880> side<00:04:46.210> where<00:04:46.480> there's<00:04:46.660> no<00:04:46.870> ribbing<00:04:47.290> so<00:04:48.190> I

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
other side where there's no ribbing so I

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.240 
other side where there's no ribbing so I
always<00:04:48.640> put<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:48.910> ribbing<00:04:49.300> on<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.540> back<00:04:53.250> slide

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
always put the ribbing on the back slide

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.420 
always put the ribbing on the back slide
that<00:04:54.520> in<00:04:55.200> like<00:04:56.200> that<00:04:56.380> now<00:04:56.950> we<00:04:57.010> want<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.340> go
