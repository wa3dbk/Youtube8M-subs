 let's see how it is done 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.020
 start by taking the cardboard more 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.930
 thick and measure and mark two squares of 9 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.930
 x 9 centimeters then cut the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.800
 you will have your two squares of 9 x 9 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.570
 centimeters 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.710
 put them aside and take the cardboard from 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.960
 another color in it measures and marks 3 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.490

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.100
 centimeters after cut you'll have 3 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.510
 squares of 15 x 15 centimeters each 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.960
 one 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.070
 take one and fold it in half 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.070
 make sure to mark the fold well 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.020
 have a fold in half so 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.760
 vertical flips your picture and returns to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.760
 mark the fold in the same way 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.070
 you will have two folds forming a cross 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.200
 Take the bottom corner and take it 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.950

 It is the same with the other paintings 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.330
