00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
accent cushions what do I choose this

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.550 
accent cushions what do I choose this
just<00:02:48.180> makes<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.569> lot<00:02:48.720> easier<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.260> gives<00:02:49.440> it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
just makes it a lot easier it gives it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.930 
just makes it a lot easier it gives it
that<00:02:49.590> double<00:02:50.010> layer<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.610> little<00:02:50.819> bit

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
that double layer so it's a little bit

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.030 
that double layer so it's a little bit
more<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.390> depth<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.799> wouldn't
