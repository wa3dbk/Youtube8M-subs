00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.160
 correspondent Ruslan Idrisov on himself 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.980
 checked the quality of the foreign mechanism 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.070
 and found out how safe the popular 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.070
 attraction 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.949
 new morning begins with a technical 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.070
 attraction inspection every bolt must 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.880
 be in place nuts tighten as 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.040
 can be tighter 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.170
 workers admit that daily 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.629
 verification is not a process that often 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.460
 make for a tick here realize 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.590

 decided to conquer the roller coaster 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.879
 every morning for safe operation 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.140
 we check my machines, that is, we take 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.739
 sacking bag it weighs about 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.230
 the average weight of a person is 50 kilograms 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.500
 load into the machine and it goes through a cycle 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.170
 that is, three circles are driven around in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.790
 idle with this bag operators here 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.350
 the attraction is joking that every one 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.790
 multi-colored cars has its 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.799
 unique character 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.990
 1 calm other cheeky with 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.880
 feature 3 has not yet decided 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.340
 what is obvious is that in whatever car 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.860
 you did not drive after one lap is already difficult 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.320
 stand on your feet about right for 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.100
 older kids shit so cool 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.400
 German-made attraction 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.590
 purchased in Belarus 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.110
 before that he worked there now on him 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.240
 Karaganda people ride but for its quality 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.390
 answers not only manufacturers but also 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.460
 security complex founders 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.510
 we can say that yes he will give enough 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.180
 reliably 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.950
 mounts rechecked before running 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 before installing this reassembly 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.430
 the attraction is collected by people coming 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.820
 from Belarus 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.510
 chief-installation and it turns out we all each of 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.570
 and every connection every video 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.770
 chassis machine all and rechecking 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.649
 there will lead an ambush 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.200
 he is known for his roller coaster 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.750
 all over the world with the states themselves such 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.660
 attraction called otherwise roller coaster 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.280
 however, they have the same concept 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.980
 exciting attraction of this series 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.260
 is in japan for its scale it 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.450
 even listed in the Guinness Book of Records 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.610
 despite the fact that booths on it 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.680
 detached from the rail and kept only on 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.319
 magnetic tape attraction all the same 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.599
 called safe but when included 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.670
 people died or were injured 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.720
 At such attractions were in many 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.069
 countries of the world including Kazakhstan 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.290
 the reliability of the rides depends on their 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.120
 operation is obtained as you will 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.299
 follow him so he will work if 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.370
 these rides they don't 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.140
 do not forgive in negligence even 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.180
 administration traction claim that 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.370
 riding it does not represent any 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.739
 the dangers of Karaganda divided into 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.579
 those who are behind the steep hills and those who 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.980
 prefers them good old carousel 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.890
 let's say i 'm afraid i wouldn't go and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.170
 children would not let go there I think that 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.319
 good and against adrenaline 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.710
 I'm still here , then I can of course 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.720
 alarming and bodily there 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.520
 No, but I probably took a chance though the questions 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.400
 no one is safe from 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.930
 accident when you ride on 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.150
 rollercoaster first time adrenaline 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.040
 really rolls over just want 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.200
 close your eyes as for attachment 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.210
 there is only one locking rail 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.760
 how dangerous is the attraction each 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.740
 the visitor decides for himself only if you are not 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.570
 afraid of height and speed then 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.260
 roller coaster you will certainly 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.390
