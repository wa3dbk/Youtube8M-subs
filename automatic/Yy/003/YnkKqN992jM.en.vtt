00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
now to just kind of investigate the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
now to just kind of investigate the
animals<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.210> aren't<00:00:51.390> doing<00:00:51.510> well<00:00:51.809> they're

animals just aren't doing well they're

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.600 
animals just aren't doing well they're
losing<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.800> few<00:00:52.949> more<00:00:53.160> than<00:00:53.309> they'd<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.580> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
losing a few more than they'd like to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.100 
losing a few more than they'd like to
see<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.510> would<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:54.900> to<00:00:54.930> try<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
see and we would just want to try to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.720 
see and we would just want to try to
figure<00:00:55.290> out<00:00:55.410> why<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> animals<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.519> getting

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
figure out why the animals are getting

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.310 
figure out why the animals are getting
sick<00:00:56.909> so<00:00:57.119> we're<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.479> to<00:00:57.540> look<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:58.019> pigs

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
sick so we're going to look at the pigs

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.240 
sick so we're going to look at the pigs
that<00:00:58.409> are<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.650> through<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.920> nursery

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that are going through the nursery

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.920 
that are going through the nursery
basically<00:00:59.760> investigating<00:01:00.299> the<00:01:00.479> younger<00:01:00.750> pigs

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
basically investigating the younger pigs

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.060 
basically investigating the younger pigs
and<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.409> there's<00:01:01.530> something<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:01.949> do

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and see if there's something we can do

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
and see if there's something we can do
there<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.239> older<00:01:03.449> pigs<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.809> turn

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
there to make the older pigs in turn

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.560 
there to make the older pigs in turn
healthier<00:01:04.830> down<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> road<00:01:05.570> biosecurity

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
healthier down the road biosecurity

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
healthier down the road biosecurity
definitely<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.260> channel<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> challenge

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
definitely can be channel a challenge

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.140 
definitely can be channel a challenge
especially<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> day<00:01:09.000> like

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
especially when you have a day like

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.000 
especially when you have a day like
today<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.450> look<00:01:09.659> outside<00:01:09.990> we've<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
today you look outside we've got you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.760 
today you look outside we've got you
know<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.250> foggy<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.030> roads<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.390> sloppy<00:01:12.770> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
know it's foggy the roads are sloppy the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.200 
know it's foggy the roads are sloppy the
snow<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.159> starting<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> melt<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:14.939> got<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> lot

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
snow is starting to melt so we got a lot

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.149 
snow is starting to melt so we got a lot
of<00:01:15.240> mud<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.689> we're<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.680> tracking<00:01:16.950> in

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
of mud that we're you know tracking in

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.100 
of mud that we're you know tracking in
and<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.490> barns<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:17.850> well<00:01:18.030> there's<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.840> bench

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and out of barns as well there's a bench

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.359 
and out of barns as well there's a bench
that<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.439> sit<00:01:19.619> down<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.860> take<00:01:19.979> our<00:01:20.040> shoes<00:01:20.250> off

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that we sit down and take our shoes off

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.130 
that we sit down and take our shoes off
so<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> good<00:01:20.909> hard<00:01:21.150> line<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:22.020> were

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so we have a good hard line that were

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
so we have a good hard line that were
absolutely<00:01:22.979> positive<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.549> not

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
absolutely positive that we're not

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149 
absolutely positive that we're not
crossing<00:01:24.290> part<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.470> procedures<00:01:25.890> will

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
crossing part of that procedures will

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.800 
crossing part of that procedures will
actually<00:01:26.430> shower<00:01:26.670> into<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> barn<00:01:27.270> right

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
actually shower into the barn right

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.930 
actually shower into the barn right
there<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.140> entryway<00:01:28.409> before<00:01:28.830> we<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.190> we

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
there in the entryway before we go in we

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.940 
there in the entryway before we go in we
got<00:01:30.090> clean<00:01:30.330> hands<00:01:30.600> clean<00:01:30.780> hair<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.410> clean

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.410 
clothes and that's the number one best
way<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.470> ensure<00:01:35.010> that<00:01:35.040> we're<00:01:35.310> not

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
way that we can ensure that we're not

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.750 
way that we can ensure that we're not
inadvertently<00:01:36.420> tracking<00:01:36.840> anything

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
inadvertently tracking anything

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.040 
inadvertently tracking anything
basically<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:39.450> we're<00:01:39.570> seeing<00:01:39.780> here

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
basically I think what we're seeing here

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.840 
basically I think what we're seeing here
today<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:40.980> just<00:01:41.190> kind<00:01:41.370> of<00:01:41.400> based<00:01:41.580> on<00:01:41.760> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
today you know just kind of based on the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.820 
today you know just kind of based on the
visual<00:01:42.150> assessment<00:01:42.480> it<00:01:43.470> does<00:01:43.620> look<00:01:43.800> like

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
visual assessment it does look like

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.890 
visual assessment it does look like
we're<00:01:44.159> seeing<00:01:44.400> more<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.030> acute<00:01:45.360> stage<00:01:45.690> of

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
we're seeing more of the acute stage of

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.880 
we're seeing more of the acute stage of
the<00:01:45.990> disease

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the disease

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
the disease
that<00:01:47.220> means<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.940> what<00:01:48.300> we're<00:01:48.420> seeing<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that means that the what we're seeing is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.180 
that means that the what we're seeing is
the<00:01:48.900> very<00:01:49.080> front<00:01:49.350> end<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.650> disease<00:01:49.950> here

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
the very front end of the disease here

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.830 
the very front end of the disease here
and<00:01:50.370> I<00:01:50.400> think<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:51.090> might<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.300> starting<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.750> get

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and I think we might be starting to get

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.450 
and I think we might be starting to get
to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.080> root<00:01:52.260> cause<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.740> where<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> where<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
to the root cause of where the where the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.520 
to the root cause of where the where the
problem<00:01:53.880> came<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.080> pig<00:01:55.320> that's

sick this is one that's in need of
treatment<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.900> just<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.350> doing
