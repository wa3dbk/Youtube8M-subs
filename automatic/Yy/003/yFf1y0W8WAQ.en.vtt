hello and welcome to how to draw with

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.650 
hello and welcome to how to draw with
colored<00:00:03.210> pencils<00:00:03.290> lesson<00:00:04.290> 3<00:00:04.529> iRiver<00:00:05.310> we<00:00:06.299> start

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
colored pencils lesson 3 iRiver we start

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.790 
colored pencils lesson 3 iRiver we start
with<00:00:06.870> drawing<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.589> shape<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> letter

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
with drawing in shape of the letter

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.850 
with drawing in shape of the letter
until<00:00:10.800> end<00:00:11.099> stuff<00:00:11.400> lemon

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.160 

so<00:00:17.860> basically<00:00:18.250> as<00:00:18.520> you<00:00:18.820> can<00:00:19.030> see<00:00:19.300> by<00:00:20.110> the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
so basically as you can see by the

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.770 
so basically as you can see by the
driver<00:00:20.680> but<00:00:20.830> this<00:00:20.950> far<00:00:21.160> away<00:00:21.430> is<00:00:22.090> smaller<00:00:22.480> and

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
driver but this far away is smaller and

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.040 
driver but this far away is smaller and
the<00:00:22.840> pilot<00:00:23.440> is<00:00:23.470> closer<00:00:23.800> to<00:00:23.950> us<00:00:24.119> again<00:00:25.119> this<00:00:25.810> way

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
the pilot is closer to us again this way

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.860 
the pilot is closer to us again this way
you<00:00:26.470> create<00:00:26.680> an<00:00:26.980> illusion<00:00:27.130> of<00:00:27.369> depth

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:28.870 
you create an illusion of depth

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.590 
you create an illusion of depth
I<00:00:28.900> like<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.860> feel<00:00:30.010> with<00:00:30.130> area<00:00:30.430> was<00:00:30.580> cold<00:00:30.850> to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
I like to feel with area was cold to

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.430 
I like to feel with area was cold to
have<00:00:31.660> this<00:00:31.900> all<00:00:32.140> of<00:00:32.890> how<00:00:33.130> things<00:00:33.460> he<00:00:33.730> looked

basically<00:00:54.149> happen<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.410> we're<00:00:56.100> gonna<00:00:56.219> draw

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
basically happen to be we're gonna draw

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.100 
basically happen to be we're gonna draw
the<00:00:56.519> plans<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.239> closer<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.750> us

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
the plans that are closer to us

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.119 
the plans that are closer to us
bigger<00:00:58.489> Atlanta<00:00:59.489> further<00:01:00.089> away<00:01:00.390> smaller<00:01:01.129> just

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
bigger Atlanta further away smaller just

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.820 
bigger Atlanta further away smaller just
like<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.460> drew

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.850 

as<00:01:09.280> you<00:01:09.430> can<00:01:09.550> see<00:01:09.730> nothing<00:01:10.120> very<00:01:10.330> difficult<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
as you can see nothing very difficult to

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:22.200 
as you can see nothing very difficult to
draw<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.100> paths<00:01:12.430> just<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:13.000> usual<00:01:13.150> self

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:36.640 

you

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.860 

so<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.370> whole<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.700> side<00:01:38.730> and<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:39.750> do

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
so we do the whole right side and we do

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:48.810 
so we do the whole right side and we do
the<00:01:39.960> same

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.780 

you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.070 

finally<00:01:54.790> we<00:01:55.090> can<00:01:55.210> begin<00:01:55.390> withdrawing<00:01:55.720> your

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
finally we can begin withdrawing your

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.520 
finally we can begin withdrawing your
order

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
order

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.200 
order
you<00:01:56.980> know<00:01:57.070> when<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.310> feel<00:01:57.520> blue<00:01:57.790> everywhere

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
you know when to feel blue everywhere

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.760 
you know when to feel blue everywhere
since<00:01:59.580> since<00:02:00.580> leaving<00:02:00.820> wide<00:02:01.240> areas<00:02:01.990> as<00:02:02.710> a

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
since since leaving wide areas as a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.580 
since since leaving wide areas as a
reflection<00:02:03.400> of<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.820> clouds<00:02:04.120> in<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.480> sky<00:02:04.590> will

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
reflection of the clouds in the sky will

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
reflection of the clouds in the sky will
make<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.220> whole<00:02:06.430> view<00:02:06.910> more<00:02:07.240> interesting

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:52.420 

we

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.369 

just<00:02:53.430> adding<00:02:53.700> some<00:02:54.000> shades<00:02:54.269> here<00:02:54.569> there<00:02:54.900> to

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
just adding some shades here there to

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:10.620 
just adding some shades here there to
create<00:02:55.769> contrast

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.500 

now<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.200> can<00:03:11.440> start<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.070> second<00:03:12.970> layer<00:03:13.150> of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
now I can start and second layer of

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.190 
now I can start and second layer of
green<00:03:13.960> there<00:03:14.620> many<00:03:15.190> plans<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:16.720> make<00:03:16.750> them<00:03:17.020> more

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
green there many plans to make them more

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.030 
green there many plans to make them more
prominently<00:03:17.890> visible
