00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.630 
heater core to get the this long bolt
that<00:01:17.409> goes<00:01:17.439> through<00:01:17.860> or<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:20.070> gas<00:01:21.070> pedal<00:01:21.310> and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
that goes through or the gas pedal and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.270 
that goes through or the gas pedal and
break<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:23.049> I<00:01:23.080> decided<00:01:23.530> not<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.799> do<00:01:23.920> that<00:01:24.070> I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
break but I decided not to do that I

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.120 
break but I decided not to do that I
just<00:01:24.630> fabricated<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.720> mount<00:01:25.960> for<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.770> left

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
just fabricated a mount for the left

connected up easiest way to do it is
just<00:02:52.780> drop<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.380> engine<00:02:53.500> transmission<00:02:53.920> out<00:02:54.190> at

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
just drop the engine transmission out at

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.780 
just drop the engine transmission out at
the<00:02:54.340> bottom<00:02:54.670> swap<00:02:55.570> it<00:02:55.780> put<00:02:56.230> back<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.620> as<00:02:57.459> far<00:02:57.700> as

the same bolt pattern is the same simple
clutch<00:03:12.670> cable<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:19.090> probably<00:03:19.299> can't<00:03:19.600> see<00:03:19.690> it

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
clutch cable you probably can't see it

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
cable the on IX have a pop out and you

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.189 
cable the on IX have a pop out and you
just<00:03:26.049> pop<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.919> right<00:03:27.010> out<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.459> put<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.329> clutch

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
just pop it right out and put the clutch

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:35.260 
just pop it right out and put the clutch
linkage<00:03:29.410> in<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:32.260> was<00:03:32.380> simple<00:03:32.739> um

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
linkage in that was simple um

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.130 
linkage in that was simple um
I<00:03:37.300> think<00:03:38.300> that's<00:03:40.210> pretty<00:03:41.210> much<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.480> simple

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
I think that's pretty much it simple

and<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.500> just<00:04:18.650> fabricate<00:04:19.340> something<00:04:19.580> for<00:04:19.820> the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
and you just fabricate something for the
