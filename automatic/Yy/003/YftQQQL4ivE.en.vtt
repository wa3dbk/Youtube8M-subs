here's the next part of my scale drift
project<00:00:22.910> so<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> cage<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.420> fully<00:00:24.660> painted<00:00:24.990> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
project so the cage is fully painted I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.950 
project so the cage is fully painted I
was<00:00:25.769> smart<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.279> made<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> cage<00:00:27.269> screw<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
was smart I made the cage screw to the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.080 
was smart I made the cage screw to the
body<00:00:28.170> conveniently<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> old<00:00:29.670> screw

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.270 

it's<00:00:44.540> still<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.810> little<00:00:44.930> wonky<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:45.740> it'll<00:00:46.100> take

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
it's still a little wonky so it'll take

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.220 
it's still a little wonky so it'll take
a<00:00:46.310> little<00:00:46.520> bit<00:00:46.640> more<00:00:46.760> work<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.750> get<00:00:47.900> things<00:00:48.110> to

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
a little bit more work to get things to

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.250 
a little bit more work to get things to
line<00:00:48.380> up<00:00:48.530> properly

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.569 

the<00:00:54.260> headlight<00:00:54.530> pop-up<00:00:54.920> is<00:00:55.070> controlled<00:00:55.429> by<00:00:55.489> a

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
the headlight pop-up is controlled by a

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.270 
the headlight pop-up is controlled by a
small<00:00:55.789> servo<00:00:56.359> I<00:00:56.570> can<00:00:57.260> adjust<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.829> end<00:00:57.980> point

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
small servo I can adjust the end point

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.639 
small servo I can adjust the end point
to<00:00:58.460> make<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:58.940> headlight<00:00:59.300> sleepy<00:00:59.780> like<00:01:00.079> all

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
to make the headlight sleepy like all

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.759 
to make the headlight sleepy like all
the<00:01:01.039> mad<00:01:01.280> rx-7<00:01:02.239> drifters<00:01:02.600> I've<00:01:02.719> seen<00:01:02.929> in<00:01:03.559> order

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
the mad rx-7 drifters I've seen in order

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.170 
the mad rx-7 drifters I've seen in order
for<00:01:03.920> that<00:01:03.979> realistic<00:01:04.430> look<00:01:04.549> I<00:01:04.670> had<00:01:04.759> to<00:01:04.820> somehow

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
for that realistic look I had to somehow

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.429 
for that realistic look I had to somehow
turn<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.600> headlights<00:01:05.780> off<00:01:06.020> when<00:01:06.380> the

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
turn the headlights off when the

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.020 
turn the headlights off when the
housings<00:01:06.770> move<00:01:06.920> down<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.520> found<00:01:07.729> this<00:01:07.850> old

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
housings move down so I found this old

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.730 
housings move down so I found this old
switch<00:01:08.360> in<00:01:08.509> my<00:01:08.600> electronics<00:01:09.110> store<00:01:09.320> the

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
switch in my electronics store the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.380 
switch in my electronics store the
switch<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.070> three<00:01:10.340> thongs<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.149> can<00:01:11.270> be

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
switch is three thongs and can be

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.389 
switch is three thongs and can be
configured<00:01:11.869> either<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.740> is<00:01:12.830> on<00:01:13.070> when<00:01:13.310> you

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
configured either it is on when you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.859 
configured either it is on when you
click<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.000> when<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.270> click<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:14.600> turns

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
click it and when you click it it turns

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.710 
click it and when you click it it turns
off<00:01:15.049> or<00:01:15.460> when<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:16.549> click<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.060> completes<00:01:17.630> a

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
off or when you click it it completes a

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.539 
off or when you click it it completes a
circuit<00:01:17.899> if<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.560> makes<00:01:18.740> any<00:01:18.770> sense<00:01:18.890> I<00:01:19.340> use

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
circuit if that makes any sense I use

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.029 
circuit if that makes any sense I use
prototyping<00:01:20.330> electronic<00:01:21.049> bridge<00:01:21.289> cables<00:01:21.799> for

prototyping electronic bridge cables for
the<00:01:22.159> headlight<00:01:23.080> this<00:01:24.080> allowed<00:01:24.409> me<00:01:24.439> some

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
the headlight this allowed me some

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.499 
the headlight this allowed me some
leeway<00:01:24.979> if<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.640> server<00:01:25.880> goes<00:01:26.090> out<00:01:26.240> of<00:01:26.270> whack

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
leeway if the server goes out of whack

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.320 
leeway if the server goes out of whack
and<00:01:26.539> damaged<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:27.470> lights<00:01:27.850> damage<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.970> servo

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
and damaged the lights damage the servo

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.779 
and damaged the lights damage the servo
it'll<00:01:29.569> just<00:01:29.750> bent<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.289> weakening<00:01:30.799> patient<00:01:31.190> so

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
it'll just bent the weakening patient so

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.510 
it'll just bent the weakening patient so
this<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:32.000> sort<00:01:32.179> of<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.360> weak<00:01:32.959> link<00:01:33.520> specifically

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
this is sort of a weak link specifically

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.760 
this is sort of a weak link specifically
put<00:01:34.789> here<00:01:35.030> just<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:35.479> that<00:01:35.509> if<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:35.959> screw<00:01:36.319> up<00:01:36.380> I

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
put here just so that if I screw up I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.039 
put here just so that if I screw up I
won't<00:01:37.490> damage<00:01:37.759> anything<00:01:37.970> expensive<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.869> hard

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
won't damage anything expensive and hard

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.690 
won't damage anything expensive and hard
everything<00:01:42.470> down<00:01:42.830> just<00:01:43.369> pretty<00:01:43.580> much

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
everything down just pretty much

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.430 
everything down just pretty much
temporary<00:01:44.240> just<00:01:44.929> have<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.110> kind<00:01:45.289> of<00:01:45.319> figure

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
temporary just have to kind of figure

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.809 
temporary just have to kind of figure
out<00:01:45.679> where<00:01:45.830> everything<00:01:45.920> goes<00:01:46.310> underneath<00:01:46.729> the

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
out where everything goes underneath the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.679 
out where everything goes underneath the
chassis<00:01:47.560> or<00:01:48.560> above<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:49.009> chassis<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:50.240> wires

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
chassis or above the chassis the wires

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.990 
chassis or above the chassis the wires
are<00:01:50.990> just<00:01:51.140> temporary<00:01:51.289> they're<00:01:51.950> really<00:01:52.789> long

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
are just temporary they're really long

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.460 
are just temporary they're really long
so<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.299> just<00:01:53.479> kind<00:01:53.659> of<00:01:53.689> lead<00:01:54.049> them<00:01:54.170> out<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.319> the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
so I just kind of lead them out of the

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.249 
so I just kind of lead them out of the
way<00:01:54.590> but<00:01:55.520> eventually<00:01:55.789> I<00:01:56.030> will<00:01:56.209> solder<00:01:56.929> them

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
way but eventually I will solder them

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.240 
way but eventually I will solder them
shorter<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.220> everything<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.670> really<00:01:58.849> clean

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
shorter so everything is really clean

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.109 
shorter so everything is really clean
just<00:02:01.250> like<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.519> did<00:02:01.700> with<00:02:01.849> the<00:02:01.940> light

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
just like I did with the light

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.180 
just like I did with the light
controller<00:02:02.509> servo<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:03.560> speed<00:02:03.800> controller

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
controller servo and speed controller

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.139 
controller servo and speed controller
why<00:02:04.489> splitters

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
why splitters

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.089 
why splitters
it's<00:02:05.929> finally<00:02:06.259> getting<00:02:06.440> warm<00:02:06.619> up<00:02:06.739> here<00:02:06.950> in<00:02:07.009> the

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
it's finally getting warm up here in the

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.369
