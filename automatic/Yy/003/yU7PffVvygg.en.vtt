00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
13-inch over here we're going to see the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.580 
13-inch over here we're going to see the
difference<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.420> outside<00:00:18.840> first<00:00:21.439> as<00:00:22.439> you

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
difference on the outside first as you

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.960 
difference on the outside first as you
can<00:00:22.710> see<00:00:23.390> there<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.539> no<00:00:24.720> difference<00:00:25.789> in<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
can see there is no difference in the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.139 
can see there is no difference in the
front<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.960> macbook<00:00:31.279> either<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.030> top

so<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.390> spin<00:00:37.110> them<00:00:37.230> around<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.680> sick<00:00:47.600> as<00:00:48.600> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
so if we spin them around a sick as you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.240 
so if we spin them around a sick as you
can<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.170> already<00:00:49.289> there<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.860> some

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
can see already there is some

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.119 
can see already there is some
differences<00:00:52.010> there<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.930> macbook

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the SD card reader but also the macbook

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.140 
the SD card reader but also the macbook
has<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.710> Kensington's<00:01:23.250> lock<00:01:23.520> slot<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
has the Kensington's lock slot on the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.740 
has the Kensington's lock slot on the
left<00:01:24.720> side<00:01:25.909> when<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> macbook<00:01:27.390> pro<00:01:27.920> doesn't

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
left side when the macbook pro doesn't

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:45.020 
left side when the macbook pro doesn't
so<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.900> spin<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.200> around<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.650> other<00:01:31.799> way<00:01:44.030> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
so we spin it around the other way the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.990 
so we spin it around the other way the
macbook<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.229> got<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.680> slot<00:01:47.009> drive<00:01:47.310> when

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
macbook it's just got a slot drive when

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.660 
macbook it's just got a slot drive when
the<00:01:48.119> macbook<00:01:48.479> pros<00:01:48.780> got<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> slot<00:01:49.439> drive<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the macbook pros got the slot drive and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.300 
the macbook pros got the slot drive and
the<00:01:50.759> chasm<00:01:51.090> comes<00:01:51.299> lock<00:01:51.540> slot<00:01:51.780> there<00:01:52.310> there's

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the chasm comes lock slot there there's

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.780 
the chasm comes lock slot there there's
not<00:01:53.460> very<00:01:53.490> much<00:01:53.880> difference<00:01:54.329> there<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
not very much difference there and the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.420 
not very much difference there and the
fifth<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.149> same<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.600> back<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.920> now<00:01:59.189> let's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
fifth the same on the back so now let's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:14.690 
fifth the same on the back so now let's
open<00:01:59.610> them<00:01:59.880> both<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.329> side<00:02:01.170> by<00:02:01.200> side<00:02:13.700> there's

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
open them both up side by side there's

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.930 
open them both up side by side there's
the<00:02:14.910> macbook<00:02:15.569> as<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.520> the

for the map macbook on f5 and f6 and
that's<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.910> only<00:02:44.940> different<00:02:45.390> inside<00:02:45.720> except

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
that's the only different inside except

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.440 
that's the only different inside except
on<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.620> macbook<00:02:46.860> pro<00:02:47.870> no<00:02:48.870> go<00:02:49.050> there<00:02:50.450> and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
on the macbook pro no go there and

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.369 
on the macbook pro no go there and
that's<00:02:51.629> your<00:02:51.840> indifference<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.280> outside

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
that's your indifference on the outside

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.649 
that's your indifference on the outside
the<00:02:55.379> macbook<00:02:55.800> pro<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> lot<00:02:56.580> faster<00:02:56.849> than<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
the macbook pro is a lot faster than the

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.280 
the macbook pro is a lot faster than the
macbook<00:02:59.060> has<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.269> got<00:03:00.420> higher<00:03:01.400> gigahertz

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
macbook has it's got higher gigahertz

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.309 
macbook has it's got higher gigahertz
which<00:03:04.290> makes<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.650> lot<00:03:04.800> faster<00:03:06.080> also<00:03:07.080> they're

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
which makes a lot faster also they're

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.360 
which makes a lot faster also they're
the<00:03:07.709> same<00:03:07.980> macbook<00:03:08.970> put<00:03:10.040> there's<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> lot

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the same macbook put there's not a lot

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.780 
the same macbook put there's not a lot
of<00:03:11.400> difference<00:03:11.849> on<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.599> outside<00:03:13.550> but<00:03:14.550> now

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
of difference on the outside but now

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.390 
of difference on the outside but now
let's<00:03:15.060> do<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.330> comparison<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.879> boot<00:03:18.090> up

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
let's do a comparison of the boot up

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.399 
let's do a comparison of the boot up
after<00:03:20.400> pressing<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:21.030> pretty<00:03:21.659> much<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.989> same

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
after pressing is pretty much the same

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:40.330 
after pressing is pretty much the same
right<00:03:22.890> three<00:03:23.280> two<00:03:24.060> one

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.660 

it's<00:03:41.340> nice<00:03:41.549> that's<00:03:42.060> my<00:03:42.209> chair<00:03:42.420> squeaking<00:03:42.900> guys

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
it's nice that's my chair squeaking guys

00:03:43.670 --> 00:04:03.610 
it's nice that's my chair squeaking guys
it's<00:03:44.670> not<00:03:44.790> me

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.539 

I<00:04:03.709> was<00:04:04.430> loaded<00:04:05.890> see<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:06.920> wasn't<00:04:07.400> already<00:04:07.519> done
