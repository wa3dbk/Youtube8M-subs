00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.580
 it's comic aspo early would be better 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.530
 this reality in the bins 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.559
 I made a first project 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.809
 there is in 2011 that I remake of the street 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.109
 I did a second project the year 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.279
 according to 2012 I believe in 2013 its 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.069
 sore for the worst and the best 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.199
 the same thing it was actually I 

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:24.550
 save me and only I got myself 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.810
 did single man the cd I do them alone 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.189
 I pressed alone I had the cover 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.220
 only then I experienced joules 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.260
 it was not going to tell you is that a 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.290
 in 2013 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:42.910
 Then there was 10 cameron who decided 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:46.020
 to produce us between cons 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.370
 why I called it strict reality 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.440
 at the base we had chosen our title 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.050
 had already taken it sure at the end that 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.040
 we got the title 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.040
 they call it the contract all that 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.010
 the goal is to reach the maximum of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.320
 public we will say that's why there 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.630
 in a we try to do all the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.010
 jerry gouges a person who will love him 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.530
 such sense another km and they are 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.090
 it's a little bit the goal is that I have the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.440
 more people possible then 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.210
 featuring good y'a jul seydoux know him 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.070
 this is also an industry 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.130
 yeah that's it aprilia also referred to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 league europe after a young kid who 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.960
 is not known at all this is his first 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.050
 piece 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.470
 it is then to the artist who is 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.920
 10.6 by the way with whom I made a 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.920
 collaboration 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.430
 I spot this summer 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.790
 at the base j'veux me that you said 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.290
 it was the pissed off tertarian blood 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.750
 this is it was not too much of 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.159
 sing ole ole say for me the purpose of a 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.790
 album that's it the artist is from 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.790
 show what he can do 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:14.220
 ocz it makes a big is not to say 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.390
 it's not my story but it's managed 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.330
 the story of a galley boy at the end 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.620
 and here it is after you have to look at it 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.840
 the picture actually to really understand 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.280
 here is the picture with the dream of the pampas 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.440
 of a particular person it is to 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.020
 just about so how does that affect 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.190
 many people what is the 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.500
 maximum number of people who will be 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.860
 can say in what I see the catch 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.300
 is an affront to the waves vhr regards 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.590
 cold ghetto calculations walk right 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.390
 that you have stubble armand 7 to 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.830
 next workshops not three there but my 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.150
 jeans each time the purse separate 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.070
 a fair that cut plates 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.640
 tasting for tf6 is not always that 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.530
 good feedback 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.989
 I did not believe one who told me he 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:03:00.090
 was not good that good messages 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:03.410
