00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
so yeah let's go to the next one um the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.309 
so yeah let's go to the next one um the
next<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.790> which<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.180> kind<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.450> broken<00:02:33.319> with

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
next one is which is kind of broken with

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
probably beaten didn't know this

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.539 
probably beaten didn't know this
proposed<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.319> probably<00:02:43.650> did<00:02:43.829> not<00:02:43.980> know<00:02:44.129> so

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
proposed to be probably did not know so

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
basically standing so it could be with

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.809 
basically standing so it could be with
Flint<00:02:48.239> steel<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.110> press<00:02:49.379> ignite<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.220> it

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
Flint steel and you press ignite and it

the<00:02:58.079> next<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.440> probably<00:02:58.709> one<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.190> most

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
the next one is probably one of the most

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.970 
the next one is probably one of the most
of<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.760> may<00:03:00.000> or<00:03:00.150> may<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.329> know<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.139> oh<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.859> can

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
actually spawn pigments in the lava and

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.120 
actually spawn pigments in the lava and
they<00:03:04.920> don't<00:03:05.099> get<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> herb<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:07.200> yeah<00:03:07.590> they're

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
they don't get a herb so yeah they're

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.059 
they don't get a herb so yeah they're
like<00:03:08.910> de<00:03:09.180> la<00:03:09.359> flower<00:03:09.660> cuz<00:03:09.989> there's<00:03:10.410> another<00:03:10.680> so
