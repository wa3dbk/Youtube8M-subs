bridge and or you start with the bridge

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.389 
bridge and or you start with the bridge
like<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.920> when<00:01:47.070> you've<00:01:47.190> kind<00:01:47.340> of

to kind of thump sort of in syncopation

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.560 
to kind of thump sort of in syncopation
so<00:04:27.070> you're<00:04:27.190> kind<00:04:27.370> of<00:04:27.430> like<00:04:29.700> or<00:04:30.700> you<00:04:31.330> could<00:04:31.480> be

de-<00:04:33.990> or<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.260> little<00:04:35.500> kind<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.740> pushing<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.190> B

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
de- or a little kind of pushing the B

de- or a little kind of pushing the B
team<00:04:39.390> moving<00:04:40.390> forward

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:57.270 

but<00:04:44.840> there's<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.490> walk<00:04:46.640> my<00:04:46.910> path

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:21.500 

which<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:58.370> can<00:04:58.550> jazz

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.060 

so<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.660> key<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.260> basically<00:05:23.560> all<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.890> blues

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
so the key to basically all the blues

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.350 
so the key to basically all the blues
and<00:05:24.250> rock<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.430> roll<00:05:24.610> is<00:05:24.790> to<00:05:24.910> forget<00:05:25.180> what

and rock and roll is to forget what

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.340 
and rock and roll is to forget what
you're<00:05:25.450> doing<00:05:25.600> with<00:05:25.690> your<00:05:25.720> left<00:05:25.930> hand<00:05:26.050> so

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
you're doing with your left hand so

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.330 
you're doing with your left hand so
you're<00:05:26.470> left<00:05:26.620> I'm<00:05:26.830> just<00:05:27.040> does<00:05:27.160> something

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
you're left I'm just does something

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.430 
you're left I'm just does something
automatically<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:28.510> then<00:05:28.840> you<00:05:28.930> can<00:05:29.080> start<00:05:29.260> to

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
automatically and then you can start to

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.050 
automatically and then you can start to
kind<00:05:29.530> of<00:05:29.650> improvise<00:05:30.070> with<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.370> left<00:05:30.550> hand<00:05:30.730> so

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
kind of improvise with the left hand so

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.320 
kind of improvise with the left hand so
a<00:05:31.660> nice<00:05:31.990> little<00:05:32.200> cheesy<00:05:32.560> one<00:05:32.850> for<00:05:33.850> example

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
a nice little cheesy one for example

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:54.810 
a nice little cheesy one for example
once<00:05:34.510> you<00:05:34.690> can<00:05:34.840> do<00:05:34.990> this<00:05:35.370> any<00:05:36.370> of<00:05:36.520> them<00:05:53.820> I'm

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
once you can do this any of them I'm

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.820 
once you can do this any of them I'm
just<00:05:55.690> trying<00:05:55.900> to<00:05:55.930> keep<00:05:56.080> this<00:05:56.230> going<00:05:56.560> and<00:05:56.680> then

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
just trying to keep this going and then

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:13.590 
just trying to keep this going and then
you're<00:05:56.980> kind<00:05:57.160> of<00:05:57.220> like<00:05:57.370> adding<00:05:57.760> it<00:06:12.450> he<00:06:13.450> is

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
you're kind of like adding it he is

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:26.460 
you're kind of like adding it he is
really<00:06:13.780> keeping<00:06:14.050> this<00:06:14.260> hand<00:06:25.140> and<00:06:26.140> then<00:06:26.320> you

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
really keeping this hand and then you

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.800 
really keeping this hand and then you
can<00:06:26.590> also<00:06:26.740> if<00:06:27.220> you<00:06:27.700> want<00:06:27.850> and<00:06:28.240> do<00:06:28.420> something

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
can also if you want and do something

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:54.310 
can also if you want and do something
like<00:06:28.990> a<00:06:29.050> minor<00:06:29.560> C<00:06:29.920> freedom<00:06:31.080> see

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.729 

so<00:06:55.320> that's<00:06:55.500> just<00:06:55.680> simple<00:06:56.220> skill
