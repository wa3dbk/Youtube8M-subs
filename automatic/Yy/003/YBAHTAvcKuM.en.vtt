00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.070
 open for whatever mistake 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.469

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.750
 close and that's it 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.949
 here you have to go to windows 7 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.809
 search for performance information or 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.089
 just for performance or something and then 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.490

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.470
 performance information and tools 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.080

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.090
 All hooks must be activated here 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.550
 be and the point for an optimal 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.890
 must adapt to presentation if 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.259
 you did that, then you go 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.360
 once on the task manager that yes 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.729
 just down here with right-click 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.410

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.530
 explorer also quits the explorer 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.869
 process is no longer open then 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:47.119
 everyone is back to applications and clicks 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:50.270
 on new task and start explorer exe 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.420
 then the desktop pictures are back 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.069
 there and the icons and so on now 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.709
 you can just for example here 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.550
 make a wmv video and click 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.289
 first grim then you have that as 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.599
 background then we only have one 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.489
 problem is the font under the icons 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.590
 not really recognize it 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.989
 you just take a black picture 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.459

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.080
 make paint and do this as 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.200
 desktop wallpaper then you go into the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.090
 adjustments at desktop background and 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 It is very important that you are filled up 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.540
 One notes this change saves you 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.940
 Close the window again 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.940

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.819

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.410

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.720
