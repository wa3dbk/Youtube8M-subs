00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
so Nicholas winging it for four and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.720 
so Nicholas winging it for four and
quarter<00:02:34.349> let's<00:02:34.500> take<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.799> going<00:02:35.040> back<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.310> 20

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
quarter let's take it going back to 20

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.479 
quarter let's take it going back to 20
which<00:02:36.659> is<00:02:36.690> another<00:02:37.319> very<00:02:37.769> strong<00:02:38.069> think<00:02:38.310> or

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
which is another very strong think or

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.580 
which is another very strong think or
doesn't<00:02:38.790> hit<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:38.909> fourth<00:02:39.239> land<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.780> guess<00:02:40.349> two

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
doesn't hit a fourth land I guess two

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.069 
doesn't hit a fourth land I guess two
heroes<00:02:41.519> there<00:02:41.760> but<00:02:42.150> he<00:02:42.209> does<00:02:42.360> have<00:02:42.540> an<00:02:42.720> honor

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
heroes there but he does have an honor

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.399 
heroes there but he does have an honor
so<00:02:43.980> now<00:02:44.129> he<00:02:44.190> has<00:02:44.370> three<00:02:44.930> three<00:02:45.930> threes<00:02:46.230> with

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
so now he has three three threes with

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.319 
so now he has three three threes with
vigilance<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.950> he<00:02:47.370> will<00:02:47.519> attack<00:02:50.329> Nick

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
vigilance and he will attack Nick

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.720

block he has doomed traveler which

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.690 
block he has doomed traveler which
becomes<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:56.940> creature<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.510> he<00:02:58.500> will<00:02:58.859> still<00:02:59.160> have
