00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
some people when we go to like a 0 gauge

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.360 
some people when we go to like a 0 gauge
or<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.390> gauge<00:02:05.660> because<00:02:06.260> they<00:02:06.590> want<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.890> have

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370

but a lot of the times especially it's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.680 
but a lot of the times especially it's
more<00:02:12.920> sizes<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.580> possible<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.420> make

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690
