00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.450
 We will continue with the term now 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.650
 Sexual correction because we want 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.940
 achieve that for you as a driver 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.440
 feel every speaker the same distance 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.369
 that's actually written off at the moment 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.890
 home 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.960
 therefore has or men's concert is yes 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.880
 you do not stand somehow as far as possible 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.800
 further try it right or possible 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 in the middle to ask for it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.590
 you the stereo effect right as left 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.669
 that feels the same distance away from you 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.969
 That's the best you can do that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.270
 understand with the voice 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:43.620
 music with one actually for the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.149
 has female voice and the times unfiltered 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.590
 so without a time correction if you have the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.910
 eyes close me a bit on the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.129
 be focused on music 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.120
 if I do not make any runtime correction 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.320
 that pretty much s.der A-pillar 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.030
 will stick because yes for you as a driver 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.899
 your speakers on the driver's side 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.510
 closer to it than the right one is what 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.280
 Do you make us delay the exit from 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.090
 the sound on the left opposite 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.740
 the right one 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.869
 We can do that with the sex tape because we 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.659
 drive yes fully actively take care of that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.920
 do each speaker individually like that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.750
 so that's okay now 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.520
 the delay by as much milliseconds 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.409
 as a tweeter the midrange 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.610
 Bisserl delay differently because he is yes 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.740
 finally different 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.330
 removed as the tweeter we can 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 make the whole whole page the same 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.780
 but we can do any speaker 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.189
 set individually and we can 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.020
 here at our preset 1 at 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.689
 time delay we can just now 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.880
 go into each channel individually and 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.470
 say how many inches is that 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.439
 Directions or how many milliseconds 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.159
 I want to delay you 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.680
 we have now explained the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.189
 Preferences made for us 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.899
 example now the front right 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.509
 Tweeter is for us now 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.549
 farthest away so take that as 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.210
 reference all speakers all others 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.020
 Speakers are closer to you than that 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.509
 tweeter 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.770
 So leave me at zero and all 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.569
 others are delayed accordingly 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.700
 because that's the farthest away 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.390
 and at the level, practically everyone has to 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.400
 bring others too 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.020
 So you can do that with both things 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.240
 Of course you can make a metal rod 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.430
 take and the length simply from you 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.580
 from the middle of your brain 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.980
 so to speak take the meter and easy 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.700
 measure the length from how far ahead 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.250
 left to front right and give 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.990
 the difference then enter as the term 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.460
 correction as centimeter accurate and 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.860
 then calculated how much 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.090
 milliseconds to be delayed and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.530
 I can do that for each one 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.200
 make speakers and never as 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.520
 reference my farthest rightmost 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.040
 remote speaker 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.390
 you can use our front system 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.760
 that's it's crucial to set 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.340
 with you in the car in there then he comes 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.960
 merely nor the views, and we can 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.330
 afterwards just continue with Total 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.770
 connect to your system though 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.430
 by that with you all loudspeakers 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.450
 really all in the front area 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.580
 have different distances 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.410
 we can set each one individually 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.150
 otherwise we could say in front 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.530
 left is midrange and tweeter 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.330
 somehow pretty close together then 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.190
 Can you say that in the one as one 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.420
 group together and can the whole 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.340
 simply delay the group 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.739
 yes but I use that from what the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.200
 Sexual everything can and do everyone 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.610
 speaker individually front left have 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.100
 We now, for example, at the court 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.480
 lead 45 centimeters as a difference 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.820
 We entered that from the outside 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.920
 had 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.830
 front left and 58 cm on the midrange 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.820
 and just 62 cm woofer at the bottom 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.590
 the wolf down there is mine with me 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.010
 now with the values â€‹â€‹to say that 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.650
 are my values at that time ans 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.570
 micro in sms meter stick meter bar easy 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.660
 times running time is said that one 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.989
 just have to listen because everyone 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.709
 speaker has other data and values 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.750
 and some dead ones I signal myself already 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.940
 late or premature like another 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.489
 loudspeaker spends so has the 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.170
 meter rod not the only valid measure 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.700
 yes this is just a rough guide 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.260
 yes there you can say okay give that 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.180
 Now, from time to time, there will be results 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.500
 be really great but you can 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.440
 even with the hearing continue working 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.039
 if you just know where to go 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.690
 got to 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.410
 you can hear it all together too 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.750
 do 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.100
 that was the last result and now 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.610
 That's why there is one here too 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.930
 small difference between the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.970
 midrange and the tweeter was 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.320
 namely felt tweeter farther away 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.580
 is like the midrange at her 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.340
 Nevertheless, I have the middle finger for this 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.320
 larger numbers are required than for the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.670
 tweeter but we hang on 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.890
 Now we can not do it now 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.090
 here our centimeters for everyone 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.060
 enter individual channels 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.130
 left as right and just in the case 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.900
 it is channel 12 are the tweeters 34 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.850
 Midrange channel 5 and 6 are the 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.120
 woofers in the door the deep 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.360
 midrange and can have as 7 and 8 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.800
 We are not delayed in that case and 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.680
 are somehow come to the conclusion 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.950
 The bass has also become the front here 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.050
 system optimally added there and at most 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.730
 Minimal chances are very difficult 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.860
 then audible 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.170
 maybe a minimal better 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.120
 would give results 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:24.600
 and that's how the term works 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.370
 correction in sexually and if I do that 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.560
 whole over exaggerates then I can 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.260
 really this vote from far to the left 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.530
 His column over to the far right 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.300
 Run only through the term 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.460
 correction and a runtime correction 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.550
 say again is not a level increase 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.860
 from the right so louder and right limb 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.030
 I feel away because it just continues 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.130
 I have to make a bit louder 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.140
 with the same level on my ear 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.970
 arrives that has the first moment 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.980
 same effect that she says mine 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.650
 voice automatically moves on 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.140
 but right is just a digital 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.240
 runtime correction without the level too 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.270
 I only make the exit of the 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.800
 I change the sound from the time 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.880
 Here and there we only talk about 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.590
 millisecond and then you can 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.720
 really completely over hiking 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.520
 let and for us or for you as 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.620
 driver is now particularly useful 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.360
 your vote in the middle of the 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.370
 to bring dashboards 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.140
 or I'll tell you about that 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.890
 Steering wheel to bring because you see yes 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.110
 straight forward and that's playing for you 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.850
 left and right the stage relative 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.830
 right from the distance 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.660
 That is, Michael Jackson makes courage of 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.820
 far left to the far right and sings 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.919
 while but then you hear the well of 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.370
 whiz through right and left 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.969
 made his sound and that makes 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.099
 so good 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:44.189
 Auslage and that's what counts 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:47.309
 An is sexually made by clear audio power 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:48.689
 runtime correction of the finest and me 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:51.110
 believe lokals now confirm after 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:07:00.299
 what listen to me sessions have power 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:07:02.689
 perfect carving okay what are we also 

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:02.689
 in the evening
