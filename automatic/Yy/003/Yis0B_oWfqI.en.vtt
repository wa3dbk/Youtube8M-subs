00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
a guess it's called super hexagon and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
a guess it's called super hexagon and
what<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.979> think<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.400> happening<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.970> he<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.420 
what I think is happening is he is this
little<00:01:21.930> dot<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> middle<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.220> little

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
little dot in the middle this little

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
little dot in the middle this little
triangle<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.390> these<00:01:24.570> hexagons<00:01:25.200> with

trying to squash him basically into the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
trying to squash him basically into the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
going on if that is the case then this

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.039
