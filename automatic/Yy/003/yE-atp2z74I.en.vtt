tutorial<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.280> today<00:00:08.940> what<00:00:09.540> we're<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:09.809> to

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
tutorial and today what we're going to

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.520 
tutorial and today what we're going to
be<00:00:09.929> doing<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.410> making<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:11.040> level<00:00:11.730> system<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.530> say

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
be doing is making a level system so say

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.410 
be doing is making a level system so say
you<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:14.190> pass<00:00:14.519> level<00:00:14.969> one

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
you you pass level one

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.150 
you you pass level one
now<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.750> go<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.199> level<00:00:16.350> two<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.980> you

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
now you go on to level two and you

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.710 
now you go on to level two and you
couldn't<00:00:17.460> get<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> level<00:00:17.940> two<00:00:18.060> before<00:00:18.449> because

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
couldn't get to level two before because

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.820 
couldn't get to level two before because
if<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:18.960> locked<00:00:19.140> because<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.470> need<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.710> get

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
if it's locked because you need to get

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.650 
if it's locked because you need to get
past<00:00:19.920> level<00:00:20.279> one

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
past level one

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.720 
past level one
back<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:22.080> type<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> stuff<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> did

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
back that type of stuff so what I did

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.250 
back that type of stuff so what I did

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
here is I went ahead and create a simple

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.769 
here is I went ahead and create a simple
sprite<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.820> just<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.029> two<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.420> three<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
sprite and just one two and three and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.259 
sprite and just one two and three and
this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.710> what<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.099> click<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.730> go

this is going to be what you click to go

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.959 
this is going to be what you click to go
on<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> next<00:00:30.869> level<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.460> click<00:00:32.820> this

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
on to the next level so you click this

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.760 
on to the next level so you click this
that<00:00:33.210> will<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.390> level<00:00:33.690> 1<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> go<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> level<00:00:34.620> 2

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
that will be level 1 you go to level 2

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
level 3 so if I go ahead and create a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.119 
level 3 so if I go ahead and create a
new<00:00:38.579> object<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:39.559> I'm<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> call<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> o

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
new object here I'm going to call it o

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
new object here I'm going to call it o
level<00:00:41.850> system<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.430> make<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.140> sprite

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
level system and make that the sprite

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.560 
level system and make that the sprite
there<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:47.969> ahead<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.390> put

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
video that was talking about it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.770 
video that was talking about it
creation<00:01:08.850> codes<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.210> how<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> use<00:01:09.570> them

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
creation codes and how to use them

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.300 
creation codes and how to use them
properly<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.710> don't<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.070> this

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
properly if you don't do that this

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270 
properly if you don't do that this
tutorial<00:01:11.820> will<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.180> make<00:01:12.330> sense<00:01:12.560> okay<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.799> I'm

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
tutorial will not make sense okay so I'm

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.230 
tutorial will not make sense okay so I'm
gonna<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.640> ahead<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> create

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
gonna go ahead and go to the create

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.539 
gonna go ahead and go to the create
event<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.619> let's<00:01:16.890> say<00:01:17.009> image<00:01:17.280> speed

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
event here and let's say image speed

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.780 
event here and let's say image speed
equals<00:01:17.970> zero<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.240> off<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> bat<00:01:18.950> now<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.220> am

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
equals zero right off the bat now I am

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.120 
equals zero right off the bat now I am
also<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> create<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.659> switch<00:01:21.869> statement

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
also going to create a switch statement

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.289 
also going to create a switch statement
if<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.369> don't<00:01:23.520> know<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> switch<00:01:23.939> statement

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
if you don't know the switch statement

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.910 
if you don't know the switch statement
it's<00:01:24.509> pretty<00:01:24.689> easy<00:01:24.869> typed<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.500> switch<00:01:25.710> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
it's pretty easy typed and switch you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.410 
it's pretty easy typed and switch you
put<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> variable<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.729> want<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.150> I'll<00:01:27.240> say

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
put in the variable you want so I'll say

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
put in the variable you want so I'll say
level<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.729> then<00:01:29.729> use<00:01:30.509> case<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.640> whatever

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
level and then use case and whatever

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
level and then use case and whatever
number<00:01:32.939> comes<00:01:32.970> after<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.570> or<00:01:33.750> whatever

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
number comes after this or whatever

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.859 
number comes after this or whatever
string<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:35.100> whatever<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.659> if

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
string or whatever is going to be if

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.100 
string or whatever is going to be if
that<00:01:37.229> level<00:01:37.979> which<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.369> put<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:38.850> here

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
that level which we put in right here

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.780 
that level which we put in right here
equals<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.650> case<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.700> say<00:01:41.820> zero

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.260 

and<00:01:46.260> after<00:01:47.260> each<00:01:47.470> case<00:01:47.770> you<00:01:48.010> have<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.400> put<00:01:48.970> in<00:01:49.150> a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
and after each case you have to put in a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.790 
and after each case you have to put in a
break<00:01:49.510> statement<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.600> required<00:01:55.290> okay<00:01:56.290> so

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
break statement that is required okay so

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.240 
break statement that is required okay so
I'm<00:01:56.860> just<00:01:57.010> going<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.160> copy<00:01:57.370> this<00:01:58.860> paste<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.070> two

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
I'm just going to copy this paste it two

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.030 
I'm just going to copy this paste it two
more<00:02:00.430> times<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:00.940> one<00:02:01.390> two<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.200> then<00:02:02.710> here<00:02:02.950> I'm

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
more times so one two and then here I'm

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.100 
more times so one two and then here I'm
just<00:02:03.130> going<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.370> say<00:02:03.490> image<00:02:03.880> index<00:02:04.390> equals

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
just going to say image index equals

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:16.830 
just going to say image index equals
zero<00:02:08.340> image<00:02:09.340> index<00:02:10.000> equals<00:02:10.510> one<00:02:12.750> image<00:02:15.840> index

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
zero image index equals one image index

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.190 
zero image index equals one image index
equals<00:02:17.500> two<00:02:18.120> now<00:02:19.120> again<00:02:19.480> if<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.720> did<00:02:20.050> not

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
equals two now again if you did not

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.350 
equals two now again if you did not
watch<00:02:20.560> or<00:02:20.920> donor's<00:02:21.400> Stan<00:02:21.730> creation<00:02:22.150> codes

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
watch or donor's Stan creation codes

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.850 
watch or donor's Stan creation codes
this<00:02:22.660> will<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:22.960> make<00:02:22.990> sense<00:02:23.380> because<00:02:23.560> right

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
this will not make sense because right

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.350 
this will not make sense because right
now<00:02:24.040> what<00:02:24.220> you're<00:02:24.400> saying<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:25.120> don't<00:02:25.150> have

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
now what you're saying is we don't have

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.870 
now what you're saying is we don't have
a<00:02:25.480> level<00:02:25.840> variable<00:02:26.260> well<00:02:27.100> what<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.760> we

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
a level variable well what we do is we

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.630 
a level variable well what we do is we
go<00:02:28.030> into<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.330> room<00:02:28.450> here<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.920> right-click<00:02:30.160> and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
go into the room here we right-click and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.600 
go into the room here we right-click and
we<00:02:30.670> say<00:02:31.770> creation<00:02:32.770> code<00:02:32.920> now<00:02:33.340> I'm<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.520> to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
we say creation code now I'm going to

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.930 
we say creation code now I'm going to
say<00:02:33.700> level<00:02:34.120> equals<00:02:34.750> zero<00:02:38.490> crazy<00:02:39.490> code<00:02:39.700> for<00:02:39.880> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
say level equals zero crazy code for the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.199 
say level equals zero crazy code for the
other<00:02:40.060> one<00:02:40.209> level<00:02:40.480> equals<00:02:40.750> one<00:02:41.970> code<00:02:42.970> for<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
other one level equals one code for the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.240 
other one level equals one code for the
other<00:02:43.330> one<00:02:43.480> level<00:02:43.690> equals<00:02:44.170> two<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.860> now<00:02:45.010> if<00:02:45.220> we

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
other one level equals two so now if we

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.680 
other one level equals two so now if we
ran<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.790> game<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:48.820> can<00:02:48.850> see<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.300> now<00:02:49.420> says

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
ran the game as you can see it now says

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.380 
ran the game as you can see it now says
one<00:02:50.020> two<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.250> three<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:51.970> they<00:02:52.120> are<00:02:52.239> now<00:02:52.420> ID'd

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
one two and three so they are now ID'd

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.520 
one two and three so they are now ID'd
so<00:02:55.390> if<00:02:56.320> we<00:02:56.830> go<00:02:56.950> into<00:02:57.070> our<00:02:57.160> object<00:02:57.610> here<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.530> we

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
so if we go into our object here and we

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.360 
so if we go into our object here and we
say<00:02:59.860> mouse<00:03:00.550> left<00:03:01.269> pressed<00:03:02.160> actually<00:03:03.160> no<00:03:03.280> what

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
say mouse left pressed actually no what

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
say mouse left pressed actually no what
we<00:03:03.430> won't<00:03:03.550> do<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.730> now<00:03:03.850> what<00:03:04.120> we're<00:03:04.239> going<00:03:04.360> to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
we won't do that now what we're going to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.640 
we won't do that now what we're going to
do<00:03:04.510> real<00:03:04.690> quick<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.959> we're<00:03:05.080> going<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.260> create<00:03:05.440> a

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
do real quick is we're going to create a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.890 
do real quick is we're going to create a
new<00:03:05.860> object<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.280> I'm<00:03:06.370> gonna<00:03:06.519> call<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.900> obj

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
new object and I'm gonna call this obj

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.620 
new object and I'm gonna call this obj
or<00:03:08.880> Oh<00:03:10.080> data<00:03:11.280> or<00:03:12.280> data<00:03:12.550> however<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.269> say<00:03:13.420> that

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
or Oh data or data however you say that

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.680 
or Oh data or data however you say that
and<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.340> going<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.760> hold<00:03:16.090> all<00:03:16.420> of<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
and this is going to hold all of the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.620 
and this is going to hold all of the
data<00:03:16.900> for<00:03:17.290> our<00:03:17.350> game<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.580> just<00:03:19.150> in<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.330> create

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
data for our game so just in the create

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.720 
data for our game so just in the create
event<00:03:20.489> I'm<00:03:21.489> going<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.670> set<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:21.850> variable<00:03:22.440> global

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
event I'm going to set a variable global

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.949 
event I'm going to set a variable global
level<00:03:25.530> equals<00:03:26.530> one<00:03:27.489> or<00:03:27.850> I'm<00:03:28.269> gonna<00:03:28.420> say<00:03:28.630> level

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
level equals one or I'm gonna say level

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.390 
level equals one or I'm gonna say level
unlocked<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:34.120> right<00:03:34.300> now<00:03:34.450> we<00:03:34.840> only<00:03:34.870> have<00:03:35.400> level

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
unlocked so right now we only have level

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.330 
unlocked so right now we only have level
unlocked<00:03:36.820> T<00:03:37.209> equal<00:03:37.600> one<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.110> we<00:03:38.890> go<00:03:39.010> back<00:03:39.040> into

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
unlocked T equal one so we go back into

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.190 
unlocked T equal one so we go back into
our<00:03:39.459> level<00:03:39.640> system<00:03:40.060> here<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.630> we<00:03:40.720> go<00:03:40.870> mouse

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
our level system here and we go mouse

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.110 
our level system here and we go mouse
left<00:03:41.590> pressed<00:03:43.680> we<00:03:44.680> will<00:03:44.830> say<00:03:45.070> another<00:03:45.790> switch

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
left pressed we will say another switch

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.320 
left pressed we will say another switch
statement<00:03:46.570> level

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:58.160 

case<00:03:51.330> 0<00:03:54.349> and<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:57.060> will<00:03:57.239> be<00:03:57.390> if<00:03:57.599> level<00:03:57.930> equals

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
case 0 and this will be if level equals

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.839 
case 0 and this will be if level equals
1<00:03:58.349> so<00:03:58.890> we're<00:03:59.400> going<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.610> say<00:03:59.730> if<00:04:00.000> global<00:04:00.870> dot

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
1 so we're going to say if global dot

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:02.990 
1 so we're going to say if global dot
level

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
level

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.619 
level
unlocked<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:06.379> greater<00:04:07.379> than<00:04:07.560> or<00:04:07.709> equal<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.159> 1

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.370 

we<00:04:12.629> can<00:04:12.780> just<00:04:13.019> do<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:14.540> settle<00:04:15.540> over<00:04:15.720> there<00:04:15.930> show

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
we can just do I settle over there show

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.560 
we can just do I settle over there show
message<00:04:19.070> level<00:04:20.070> 1<00:04:21.979> yeah<00:04:23.010> level<00:04:23.310> 1<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:23.970> right

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
message level 1 yeah level 1 so right

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.980 
message level 1 yeah level 1 so right
here<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.900> would<00:04:25.050> put<00:04:25.260> room<00:04:25.530> go<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.880> whatever

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
here you would put room go to whatever

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.270 
here you would put room go to whatever
but<00:04:28.580> we're<00:04:29.580> not<00:04:29.729> going<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.090> do<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.360> because

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
but we're not going to do that because

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.830 
but we're not going to do that because
it's<00:04:32.280> just<00:04:32.460> easier<00:04:32.760> for<00:04:32.820> me<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.060> show<00:04:33.180> and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
it's just easier for me to show and

all of the levels are now unlocked so if
okay<00:05:59.530> I<00:05:59.910> know<00:06:00.910> this<00:06:01.210> is<00:06:01.390> kind<00:06:01.630> of<00:06:01.780> for

demonstration<00:06:02.710> purposes<00:06:03.160> and<00:06:03.490> a<00:06:03.670> tutorial

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
demonstration purposes and a tutorial

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.200 
demonstration purposes and a tutorial
purpose<00:06:04.510> obviously<00:06:05.700> this<00:06:06.700> is<00:06:06.880> not<00:06:06.910> how<00:06:07.150> you

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
purpose obviously this is not how you

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.310 
purpose obviously this is not how you
would<00:06:07.420> have<00:06:07.570> it<00:06:07.660> in<00:06:07.750> the<00:06:07.810> game<00:06:07.990> you<00:06:08.140> couldn't

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
would have it in the game you couldn't

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.200 
would have it in the game you couldn't
just<00:06:08.530> press<00:06:08.710> space<00:06:08.980> so<00:06:09.430> what<00:06:09.580> you<00:06:09.730> do<00:06:09.940> is

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
just press space so what you do is

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.750 
just press space so what you do is
instead<00:06:10.660> of<00:06:10.780> the<00:06:10.900> space<00:06:11.170> here<00:06:11.580> you<00:06:12.580> would<00:06:12.730> have

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
instead of the space here you would have

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.550 
instead of the space here you would have
it<00:06:13.060> so<00:06:13.270> that<00:06:13.300> at<00:06:13.660> the<00:06:13.690> end<00:06:13.840> of<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.140> level<00:06:14.440> when

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
it so that at the end of the level when

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.830 
it so that at the end of the level when
you<00:06:14.650> reach<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:15.580> final<00:06:16.000> goal<00:06:16.030> which<00:06:16.450> would<00:06:16.690> be

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
you reach the final goal which would be

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.370 
you reach the final goal which would be
a<00:06:16.870> door<00:06:17.290> a<00:06:17.320> flag<00:06:18.690> anything<00:06:19.690> really<00:06:19.900> once<00:06:20.260> you
