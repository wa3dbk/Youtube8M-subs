think<00:02:15.080> it's<00:02:15.290> important<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:15.770> we<00:02:15.860> don't<00:02:16.070> go<00:02:16.190> in

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
think it's important that we don't go in

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.160 
think it's important that we don't go in
there<00:02:16.520> thinking<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.910> little<00:02:17.060> already<00:02:17.750> won<00:02:18.050> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170

there thinking a little already won the
game<00:02:18.820> otherwise<00:02:19.820> we're<00:02:20.060> going<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.240> get<00:02:20.620> shown

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
up by zebras so what's also aims in the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.410 
up by zebras so what's also aims in the
Heineken<00:02:24.800> Cup<00:02:25.160> season<00:02:25.460> I'm<00:02:25.640> soon<00:02:25.790> with<00:02:26.180> well

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
Heineken Cup season I'm soon with well

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.170 
Heineken Cup season I'm soon with well
last<00:02:26.600> season<00:02:26.780> but<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:28.400> there<00:02:28.580> any<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.880> go<00:02:29.000> one

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
last season but is there any to go one

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.910 
last season but is there any to go one
further<00:02:29.330> maybe<00:02:29.630> maybe<00:02:29.870> reach<00:02:30.110> everyone<00:02:30.380> yeah

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
further maybe maybe reach everyone yeah

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.030 
further maybe maybe reach everyone yeah
definitely<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.520> think<00:02:32.230> if<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.380> know<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.800> win

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
definitely I think if you know it's win

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.730 
definitely I think if you know it's win
it<00:02:34.160> then<00:02:34.360> there's<00:02:35.360> no<00:02:35.600> not<00:02:36.110> much<00:02:36.260> point<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.650> you

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
it then there's no not much point of you

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.100 
it then there's no not much point of you
being<00:02:37.100> in<00:02:37.310> competition<00:02:37.970> or<00:02:38.300> there's<00:02:38.870> always

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
being in competition or there's always

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.450 
being in competition or there's always
point<00:02:39.350> of<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.560> taking<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.950> composition

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
point of you taking a composition

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.180 
point of you taking a composition
seriously<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:41.960> think<00:02:42.530> that's<00:02:42.710> definitely<00:02:43.100> the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
seriously I think that's definitely the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.600 
seriously I think that's definitely the
goal<00:02:43.690> forget<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.840> final<00:02:45.170> maybe<00:02:45.650> try<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.490> win

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
goal forget to a final maybe try and win

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.840 
goal forget to a final maybe try and win
it<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:47.510> um<00:02:47.830> like<00:02:48.830> I<00:02:48.860> said<00:02:49.040> we<00:02:49.280> can't<00:02:49.550> look<00:02:49.700> any

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
it but um like I said we can't look any

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.830 
it but um like I said we can't look any
