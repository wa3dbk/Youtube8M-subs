and<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.730> round<00:01:34.120> of<00:01:34.390> 36<00:01:35.170> or<00:01:35.410> I<00:01:35.620> mean<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.040> round

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and the round of 36 or I mean the round

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.700 
and the round of 36 or I mean the round
of<00:01:36.310> 16<00:01:36.730> already<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:37.840> yeah<00:01:38.200> I'd<00:01:38.320> say<00:01:38.380> there's<00:01:38.680> a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
of 16 already so yeah I'd say there's a

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.260 
of 16 already so yeah I'd say there's a
pretty<00:01:38.920> good<00:01:39.010> chance<00:01:39.160> actually<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.150> we're

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
pretty good chance actually that we're

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.990 
pretty good chance actually that we're
going<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.480> get<00:01:40.600> half<00:01:40.930> Zerg<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.980> the<00:01:42.520> round<00:01:42.760> of

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
going to get half Zerg in the round of

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.140 
going to get half Zerg in the round of
16<00:01:43.380> which<00:01:44.380> actually<00:01:44.590> isn't<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:45.070> unusual<00:01:45.430> of

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
16 which actually isn't that unusual of

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.290 
16 which actually isn't that unusual of
a<00:01:46.270> phenomenon<00:01:47.820> remembering<00:01:48.820> back<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.180> the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
a phenomenon remembering back to the

flashes actually put his pile on inside
of<00:02:24.940> his<00:02:25.300> main<00:02:25.629> it's<00:02:26.379> very<00:02:26.709> risky<00:02:26.950> play<00:02:27.340> for<00:02:27.519> me

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
of his main it's very risky play for me

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.550 
of his main it's very risky play for me
I'm<00:02:27.700> always<00:02:27.910> going<00:02:28.180> Gateway<00:02:28.660> first<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.409> don't

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
I'm always going Gateway first you don't

I'm always going Gateway first you don't
see<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.709> lot<00:02:29.769> of<00:02:29.920> Protoss<00:02:30.280> players<00:02:30.579> doing<00:02:30.909> this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
see a lot of Protoss players doing this

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
see a lot of Protoss players doing this
so<00:02:31.480> yes<00:02:32.349> he's<00:02:32.849> deciding<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:33.999> forgo<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.810> four

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
so yes he's deciding to forgo the four

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.690 
so yes he's deciding to forgo the four
fast<00:02:35.320> expand<00:02:35.800> he's<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.160> going<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.400> put<00:02:36.580> down

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
fast expand he's just going to put down

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.460 
fast expand he's just going to put down
his<00:02:36.850> gateway<00:02:37.240> try<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.080> some<00:02:38.230> early

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
his gateway try to get some early

pressure<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.430> expansion<00:02:39.970> from<00:02:40.390> hoagie

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
pressure on this expansion from hoagie

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.060 
pressure on this expansion from hoagie
and<00:02:41.010> hokey<00:02:42.010> he<00:02:42.130> went<00:02:42.310> for<00:02:42.550> his<00:02:43.230> base<00:02:44.230> down<00:02:44.740> here

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
and hokey he went for his base down here

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.350 
and hokey he went for his base down here
I<00:02:45.100> think<00:02:45.190> he<00:02:45.370> went<00:02:45.520> for<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.790> spawning<00:02:46.120> pool

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
I think he went for a spawning pool

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.840 
I think he went for a spawning pool
first<00:02:46.750> actually<00:02:47.530> was<00:02:47.650> probably<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.070> 12<00:02:48.610> hatch

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
first actually was probably a 12 hatch

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.210 
first actually was probably a 12 hatch

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
build seeing the Overlord go out like

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.920 
build seeing the Overlord go out like
that<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.430> think<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.790> was<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.940> 12<00:02:52.300> hatch<00:02:52.510> we'll<00:02:52.780> see

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
that I think it was a 12 hatch we'll see

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.540 
that I think it was a 12 hatch we'll see
if<00:02:53.050> his<00:02:53.200> spawning<00:02:53.560> pool<00:02:53.710> is<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.100> here<00:02:54.310> or<00:02:54.430> not

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
if his spawning pool is up here or not

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.330 
if his spawning pool is up here or not
is<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.450> was<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.600> 12<00:02:55.870> hatch<00:02:56.050> from<00:02:56.380> hoagie<00:02:56.860> he's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
is it was a 12 hatch from hoagie he's

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.920 
is it was a 12 hatch from hoagie he's
going<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.610> put<00:02:57.760> down<00:02:57.910> his<00:02:58.180> hooky<00:02:58.630> spawning

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
going to put down his hooky spawning

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.780 
going to put down his hooky spawning
pool<00:02:59.520> delicious<00:03:00.660> spawning<00:03:01.660> pool<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.170> yes<00:03:03.130> now

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
pool delicious spawning pool and yes now

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.340 
pool delicious spawning pool and yes now
he's<00:03:04.000> probably<00:03:04.150> going<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.630> transition<00:03:05.020> into

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
he's probably going to transition into

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.970 
he's probably going to transition into

another pile on coming up for flash will

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.150 
another pile on coming up for flash will
see<00:03:16.989> flash<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.440> able<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.739> deal<00:03:17.890> with<00:03:18.010> it

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
see flash is able to deal with it

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.310 
see flash is able to deal with it
everyone<00:03:18.550> knows<00:03:18.580> flash<00:03:19.450> is<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.690> fantastic

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
everyone knows flash is a fantastic

everyone knows flash is a fantastic
Protoss<00:03:21.040> player<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.140> yeah<00:03:23.140> it's<00:03:23.290> going<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.560> be

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
Protoss player so yeah it's going to be

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.490 
Protoss player so yeah it's going to be
very<00:03:24.520> easy<00:03:24.820> for<00:03:24.970> him<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.300> get<00:03:25.510> past<00:03:25.840> togi<00:03:26.230> here

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
very easy for him to get past togi here

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.590 
very easy for him to get past togi here
if<00:03:26.620> he<00:03:26.950> comes<00:03:27.160> up<00:03:27.400> with<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.760> right<00:03:27.970> mechanics

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
if he comes up with the right mechanics

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.660 
if he comes up with the right mechanics
flashes<00:03:29.410> mechanics<00:03:29.860> are<00:03:30.010> awfully<00:03:30.489> awfully

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
flashes mechanics are awfully awfully

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.660 
flashes mechanics are awfully awfully
good<00:03:31.410> here<00:03:32.410> comes<00:03:32.650> another<00:03:32.770> hatchery<00:03:33.310> inside

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
good here comes another hatchery inside

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.570 
good here comes another hatchery inside
of<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.880> main<00:03:34.090> actually<00:03:34.540> for<00:03:34.720> hoagie<00:03:35.580> flash

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
of the main actually for hoagie flash

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.040 
of the main actually for hoagie flash
coming<00:03:36.940> down<00:03:37.060> here<00:03:37.239> flash<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.750> actually

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
coming down here flash is actually

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.940 
coming down here flash is actually
building<00:03:38.500> eyes<00:03:39.570> crap<00:03:40.570> what's<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.290> what's<00:03:41.860> the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
building eyes crap what's the what's the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.310 
building eyes crap what's the what's the
Protoss<00:03:42.370> equivalent<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:43.030> bunker<00:03:43.290> now<00:03:44.290> I

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
Protoss equivalent of a bunker now I

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.590 
Protoss equivalent of a bunker now I
give<00:03:44.980> up<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.640> joke<00:03:45.880> was<00:03:45.910> wearing<00:03:46.330> out<00:03:46.450> its

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
give up that joke was wearing out its

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.870 
give up that joke was wearing out its
welcome<00:03:46.750> anyway<00:03:47.230> but<00:03:47.709> flash<00:03:47.980> he<00:03:48.310> built<00:03:48.790> a

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
welcome anyway but flash he built a

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.030 
welcome anyway but flash he built a
bunker<00:03:49.060> here<00:03:49.330> basically<00:03:49.600> just<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.350> distract

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
bunker here basically just to distract

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.009 
bunker here basically just to distract
hoagie<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:51.940> make<00:03:52.269> him<00:03:52.450> think<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.840> he's

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
hoagie and make him think that he's

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.380 
hoagie and make him think that he's
going<00:03:53.170> for<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.380> bunker<00:03:53.709> rush<00:03:53.890> but<00:03:54.250> hoagie<00:03:55.180> was

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
going for a bunker rush but hoagie was

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.810 
going for a bunker rush but hoagie was
very<00:03:55.780> very<00:03:56.019> wise<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:56.890> think<00:03:57.370> he<00:03:57.700> only

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
very very wise to that I think he only

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.449 
very very wise to that I think he only
brought<00:03:58.060> down<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.299> couple<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:59.140> drones<00:03:59.440> so<00:04:00.430> I

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
brought down a couple of drones so I

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.210 
brought down a couple of drones so I
don't<00:04:00.730> think<00:04:00.820> he<00:04:00.970> was<00:04:01.290> suspecting<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.470> bunker

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
don't think he was suspecting a bunker

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.190 
don't think he was suspecting a bunker
rush<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.580> some<00:04:03.790> kind<00:04:04.000> but<00:04:04.450> flash<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:04.900> putting

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
rush of some kind but flash is putting

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.470 
rush of some kind but flash is putting
down<00:04:05.380> his<00:04:05.920> command<00:04:06.610> center<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.090> getting<00:04:07.360> his

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
down his command center is getting his

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.500 
down his command center is getting his

see a layer build now from hoagie and
we'll<00:04:14.440> see<00:04:14.620> where<00:04:14.860> this<00:04:14.980> branches<00:04:15.400> off<00:04:15.519> from

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
we'll see where this branches off from

the SUV is very much alive we'll see how

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.640 
the SUV is very much alive we'll see how
long<00:04:45.250> he<00:04:45.640> can<00:04:45.669> keep<00:04:45.849> it<00:04:46.210> alive<00:04:46.479> here<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:47.410> yes

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
long he can keep it alive here but yes

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
long he can keep it alive here but yes
you're<00:04:47.770> gonna<00:04:47.950> see

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
you're gonna see

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.850 
you're gonna see
the<00:04:48.760> next<00:04:49.030> building<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.480> comes<00:04:49.720> up<00:04:49.930> probably

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
the next building that comes up probably

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.400 
the next building that comes up probably
going<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.160> be<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.400> spire<00:04:51.820> for<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.660> butyl

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
going to be the spire for the butyl

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.500 
going to be the spire for the butyl
assessment<00:04:54.070> which<00:04:54.490> is<00:04:54.670> very<00:04:54.940> very<00:04:55.000> strong

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
assessment which is very very strong

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.630 
assessment which is very very strong
especially<00:04:55.780> on<00:04:56.080> this<00:04:56.260> map<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.710> think<00:04:56.980> it's<00:04:57.400> a

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
especially on this map I think it's a

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.300 
especially on this map I think it's a
pretty<00:04:57.880> easy<00:04:57.970> for<00:04:58.360> zerg<00:04:58.660> just<00:04:59.050> shake<00:04:59.620> into<00:04:59.890> the

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
pretty easy for zerg just shake into the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.250 
pretty easy for zerg just shake into the
base<00:05:00.640> there<00:05:00.910> just<00:05:01.060> a<00:05:01.180> few<00:05:01.210> ledges<00:05:01.990> that<00:05:02.020> could

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
base there just a few ledges that could

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.620 
base there just a few ledges that could
just<00:05:02.440> sneak<00:05:02.620> past<00:05:02.910> finally<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.090> Scout<00:05:04.330> going

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
just sneak past finally the Scout going

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.260 
just sneak past finally the Scout going
down<00:05:04.810> so<00:05:05.140> hogi<00:05:05.890> could<00:05:06.160> go<00:05:06.340> for<00:05:06.610> something<00:05:06.820> like

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
down so hogi could go for something like

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.240 
down so hogi could go for something like
a<00:05:07.480> lurker<00:05:08.080> rush<00:05:08.470> and<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.770> would<00:05:08.860> kind<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.190> take

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
a lurker rush and it would kind of take

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.160 
a lurker rush and it would kind of take
flash<00:05:09.790> off<00:05:10.060> guard<00:05:10.360> at<00:05:10.540> least<00:05:10.690> until<00:05:10.930> he<00:05:11.020> gets

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
flash off guard at least until he gets

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.650 
flash off guard at least until he gets
some<00:05:11.320> scan<00:05:11.620> up<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:12.040> get<00:05:12.910> some<00:05:13.090> more<00:05:13.210> scouting

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
some scan up to get some more scouting

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.960 
some scan up to get some more scouting
information<00:05:14.410> it<00:05:15.070> could<00:05:15.250> end<00:05:15.430> up<00:05:15.580> going<00:05:15.880> out

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
information it could end up going out

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.640 
information it could end up going out
with<00:05:16.150> another<00:05:16.330> SCB<00:05:16.840> actually<00:05:17.290> to<00:05:17.380> get<00:05:17.470> that

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
with another SCB actually to get that

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.570 
with another SCB actually to get that
scouting<00:05:17.890> information<00:05:18.490> just<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.180> make<00:05:19.420> sure

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
scouting information just to make sure

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.920 
scouting information just to make sure
looks<00:05:21.580> like<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:21.940> might<00:05:22.180> be<00:05:22.240> what<00:05:22.390> he's<00:05:22.630> doing

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
looks like that might be what he's doing

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.720 
looks like that might be what he's doing
with<00:05:23.080> this<00:05:23.260> SUV<00:05:23.680> right<00:05:23.980> here<00:05:24.250> yes<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.550> think

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
with this SUV right here yes I think

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
with this SUV right here yes I think
he's<00:05:24.820> going<00:05:25.030> out<00:05:25.120> with<00:05:25.180> that<00:05:25.300> it's<00:05:25.540> going<00:05:25.690> to

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
he's going out with that it's going to

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.720 
he's going out with that it's going to
be<00:05:25.870> intercepted<00:05:26.380> by<00:05:26.410> circling<00:05:27.070> so<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.340> think

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
be intercepted by circling so I think

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.460 
be intercepted by circling so I think
even<00:05:28.270> though<00:05:28.420> these<00:05:28.570> are<00:05:28.630> going<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:29.020> not<00:05:29.140> speed

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
even though these are going to not speed

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.900 
even though these are going to not speed
upgraded<00:05:29.890> they're<00:05:30.010> probably<00:05:30.340> going<00:05:30.730> to<00:05:30.820> be

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
upgraded they're probably going to be

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.200 
upgraded they're probably going to be
able<00:05:31.090> to<00:05:31.180> deny<00:05:31.330> this<00:05:31.540> of<00:05:31.930> flesh<00:05:32.820> almost<00:05:33.820> losing

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
able to deny this of flesh almost losing

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.450 
able to deny this of flesh almost losing
that<00:05:34.360> SUV<00:05:34.690> I'm<00:05:34.780> surprised<00:05:35.170> that<00:05:35.350> hooky<00:05:36.220> didn't

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
that SUV I'm surprised that hooky didn't

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.310 
that SUV I'm surprised that hooky didn't
actually<00:05:36.610> try<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.030> go<00:05:37.600> and<00:05:37.780> take<00:05:37.930> that<00:05:38.080> down

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
actually try to go and take that down

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.490 
actually try to go and take that down
but<00:05:38.680> here<00:05:39.580> comes<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:39.910> Academy<00:05:40.510> up<00:05:40.690> for<00:05:41.110> flash

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
but here comes the Academy up for flash

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.340 
but here comes the Academy up for flash
he<00:05:41.770> actually<00:05:41.920> did<00:05:42.370> say<00:05:42.700> that<00:05:42.940> SUV<00:05:43.390> says<00:05:43.990> go<00:05:44.140> put

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
he actually did say that SUV says go put

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.990 
he actually did say that SUV says go put
that<00:05:44.470> back<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.770> mine<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.130> spire<00:05:45.430> coming<00:05:45.880> up

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
that back to mine the spire coming up

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.540 
that back to mine the spire coming up
and<00:05:46.180> flash<00:05:46.870> can<00:05:47.230> assume<00:05:47.710> the<00:05:47.950> spire<00:05:48.250> at<00:05:48.400> this

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
and flash can assume the spire at this

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.420 
and flash can assume the spire at this
point<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:48.970> think<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.930> hooky<00:05:50.830> he<00:05:50.950> kind<00:05:51.130> of<00:05:51.190> hit

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
point I think and hooky he kind of hit

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.460 
point I think and hooky he kind of hit
that<00:05:51.460> down<00:05:51.910> there<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.480> make<00:05:52.630> sure<00:05:52.960> that<00:05:53.200> flash

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
that down there to make sure that flash

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.860 
that down there to make sure that flash
has<00:05:54.070> a<00:05:54.100> harder<00:05:54.490> time<00:05:54.640> scanning<00:05:55.120> it<00:05:55.330> when<00:05:55.510> scan

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
has a harder time scanning it when scan

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.350 
has a harder time scanning it when scan
comes<00:05:56.170> up<00:05:56.350> but<00:05:57.010> i<00:05:57.040> think<00:05:57.520> that<00:05:57.580> flash<00:05:57.940> can

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
comes up but i think that flash can

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.870 
comes up but i think that flash can
assume<00:05:58.960> spire<00:05:59.800> right<00:06:00.160> now<00:06:00.310> since<00:06:00.550> he<00:06:00.670> saw<00:06:00.820> the

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
assume spire right now since he saw the

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.420 
assume spire right now since he saw the
lair<00:06:01.090> coming<00:06:01.390> up<00:06:01.510> and<00:06:01.630> no<00:06:01.840> hydrolysed<00:06:02.470> in<00:06:02.680> the

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
lair coming up and no hydrolysed in the

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.210 
lair coming up and no hydrolysed in the
timing<00:06:04.420> on<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.840> lurker<00:06:05.320> rush<00:06:05.650> of<00:06:05.860> some<00:06:06.040> kind

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
timing on the lurker rush of some kind

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.810 
timing on the lurker rush of some kind
would<00:06:06.520> be<00:06:06.550> kind<00:06:07.150> of<00:06:07.240> off<00:06:07.420> at<00:06:07.840> this<00:06:08.140> point<00:06:08.820> flash

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
would be kind of off at this point flash

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.060 
would be kind of off at this point flash
putting<00:06:10.120> up<00:06:10.210> more<00:06:10.330> barracks<00:06:10.860> finally<00:06:11.860> getting

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
putting up more barracks finally getting

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.100 
putting up more barracks finally getting
a<00:06:12.160> scan<00:06:12.520> up<00:06:12.700> and<00:06:12.910> he's<00:06:13.300> just<00:06:13.480> now<00:06:13.660> putting<00:06:13.900> down

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
a scan up and he's just now putting down

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.680 
a scan up and he's just now putting down
his<00:06:14.230> engineering<00:06:14.710> Bay<00:06:14.890> he's<00:06:15.040> gonna<00:06:15.190> try<00:06:15.430> to

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
his engineering Bay he's gonna try to

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.260 
his engineering Bay he's gonna try to
outsmart<00:06:16.830> hoagies<00:06:17.830> coming<00:06:18.160> up<00:06:18.280> always<00:06:19.090> I

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
outsmart hoagies coming up always I

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.790 
outsmart hoagies coming up always I
think<00:06:19.480> he's<00:06:19.570> going<00:06:19.690> to<00:06:19.750> a<00:06:19.840> sunken<00:06:20.290> Buster<00:06:20.650> of

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
think he's going to a sunken Buster of

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.800 
think he's going to a sunken Buster of
some<00:06:21.010> kind<00:06:21.190> is<00:06:21.370> coming<00:06:21.610> up<00:06:21.730> with<00:06:21.970> a<00:06:22.180> 1<00:06:22.360> fire<00:06:22.600> bat

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
some kind is coming up with a 1 fire bat

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.710 
some kind is coming up with a 1 fire bat
one<00:06:23.050> medic<00:06:23.410> already<00:06:24.130> pushing<00:06:24.430> with<00:06:24.730> this<00:06:24.880> tiny

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
one medic already pushing with this tiny

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.080 
one medic already pushing with this tiny
little<00:06:25.960> squad<00:06:26.440> so<00:06:26.740> yeah<00:06:26.890> he's<00:06:27.010> making<00:06:27.370> hoagie

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
little squad so yeah he's making hoagie

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.350 
little squad so yeah he's making hoagie
put<00:06:28.330> down<00:06:28.600> more<00:06:28.960> sunken<00:06:29.590> a<00:06:30.220> few<00:06:30.970> seconds

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
put down more sunken a few seconds

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.520 
put down more sunken a few seconds
coming<00:06:31.630> up<00:06:31.750> we'll<00:06:31.930> see<00:06:32.080> if<00:06:32.170> he<00:06:32.410> actually

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
coming up we'll see if he actually

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.010 
coming up we'll see if he actually
decides<00:06:33.160> to<00:06:33.550> morph<00:06:34.210> them<00:06:34.420> all<00:06:34.570> in<00:06:34.750> his<00:06:34.870> sunken

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
decides to morph them all in his sunken

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.600 
decides to morph them all in his sunken
ziff<00:06:35.320> he<00:06:35.410> does<00:06:35.590> it's<00:06:35.830> going<00:06:35.980> to<00:06:36.130> take<00:06:36.280> up<00:06:36.400> a<00:06:36.490> lot

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
ziff he does it's going to take up a lot

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.220 
ziff he does it's going to take up a lot
of<00:06:36.670> minerals<00:06:37.090> and<00:06:37.270> that's<00:06:37.420> exactly<00:06:37.600> what

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
of minerals and that's exactly what

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.590 
of minerals and that's exactly what
flash<00:06:38.440> wants<00:06:38.890> actually<00:06:39.790> a<00:06:39.820> zergling<00:06:40.240> snuck

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
flash wants actually a zergling snuck

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.060 
flash wants actually a zergling snuck
into<00:06:40.750> the<00:06:40.930> base<00:06:41.080> so<00:06:41.380> hook<00:06:41.560> he<00:06:41.650> got<00:06:41.800> asked<00:06:41.980> out

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
into the base so hook he got asked out

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.130 
into the base so hook he got asked out
there<00:06:42.370> it<00:06:43.060> was<00:06:43.240> taken<00:06:43.450> up<00:06:43.570> by<00:06:43.600> the<00:06:43.720> fire<00:06:43.900> bat

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
there it was taken up by the fire bat

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.230 
there it was taken up by the fire bat
yes<00:06:44.470> they're<00:06:44.680> all<00:06:44.710> morphed<00:06:45.370> in<00:06:45.490> the<00:06:45.580> sunken<00:06:45.970> so

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
yes they're all morphed in the sunken so

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.420 
yes they're all morphed in the sunken so
flash<00:06:46.840> has<00:06:47.110> done<00:06:47.350> his<00:06:47.530> damage<00:06:47.710> he<00:06:48.130> doesn't

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
flash has done his damage he doesn't

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.300 
flash has done his damage he doesn't
even<00:06:48.520> need<00:06:48.850> to<00:06:49.390> take<00:06:49.570> these<00:06:49.750> sunken<00:06:49.990> down<00:06:50.320> he

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
even need to take these sunken down he

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.550 
even need to take these sunken down he
says<00:06:51.700> stimming<00:06:52.330> anyway<00:06:52.690> trying<00:06:53.290> to<00:06:53.350> get<00:06:53.440> rid

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
says stimming anyway trying to get rid

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.050 
says stimming anyway trying to get rid
of<00:06:53.620> these<00:06:53.710> annoying<00:06:54.160> circlings<00:06:54.610> he<00:06:54.730> really

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
of these annoying circlings he really

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.750 
of these annoying circlings he really
doesn't<00:06:55.330> like<00:06:55.420> zerglings<00:06:55.900> but<00:06:56.550> yeah<00:06:57.550> when

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
doesn't like zerglings but yeah when

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.130 
doesn't like zerglings but yeah when
scan<00:06:58.030> comes<00:06:58.300> up<00:06:58.480> he's<00:06:58.630> going<00:06:58.780> to<00:06:58.870> try<00:06:59.080> to

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
scan comes up he's going to try to

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.350 
scan comes up he's going to try to
figure<00:06:59.350> out<00:06:59.470> where<00:07:00.160> the<00:07:00.340> next<00:07:00.610> base<00:07:00.850> is<00:07:01.060> coming

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
figure out where the next base is coming

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.150 
figure out where the next base is coming
up<00:07:01.480> for<00:07:01.690> hoagie

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
up for hoagie

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.070 
up for hoagie
because<00:07:02.670> that's<00:07:02.970> what<00:07:03.150> the<00:07:03.420> Terran<00:07:03.720> really

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
because that's what the Terran really

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.720 
because that's what the Terran really
needs<00:07:04.290> to<00:07:04.380> focus<00:07:04.410> on<00:07:04.860> is<00:07:04.980> take<00:07:05.190> you<00:07:05.310> down<00:07:05.520> that

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
needs to focus on is take you down that

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.700 
needs to focus on is take you down that
third-base<00:07:06.030> and<00:07:06.480> especially<00:07:06.780> on<00:07:07.050> this<00:07:07.230> map<00:07:07.500> I

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710 
third-base and especially on this map I

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.100 
third-base and especially on this map I
think<00:07:08.070> it's<00:07:08.190> pretty<00:07:09.060> easy<00:07:09.390> to<00:07:09.690> do<00:07:09.840> for<00:07:10.080> a

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
think it's pretty easy to do for a

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.050 
think it's pretty easy to do for a
Terran<00:07:10.500> player<00:07:10.650> at<00:07:11.130> least<00:07:11.340> a<00:07:11.460> medic<00:07:11.700> a<00:07:11.760> marine

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
Terran player at least a medic a marine

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.930 
Terran player at least a medic a marine
army<00:07:12.270> on<00:07:12.540> the<00:07:12.570> ground
