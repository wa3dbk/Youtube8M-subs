00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
gigahertz processor 4 gigs of ram 128 I

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.840 
gigahertz processor 4 gigs of ram 128 I
kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.979> realized<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> 128<00:01:13.010> was<00:01:14.010> maybe

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
kind of realized that the 128 was maybe

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.539 
kind of realized that the 128 was maybe
a<00:01:15.060> little<00:01:15.360> bit<00:01:15.570> too<00:01:15.810> small<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> decided<00:01:17.369> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
a little bit too small so I decided to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.999 
a little bit too small so I decided to
go<00:01:18.060> bigger<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.509> then<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.170> decided<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.830> go

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
go bigger and then I just decided to go

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.560 
go bigger and then I just decided to go
you<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> bigger<00:01:21.810> processor<00:01:22.439> here's

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
you know get the bigger processor here's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.440 
you know get the bigger processor here's
left<00:01:24.570> side<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.450> headphone

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
left side I think with the headphone

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.280 
left side I think with the headphone
jack<00:01:28.070> microphone<00:01:29.070> USB<00:01:29.909> port<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.930> other

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
jack microphone USB port and the other

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.440 
jack microphone USB port and the other
side<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> display<00:01:32.490> port<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.150> USB

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
side with the display port and a USB

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.810 
side with the display port and a USB
port<00:01:34.130> but<00:01:35.130> i<00:01:35.400> also<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.409> love<00:01:37.409> how<00:01:37.770> small<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
port but i also just love how small the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.679 
port but i also just love how small the
11.6<00:01:39.659> inches<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.770> thought<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.460> wasn't<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.540> know

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
11.6 inches I thought it wasn't you know

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.190 
11.6 inches I thought it wasn't you know
better<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.259> carry<00:01:43.710> around<00:01:44.149> than<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.390> 13<00:01:45.960> I

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
better to carry around than the 13 I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.469 
better to carry around than the 13 I
felt<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.159> bought<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.610> 30<00:01:48.060> might<00:01:48.329> as

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
extension for the poor depth or should

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.770 
extension for the poor depth or should
say<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.600> your<00:02:01.290> power<00:02:01.469> cord
