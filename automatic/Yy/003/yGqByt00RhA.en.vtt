loading screen which is kind of long
I'll<00:00:42.639> start<00:00:43.059> running<00:00:43.239> around<00:00:43.449> a<00:00:43.719> little<00:00:43.839> bit

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
I'll start running around a little bit

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.419 
I'll start running around a little bit
it<00:00:44.260> won't<00:00:44.350> look<00:00:44.620> too<00:00:44.799> pretty<00:00:44.979> because<00:00:45.309> I'm

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
it won't look too pretty because I'm

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:46.829 
it won't look too pretty because I'm
going<00:00:45.579> to<00:00:45.639> be<00:00:45.760> using<00:00:45.940> one<00:00:46.210> hand<00:00:46.510> because<00:00:46.659> I'm

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
going to be using one hand because I'm

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.930 
going to be using one hand because I'm
using<00:00:47.019> my<00:00:47.170> smartphone<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.370> record<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.670> that's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
using my smartphone to record so that's

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:01.319 
using my smartphone to record so that's
why<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.409> screen<00:00:53.409> is<00:00:53.559> a<00:00:53.589> little<00:00:53.799> shaky<00:01:00.119> any<00:01:01.119> day

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
why the screen is a little shaky any day

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.410 
why the screen is a little shaky any day
now<00:01:01.359> infamous
