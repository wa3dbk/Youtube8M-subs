00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469 
phase shenanigans you can pull this

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.349 
phase shenanigans you can pull this
because<00:04:54.099> not<00:04:54.249> only<00:04:54.279> does<00:04:54.549> it<00:04:54.609> mean<00:04:54.849> recurring

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:55.359 
because not only does it mean recurring

00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:57.359 
because not only does it mean recurring
effect<00:04:55.659> you<00:04:55.929> can<00:04:55.959> recur<00:04:56.529> the<00:04:56.799> effect<00:04:57.069> of<00:04:57.159> them

effect you can recur the effect of them

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:59.489 
effect you can recur the effect of them
to<00:04:57.669> hear<00:04:57.819> astrato's<00:04:58.389> but<00:04:58.899> it<00:04:58.989> also<00:04:59.109> means<00:04:59.349> you

00:04:59.489 --> 00:04:59.499 
to hear astrato's but it also means you

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.499 
to hear astrato's but it also means you

able to be a component of those planes

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.429 
able to be a component of those planes
allows<00:05:07.299> you<00:05:07.419> to<00:05:07.539> get<00:05:07.659> more<00:05:07.749> field<00:05:07.989> presence<00:05:08.319> on

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:08.439 
allows you to get more field presence on

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.139 
allows you to get more field presence on
the<00:05:08.529> field<00:05:08.559> and<00:05:08.860> of<00:05:08.949> course<00:05:09.159> it<00:05:09.669> is<00:05:09.939> an

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:10.149 
the field and of course it is an

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:11.939 
the field and of course it is an
elemental<00:05:10.599> hero<00:05:10.839> so<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.289> gets<00:05:11.499> all<00:05:11.799> the

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
elemental hero so it gets all the

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.589 
elemental hero so it gets all the
element<00:05:12.249> we<00:05:12.339> were<00:05:12.489> support<00:05:12.849> it's<00:05:13.419> another

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
element we were support it's another

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.539

light for elementary row the shining and

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:18.239 
light for elementary row the shining and
it's<00:05:16.269> I<00:05:16.869> really<00:05:17.529> like<00:05:17.679> it<00:05:17.860> I<00:05:17.919> think<00:05:18.099> it's<00:05:18.189> a

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:18.249 
it's I really like it I think it's a

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:21.449 
it's I really like it I think it's a
very<00:05:18.610> underrated<00:05:19.059> God<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.860> that's<00:05:21.189> pretty

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:21.459 
very underrated God so that's pretty

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.729 
very underrated God so that's pretty
much<00:05:21.549> it<00:05:21.669> of<00:05:22.029> course<00:05:22.360> this<00:05:22.629> deck<00:05:22.899> can<00:05:23.319> pull<00:05:23.709> off

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:23.739 
much it of course this deck can pull off

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:25.829 
much it of course this deck can pull off
most<00:05:24.219> of<00:05:24.309> the<00:05:24.369> combos<00:05:25.209> that<00:05:25.239> a<00:05:25.449> bubble<00:05:25.719> a

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:25.839 
most of the combos that a bubble a

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.839 
most of the combos that a bubble a
deckhand<00:05:26.379> do<00:05:26.529> but<00:05:26.709> and<00:05:26.889> then<00:05:27.159> some<00:05:27.519> so<00:05:27.669> ever

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
deckhand do but and then some so ever

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.879 
deckhand do but and then some so ever
not<00:05:28.059> eats<00:05:28.269> but<00:05:28.599> rather<00:05:28.899> not<00:05:29.109> it's<00:05:29.289> better<00:05:29.409> than

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
not eats but rather not it's better than

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.819 
not eats but rather not it's better than
a<00:05:29.949> bubble<00:05:30.279> a<00:05:30.639> deck<00:05:30.879> or<00:05:31.149> not<00:05:31.749> is<00:05:31.929> of<00:05:32.199> course

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:32.829 
a bubble a deck or not is of course

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:34.350 
a bubble a deck or not is of course
questionable<00:05:33.459> and<00:05:33.699> it's<00:05:33.879> up<00:05:33.969> to<00:05:34.089> personal

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
questionable and it's up to personal

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.850 
questionable and it's up to personal
preference<00:05:34.569> I<00:05:34.839> personally<00:05:35.319> think<00:05:35.529> this<00:05:35.679> deck

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
preference I personally think this deck

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.159 
preference I personally think this deck
is<00:05:35.889> more<00:05:36.159> fun<00:05:36.369> so<00:05:36.579> r<00:05:36.610> ever<00:05:36.789> not<00:05:37.029> it's<00:05:37.360> better<00:05:37.839> or

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
is more fun so r ever not it's better or

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.799 
is more fun so r ever not it's better or
not<00:05:38.229> kind<00:05:38.829> of<00:05:38.949> irrelevant<00:05:39.249> to<00:05:39.519> me<00:05:39.639> but<00:05:40.569> of
