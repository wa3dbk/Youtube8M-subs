a look at let's just take a look at here

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.280 
a look at let's just take a look at here
for<00:02:23.430> sample<00:02:23.610> billion<00:02:24.360> he's<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> very<00:02:25.140> good

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
for sample billion he's a very good
