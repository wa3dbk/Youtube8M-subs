these lower areas remember that this

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.889 
these lower areas remember that this
will<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.490> three<00:01:56.759> coats<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.360> we're<00:01:57.509> slowly

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
will get three coats so we're slowly

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.780 
will get three coats so we're slowly
building<00:01:58.259> up<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> third<00:01:59.189> finished<00:01:59.579> coat

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
building up to that third finished coat

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.240 
building up to that third finished coat
level<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.840> before<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.320> started<00:02:01.649> skimming<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
level and before we started skimming a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.760 
level and before we started skimming a
ceiling<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.850> had<00:02:03.030> some<00:02:03.299> loose<00:02:03.810> drywall<00:02:04.469> tape

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
ceiling we had some loose drywall tape

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800 
ceiling we had some loose drywall tape
that<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.130> had<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.610> rip<00:02:05.820> out<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.149> repair<00:02:06.450> here

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
that we had to rip out and repair here

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.139 
that we had to rip out and repair here
we<00:02:07.020> had<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> nail<00:02:07.799> pop<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.429> actually<00:02:08.940> went

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
we had a nail pop that actually went

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.729 
we had a nail pop that actually went
through<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.479> ceiling<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.110> did<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> patch

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
through the ceiling and did a patch

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.870 
through the ceiling and did a patch
there

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
there

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.610 
there
so<00:02:12.090> we'll<00:02:12.240> be<00:02:12.360> skimming<00:02:12.630> around<00:02:13.290> smaller

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
so we'll be skimming around smaller

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.910 
so we'll be skimming around smaller
areas<00:02:14.100> sometimes<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.820> use<00:02:15.030> my<00:02:15.300> Italian<00:02:15.920> spatula

to<00:02:25.590> size<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.730> styrene<00:02:27.030> blades

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
to size the styrene blades

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.920

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
distribution of compound then i'm going

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.580 
distribution of compound then i'm going
