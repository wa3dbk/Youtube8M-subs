00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.559
 Hello everyone, good morning 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.450
 this is the first video dedicated to one 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.330
 series that I would like to shoot about 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.150
 crochet and I know that on youtube there 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.789
 are lots of videos that teach the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.340
 basic points to start with 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.699
 a challenge, however, since I have 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.920
 it took several months to learn not 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.130
 because if particularly late or maybe 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 yes but because I had no one with whom 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.760
 being able to practice in person and me for 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 how I am made I need that is 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.520
 I would prefer to have a person close than 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.250
 show me things as they should be 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.440
 done i need to have someone from 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.390
 observe to learn to be able to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.129
 correct errors to be able to redo 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.699
 tell me what I'm doing wrong and 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.739
 what not being able to have all this for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.800
 learn to crochet before I bought 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.159
 some numbers of the seas of permanently 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.610
 cross or all knows a similar name 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.490
 but from the books one who must learn from 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.530
 zero at least I did a little 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.799
 effort for which youtube helped me 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.310
 there are so many girls 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.619
 so many very good ladies and therefore me 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.630
 here I don't feel like teaching 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.270
 nothing to anyone because there are people 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.490
 which I consider much more capable than myself of 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.640
 pass on these teachings 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.680
 however I would still like to give a small one 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.990
 contribution for what I can for 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.530
 how much 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.159
 my relative experience gives it to me 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.610
 for which today we learn the goodwill and the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.570
 chain we will do for each video two 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.560
 points then brief introduction to the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.270
 crochet hooks I have various Chinese in the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.950
 pencil that does not center for these are 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.039
 all my crochet hooks 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.610
 personally different size diameters 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.710
 I prefer the only aluminum ones 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.920
 whether they are colored or silver or gold 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.650
 no matter here I have taken several 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.480
 both in the market and online with those of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.510
 aluminum I find the work flowing 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 much better and than those maybe 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.850
 of plastic or even those I think it is 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.959
 always aluminum or maybe iron I don't know 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.519
 however these here dull gray on these a 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.650
 me the job runs a little less 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.530
 especially wool 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.630
 since I work with wool 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.880
 especially with cotton, however, I prefer 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.609
 the wool I find that those of aluminum 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.109
 let them be ideal let's start 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:53.690
 with the start we take ours 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:56.780
 thread let us pass on index two 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.440
 times this way 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.819
 we take the second package there 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.030
 let's pass on the first one like this 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:14.060
 let 's take the first let's pass 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:18.319
 under pull we see you slip on ours 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.620
 crochet and we pull and we have ours 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.180
 drawer that is the base from which we start 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.720
 always to begin work 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.730
 here here i'm sorry that the camera 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.560
 some faults in the zoom you will have 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.019
 the slightly grainy image I apologize 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.180
 for this I hope that the passages anyway 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.950
 be clear in any case if 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.889
 you have any questions whatsoever 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:49.110
 or whoever holds or keeps the job 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:50.850
 in this way in tension in wire 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.450
 let's start with our chains 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:59.330
 we take the movie and pull in our 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.330
 this is the first chain 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.440
 here it is 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.630
 and let's go on for all of those 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.630
 serve 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.930
 born here we have our chains 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:34.669
 let's do it all again 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:37.880
 let's dissolve then to do ours 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.720
 drawer we take the thread they remove 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.050
 immediately twice so we take the 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.500
 second son we pass it on the first 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.710
 let's pass this see our 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.620
 capitino begins to tighten we pull 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.050
 slightly and here we have the 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.040
 our drawer 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:05.990
 we take the thread we pass it over 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.030
 pull chain or you can do it 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.639
 so then take the trust 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.930
 the crochet hook catch the thread 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.590
 pass it over and then pull or later 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.470
 when you might have taken your hand 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.720
 hold the wire in place and move only one 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:30.860
 crochet you pass it under hooked the 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:32.630
 thread and pull our chains well 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.060
 for today we have concluded try to 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.510
 exercising is much easier to do 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.680
 what to say, don't worry 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.450
 I hope this video was there 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.389
 See you next time useful 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.840

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.840
 low
