met Terry I wanted to win but not as bad

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.180 
met Terry I wanted to win but not as bad
as<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:20.810> do<00:04:20.870> now<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.410> didn't<00:04:21.769> have<00:04:21.919> as<00:04:22.040> much

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
as I do now I didn't have as much

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.219 
as I do now I didn't have as much
adrenaline<00:04:22.669> pumping<00:04:23.000> through<00:04:23.090> my<00:04:23.180> body<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:23.870> I

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
adrenaline pumping through my body and I

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.930 
adrenaline pumping through my body and I
didn't<00:04:24.530> want<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:24.950> as<00:04:25.220> much<00:04:25.610> as<00:04:25.729> other<00:04:25.880> people

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
didn't want it as much as other people

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.520 
didn't want it as much as other people
and<00:04:26.419> then<00:04:26.570> he<00:04:26.690> opened<00:04:26.960> my<00:04:27.050> eyes<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.410> he

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
and then he opened my eyes and he

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.620 
and then he opened my eyes and he
slapped<00:04:27.830> me<00:04:27.919> across<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.190> head<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:29.090> then<00:04:29.300> he

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
slapped me across the head and then he

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.390 
slapped me across the head and then he
made<00:04:29.840> me<00:04:29.870> realize<00:04:30.139> what<00:04:30.530> how<00:04:30.800> hard<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:31.220> is<00:04:31.340> to

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
made me realize what how hard it is to

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.250 
made me realize what how hard it is to
win<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:31.940> that's<00:04:32.270> that's<00:04:32.630> what<00:04:32.780> made<00:04:33.140> me

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
win and that's that's what made me

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:49.810 
win and that's that's what made me
better<00:04:47.530> because<00:04:48.530> it's<00:04:48.680> natural<00:04:49.130> for<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.280> man<00:04:49.550> to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
better because it's natural for a man to

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.790 
better because it's natural for a man to
not<00:04:49.970> get<00:04:50.120> beaten<00:04:50.479> by<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.660> girl<00:04:50.930> because<00:04:51.650> they

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
not get beaten by a girl because they

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.740 
not get beaten by a girl because they
think<00:04:52.100> well<00:04:52.490> generally<00:04:52.940> we<00:04:53.210> feel<00:04:53.450> that<00:04:53.570> we<00:04:53.720> are

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
think well generally we feel that we are

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.240 
think well generally we feel that we are
inferior<00:04:54.289> but<00:04:54.560> we're<00:04:54.650> actually<00:04:54.770> not<00:04:54.979> really

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
inferior but we're actually not really

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.010 
inferior but we're actually not really
and<00:04:55.430> there's<00:04:55.850> some<00:04:56.060> like<00:04:56.270> Sophia<00:04:56.660> like<00:04:56.870> you

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
and there's some like Sophia like you

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.810 
and there's some like Sophia like you
dress<00:04:57.200> interviewed<00:04:57.650> early<00:04:58.100> on<00:04:58.220> today<00:04:58.370> she<00:04:58.729> is

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
dress interviewed early on today she is

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.250

actually very very good and she's very
very<00:05:00.590> quick<00:05:00.919> and<00:05:01.160> I<00:05:01.970> think<00:05:02.180> she<00:05:02.600> will<00:05:02.750> be<00:05:02.960> good

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
very quick and I think she will be good

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.710 
very quick and I think she will be good
because<00:05:03.289> obviously<00:05:03.740> with<00:05:04.039> press<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:04.520> stuff

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
because obviously with press and stuff

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.880 
because obviously with press and stuff
they<00:05:05.720> will<00:05:05.870> everyone<00:05:06.229> will<00:05:06.440> want<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.680> first

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.360 
they will everyone will want a first
Formula<00:05:07.250> one<00:05:07.430> woman<00:05:08.150> driver<00:05:08.419> I<00:05:09.039> think<00:05:10.039> it<00:05:10.220> is

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
Formula one woman driver I think it is

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.100 
Formula one woman driver I think it is
very<00:05:10.520> possible<00:05:10.789> for<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.210> woman<00:05:11.510> driver<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.960> come

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
very possible for a woman driver to come

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.440 
very possible for a woman driver to come
into<00:05:12.229> it
