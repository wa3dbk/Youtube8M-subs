00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:18.870 
such a low cost entry point people can

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.560 
such a low cost entry point people can
just<00:00:19.050> there's<00:00:20.010> no<00:00:20.160> no<00:00:20.550> impediment<00:00:20.850> now<00:00:21.150> anyone

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
just there's no no impediment now anyone

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
just there's no no impediment now anyone
can<00:00:21.750> see<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.740> may<00:00:22.950> be<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> product

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
can see this and this may be the product

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.670 
can see this and this may be the product
that<00:00:23.730> really<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.390> they're<00:00:25.140> very<00:00:25.320> natural

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
that really just they're very natural

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.870 
that really just they're very natural
anyway<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.100> needed<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.520> bit<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.700> science

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
anyway it just needed a bit of science

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.490 
anyway it just needed a bit of science
and<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.240> little<00:00:27.300> bit<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.570> logic<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.080> off

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
and a little bit of logic and off

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.310 
and a little bit of logic and off
they'll<00:00:28.710> run<00:00:28.920> forever<00:00:29.220> right<00:00:30.180> you<00:00:31.110> know<00:00:31.200> in

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
they'll run forever right you know in

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.490 
they'll run forever right you know in
again<00:00:32.279> whether<00:00:32.759> somebody<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:34.170> gets

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
again whether somebody just gets

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.010 
again whether somebody just gets
themselves<00:00:34.680> through<00:00:35.310> a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.780> blip<00:00:36.780> in

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
themselves through a little blip in

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
themselves through a little blip in
their<00:00:37.530> relationship<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.130> their<00:00:38.250> horse<00:00:38.430> or

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
their relationship with their horse or

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.660 
their relationship with their horse or
they<00:00:39.780> really<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> taste<00:00:40.470> of<00:00:40.560> this<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> get

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
they really get a taste of this and get

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.790 
they really get a taste of this and get
addicted<00:00:42.060> to<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.540> oh<00:00:42.570> my<00:00:42.840> gosh<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.320> is
