name's Davis and he ended up selling for
just<00:03:37.890> over<00:03:38.010> 4<00:03:38.430> case<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.030> between<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.079> the

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
just over 4 case so between that and the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.960 
just over 4 case so between that and the
coins<00:03:40.500> from<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.799> division<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.190> was<00:03:41.280> by<00:03:41.370> 12<00:03:41.700> k

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
coins from the division it was by 12 k

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.300

457 and a half thousand so we made at
between<00:05:45.510> I<00:05:45.660> think<00:05:46.080> about<00:05:46.230> three<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.680> four

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
between I think about three to four

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.410 
between I think about three to four
thousand<00:05:47.280> often<00:05:47.550> which<00:05:47.670> wasn't<00:05:47.880> bad<00:05:48.030> at<00:05:48.300> all

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420

and my car we picked up for sixty

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.910 
and my car we picked up for sixty
thousand<00:05:50.370> five<00:05:50.550> hundred<00:05:50.580> we<00:05:50.940> sold<00:05:51.240> him<00:05:51.480> on<00:05:51.920> 468

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
thousand five hundred we sold him on 468

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.090 
thousand five hundred we sold him on 468
has<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.310> in<00:05:53.400> that<00:05:53.520> 4<00:05:53.820> 12<00:05:54.300> 12<00:05:54.720> position<00:05:55.200> so<00:05:55.770> we

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
has it in that 4 12 12 position so we

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.830 
has it in that 4 12 12 position so we
