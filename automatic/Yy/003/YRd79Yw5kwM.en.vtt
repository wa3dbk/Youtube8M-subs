 follower of the big canvas hello 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.090
 today we are tackling 2001 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.190
 the space odyssey of stanley kubrick 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.050
 nine big sci-fi movies from 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.780
 all the time at the dawn of humanity 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.970
 alister black mill will rush a 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.850
 evolution of a great monkey that will become 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.150
 to 9.4 million ha the latest on the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.980
 Moon 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.840
 researchers and other humans 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.030
 monolith that emits a signal towards 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.040
 jupiter a vessel controlled by a 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.260
 artificial intelligence will then be 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.910
 sent to the distant star in order to 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.650
 find the answer to the biggest 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.290
 riddle that may have met humanity 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.989
 which repels quite often in the 2001 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.150
 it's the rhythm the film is cold the year 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.250
 there is little dialogue and realism 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.470
 scientist is pushed to the extreme 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.659
 of course the idea of ​​kubrick this was 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.820
 not to scare the viewer but beautiful and 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.170
 good to make him feel the experience 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.140
 a journey into space 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.210
 except that in 1968 space exploration 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.070
 in the heads because this crime 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.650
 had not yet set foot on the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.720
 moon kubrick had to imagine what 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.340
 could be life in space he had 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.500
 access to NASA's work there 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.570
 surrounded himself with specialists to render 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.490
 credible every detail of his film 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.930
 and for a bit that we look at his 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.630
 masterpiece of good conditions 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.670
 image and sound 2001 is actually 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.149
 a real trip to the confines of 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.759
 the universe 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.320
 but the great technology 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.000
 developed in the film is cold and 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.280
 dehumanizing just like franck 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.020
 perverted in his saga of a kubrick 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.759
 feared that the man would be tempted to 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.979
 copy to all his responsibilities to 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.720
 a machine and become slave of 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.550
 his own creation that's why the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.310
 most important character of 2001 and 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.619
 hal 9000 a paranoid computer and 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.500
 murderer as astronaut david bowman 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.820
 will have to defeat in order to complete the destiny 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.670
 cosmic of humanity 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.410
 and yes 2001 is a movie that celebrates the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.390
 again the age of space exploration 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.670
 but it's also a work on 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.380
 unfathomable mysteries of the cosmos a myth 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.420
 on the purpose of our existence 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.370
 inspired by the mysterious monolith of which 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.440
 the origins escape all understanding 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.810
 by means of the image but also of the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.280
 kubrick music makes a film about 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.560
 the insignificance of human thought 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.090
 against the titanic proportions of 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.549
 the universe at its release 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.709
 2001 the odyssey of space plus a flop 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.870
 and the critical welcome was disastrous 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.060
 slow room operators decided 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.950
 to leave the film to the card is to 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.739
 more and more that one came to see this 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.180
 atypical work since 2001 remains the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.890
 master stallion of science fiction 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.000
 that's all for today at 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.000
 soon for new adventures
