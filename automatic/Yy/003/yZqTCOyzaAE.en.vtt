years<00:00:19.320> ago<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:23.600> believe<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:26.180> historical

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
years ago I believe that the historical

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.600 
years ago I believe that the historical
evidence<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.500> historical<00:00:29.220> evidence<00:00:29.730> is

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
evidence the historical evidence is

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.979 
evidence the historical evidence is
strongly<00:00:32.610> again<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:34.100> hugely<00:00:35.100> against<00:00:35.989> six

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
strongly again is is hugely against six

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.530 
strongly again is is hugely against six
million<00:00:37.320> Jews<00:00:37.860> having<00:00:38.670> been<00:00:38.700> deliberately

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
million Jews having been deliberately

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.889 
million Jews having been deliberately
gassed<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.710> gas<00:00:41.040> chambers<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.210> deliberate

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.299 
gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate
policy<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:44.600> Adolf<00:00:45.600> Hitler<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.770> say<00:00:46.950> not

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
policy of Adolf Hitler but you say not

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.139

one<00:00:47.760> Jew<00:00:48.329> was<00:00:48.870> killed<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:50.070> gas<00:00:50.430> chambers

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
one Jew was killed in gas chambers

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.700 
one Jew was killed in gas chambers
so<00:00:51.930> by<00:00:52.079> loading<00:00:52.289> no<00:00:52.530> gas<00:00:52.829> chambers<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:54.710> believe

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
so by loading no gas chambers I believe

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.549 
so by loading no gas chambers I believe
there<00:00:55.890> were<00:00:55.980> no<00:00:56.129> gas<00:00:56.340> chambers<00:00:56.789> yes<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.870> think

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
there were no gas chambers yes I think

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.130 
there were no gas chambers yes I think
as<00:00:59.219> far<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.120> studied<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.750> evidence

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
as far as I have studied the evidence

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.000 
as far as I have studied the evidence
I'm<00:01:01.649> knocking<00:01:02.070> by<00:01:02.219> motion<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.449> by<00:01:04.010> as

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
I'm knocking by motion I'm going by as

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
I'm knocking by motion I'm going by as
far<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.460> I've<00:01:05.580> understood<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.420> evidence<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
far as I've understood the evidence I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.469 
far as I've understood the evidence I
think<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:08.070> instance<00:01:09.200> people<00:01:10.200> who<00:01:10.710> are

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
think for instance people who are

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.810 
think for instance people who are
against<00:01:15.140> what<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.159> widely<00:01:17.430> believed
