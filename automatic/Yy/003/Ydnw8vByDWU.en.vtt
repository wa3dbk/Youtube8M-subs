00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.570 
conference it was really fun and we got
a<00:00:18.660> ton<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> opportunities<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:20.070> out<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
a ton of opportunities to get out and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.130 
a ton of opportunities to get out and
shoot<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.180> want<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.480> share<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.900> some

shoot so I want to share with you some

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200 
shoot so I want to share with you some
of<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> tips<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.859> learned<00:00:23.369> while<00:00:24.029> we

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
of the tips that we learned while we

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390 
of the tips that we learned while we
were<00:00:24.359> there<00:00:24.600> I've<00:00:25.170> learned<00:00:25.619> something<00:00:26.010> really

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
were there I've learned something really

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.009 
were there I've learned something really
cool<00:00:26.580> about<00:00:27.000> shooting<00:00:27.330> mic<00:00:27.510> trails<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.990> I

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
cool about shooting mic trails that I

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.099 
cool about shooting mic trails that I
just<00:00:28.349> never<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.890> realized<00:00:29.429> before<00:00:30.109> when

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
just never really realized before when

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
just never really realized before when
you're<00:00:31.650> setting<00:00:32.130> your<00:00:32.250> exposure<00:00:32.700> we're

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you're setting your exposure we're

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.819 
you're setting your exposure we're
usually<00:00:33.390> thinking<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.380> exposure

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
usually thinking of the exposure

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.110 
usually thinking of the exposure
triangle<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:36.000> get<00:00:36.180> an<00:00:36.420> overall<00:00:36.989> exposure<00:00:38.120> and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
triangle to get an overall exposure and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.200 
triangle to get an overall exposure and
so<00:00:40.079> when<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.829> first<00:00:41.129> got<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.850> had<00:00:42.180> my

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
so when we first got here I had my

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.170 
so when we first got here I had my
shutter<00:00:42.840> speed<00:00:42.930> set<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.100> 30<00:00:44.399> seconds<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.120> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
shutter speed set to 30 seconds so I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.799 
shutter speed set to 30 seconds so I
could<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.510> lots<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.190> trails<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.820> vehicles

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
could get lots of trails of the vehicles

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.750 
could get lots of trails of the vehicles
as<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.170> were<00:00:49.230> coming<00:00:49.530> past

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
as they were coming past

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.389 
as they were coming past
we're<00:00:51.970> having<00:00:52.329> as<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.660> car<00:00:52.960> is<00:00:53.320> only<00:00:53.739> in<00:00:54.070> the

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
we're having as the car is only in the

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.150 
we're having as the car is only in the
shot<00:00:54.670> for<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.690> know<00:00:55.809> two<00:00:55.870> seconds<00:00:56.559> waltz<00:00:57.010> in

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
shot for you know two seconds waltz in

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.069 
shot for you know two seconds waltz in
front<00:00:57.430> of<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.579> camera<00:00:57.910> maybe<00:00:58.090> four<00:00:58.510> seconds

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
front of the camera maybe four seconds

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.650 
front of the camera maybe four seconds
and<00:00:59.290> so<00:00:59.950> because<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.579> exposure<00:01:01.090> was<00:01:01.360> 30

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
and so because the exposure was 30

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.479 
and so because the exposure was 30
seconds<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.290> looked<00:01:02.470> good<00:01:02.680> on<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.920> buildings

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
seconds it looked good on the buildings

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.310 
seconds it looked good on the buildings
but<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.210> car<00:01:04.449> was<00:01:04.659> only<00:01:04.839> there<00:01:05.110> for<00:01:05.140> a

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
but the car was only there for a

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.350 
but the car was only there for a
fraction<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.070> time<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.340> so<00:01:06.729> this<00:01:06.909> light

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
fraction of the time and so this light

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.080 
fraction of the time and so this light
trails<00:01:07.720> were<00:01:07.990> too<00:01:08.229> dark<00:01:08.550> and<00:01:09.550> so<00:01:09.700> I'd<00:01:09.910> never

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
trails were too dark and so I'd never

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.240 
trails were too dark and so I'd never
really<00:01:10.360> thought<00:01:10.390> about<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.930> before<00:01:11.050> but<00:01:11.560> when

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
really thought about it before but when

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.890 
really thought about it before but when
you're<00:01:12.400> shooting<00:01:12.550> light<00:01:12.910> trails<00:01:13.300> what<00:01:13.630> we<00:01:13.750> did

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
you're shooting light trails what we did

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.350 
you're shooting light trails what we did
is<00:01:14.020> we<00:01:14.050> switched<00:01:14.590> our<00:01:14.860> camera<00:01:15.250> settings<00:01:15.460> to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
is we switched our camera settings to

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.810 
is we switched our camera settings to
instead<00:01:16.780> just<00:01:17.110> use<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.350> shutter<00:01:17.800> speed<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.250> just

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
instead just use a shutter speed of just

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.700 
instead just use a shutter speed of just
the<00:01:19.000> amount<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.300> time<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.869> car<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.320> there

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
the amount of time that the car is there

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.630 
the amount of time that the car is there
for<00:01:21.369> seconds<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.210> we<00:01:22.930> increase<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.560> ISO<00:01:23.710> up

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
for seconds and we increase the ISO up

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.760 
for seconds and we increase the ISO up
to<00:01:24.700> 1600<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.619> that<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:28.080> trails<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.410> the<00:01:29.530> cars

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
to 1600 so that the trails of the cars

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.609 
to 1600 so that the trails of the cars
are<00:01:30.160> much<00:01:30.610> much<00:01:30.910> brighter<00:01:31.600> now<00:01:32.020> in<00:01:32.289> the

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
are much much brighter now in the

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.499 
are much much brighter now in the
picture<00:01:32.979> so<00:01:33.460> this<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.850> what<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.119> looked<00:01:34.360> like

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
picture so this is what it looked like

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.779 
picture so this is what it looked like
with<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.810> 30-second<00:01:35.619> exposure<00:01:35.710> you'll<00:01:36.610> see

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
with the 30-second exposure you'll see

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.779 
with the 30-second exposure you'll see
it's<00:01:36.910> properly<00:01:37.360> exposed<00:01:37.930> but<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.979> long

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
it's properly exposed but the long

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.210 
it's properly exposed but the long
exposure<00:01:40.240> trails<00:01:40.690> from<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.140> car<00:01:41.350> are<00:01:41.649> kind<00:01:42.130> of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
exposure trails from the car are kind of

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.139 
exposure trails from the car are kind of
dim<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.700> then<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:44.050> same<00:01:44.320> brightness<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.640> this

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
dim and then the same brightness in this

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:55.330 
dim and then the same brightness in this
picture<00:01:46.690> but<00:01:47.410> now<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.830> star<00:01:48.640> trails

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.520 

next<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> taught<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:56.790> awesome<00:01:57.540> workshop<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.290> ten

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
she would stand off the background and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.259 
she would stand off the background and
then<00:02:28.019> we<00:02:28.200> stashed<00:02:28.560> other<00:02:28.860> speed<00:02:29.370> lights<00:02:29.640> just

trying to do this is if we take multiple
photos<00:03:26.470> over<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> period<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.790> time<00:03:28.000> hopefully

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
photos over a period of time hopefully

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.130 
photos over a period of time hopefully
people<00:03:29.560> have<00:03:29.890> moved<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.940> what<00:03:31.780> we'll<00:03:31.930> do<00:03:32.050> is

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
people have moved and what we'll do is

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
we get stacking them together in

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.190 
we get stacking them together in
Photoshop<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.950> from<00:03:39.610> Photoshop<00:03:40.090> we're<00:03:41.020> able

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.590 
Photoshop and from Photoshop we're able
to<00:03:41.610> stack<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:42.760> together<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.180> wear<00:03:43.330> anything

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
to stack it together to wear anything

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.780 
to stack it together to wear anything
that<00:03:43.870> has<00:03:44.020> been<00:03:44.200> moved<00:03:44.470> at<00:03:45.250> one<00:03:45.490> point<00:03:45.640> or

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
that has been moved at one point or

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.730 
that has been moved at one point or
another<00:03:45.820> will<00:03:46.209> not<00:03:46.390> be<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.750> image<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:47.709> that

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
another will not be in the image so that

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.820 
another will not be in the image so that
way<00:03:48.130> anything<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:48.880> has<00:03:49.180> been<00:03:49.740> stable<00:03:50.740> the

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
way anything that has been stable the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.490 
way anything that has been stable the
whole<00:03:50.950> time<00:03:51.190> should<00:03:52.180> be<00:03:52.480> what<00:03:53.020> we<00:03:53.170> have<00:03:53.320> for

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
whole time should be what we have for

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.110 
whole time should be what we have for
the<00:03:53.560> shots<00:03:53.800> our<00:03:54.070> hope<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.550> all<00:03:54.970> these

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
the shots our hope is that all these

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.340 
the shots our hope is that all these
people<00:03:55.330> move<00:03:55.600> at<00:03:55.750> some<00:03:55.990> point<00:03:56.230> or<00:03:56.320> another

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
people move at some point or another

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.320 
people move at some point or another
over<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.830> next<00:03:57.070> few<00:03:57.220> minutes<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:58.030> we'll<00:03:58.120> keep

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
over the next few minutes and we'll keep

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.940 
over the next few minutes and we'll keep
taking<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.660> shots<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.410> then<00:03:59.590> we'll<00:03:59.709> be<00:03:59.830> able

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
taking the shots and then we'll be able

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.680 
taking the shots and then we'll be able
to<00:04:00.010> stack<00:04:00.190> them<00:04:00.340> together<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:01.180> will<00:04:01.420> look<00:04:01.570> as

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
to stack them together it will look as

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.270 
to stack them together it will look as

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
blocked off the tripod so the security

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.960
