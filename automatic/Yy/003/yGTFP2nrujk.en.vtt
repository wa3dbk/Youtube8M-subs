lps video was the last time I bought
some<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.199> guess<00:01:01.260> ebay<00:01:01.980> although<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> have

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
some so I guess ebay although I have

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.810 
some so I guess ebay although I have
gone<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> target<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.140> look<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.189> new<00:01:05.369> lps

but I just never found any ones I liked

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.230 
but I just never found any ones I liked
because<00:01:09.119> our<00:01:09.990> target<00:01:10.590> has<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> bad<00:01:11.729> selection

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240

because<00:02:37.930> this<00:02:38.110> camera<00:02:38.470> I've<00:02:38.560> been<00:02:38.769> using<00:02:38.980> for

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
because this camera I've been using for

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.059 
because this camera I've been using for
a<00:02:39.549> while<00:02:39.790> now<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:41.500> been<00:02:41.650> going<00:02:41.799> in<00:02:42.040> and

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
a while now and it's been going in and

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.550 
a while now and it's been going in and
out<00:02:42.280> focus<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.150> having<00:02:43.390> issues<00:02:43.780> lately<00:02:44.110> I

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
out focus and having issues lately I

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.069
