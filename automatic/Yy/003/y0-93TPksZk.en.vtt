00:00:02.315 --> 00:00:05.200
ANNOUNCER: And now for another
fast-breaking news story, we

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.010
go to our roving reporter,
Kermit the Frog.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.250
KERMIT THE FROG: And I'm getting
pretty tired of all

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.950
this roving too.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.260
Oh.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.570
Ahem.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.280
Hi, all.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.060
Kermit the Frog here, and
I'm standing next to a

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.620
candlestick, which may give
you some clue as to which

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.260
fast-breaking news story we're
here to report on.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.510
Yes indeed, friend, we're here
at the site of Jack be nimble,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.480
Jack be quick, Jack jump
over the candlestick.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.970
That's a candlestick, and
here comes Jack now.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.140
[SINGING]

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.490
JACK: Hey, Frog, what's
happening?

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.520
KERMIT THE FROG: Well, we're
waiting for you to act out

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.420
your world-famous
nursery rhyme.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.010
JACK: Heavy, heavy.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.570
I can dig it.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.640
What do I do?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.030
KERMIT THE FROG: Well,
it's all very simple.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.530
You see, all you have to do is,
Jack be nimble, Jack be

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.160
quick, Jack jump over
the candlestick.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.080
And the candlestick
is right there.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.000
JACK: All right, you got
it, froggy dude.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.280
KERMIT THE FROG: Yeah?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.630
JACK: Yeah.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.890
Let me get a little
leg room here.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.560
KERMIT THE FROG: OK.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.730
OK, folks, here it is.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.950
This is the moment we've
all been waiting for.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.080
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,
Jack jump over the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.425
candlestick.

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:01.635
Take it away, Jack!

00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:02.195
[DRUM ROLL]

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.630
JACK: Something else!

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.500
Yeah!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.560
All right, was that not heavy?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.410
Was that not a thing
of beauty?

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.380
KERMIT THE FROG:
That was wrong.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.660
That was wrong, is
what that was.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.700
That was wrong.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.420
See, you were supposed to jump
over the candlestick.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.600
What you did, you did, Jack be
nimble, Jack be quick, Jack

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
duck under the candlestick.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.010
That's no good.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.800
JACK: Oh.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.740
Over, not under.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.230
KERMIT THE FROG: Right.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.690
JACK: Oh, yeah, I got it now.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.100
Yeah.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.890
I'll do it again.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.050
Watch this.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.300
KERMIT THE FROG: OK,
here we go, folks.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.310
One more time, Jack be nimble,
Jack be quick, Jack jump over

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.880
the candlestick.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.142
Take it away, Jack!

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:38.600
JACK: Everything
is everything!

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.720
All right!

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.520
Hey, yeah, dudes and dollies,
do you dig it?

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.850
Yeah, just send the coins
in, don't applaud.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.220
KERMIT THE FROG: Uh, what you
did there, what you did there

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.580
was, Jack be nimble, Jack be
quick, Jack run around the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.820
candlestick.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.970
That's no good.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.630
JACK: Listen, Frog,
get off my case.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.470
I mean, I don't dig that.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.390
KERMIT THE FROG: Uh,
listen, Jack.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.030
If you want to work in a
world-famous nursery rhyme,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.540
you got to do it right.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.350
If you're going to do it,
you got to do it right.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.720
It says, Jack jump over
the candlestick.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.340
Now, "jump over" means you jump
up into the air, and you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.840
leap and you sail gracefully
over the candlestick, and you

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.430
land on the other side.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.610
JACK: Hey, the light dawns.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.940
Yeah, I got it.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.002
I'll do it, Frog.

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:26.920
KERMIT THE FROG: OK, folks,
one last time, and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.950
it better be right.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.720
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,
Jack jump over the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.120
candlestick.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.400
Take it away, Jack!

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.249
[DRUM ROLL]

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.686
[LOUD CRASH]

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:42.180
JACK: Ow.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.750
KERMIT THE FROG: He did it!

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.615
He did it, folks.

00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:45.850
Jack jumped over the
candlestick.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.630
JACK: Oh, yeah.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.410
Jack also broke every bone
in his body, Frog.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.740
KERMIT THE FROG: Oh, I'm
sorry about that.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.440
JACK: Yeah, I'm going to sue
Mother Goose for that.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.580
That's some heavy action.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.100
GLADYS THE COW: You think that's
bad, honey, you should

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.755
try jumping over the
Moon sometime.

00:02:58.755 --> 00:03:00.160
JACK: Hey, out of sight.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.680
Yeah, why don't you tell
me how you did that?

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.740
KERMIT THE FROG: This is Kermit
the Frog returning you

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.240
to your regularly scheduled
program.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.710
Boy, these nursery rhymes get
weirder all the time.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.490
That's weird.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.750
That's just weird, this here.
