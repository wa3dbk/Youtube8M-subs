enough to be washed and twists and I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.810 
enough to be washed and twists and I

thought who would want to do that well

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.320 
thought who would want to do that well
apparently<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:13.049> your<00:01:13.560> hair<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.150> tangley<00:01:15.150> if

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

started yeah yeah I started washing my
hair<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.320> twist<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.040> didn't<00:01:26.729> like

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
hair and twist and I just didn't like

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.760 
hair and twist and I just didn't like
the<00:01:26.939> feel<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.360> shampooing<00:01:28.110> my<00:01:28.229> hair<00:01:28.380> while

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the feel of shampooing my hair while

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.200 
the feel of shampooing my hair while
it's<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.100> twist<00:01:29.340> yeah<00:01:29.549> imagine<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> would<00:01:30.119> be

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's in twist yeah imagine that would be

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450 
it's in twist yeah imagine that would be
quite<00:01:30.329> difficult<00:01:30.630> yeah<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.070> found<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
quite difficult yeah and then I found a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.999 
quite difficult yeah and then I found a
sort<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.720> halfway<00:01:33.720> house<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> science<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
sort of halfway house in the science of

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.700 
sort of halfway house in the science of
black<00:01:35.220> hair<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:36.150> said<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.659> order<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.500> avoid

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
black hair they said in order to avoid

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
black hair they said in order to avoid
tangles<00:01:38.250> wash<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.090> hair<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.540> strands

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
tangles wash your hair with the strands

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.889 
tangles wash your hair with the strands
downwards<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.159> now<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> sit<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> tub<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
downwards so now I sit in the tub and I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.760 
downwards so now I sit in the tub and I
sort<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.399> wash<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.610> hair<00:01:44.850> downwards<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.170> don't

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
sort of wash my hair downwards so don't

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980 
sort of wash my hair downwards so don't
put<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.070> head<00:01:47.250> over<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> tub<00:01:47.970> wash<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.810> then

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
put your head over the tub wash and then

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.929 
put your head over the tub wash and then
stand<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.409> again<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:50.250> apparently<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
stand up again because apparently that

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.569 
stand up again because apparently that
makes<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.270> more<00:01:51.659> prone<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> tangling<00:01:52.590> so

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
makes it more prone to tangling so

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.880 
makes it more prone to tangling so
that's<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.170> wash<00:01:55.470> my<00:01:55.710> hair

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
that's what I do now I wash my hair

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.310 
that's what I do now I wash my hair
