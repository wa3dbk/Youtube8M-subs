00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 all the rays of good with you and the mayor today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.120
 we 'll talk about the Soviet premium 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.830
 tank t-34 prototype with a gun l-11 on 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.809
 in fact, on this tank, I'm not enough 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.269
 skated and just a few days ago decided 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.820
 I think you want he went to the first battle 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.789
 then I threw a little bit higher to and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.340
 the keyway we are the second and the next 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.529
 fight threw me to the first and second erin 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.740
 I mean that in the second Irina there was 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.529
 of these grooves B2 and the thing if in the first 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.260
 the battle was pretty hard after all in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.140
 2 has a good gun here in the second 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.600
 the battle it was simple and this hell was not with 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.820
 my side was for the germans 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.629
 but about everything in order and probably begin 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.270
 at first 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.940
 viewing tth tanks and the first is 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 of course we have armor in the tower we have 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 circle armor 45 millimeters armor 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.149
 the corps is also 45 except for the armor 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.609
 we have 40 there, but it’s not true 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.949
 really important and of course separate 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.989
 noteworthy slopes of armor they have 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.689
 we are pretty good compared to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.240
 by the same germans who are like 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.090
 those box tanks are basically so here 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.040
 having such armor and such slopes and here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.189
 getting into such fights that i got 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.350
 the tank is very, very nagiba I so as against 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.180
 throws you in for 4 with short 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.920
 seventy five millimeter cannon 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.170
 which bb shell you not at all 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 punch but there are cumulative projectiles 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.729
 which can punch but on the other 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.159
 parties they are not all pumped 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.280
 also situations with modification items a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.689
 also throw us pc 3 modifications 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.700
 e.i. 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 who also babette is not really palau 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.290
 work from but there is a subcaliber 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.630
 shells which of course pierce you but 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.729
 again on the other hand they don't have 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.890
 so special for armor action 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.090
 after all these are pigs usually they are not 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.189
 explode inside 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.740
 yes and phonology with cumulative they are not 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.990
 always prokachana at the enemy so 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.700
 in terms of security, we are in such battles 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.219
 I felt very well 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.740
 but that doesn't mean we can ololo 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.200
 rashit fly distribute right and left 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.629
 and think we won't do anything at all 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.020
 and we are such cool moments usually 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.330
 any tricky them 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.520
 steal up from the side and while you're busy 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.860
 some other adversary and 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.440
 intensely focused on him he 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.960
 quietly takes aim at you under the turret 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.840
 the case where you have bk shoots 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.820
 and blow up the zeros in the engine though here 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.280
 not everything is so simple if you shoot 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.590
 cumulative the chance to set fire to the enemy 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.810
 more, but not always with a subcaliber 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.790
 one shot can knock out the engine 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.720
 or set on fire or even blow up the same 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.460
 most bk 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.430
 that's just on the video you can see 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.700
 how do i proceed carefully on the map on 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.890
 this one i dont climb ahead and they allora jester i 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.470
 quietly standing behind the stone taking advantage 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.840
 I went away by cover 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.060
 reloading generally cautiously so 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.580
 click out opponents here probably 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.740
 many will shout out to fuke internet and in general 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.140
 how do you get out not kid but judge with 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.970
 the other side of the map is the jungle we need 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.160
 grab this point to dominate 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.530
 Well, just 3, respectively, we have them 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.140
 grab and to the opponent to win 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.870
 but rather that their glasses did not kill them 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.780
 I need to grab the point that I am 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.850
 defending well or point which is on the beach 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.970
 arranged in general bullshit me somewhere 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.310
 go ahead i'm standing trying to hold back 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.410
 enemy attacks well, like end of norms 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.290
 I hope with booking you understand everything 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.050
 We now turn to the instrument which is very 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.730
 also very good for your level, this 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.980
 gun l-11 caliber 76.2 millimeters from her 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.920
 very good selection of shells we have 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.780
 as well as team and solid high-explosive 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.600
 shrapnel on well of course best 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.160
 use kamornye let them and break through 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.980
 they have less than the same 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.560
 stupid but they explode inside and 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.900
 damage dealt more yes and with opponents 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.820
 against which you are thrown, I don't think that 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.130
 you need to use these solid 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.800
 dull-headed shells because chamber 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.959
 , too, all make their way with a bang, but there is 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.420
 a small remark about such 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.060
 chamber they have blow up or md5 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.230
 which worked early there still on 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.790
 who of which with the breaker im mdv 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.010
 but we don’t have them 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.440
 work already away from the point 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.930
 breaking through the fighting compartment so be 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.290
 careful when you meet against yourself 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.830
 pc3 modifications f they have screens on 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.020
 the tower and where we have mehvod and here is my grandfather 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.030
 the gunner-radio operator sits there are screens so 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.400
 that by shooting there you can just not 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.889
 break through the tank because the projectile will explode 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.210
 after breaking through the screen never reaching 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.610
 basic armor 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.800
 yes even a little bit about armor penetration and 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.260
 enemies are less serious 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.260
 opponents you can probably be 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.389
 only patient four modifications f 1 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.419
 whose forehead is 50 millimeters and the same 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.970
 pieces of modification and which is also 50 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.850
 millimeters in general I recommend shooting 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.800
 tank so and generally love tanks in 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.780
 mechanized water slot there is very good 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.630
 shells flying explode in combat 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.120
 separation and basically always happens 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.010
 you could probably see for yourself 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.229
 This video is also for those who love 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.780
 extreme you can carry with you and 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.849
 shrapnel on and shells that have on 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.080
 same 500 meters on which by the way 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:23.330
 armor penetration usually occurs 28 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.610
 so if you notice an opponent 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.220
 who did not notice you and is worth to you 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.590
 overboard or stern you can shoot 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.340
 shrapnel my watch a beautiful explosion but 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.560
 here all the same 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.840
 double-edged sword suddenly can and will not 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.060
 punch so I recommend shooting 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.220
 after all more but 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.050
 chamber and so with a tool like everything 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.210
 understandable now let's move on to 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.010
 next port is ours of course 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.650
 driving characteristics that is generally 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.110
 how the tank moves with us and it moves 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.940
 chic in a straight line picks up his 48 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.120
 kilometers per hour pretty easy 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.099
 it is necessary even with a slight bias up 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.880
 goes with the same speed in general 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.870
 no complaints about the ride quality 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.000
 It unfolds it too pretty 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.520
 cheerfully but on the other hand we already 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.310
 besides the car we circle armor 45 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.320
 millimeters and sometimes you can projectile 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.199
 the sides to catch a word or a little bit 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.120
 diagonally we stand astern to the enemy 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.240
 but if you want it to be faster 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.520
 unfolded 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.759
 do not forget to pump the water supply as it is 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.530
 directly affects the switching speed 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.090
 gears and then with not pumped mehvodom 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.370
 you will unfold it will 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.810
 transmit transmissions in general will be this 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.120
 do everything slower 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.740
 the next item and iran should be about 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.990
 modules but on the other hand it's the same 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.900
 premium appliances if you buy yourself 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.539
 you all will be pumped this one 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.389
 of the main advantages except of course 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:48.419
 Bonus Kachkom study and increased 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:52.500
 yield by the way they are as you can see for this 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:55.139
 fight killing 7 players and 1 bot I got 30 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.509
 thousand it is of course subject to victory but 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.099
 if we assume that it will probably be on average 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.949
 where are three four players 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:03.569
 or you can probably get those killed 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:06.150
 thousand about 20 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.069
 which is probably the same thing 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.930
 minus then we hope we never 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:12.539
 leave as the repair costs only 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.909
 eight hundred and forty silver lions 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:17.310
 so if possible recommend 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:19.949
 unequivocally take well well with me on this 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.080
 all with you was a mayor I hope you video 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.630
 like put likes subscribe 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.210
 Share this video with all 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:31.039
 friends well in general, share and how 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.039
 usually see you in sight
