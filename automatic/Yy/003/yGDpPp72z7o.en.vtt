get a precise lock I take the same key I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.100 
get a precise lock I take the same key I
put<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:08.350> all<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.890> way<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.810> then<00:03:10.810> I<00:03:10.900> just

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
put it in all the way and then I just

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.730 
put it in all the way and then I just
push<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.440> back<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.760> then<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.180> pull<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.660> out<00:03:13.740> just

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
push it back and then I pull it out just

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.470 
push it back and then I pull it out just
like<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.960> that's<00:03:16.960> how<00:03:17.110> i<00:03:17.140> lock<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:18.210> now<00:03:19.210> how

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
like that that's how i lock it now how

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.680 
like that that's how i lock it now how
are<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.750> local<00:03:19.930> machine<00:03:20.850> okay<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.270> usually

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
are your local machine okay so usually

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.010 
are your local machine okay so usually
for<00:03:22.900> precise<00:03:23.290> loading<00:03:23.770> I<00:03:23.980> use<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:25.210> here<00:03:25.570> like

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
for precise loading I use this here like

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.860 
for precise loading I use this here like
magazine<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.790> hold<00:03:28.030> candy<00:03:30.150> for<00:03:31.150> both<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.660> my

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
magazine that hold candy for both of my

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.660 
magazine that hold candy for both of my
starburst<00:03:32.320> machines<00:03:32.740> because<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.310> gives<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.580> a

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
starburst machines because it gives it a

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.720 
starburst machines because it gives it a
process<00:03:34.000> clothing<00:03:36.990> excuse<00:03:37.990> me<00:03:38.140> for<00:03:39.040> um<00:03:39.220> this

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
process clothing excuse me for um this

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.460 
process clothing excuse me for um this
machine<00:03:40.090> but<00:03:40.300> for<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.540> other<00:03:40.600> one<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:41.050> won't

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
machine but for the other one it won't

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.930 
machine but for the other one it won't
work<00:03:41.650> without<00:03:41.860> it<00:03:42.070> because<00:03:42.400> there's<00:03:42.610> spit<00:03:42.910> out

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
work without it because there's spit out

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.480 
work without it because there's spit out
like<00:03:43.030> 15<00:03:43.600> pieces<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:44.230> candy<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:44.710> I<00:03:44.860> have<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.340> use

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
like 15 pieces of candy so I have to use

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.350 
like 15 pieces of candy so I have to use
it<00:03:46.830> usually<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:47.860> would<00:03:48.100> load<00:03:48.610> them<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:49.060> here

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
it usually I would load them in here

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.600 
it usually I would load them in here
just<00:03:49.750> like<00:03:50.050> this<00:03:51.090> one<00:03:52.090> by<00:03:52.300> one<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:54.280> stick

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
just like this one by one and just stick

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.290 
just like this one by one and just stick
them<00:03:54.760> all<00:03:54.970> in<00:03:55.270> there<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.820> facing<00:03:57.820> up

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
them all in there like this facing up

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.920 
them all in there like this facing up
like<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:59.100> put<00:04:00.100> another<00:04:00.190> one<00:04:00.489> in<00:04:00.660> pushing<00:04:01.660> it

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
like that put another one in pushing it

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.390 
like that put another one in pushing it
back<00:04:02.140> just<00:04:03.010> like<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:04.900> pushing<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
back just like that and then pushing the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.350 
back just like that and then pushing the
last<00:04:06.610> one<00:04:06.910> back<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:09.459> today<00:04:09.910> I'm<00:04:10.000> not<00:04:10.150> going<00:04:10.300> to

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
last one back but today I'm not going to

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.540 
last one back but today I'm not going to
do<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.540> because<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:11.320> can<00:04:11.620> easily<00:04:12.040> just<00:04:12.250> stick

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
do that because I can easily just stick

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.229 
do that because I can easily just stick
all<00:04:12.760> three<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.180> them<00:04:13.360> in<00:04:13.660> at<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:13.989> top<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:16.090> what

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
all three of them in at the top so what

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.150 
all three of them in at the top so what
I'm<00:04:16.330> doing<00:04:16.570> it<00:04:16.690> manually<00:04:17.109> I<00:04:17.470> will<00:04:17.830> pull<00:04:18.040> off

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
I'm doing it manually I will pull off

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.740 
I'm doing it manually I will pull off
this<00:04:18.370> here<00:04:18.640> lever<00:04:20.489> device<00:04:21.489> here<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.030> i<00:04:22.690> will

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
this here lever device here and i will

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.510 
this here lever device here and i will
just<00:04:22.990> load<00:04:23.560> them<00:04:23.770> in<00:04:23.950> there<00:04:26.250> because<00:04:27.250> usually

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
just load them in there because usually

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.970 
just load them in there because usually
when<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:28.030> load<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.540> it's<00:04:29.080> really<00:04:29.680> low

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
when you load it and it's really low

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.860 
when you load it and it's really low
they<00:04:30.280> land<00:04:30.580> on<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.970> wrong<00:04:31.150> side<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.450> it's

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
they land on the wrong side a it's

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.420 
they land on the wrong side a it's
really<00:04:32.080> frustrating<00:04:32.320> because<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.160> have<00:04:33.280> to

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
really frustrating because you have to

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.760 
really frustrating because you have to
take<00:04:34.419> it<00:04:34.570> all<00:04:34.630> out<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:34.900> do<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.290> all<00:04:35.440> over<00:04:35.470> again

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
take it all out and do it all over again

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.900 
take it all out and do it all over again

do another video on me doing the

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.640 
do another video on me doing the
mechanism<00:05:39.720> so<00:05:40.720> again<00:05:40.930> stay<00:05:41.169> tuned<00:05:41.380> for<00:05:41.620> that

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
mechanism so again stay tuned for that

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.860 
mechanism so again stay tuned for that
