00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 hey we are going to make my lessons today 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.910
 do with 125 milliliters of sunflower oil 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 I can use any oil you want 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.740
 but I think laying sunflower was there 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.800
 little taste is in a tablespoon of honey 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.100
 a tablespoon of ground flax seed tablespoon 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.260
 vinegar 2 tablespoons water I now as a 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.840
 pepper and salt a few times at and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.609
 tablespoon mustard and that mustard that is 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 to taste I like it a bit 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.929
 French mayonnaise 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.690
 so i want them to have strong mustard 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.750
 deal with this and how the blender 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 put it on and show you how to get there 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.190
 get my lessons from 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 first we will mix the ingredients 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:51.170
 the king may go with the oil 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.800
 the linseed wonders is going to be there 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.800
 2 spoons of water 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.370
 a few a tablespoon of mustard 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.619
 maybe handy measuring spoons they exactly 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.360
 because it is a spoon so you can 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 it can easily keep up 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.860
 have about one checkered to the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.150
 have the right amount 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.150
 this is what you need 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.270
 let's in for all known 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.049
 with the blender I have all the ingredients 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.299
 ghana together here also a tablespoon 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.049
 I think I had to add mustard 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.320
 yummy 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.479
 I don't want a little pepper 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.710
 too much of the pinch 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.229
 and a pinch of salt because it can 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 always more but it would do 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.490
 trickier 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 it also went on my hand and then 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.579
 a pinch of salt names are long 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.460
 so do with blender on the pulse now 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.829
 stop all the way in but go downstairs 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.159
 we pulsate we are going to try a fatter 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.159
 to get 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.940
 justice down that the colors 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.940
 adjusting is getting thicker here 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.980
 Hey 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.220
 what we are going to do now is just for 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.870
 really mix top to bottom 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.870
 So I packed him just bitches 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.010
 Hey 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.150
 normally would but no they thicken 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.430
 of the eggs we don't have now 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.980
 used where your linseed oil meat doctor 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.970
 uses crushed flax seeds and it cares 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.680
 sure you get fatter 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.120
 well i don't know if you can't do well 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 but he is really beautifully fat now 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.519
 first we appeal because that is 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.519
 also most important 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.220
 He really tastes like a little mustard 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.620
 so if you don't like that you have to 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.170
 also less mustard in but I know 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.430
 sure that it is difficult here 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.819
 tastes 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.129
 for very many people i would say well 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.530
 i would like a pot but he does his job 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.859
 opening sentence such 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.859
 making AIDS
