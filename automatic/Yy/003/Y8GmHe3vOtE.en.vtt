00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.840
 hello to all in this video I want 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.940
 let you see how to remove 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 and that simple gesture instead of 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.029
 hold the acetone with the button to rub 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.740
 I wanted to share this method 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.980
 that I saw on real time the 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.520
 program me what wood you call 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.650
 in the labs 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.630
 so I like it a lot and I wanted to 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.420
 also share it with you then 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.800
 first of all we need to hear from you 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:40.900
 of foil of the diskettes that yes 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.960
 use to remove make-up and 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:48.340
 first of all acetone 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.149
 we have to get the diskettes and we have to 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.149
 cut them in half 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:06.020
 after we cut our own 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:11.150
 diskettes we take the acetone we enter 1 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:18.040
 on the diskette we wrap it around 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.040
 at the nail we take it this way 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.420
 our piece of tinfoil 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:33.950
 if we want to do it well 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:37.899
 in short, the nail sealing and proceeding 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.899
 so on the rest of ours 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.350
 after we have sealed ours 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.420
 nails with our method we leave 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.740
 act for about 5 minutes 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.860
 well after we get through e 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.770
 anyone minutes we are going to remove the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:05.590
 our wrapping rubbing well first 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.590
 the nail and then removing it 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.359
 then if some residue remains the return 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.540
 around the nails around the lap more 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:57.650
 small normalissimo so we will go to 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:03:00.930
 take a piece of aileron together 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:06.540
 there is a piece of against fine cotton 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:11.489
 cm to accept is the demo to clean well 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:16.040
 our account long in order to raise 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.040
 away and residues of enamel 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.690
