00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560
 water well 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.950
 my artistic career began in October 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 2010 when I started doing a little bit my 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.320
 brother of blood 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.710
 and we went to a tube known as willy 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.449
 titan the extraordinary then more 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.589
 late for some differences with my 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:51.839
 brother and we broke up and started doing duo 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.839

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.640
 He knew us as the titans 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.460
 but my comrades which army and me 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.040
 I was alone, I'm currently recording 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.470

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.510
 Appear 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.790
 I decided to call me titans with good reason 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.610
 but the main thing is that life made me 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.590
 a warrior 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.080
 become the very warrior is a name 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.390
 indicated after aqualia with me and 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.120
 that would please the public 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.570
 that it was time and that's why 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.130
 call me titans then watching the way 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.979

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.930
 versatility seeing how he composed a 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.840
 romantic spite seeing how 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.050
 variant component or a well perreo 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.410
 dance from a rock that lusts all 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.050
 type of songs so I decided to address in 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.500
 something else and that's why titans went up on 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:00.740
 professor as the greatest composer 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.310
 and demonstrating my mentality through 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.330
 different songs composed by me 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.630

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.030
 hearts 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.730
 and I have the dream and the longing that 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.710
 at least a few when listening to some 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.420
