00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
social system where you can follow your

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.700 
social system where you can follow your
friends<00:05:09.180> and<00:05:09.330> get<00:05:09.629> recommendations<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.500> see

friends and get recommendations and see

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.619 
friends and get recommendations and see
what<00:05:10.889> they're<00:05:11.069> listening<00:05:11.219> to<00:05:11.520> Apple<00:05:12.509> music

social<00:05:13.199> networking<00:05:13.680> is<00:05:13.860> more<00:05:14.069> about

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
social networking is more about

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.980 
social networking is more about
connecting<00:05:14.699> with<00:05:14.819> artists<00:05:15.360> rather<00:05:15.629> than<00:05:15.840> your

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
connecting with artists rather than your

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.749 
connecting with artists rather than your
friends<00:05:16.439> so<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.889> really<00:05:17.069> just<00:05:17.129> depends<00:05:17.580> on

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
friends so it really just depends on

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.189 
friends so it really just depends on
whether<00:05:17.969> you<00:05:18.060> think<00:05:18.509> that<00:05:18.629> your<00:05:18.840> friends<00:05:19.169> have

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
good enough music taste that you even

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.369 
good enough music taste that you even
care<00:05:20.969> what<00:05:21.150> they<00:05:21.270> listen<00:05:21.599> to<00:05:21.750> because<00:05:22.169> if<00:05:22.259> you

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379
