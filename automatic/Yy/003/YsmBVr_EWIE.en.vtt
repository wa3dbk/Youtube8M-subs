00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.300
 Well, it's time to make a retro 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.980
 boxing and take advantage of the one that was not yet 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.419
 to do it 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.799
 if it were for that, we'll already be 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.250
 doing it in boxing of new super mario 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.849
 bros 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.610
 but wii nobody this time he gets something 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.630
 more classic some really retro and already 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.630
 I know which game will be the perfect 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.440
 ah 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.120
 let's see an unboxing trail and one of 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.860
 those that I think excellent all 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.780
 players have played it or at least 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.730
 I have seen the great ear of him 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.670
 we refer clearly to the version of the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.020
 super mario bros the first nintendo in 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.950
 its commercial version that contains 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.950
 also talc game 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.430
 this pack of games is possibly 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.290
 the cartridge best known by all 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.630
 players since it includes two video games 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.550
 classic and icons of the first nintendo the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.409
 super mario bros which is a game of 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.180
 platforms in which you will help mario 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.530
 to rescue the princess through 8 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.479
 worlds due to science actions 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.250
 and on the other hand we find it adba with 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.260
 a pretty interesting game for the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.640
 epoch since its objective was home of 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.560
 Largest number of ducks per scenario 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840
 making use of one of the most advisors 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.700
 nintendo classics for the pistolite or 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.259

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.820
 friend a canine which and in the mission 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.920
 space to the dams and literally 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.049
 he lets the ducks fall causing his 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.490
 Quick escape in flocks leaving them to your 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.810
 merced giving you the possibility 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.450
 shoot them up to three times for each 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.250

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.960

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.960
 no white 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.490
 i 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.140
 no no 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.910
 and we are starting with this challenge in the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.310
 what is the commercial pressure of super 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.200
 mario bros with dot com in the same 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.570
 cartridge with much remember this 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.680
 cartridge really everyone know it I 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.680
 I think everyone will know 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.150
 has exactly on the cover with the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.220
 cartridge the same illustration this pair 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.910
 of games were played differently 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.880
 the mario bros was controlled with our 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.590
 pad 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.450
 while the ones with we have to 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.450
 resort to using the internal pistolita 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.390
 on the back of the box 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.280
 then comes artwork about 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.020
 the video games already mentioned in the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.880
 mario bros case 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.890
 Well well an illustration about 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.680
 of this level remembering the fish 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.550
 fly away more than one of this type 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.050
 of levels the underground worlds these 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.700
 I really like worlds 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.560
 aquatic that really are very few in 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.960
 the game but they are also fun and 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.810
 you will compose final confrontation against 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.460
 you to me at the end of each castle at 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.290
 the doctor also has some 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.470
 illustrations in this case the ducks 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.780
 flying our faithful friend who is 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.940
 will make the ducks fly 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.000
 so that we can hunt them and 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.590
 finally an image of others that 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.240
 they have even the doctor that in this 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.940
 case they do not leave duck but a kind of 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.720
 UFOs or discs that pulverized them 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.720
 literally 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.740
 also bring your protector preserve for 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.819
 keep your cartridges well in a state 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.069
 and clean 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.680
 and this is the manual of mario bros and 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.900
 doctoral student 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.519
 same the same illustration in both 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.080
 occasions on the cover on the cartridge and 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.220
 in the manual 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.220
 let's go down a little bit 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.400
 teach the controls 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.360
 we have basics back then 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.360
 really the controls 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.600
 teach the different items that there are in 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.120
 the game like the Mayan mushrooms that have 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.040
 changed with the reference to difference 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.570
 of many of the current new games 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.570
 of mario and later 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.260
 tell us more have illustration 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.260
 then handmade 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.670
 teach you about the enemies and the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.600
 number of points you get at 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.700
 beat them 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.950
 for example these 12 enemies that more 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.230
 silver have given us in this game the 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.400
 hammers brothers who always spend it 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.750
 like dancing and bursting you hammers 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.750
 and also clear the classic latitude 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.139
 and bowser that really has also 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.139
 changed and evolved 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.350
 ah 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.240
 no no 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.220
 I mentioned that this cartridge is the most 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.230
 common because it is the cartridge that you 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.910
 gave away when buying your nintendo which 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.220
 It also includes a pistol and is in 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.630
 red or gray color though 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.490
 this pair of games also came out to the 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.710
 sale individually retaining its 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.210
 same cover and content also then 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.670
 another version that includes both games 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.990
 but additionally, another is included 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.990
 world class trick met 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.090
 we were not all friends in this little 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.189
 boxing mouse I hope you liked it 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.259
 they really are a couple of games very 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.419
 good both mario bros or in principle 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.009
 of a saga and of many games that 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.289
 they followed and continue this line of this 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.849
 game like new super mario bros home 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.680
 by mario bros wii is in a form of 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.389
 part of my style and good if they want 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.969
 get revenge on the puppy from them 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.379
 I recommend this paper the version of the 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.479
 dot count 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:56.330
 mysterious by and so good if you have 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.919
 opportunity to acquire it then luck and 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.919
 well that is soon greetings 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.200
