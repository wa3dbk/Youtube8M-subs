00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.879
 but episode a new tutorial you know 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.140
 how to make a hidden store in a blog 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.599
 it's good how it's done 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.060
 or a block is opened in the middle of 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.750
 wall as you see vale is exchanged and 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.449
 well this is this circuit is very very 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.010
 good since it occupies very little space and 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.510
 I'm going to give an example of what the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.739
 warehouse is worth here exposed a 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.540
 configuration you can do it 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.430
 As lonely as you want, I've done it 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.229
 well and in this case as the circuit is 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.979
 so small lets have a lot of 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.839
 things inside 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:48.460
 for example in this combination we have 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:51.610
 access to 17 blocks to 17 double goals 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.890
 worth 17 trunks double eyes to the data 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.379
 worth 3 ovens as you see here an anvil 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.350
 an enders is a table fret and a table 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.320
 enchantment level 30 is worth as you see 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.030
 we are lying 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.240
 there is no no you do not wave 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.930
 ok and broke 31 this bad 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.440
 Y 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.800
 As you can see, it 's totally hidden, it's worth it 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.560
 for our tutorial we will need three 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.170
 Two sticky law blocks and pistons 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.270
 two axes for better stone and a sensual and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.250
 repeater or my god and we go with the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.660
 tutorial and we started the turn of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.340
 protection of our pistons that one 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.920
 know looking down another iran 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.650
 looking to this side and here the block 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.800
 normal three blocks of the line over here 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.800
 down ballet and here will go our input 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.649
 ok with a block pushes us bleu yo 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.990
 I recommend putting an oven because it's very 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.660
 easy to spend in survival vale and 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.240
 It will also serve as part of our 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.190
 hidden store valent well here will be 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.890
 the input with a lever that will be 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.720
 the wall and here we are going to take others 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.399
 what pushes us bleu 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.490
 another block does not push bleu around here 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.860
 down and a repeater to 2 tick here 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.539
 over it's worth if we have blocks go up 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.670
 blocks over here and we put one of rest 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.400
 nor the circuit would be done 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.140
 well we fill all this is worth this 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.860
 it would be our wall 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.520
 petete 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.020
 ok and here just like here it would open 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.020
 as you see the hole and 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.989
 and I love this people circuit because 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.150
 it really does not just take it off 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.610
 I exchanged you take this one up and 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.610
 up and this one goes up here 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.650
 as you can see and well I hope that it has 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.230
 liked this one insists the tutorial are worth 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.170
 As you can see here, you can see this 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.000
 and this valuable way to store the items 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.819
 for the only thing you have to do is 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.530
 just put it around the block 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.390
 ok and until it reaches the hand of 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.950
 our character and see you in the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.950
 next video chao
