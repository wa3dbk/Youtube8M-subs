00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 v is that one as rest introduces and 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.069
 I bring you a new trick 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.500
 simple where I'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.840
 make a vision or how to have ex vision 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.330
 king in minecraft underwater then 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.730
 Today I am going to show you, I do not think 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.590
 I would be in being a former king, I think 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.770
 I would come doing as perfect vision 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.930
 under water but good this treatment of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.460
 show how it works 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.260
 first I'm going to show you a small 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.930
 show that we get this 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.230
 small platform we use this position 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.480
 of night vision and then how can 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.430
 notice we have perfect vision under the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.340
 water then in case it ever gets 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.559
 They asked how or what the octopuses do 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.540
 under water all the time then look here 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.149
 they have the answer that octopuses do 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.850
 under water, look here, they have what 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.430
 what they do are worth housing all the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.829
 time as you can see but good this 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.840
 I know it's something could seem useless 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 but it's a gray that just came out 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 recently and it made me interesting 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.160
 I said well let's record it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.450
 originally the idea that was well redit 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.280
 was with one of our light sensors 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.770
 that if we get in we have to press 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.870
 chip and we can already see underwater and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.090
 I was testing other blocks that were 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.500
 towards the middle or so they are blocks 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.960
 like stairs and others 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.210
 until I found this one that was the one of 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.800
 tractor that as you can see our 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.020
 pressing not even shift and I can already 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.570
 see perfectly well instead as 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.780
 I say here we have to press shift and 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.700
 now yes we can see then this is 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.619
 something to keep in mind apart from that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.330
 this is a lot more cheaper than 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.250
 do it that your tractor the comparison 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.860
 of the light sensor that I do not even know 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.390
 how it is done but good now what 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 I'm going to show you how everything is made unique 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.150
 what we need is a tractor and we take 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.940
 this a sign of these then what 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.090
 we need now is to find a place 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.520
 we are not going to give a bit of land and we're going 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.130
 let's see let's grab this we have to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.900
 have I think it 's there is not one more 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.159
 down 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.369
 we do not have to put is that 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.800
 here we put what is the most work 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.870
 down 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.209
 we 're fine there we have to put the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.160
 worker and two blocks up here a 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.099
 block two blocks up we have to 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.450
 put what is a signal do not remember 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.190
 which are two blocks not because if not 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.599
 is going to work this and now if 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.599
 we only get here 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.560
 when it's not like that, the more down 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.970
 down to see is one further down sorry 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.110
 Excuse me, this is what I did 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.390
 how many days and I do not remember 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.470
 perfectly fine of everything is now if 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.470
 we put it here we take the position 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.820
 and now it works how you can notice 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.920
 I tell you, it's quite simple but 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.230
 It made me interesting since the is 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.110
 very recent people, because recently 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.640
 they just discovered it and I do not know how I saw 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.620
 that with the after two can be done without 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.900
 not even press shift because yes we are going to 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.370
 do the video to see how you like this 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.560
 also a while ago I made a video of 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.730
 how to do is law how to have a vision 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.709
 it's racing 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.940
 well here on the surface then such 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.500
 Once again , they will be again a 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.019
 new version that I have been working on 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.200
 her but well this is going to be all for 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.489
 today I hope you liked it and see you 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.489
 until next time
