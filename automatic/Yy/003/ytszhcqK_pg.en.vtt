we<00:00:09.420> got<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> no.3<00:00:10.110> Acura<00:00:10.559> MDX<00:00:11.179> now<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
we got a no.3 Acura MDX now the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.240 
we got a no.3 Acura MDX now the
complaint<00:00:12.719> from<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.049> driver<00:00:13.320> was<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.009> some

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
complaint from the driver was that some

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.189 
complaint from the driver was that some
kind<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> fluid<00:00:14.880> was<00:00:15.210> bubbling<00:00:15.630> out<00:00:15.870> and

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
kind of a fluid was bubbling out and

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.230 
kind of a fluid was bubbling out and
it's<00:00:16.350> kind<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.710> strange<00:00:17.039> color<00:00:17.460> when<00:00:18.150> he

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
it's kind of a strange color when he

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.730 
it's kind of a strange color when he
checked<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.660> looked<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.289> coming<00:00:19.619> out

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
checked it looked like it was coming out

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.040 
checked it looked like it was coming out
of<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.010> overflow<00:00:20.310> from<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> coolant<00:00:21.210> when<00:00:21.900> we

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
of the overflow from the coolant when we

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.290 
of the overflow from the coolant when we
brought<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:23.279> took<00:00:23.460> off<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.699> radiator

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
brought it in we took off the radiator

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.290 
brought it in we took off the radiator
cap<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.170> was<00:00:25.260> an<00:00:25.410> oily<00:00:25.970> coolant<00:00:26.970> mix

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
cap and there was an oily coolant mix

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.599 
cap and there was an oily coolant mix
coming<00:00:27.720> out<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.349> bubbling<00:00:28.740> out<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
coming out just bubbling out of the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.150 
coming out just bubbling out of the
radiator<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.900> that's<00:00:31.230> your<00:00:31.410> problem<00:00:31.679> here's

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
radiator if that's your problem here's

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.450 
radiator if that's your problem here's
something<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> look<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:37.190> now<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.340> our

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
something to look for now in our

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.130 
something to look for now in our
preliminary<00:00:38.610> checks<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.540> check<00:00:39.809> pulled<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
preliminary checks we check pulled the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
preliminary checks we check pulled the
oil<00:00:40.379> dipstick<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> little<00:00:42.090> bit

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
oil dipstick out and it was a little bit

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.630 
oil dipstick out and it was a little bit
low<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.200> nearly<00:00:43.500> enough<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.219> mixing

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
low but not nearly enough to be mixing

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.910 
low but not nearly enough to be mixing
this<00:00:44.850> badly<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.690> antifreeze<00:00:46.230> now<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this badly with your antifreeze now the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.830 
this badly with your antifreeze now the
transmission<00:00:47.399> however<00:00:48.149> showed<00:00:48.450> hardly

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
transmission however showed hardly

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900 
transmission however showed hardly
anything<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> dipstick<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.190> when<00:00:50.730> we

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
anything on the dipstick and when we

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.760 
anything on the dipstick and when we
were<00:00:51.059> driving<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.780> into<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> shop<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.559> was

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
were driving it into the shop it was

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.860 
were driving it into the shop it was
shifting<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.760> odd<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.690> we're

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
shifting a little bit odd so we're

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
shifting a little bit odd so we're
suspecting<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.890> transmission<00:00:56.640> fluid<00:00:57.000> also

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
suspecting it's transmission fluid also

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.500 
suspecting it's transmission fluid also
when<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.199> look<00:00:58.230> at<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> radiator<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.149> no

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
when we look at the radiator there is no

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.450 
when we look at the radiator there is no
engine<00:01:01.050> oil<00:01:01.379> cooler<00:01:01.440> built<00:01:01.980> into<00:01:02.280> this

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
engine oil cooler built into this

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.369 
engine oil cooler built into this
radiator<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> transmission

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
radiator but there is a transmission

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.530 
radiator but there is a transmission
cooler<00:01:04.589> built<00:01:05.129> internally<00:01:05.790> inside<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
cooler built internally inside the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.080 
cooler built internally inside the
radiator<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> only<00:01:08.430> way<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.909> really

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
radiator so the only way we can really

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.390 
radiator so the only way we can really
diagnose<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.200> pull<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> radiator<00:01:10.770> out

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
diagnose this is pull the radiator out

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.870 
diagnose this is pull the radiator out
and<00:01:11.869> pressurize<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.229> transmission<00:01:13.880> cooling

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and pressurize that transmission cooling

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.810 
and pressurize that transmission cooling
channels<00:01:15.840> inside<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> radiator<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.670> if

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
channels inside the radiator and see if

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.609 
channels inside the radiator and see if
they're<00:01:18.000> leaking<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:19.049> course<00:01:19.350> we're<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
they're leaking of course we're going to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.140 
they're leaking of course we're going to
have<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.830> replace<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> radiator<00:01:20.490> anyway

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
have to replace the radiator anyway

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.140 
have to replace the radiator anyway
because<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.479> has<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.689> been<00:01:21.900> full<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.530> oil

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
because it has just been full of oil

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.270 
because it has just been full of oil
transmission<00:01:24.150> fluid<00:01:25.009> we've<00:01:26.009> got<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
transmission fluid we've got the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
transmission fluid we've got the
radiator<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:27.000> we're<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> Sun<00:01:27.720> where<00:01:27.900> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
radiator out we're out the Sun where you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.240 
radiator out we're out the Sun where you
can<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> good<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.799> know<00:01:28.829> we've<00:01:29.070> got

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
can see it good as you know we've got

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
can see it good as you know we've got
the<00:01:29.369> upper<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.729> lower<00:01:29.939> hose<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> coolant

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the upper and lower hose so the coolant

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.649 
the upper and lower hose so the coolant
actually<00:01:32.070> flows<00:01:32.369> through<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.759> radiator<00:01:33.210> here

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
actually flows through the radiator here

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
actually flows through the radiator here
and<00:01:33.840> we've<00:01:34.470> actually<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> tranny<00:01:35.340> cooler

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and we've actually got the tranny cooler

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240 
and we've actually got the tranny cooler
line<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.869> very<00:01:37.170> rusted<00:01:37.770> down<00:01:37.920> there

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
line there it's very rusted down there

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
line there it's very rusted down there
and<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.360> actually<00:01:39.509> right<00:01:39.930> there

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and this one was actually right there

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.810 
and this one was actually right there
and<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.860> rusted<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.640> actually

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and it was so rusted that it actually

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.910 
and it was so rusted that it actually
came<00:01:42.180> off<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.780> took<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.290> it's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
came off when we took it out it's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.460 
came off when we took it out it's
supposed<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.549> sealed<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
supposed to be sealed in there so the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.200 
supposed to be sealed in there so the
tranny<00:01:46.740> cooler<00:01:47.070> runs<00:01:47.640> through<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> lower

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
tranny cooler runs through the lower

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.380 
tranny cooler runs through the lower
tank<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.610> were<00:01:50.729> thinking<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.270> would

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
tank so what we were thinking what would

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.830 
tank so what we were thinking what would
happen<00:01:51.810> was<00:01:52.159> we<00:01:53.159> would<00:01:53.340> take<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> air<00:01:54.360> line<00:01:54.659> with

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
happen was we would take a air line with

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.260 
happen was we would take a air line with
a<00:01:54.869> rubber<00:01:55.140> tip<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.799> put<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.640> here<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.909> seal

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a rubber tip and put it in here and seal

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.800 
a rubber tip and put it in here and seal
it<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:58.409> pump<00:01:58.710> through<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
it and then pump through here and you

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.380 
it and then pump through here and you
can<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:00.960> air<00:02:01.170> coming<00:02:01.439> out<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.060> sealed

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
can see air coming out so if we sealed

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.630 
can see air coming out so if we sealed
this<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:04.530> thought<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:04.979> would<00:02:05.159> hear<00:02:05.430> air

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
this we thought we would hear air

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.370 
this we thought we would hear air
leaking<00:02:06.270> through<00:02:06.540> into<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> coolant

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
leaking through into the coolant

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.979 
leaking through into the coolant
passageways<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:09.000> let<00:02:09.149> them<00:02:09.239> seal<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
passageways so let them seal that and

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.320 
passageways so let them seal that and
pressurize<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.850 

it<00:02:15.330> may<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.600> hard<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.960> tell<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.470> video<00:02:16.590> but

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
it may be hard to tell on the video but

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.400 
it may be hard to tell on the video but
we're<00:02:17.790> not<00:02:17.940> getting<00:02:18.300> any<00:02:18.510> air<00:02:18.780> coming<00:02:19.080> through

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
we're not getting any air coming through

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.770 
we're not getting any air coming through
the<00:02:19.530> coolant<00:02:19.860> passageways<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.790> I've<00:02:21.420> got<00:02:21.630> it

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
the coolant passageways and I've got it

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.010 
the coolant passageways and I've got it
sealed<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.380> time<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.090> tight<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.390> can't<00:02:24.510> hold<00:02:24.900> it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
sealed for time so tight I can't hold it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.650 
sealed for time so tight I can't hold it
back<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.410> my<00:02:25.590> thumb<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:27.300> then<00:02:27.480> we're

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
back with my thumb so then we're

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.910 
back with my thumb so then we're
wondering<00:02:28.020> well<00:02:28.170> wait<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> minute<00:02:28.650> how<00:02:28.740> could

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
wondering well wait a minute how could

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.100 
wondering well wait a minute how could
that<00:02:29.040> happen<00:02:29.280> we<00:02:30.270> thought<00:02:30.570> we<00:02:30.750> were<00:02:30.900> mixing

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
that happen we thought we were mixing

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.010 
that happen we thought we were mixing
transmission<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.160> coolant<00:02:32.600> then<00:02:33.600> we<00:02:33.810> took<00:02:33.960> a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
transmission with coolant then we took a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.140 
transmission with coolant then we took a
real<00:02:34.290> close<00:02:34.500> look<00:02:34.650> at<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.340> if<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.030> look

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
real close look at it and if you look

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.040 
real close look at it and if you look
right<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:36.570> here<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:38.640> part<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.420> line<00:02:39.720> was

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
right in here this part of this line was

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.340 
right in here this part of this line was
actually<00:02:40.230> sealing<00:02:40.980> inside<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.730> tubing<00:02:42.360> but

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
actually sealing inside the tubing but

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.040 
actually sealing inside the tubing but
it<00:02:43.440> was<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.770> rusted<00:02:44.310> here<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:45.480> were<00:02:45.630> actually

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
it was so rusted here we were actually

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.990 
it was so rusted here we were actually
leaking<00:02:46.440> transmission<00:02:46.680> fluid<00:02:47.160> from<00:02:47.640> here

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
leaking transmission fluid from here

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.320 
leaking transmission fluid from here
into<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:49.380> inner<00:02:49.560> portion<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.400> tank<00:02:50.700> it

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
into the inner portion of the tank it

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.750 
into the inner portion of the tank it
was<00:02:51.600> not<00:02:51.870> leaking<00:02:52.260> transmission<00:02:52.760> externally

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
was not leaking transmission externally

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.810 
was not leaking transmission externally
but<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.750> was<00:02:54.870> leaking<00:02:55.230> into<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.560> tank<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.220> we

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
but it was leaking into the tank and we

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.120 
but it was leaking into the tank and we
proved<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.120> by<00:02:57.540> taking<00:02:58.080> our<00:02:58.230> air<00:02:58.410> gun<00:02:58.680> and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
proved that by taking our air gun and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.190 
proved that by taking our air gun and
putting<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.060> between<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.570> tank<00:03:00.840> which<00:03:01.080> you

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
putting it between the tank which you

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.460 
putting it between the tank which you
can<00:03:01.380> see<00:03:01.590> kind<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:01.980> moving<00:03:02.280> inside<00:03:02.670> there<00:03:02.940> and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
can see kind of moving inside there and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.640 
can see kind of moving inside there and
just<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.650> into<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.250> tank<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:06.290> then<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.470> can

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
just go into the tank and then you can

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:20.449 
just go into the tank and then you can
see<00:03:07.800> our<00:03:07.950> air<00:03:08.160> coming<00:03:08.430> out<00:03:08.640> here<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> our

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
see our air coming out here so our

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.790 
see our air coming out here so our
transmission<00:03:21.150> was<00:03:21.330> mixing<00:03:21.780> right<00:03:22.470> here<00:03:22.740> at

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
transmission was mixing right here at

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.220 
transmission was mixing right here at
the<00:03:22.920> fitting<00:03:23.190> between<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> tank<00:03:24.360> which<00:03:25.200> is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
the fitting between the tank which is

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.710 
the fitting between the tank which is
filled<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.740> coolant<00:03:26.270> not<00:03:27.270> in<00:03:27.540> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
filled with coolant not in the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.770 
filled with coolant not in the
passageways<00:03:28.440> between<00:03:29.040> here<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.370> there<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:30.690> if

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
passageways between here and there so if

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.010 
passageways between here and there so if
you<00:03:30.900> get<00:03:31.110> an<00:03:31.370> mdx<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:33.180> has<00:03:33.390> transmission

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
you get an mdx that has transmission

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.170 
you get an mdx that has transmission
fluid<00:03:34.320> mixing<00:03:34.680> with<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.950> coolant<00:03:35.340> check

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
fluid mixing with the coolant check

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.449 
fluid mixing with the coolant check
these<00:03:36.360> out<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:37.500> could<00:03:37.740> be<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.190> deceiving

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
these out it could be a little deceiving

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.570 
these out it could be a little deceiving
unless<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.090> know<00:03:39.209> what<00:03:39.390> you're<00:03:39.540> looking<00:03:39.660> for

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
unless you know what you're looking for

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.920 
unless you know what you're looking for
as<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:41.940> see<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.240> isn't<00:03:42.480> an<00:03:42.630> easy<00:03:42.750> job

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
as you can see this isn't an easy job

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.960 
as you can see this isn't an easy job
you've<00:03:43.740> got<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.010> take<00:03:44.160> all<00:03:44.340> this<00:03:44.550> off<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
you've got to take all this off the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.430 
you've got to take all this off the
bumper<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.420> skin<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.840> everything<00:03:45.959> in

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
bumper of the skin and everything in

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.620 
bumper of the skin and everything in
order<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.770> get<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.040> radiator<00:03:47.430> out<00:03:47.760> now<00:03:48.570> the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
order to get the radiator out now the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.990 
order to get the radiator out now the
engine<00:03:49.200> was<00:03:49.380> full<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:50.040> slimy<00:03:50.430> stuff<00:03:50.850> as

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
engine was full of that slimy stuff as

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.150 
engine was full of that slimy stuff as
well<00:03:51.240> so<00:03:51.270> we've<00:03:52.140> got<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.470> lower<00:03:52.650> radiator

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
well so we've got the lower radiator

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.640 
well so we've got the lower radiator
hose<00:03:53.310> blocked<00:03:53.880> off<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.810> make<00:03:55.020> you<00:03:55.200> some<00:03:55.410> kind

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
hose blocked off just make you some kind

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.010 
hose blocked off just make you some kind
of<00:03:55.740> combination<00:03:56.070> hook<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:56.640> up<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.020> garden

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
of combination hook it up to a garden

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.840 
of combination hook it up to a garden
hose<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.470> then<00:03:59.070> we're<00:03:59.220> going<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.370> flush<00:03:59.640> the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
hose and then we're going to flush the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.430 
hose and then we're going to flush the
engine<00:04:00.180> by<00:04:00.330> pushing<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.810> back<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
engine by pushing it back to the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.440 
engine by pushing it back to the
thermostat<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.250> flush<00:04:02.790> all<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.150> crud<00:04:03.420> out
