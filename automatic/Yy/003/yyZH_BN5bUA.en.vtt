to<00:00:53.129> remember<00:00:53.370> Jennifer<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.210> said<00:00:54.420> we

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to remember Jennifer like I said we

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.350 
to remember Jennifer like I said we
spend<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.739> percent<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.370> our<00:00:56.579> total<00:00:56.789> budget<00:00:57.059> on

spend one percent of our total budget on
foreign<00:00:57.690> aid<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.530> some<00:00:59.100> folks<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.399> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
foreign aid so some folks think it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.420 
foreign aid so some folks think it's
like<00:00:59.850> 25<00:01:00.180> percent<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.020> mean<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:01.980> small

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
like 25 percent I mean it's a very small

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.240 
like 25 percent I mean it's a very small
portion<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.379> most<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> foreign<00:01:04.979> aid<00:01:05.070> we

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
portion and most of the foreign aid we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.359 
portion and most of the foreign aid we
provide<00:01:05.810> is<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.380> countries<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.250> also

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
provide is to countries that are also

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.520 
provide is to countries that are also
helping<00:01:08.909> us<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.810> our<00:01:09.840> national<00:01:10.380> security

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
helping us with our national security

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.940 
helping us with our national security
and<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:12.049> oftentimes<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.500> we're<00:01:13.650> providing

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and so oftentimes one we're providing

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.850 
and so oftentimes one we're providing
that<00:01:14.220> age<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> country<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.960> may<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.200> saving

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that age for a country we may be saving

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.760 
that age for a country we may be saving
a<00:01:17.670> larger<00:01:18.570> amount<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:19.049> terms<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.650> we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
a larger amount in terms of what we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.730 
a larger amount in terms of what we
would<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.280> deal<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.240> deal<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.409> they

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
would have to deal if deal with if they

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890 
would have to deal if deal with if they
weren't<00:01:22.979> cooperating<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.820> us<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.150> that's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
weren't cooperating with us so that's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.719 
weren't cooperating with us so that's
part<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> reason<00:01:25.470> why<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:26.159> always

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
part of the reason why I always

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.840 
part of the reason why I always
emphasize<00:01:27.390> our<00:01:28.259> defense<00:01:29.189> budget<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.820> our

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
emphasize our defense budget and our

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
emphasize our defense budget and our
foreign<00:01:32.850> aid<00:01:32.939> budget<00:01:33.000> should<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.810> seen<00:01:34.110> as

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
foreign aid budget should be seen as

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.160 
foreign aid budget should be seen as
over<00:01:35.159> an<00:01:35.549> overall<00:01:36.090> package<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.750> overall

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
over an overall package and overall

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.130 
over an overall package and overall
strategy<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.310> keep<00:01:38.490> America<00:01:39.030> safe<00:01:39.240> because

strategy to keep America safe because

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.080 
strategy to keep America safe because
what<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:40.740> don't<00:01:40.920> want<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
what we don't want to do is have a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.819 
what we don't want to do is have a
situation<00:01:42.420> where<00:01:42.810> certain<00:01:43.350> countries
