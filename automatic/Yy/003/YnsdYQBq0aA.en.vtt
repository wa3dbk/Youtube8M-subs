00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.580
 i 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.349
 in this chapter and the costumes' tips for 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.580
 learn to draw to patricio since 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.619
 I find that he is one of the characters 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.840
 silly and more sponge pink so 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.550
 let's go good in this case I'll start 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.470
 for the face of patrician because for me 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.869
 is when there are characters that are like 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.220
 more geometric so it becomes more 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.289
 easy to start on the face for later 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.250
 know where the body is going so we're going to 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.250
 make your eyes 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.980
 one on top of the other since in this case 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.980
 we have it in profile 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.300
 his pupils and his eyebrows are like two 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.690
 zetas but inverted 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.910
 let's make your mouth 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.180
 which is how I say it as a quarter of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.180
 Moon 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.070
 and in we tend to do the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.960
 request body price below 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.160
 because I find it easier to get in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.910
 your stomach and then be able to do your 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.310
 head so we're going to do it 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.390
 more or less like that 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.150
 to his eye 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.320
 Y 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.320
 and after here 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.950
 until now 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.069
 I leave it here to be able to later 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.770
 make your arm without getting in the way 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:21.320
 as the solid line we will 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.200
 do from here to teach 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.870
 and there we leave the space to be able 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.930
 do his arm the same thing I said here 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.510
 down to be able to make her pants and 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.270
 here we do the other side 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.770
 this side we're going to examine your 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.200
 little arm stretched and under his pants 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.079
 his feet 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 in the middle of your stomach we are going to do 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:52.820
 the swimsuit well 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.810
 with another strip and here your flowers are 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.840
 Hawaiian 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.600
 there in the middle of your stomach are alive 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.299
 and those little dots that he has as well as 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.299
 of little star and ready 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.879

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.680
