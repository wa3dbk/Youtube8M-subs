00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:08.780 

what's<00:00:07.349> important<00:00:07.890> about<00:00:07.920> methane<00:00:08.430> is<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
what's important about methane is that a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.029 
what's important about methane is that a
very<00:00:09.090> it's<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.570> very<00:00:09.600> powerful<00:00:09.990> greenhouse<00:00:10.559> gas

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.039 
very it's a very powerful greenhouse gas

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.480 
very it's a very powerful greenhouse gas
so<00:00:11.940> if<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.180> look<00:00:12.299> at<00:00:12.510> the<00:00:12.570> 100<00:00:13.559> years<00:00:13.949> time

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
so if you look at the 100 years time

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.070 
so if you look at the 100 years time
scale<00:00:14.820> methane<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.840> about<00:00:16.410> 25<00:00:17.160> folds<00:00:18.080> more

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
scale methane is about 25 folds more

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.740 
scale methane is about 25 folds more
powerful<00:00:19.619> than<00:00:19.859> carbon<00:00:20.250> dioxide<00:00:20.450> if<00:00:21.450> you<00:00:21.630> look

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
powerful than carbon dioxide if you look

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.250 
powerful than carbon dioxide if you look
at<00:00:21.900> at<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.440> 20<00:00:23.010> years<00:00:23.250> time<00:00:23.460> scale<00:00:23.900> methane<00:00:24.900> can

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
at at a 20 years time scale methane can

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.250 
at at a 20 years time scale methane can
be<00:00:25.380> 100<00:00:26.010> times<00:00:26.220> more<00:00:26.369> powerful<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> that's<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
be 100 times more powerful so that's a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.540 
be 100 times more powerful so that's a
powerful<00:00:28.470> greenhouse<00:00:28.800> gas<00:00:29.160> you've<00:00:29.340> got<00:00:29.460> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
powerful greenhouse gas you've got to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.049 
powerful greenhouse gas you've got to
look<00:00:29.670> at<00:00:29.850> that<00:00:31.399> where<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.850> stuff

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
look at that where is all of that stuff

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
trying out for research we just thought

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.150 
trying out for research we just thought
you<00:02:10.420> could<00:02:10.540> move<00:02:10.750> inland<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.470> little<00:02:11.710> bit<00:02:11.860> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
you could move inland a little bit and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.520 
you could move inland a little bit and
start<00:02:12.730> working<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:13.540> creeks<00:02:13.840> rivers<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
start working in creeks rivers in the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.180 
start working in creeks rivers in the
atmosphere<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:16.000> what<00:02:16.630> makes<00:02:16.870> this

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
atmosphere so what makes this

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.530 
atmosphere so what makes this
instrumentation<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.490> special<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.270> over

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
instrumentation so special it's over

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.680 
instrumentation so special it's over
there<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.590> portable<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:22.480> can

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
there is that this is portable we can

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.290 
there is that this is portable we can
just<00:02:22.840> put<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.110> machine<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.800> car<00:02:24.070> or<00:02:24.730> on<00:02:25.210> a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
just put that machine in a car or on a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.410 
just put that machine in a car or on a
small<00:02:25.570> boat<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.110> go<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> drive<00:02:27.070> and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
small boat and go for a drive and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.530 
small boat and go for a drive and
they're<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.660> get<00:02:28.780> high<00:02:29.050> precision

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
they're going to get high precision

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.590 
they're going to get high precision
high-resolution<00:02:31.540> observations<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.700> we're

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
high-resolution observations so we're

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.200 
high-resolution observations so we're
able<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.020> take<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> raging<00:02:35.740> every<00:02:36.250> second<00:02:36.760> while

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
able to take a raging every second while

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.810 
able to take a raging every second while
driving<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.720> car<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:39.010> much<00:02:39.250> easier<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.610> do

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
driving a car it's much easier to do

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.720 
driving a car it's much easier to do
that<00:02:39.850> than<00:02:40.030> go<00:02:40.690> out<00:02:40.810> there<00:02:41.230> see<00:02:41.980> what<00:02:42.160> bottles

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
that than go out there see what bottles

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.690 
that than go out there see what bottles
fill<00:02:43.420> up<00:02:43.600> air<00:02:43.870> bags<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.500> bring<00:02:45.070> those<00:02:45.280> bags

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
fill up air bags and bring those bags

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.970 
fill up air bags and bring those bags
back<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.450> lab<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.930> spending<00:02:47.830> days

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
back to the lab and spending days

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.620 
back to the lab and spending days
running<00:02:48.430> them<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:48.940> we're<00:02:49.150> much<00:02:49.600> more

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
running them so we're much more

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
running them so we're much more
effectively<00:02:50.320> today<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:52.750> can<00:02:52.930> go<00:02:53.440> around

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
effectively today so we can go around

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.180 
effectively today so we can go around
and<00:02:53.920> measure<00:02:54.959> individual<00:02:55.959> wellheads<00:02:56.500> we<00:02:57.010> can

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and measure individual wellheads we can

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.280 
and measure individual wellheads we can
measure<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:58.080> concentrations<00:02:59.080> long

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
measure the concentrations long

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.360 
measure the concentrations long
pipelines<00:03:00.900> what<00:03:01.900> if<00:03:01.989> we've<00:03:02.170> got<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.709> series<00:03:03.340> of

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
happening across the landscape we won't

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.420 
happening across the landscape we won't
pick<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.680> up<00:03:11.709> with<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.160> conventional

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
pick that up with the conventional

pick that up with the conventional
measurement<00:03:13.120> techniques<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.950> won't<00:03:15.160> see<00:03:15.430> that

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
measurement techniques we won't see that

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.000 
measurement techniques we won't see that
happening<00:03:16.080> if<00:03:17.080> it's<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:17.440> land<00:03:17.620> we're<00:03:17.920> not

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
happening if it's on land we're not

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.620 
happening if it's on land we're not
going<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.340> see<00:03:18.459> that<00:03:18.610> gasps<00:03:18.820> come<00:03:19.090> out<00:03:19.300> it

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
going to see that gasps come out it

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.500 
going to see that gasps come out it
doesn't<00:03:20.080> smell<00:03:20.260> there's<00:03:20.950> no<00:03:21.510> nothing

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
doesn't smell there's no nothing

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.430 
doesn't smell there's no nothing
distinct<00:03:23.050> about<00:03:23.320> it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.770 

so<00:03:29.440> now<00:03:30.130> I'm<00:03:30.250> going<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.490> present<00:03:30.640> some<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.600> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
so now I'm going to present some of the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.559 
so now I'm going to present some of the
data<00:03:31.990> that<00:03:32.380> we<00:03:32.680> found<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:34.360> our

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
data that we found so our

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.290 
data that we found so our
instrumentation<00:03:35.319> has<00:03:35.680> really<00:03:36.069> given<00:03:36.850> us<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
instrumentation has really given us the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.080 
instrumentation has really given us the
ability<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:38.800> have<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.340> look<00:03:39.520> at<00:03:39.610> this<00:03:39.730> from<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
ability to have a look at this from a

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.940 
ability to have a look at this from a
different<00:03:40.120> perspective<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:44.410> is<00:03:44.590> the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
different perspective so this is the

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.780 
different perspective so this is the
first<00:03:45.250> large-scale<00:03:47.310> methane<00:03:48.310> mapping

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
first large-scale methane mapping

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.330 
first large-scale methane mapping
exercise<00:03:49.590> carried<00:03:50.590> out<00:03:50.739> specifically

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
exercise carried out specifically

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.250 
exercise carried out specifically
looking<00:03:51.700> at<00:03:51.790> coal<00:03:52.030> seam<00:03:52.270> gas<00:03:52.300> production<00:03:52.930> in

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
looking at coal seam gas production in

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.370 
looking at coal seam gas production in
Australia<00:03:53.910> so<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.090> fact<00:03:55.330> that<00:03:55.450> we<00:03:56.080> have<00:03:56.200> down

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
Australia so the fact that we have down

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.820 
Australia so the fact that we have down
the<00:03:56.560> instrument<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:59.290> particular<00:03:59.530> coin

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
the instrument of the particular coin

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.250 
the instrument of the particular coin
we've<00:04:00.040> got<00:04:00.250> its<00:04:00.430> kind<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.760> helped<00:04:01.000> us<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.810> to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
we've got its kind of helped us and to

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.729 
we've got its kind of helped us and to
take<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.650> research<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:05.290> I'll<00:04:05.380> start<00:04:05.620> off

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
take this research so I'll start off

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.479 
take this research so I'll start off
with<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:07.060> local<00:04:07.570> data<00:04:08.500> so<00:04:08.860> that<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:09.220> red

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
with the the local data so that that red

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.330 
with the the local data so that that red
line<00:04:09.730> is<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.000> track<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.720> our<00:04:10.989> survey<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:12.310> we

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
line is the track of our survey so we

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.890 
line is the track of our survey so we
covered<00:04:12.850> hundreds<00:04:13.209> of<00:04:13.300> kilometers

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
covered hundreds of kilometers

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.000 
covered hundreds of kilometers
continuously<00:04:14.890> measuring<00:04:15.459> methane<00:04:16.410> co2<00:04:17.410> and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
continuously measuring methane co2 and

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.690 
continuously measuring methane co2 and
the<00:04:18.970> stable<00:04:19.450> isotope<00:04:19.989> ratio<00:04:20.950> values<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:21.519> those

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
the stable isotope ratio values of those

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.060 
the stable isotope ratio values of those
so<00:04:22.419> Isaac<00:04:22.870> spoke<00:04:23.169> earlier<00:04:23.500> about<00:04:23.800> the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
so Isaac spoke earlier about the

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.350 
so Isaac spoke earlier about the
chemical<00:04:24.669> fingerprint<00:04:25.330> of<00:04:26.639> methane<00:04:27.639> so

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
chemical fingerprint of methane so

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.960 
chemical fingerprint of methane so
that's<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.870> stable<00:04:29.350> isotope<00:04:29.680> ratio<00:04:32.070> so<00:04:33.070> the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
that's the stable isotope ratio so the

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.110 
that's the stable isotope ratio so the
local<00:04:34.180> map<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.410> here<00:04:35.890> and<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.850> can<00:04:36.940> see

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
local map is here and you can see

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.710 
local map is here and you can see
there's<00:04:37.330> ups<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.690> downs<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:40.360> natural

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
there's ups and downs the natural

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.670 
there's ups and downs the natural
environment<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:41.500> variable<00:04:41.979> we<00:04:42.370> all<00:04:42.520> know<00:04:42.669> that

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
environment is variable we all know that

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.010 
environment is variable we all know that
so<00:04:44.680> what's<00:04:45.220> interesting<00:04:45.580> here<00:04:46.150> is<00:04:46.300> there's

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
so what's interesting here is there's

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.990 
so what's interesting here is there's
obviously<00:04:47.440> other<00:04:47.710> potential<00:04:48.370> sources<00:04:48.820> of

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
obviously other potential sources of

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.800 
obviously other potential sources of
methane<00:04:51.510> so<00:04:52.530> we<00:04:53.530> drove<00:04:53.740> through<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:55.180> large

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
methane so we drove through a large

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.440 
methane so we drove through a large
wetland<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.470> tuck-in<00:04:56.680> wetland<00:04:57.450> highest

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
wetland the tuck-in wetland highest

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
cows up to 1.88 so this instrument is

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.600 
cows up to 1.88 so this instrument is
extremely<00:05:29.320> sensitive<00:05:29.770> we<00:05:30.039> can<00:05:30.220> pick<00:05:30.430> up

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
extremely sensitive we can pick up

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.090 
extremely sensitive we can pick up
individual<00:05:31.510> cows<00:05:32.350> we<00:05:32.710> can<00:05:32.860> pick<00:05:33.010> up

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
individual cows we can pick up

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.279 
individual cows we can pick up
individual<00:05:33.669> cars<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.150> so<00:05:34.300> on<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:35.710> i<00:05:36.039> guess<00:05:37.289> the

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
individual cars and so on so i guess the

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.320 
individual cars and so on so i guess the
take-home<00:05:38.560> number<00:05:39.070> from<00:05:39.250> here<00:05:39.900> methane<00:05:40.900> did

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
take-home number from here methane did

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.749 
take-home number from here methane did
not<00:05:41.419> get<00:05:41.720> above<00:05:41.930> 2.1<00:05:42.590> parts<00:05:43.220> per<00:05:43.460> million<00:05:45.759> so

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
not get above 2.1 parts per million so

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.570 
not get above 2.1 parts per million so
on<00:05:47.090> to<00:05:47.330> our<00:05:47.479> coal<00:05:48.169> seam<00:05:48.379> gas<00:05:48.409> production<00:05:49.069> area

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
on to our coal seam gas production area

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.029 
on to our coal seam gas production area
in<00:05:49.849> the<00:05:50.780> the<00:05:51.110> terra<00:05:51.379> area<00:05:53.620> we<00:05:54.620> said<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:54.889> same

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
in the the terra area we said the same

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.469 
in the the terra area we said the same
thing<00:05:55.310> we<00:05:55.430> see<00:05:55.610> ups<00:05:55.819> and<00:05:56.000> downs<00:05:56.860> however<00:05:58.479> the

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
thing we see ups and downs however the

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.119 
thing we see ups and downs however the
concentration<00:06:00.289> of<00:06:00.439> methane<00:06:00.949> in<00:06:01.099> the

concentration of methane in the

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.390 
concentration of methane in the
atmosphere<00:06:01.250> is<00:06:01.849> consistently<00:06:02.840> higher<00:06:03.500> than

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
atmosphere is consistently higher than

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.369 
atmosphere is consistently higher than
what<00:06:04.639> we<00:06:04.729> saw<00:06:04.939> the<00:06:05.000> highest<00:06:05.509> value<00:06:05.900> in<00:06:06.139> the

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:06.379 
what we saw the highest value in the

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.170 
what we saw the highest value in the
local<00:06:06.710> area<00:06:07.629> the<00:06:08.629> highest<00:06:08.919> concentrations

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
local area the highest concentrations

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.179 
local area the highest concentrations
over<00:06:11.180> three<00:06:11.870> times<00:06:12.169> the<00:06:12.710> atmosphere

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:13.189 
over three times the atmosphere

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:18.999 
over three times the atmosphere
background<00:06:13.789> values<00:06:17.469> so<00:06:18.469> if<00:06:18.560> you<00:06:18.650> have<00:06:18.770> a<00:06:18.800> look

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
background values so if you have a look

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.779 
background values so if you have a look
at<00:06:19.129> the<00:06:19.219> same<00:06:19.460> data<00:06:19.990> so<00:06:20.990> we<00:06:21.440> drove<00:06:21.919> through<00:06:21.979> the

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
at the same data so we drove through the

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.999 
at the same data so we drove through the
field<00:06:23.090> then<00:06:23.659> we<00:06:23.810> drove<00:06:24.050> all<00:06:24.440> the<00:06:24.680> way<00:06:24.710> home

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
field then we drove all the way home

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:29.140 
field then we drove all the way home
with<00:06:25.250> the<00:06:25.370> instruments<00:06:25.789> still<00:06:26.000> on<00:06:27.129> so<00:06:28.129> we<00:06:29.000> can

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
with the instruments still on so we can

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.909 
with the instruments still on so we can
see<00:06:29.389> that<00:06:29.719> there's<00:06:30.349> a<00:06:30.469> distinct<00:06:30.860> difference

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
see that there's a distinct difference

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.159 
see that there's a distinct difference
between<00:06:31.849> what's<00:06:32.300> happening<00:06:32.659> in<00:06:32.779> the<00:06:32.900> field

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
between what's happening in the field

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.129 
between what's happening in the field
and<00:06:33.379> what's<00:06:33.590> happening<00:06:33.949> outside
