I want to give you an update on bounds

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.600 
I want to give you an update on bounds
development<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.679> first<00:00:13.980> i<00:00:14.160> want<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.370> show<00:00:14.580> you

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
development but first i want to show you

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.170 
development but first i want to show you
how<00:00:15.599> bounden<00:00:16.379> works<00:00:16.650> exactly<00:00:19.820> this<00:00:20.820> lemon

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
how bounden works exactly this lemon

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.509 
how bounden works exactly this lemon
represents<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> world<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.680> world<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.130> fixed

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
represents the world the world is fixed

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.210 
represents the world the world is fixed
in<00:00:23.670> space<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.300> top<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.439> lemon<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
in space on top of this lemon of the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.089 
in space on top of this lemon of the
world<00:00:26.430> are<00:00:26.730> markers<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.930> as<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.070> see

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
world are markers and as you can see

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.389 
world are markers and as you can see
they're<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.580> placed<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.630> top<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.800> world

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
they're all placed on top of this world

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.360 
they're all placed on top of this world
so<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:34.050> fixed<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.410> space<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.219> going

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
so as it's fixed in space I'm just going

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
so as it's fixed in space I'm just going
to<00:00:35.430> position<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.300> space<00:00:37.940> right<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.620> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
to position it in space right there so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.700 
to position it in space right there so
beside<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.520> there's<00:00:41.820> also<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.899> camera<00:00:43.320> in

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
beside that there's also the camera in

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.160 
beside that there's also the camera in
this<00:00:43.829> case<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.340> iPhone<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.570> top<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
this case my iPhone and on top of the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.920 
this case my iPhone and on top of the
camera<00:00:46.530> also<00:00:47.190> fixed<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> center<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
camera also fixed in the center of the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.100 
camera also fixed in the center of the
screen<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.680> crosshair<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
screen is the crosshair like that and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.830 
screen is the crosshair like that and
the<00:00:52.110> thing<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:53.059> when<00:00:54.059> playing<00:00:54.270> bounden

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the thing is that when playing bounden

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.880 
the thing is that when playing bounden
you<00:00:55.379> try<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.160> align<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:58.020> crosshair<00:00:58.559> which<00:00:58.800> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
you try to align the crosshair which I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.979 
you try to align the crosshair which I
just<00:00:59.129> fixed<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.850> my<00:00:59.969> camera<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.570> top<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.559> these

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
just fixed on my camera on top of these

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.410 
just fixed on my camera on top of these
markers<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:05.040> try<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.869> rotate<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.520> phone<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
markers you try to rotate the phone so

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.749 
markers you try to rotate the phone so
that<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.680> top<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.100> match<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.850> one

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.030 

so<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.360> how<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.600> technically<00:01:19.200> play

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
so this is how you technically play

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.760 
so this is how you technically play
bounden<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.600> instead<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> lemon<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.530> have

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
bounden but instead of a lemon I have

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
bounden but instead of a lemon I have
natural<00:01:23.130> world<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.610> my<00:01:23.729> phone<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.570> take<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
natural world on my phone we take a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.110 
natural world on my phone we take a
rotate<00:01:25.320> around

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.450 

so<00:01:33.120> I've<00:01:33.810> been<00:01:34.050> doing<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.320> by<00:01:34.530> myself<00:01:34.560> but

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
so I've been doing this by myself but

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.400 
so I've been doing this by myself but
bounding<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.090> two-player<00:01:36.480> game<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.260> when

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
bounding is a two-player game so when

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.170 
bounding is a two-player game so when
two<00:01:37.620> people<00:01:37.950> hold<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.730> phone<00:01:38.910> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
two people hold on to the phone and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.420 
two people hold on to the phone and
rotate<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:39.720> together<00:01:40.200> trying<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.010> follow<00:01:41.190> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
rotate it together trying to follow the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.150 
rotate it together trying to follow the
markers<00:01:41.910> they<00:01:42.630> will<00:01:42.780> actually<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.440> led<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:44.010> a

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
markers they will actually be led into a

00:01:44.160 --> 00:02:05.950 
markers they will actually be led into a
choreography

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.330 

so<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> past<00:02:07.350> month<00:02:07.649> we've<00:02:07.799> been<00:02:08.190> working

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
so for the past month we've been working

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.540 
so for the past month we've been working
on<00:02:08.640> adding<00:02:08.940> new<00:02:09.569> worlds<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> bounden<00:02:10.830> we've

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
on adding new worlds to bounden we've

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.790 
on adding new worlds to bounden we've
added<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.030> peek<00:02:12.360> we've<00:02:12.690> added<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:13.110> estic<00:02:13.590> world

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
added a peek we've added a estic world

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.610 
added a peek we've added a estic world
and<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.310> couple<00:02:14.489> more<00:02:14.700> abstract<00:02:15.209> worlds<00:02:15.620> we've

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and a couple more abstract worlds we've

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.490 
and a couple more abstract worlds we've
also<00:02:16.890> made<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.250> dance<00:02:17.610> editor<00:02:18.120> which<00:02:18.840> allows<00:02:19.230> us

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
also made a dance editor which allows us

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.720 
also made a dance editor which allows us
to<00:02:19.940> make<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.180> dances<00:02:21.630> on<00:02:21.810> our<00:02:22.080> phones<00:02:22.380> and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
to make the dances on our phones and

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.170 
to make the dances on our phones and
we've<00:02:23.730> added<00:02:24.090> or<00:02:24.780> basically<00:02:25.769> iterated<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.519> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
we've added or basically iterated on the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.180 
we've added or basically iterated on the
markers<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.900> much<00:02:28.140> more<00:02:28.170> responsive<00:02:28.709> and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
markers to be much more responsive and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.430 
markers to be much more responsive and
also<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.330> feels<00:02:30.569> satisfying<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
also that it feels satisfying to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.930 
also that it feels satisfying to
actually<00:02:32.660> grab<00:02:33.660> them<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:35.280> that's<00:02:35.700> what<00:02:35.819> we've

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
actually grab them so that's what we've

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.850 
actually grab them so that's what we've
been<00:02:36.090> working<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.810> next<00:02:37.440> month<00:02:37.620> we'll

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
been working on and next month we'll

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.800 
been working on and next month we'll
probably<00:02:38.160> be<00:02:38.400> working<00:02:38.549> out<00:02:38.819> much<00:02:39.060> more<00:02:39.090> music

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
probably be working out much more music

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.400 
probably be working out much more music
and<00:02:39.989> gain<00:02:40.410> feel<00:02:40.799> will<00:02:41.489> also<00:02:41.790> try<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.200> put<00:02:43.200> some

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
and gain feel will also try to put some

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.400 
and gain feel will also try to put some
more<00:02:43.530> dances<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.160> their<00:02:44.959> work<00:02:45.959> together<00:02:46.140> with

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
more dances in their work together with

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.860 
more dances in their work together with
national<00:02:46.890> ballet<00:02:47.459> choreographer<00:02:48.120> Aaron's

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
national ballet choreographer Aaron's

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.030 
national ballet choreographer Aaron's
Meisner<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:50.239> probably<00:02:51.410> kind<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.560> make<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
Meisner and probably kind of make the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.490 
Meisner and probably kind of make the
first<00:02:53.310> version<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.940> most<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.660> dances<00:02:55.140> so

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
first version of most of the dances so
