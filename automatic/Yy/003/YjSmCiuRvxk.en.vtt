it's gonna be like this probably in the
middle<00:00:42.610> of<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.760> floor<00:00:42.910> but<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.430> heel<00:00:45.430> is

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
middle of the floor but the heel is

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.070 
middle of the floor but the heel is
going<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.790> be<00:00:45.850> further<00:00:46.090> over<00:00:46.420> that's<00:00:46.690> how<00:00:46.870> it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
going to be further over that's how it's

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
going to be on here not like this like

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.110 
going to be on here not like this like
this<00:00:49.500> unless<00:00:50.500> stuff<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.580> this<00:00:51.700> trick<00:00:51.910> might

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
this unless stuff and this trick might

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.430 
this unless stuff and this trick might
be<00:00:52.239> a<00:00:52.270> bit<00:00:52.450> harder<00:00:52.750> if<00:00:52.809> you<00:00:52.840> don't<00:00:53.050> have<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.200> nose

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
be a bit harder if you don't have a nose

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.470 
be a bit harder if you don't have a nose
or<00:00:53.710> tail<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.550> first<00:00:58.120> thing<00:00:58.210> you're<00:00:58.329> going<00:00:58.420> to

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
or tail so first thing you're going to

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.660 
or tail so first thing you're going to
want<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.660> practice<00:00:59.079> this<00:00:59.280> spinning<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.430> board

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
want to practice this spinning the board

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.700 
want to practice this spinning the board
not<00:01:01.300> landing<00:01:01.930> on<00:01:02.020> it<00:01:02.140> just<00:01:02.290> getting<00:01:02.560> the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
not landing on it just getting the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.540 
not landing on it just getting the
rotation<00:01:03.250> so<00:01:04.410> this<00:01:05.410> part<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:05.770> going<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:06.009> be<00:01:06.070> one

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
rotation so this part is going to be one

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.520 
rotation so this part is going to be one
of<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.670> hardest<00:01:06.850> parts<00:01:07.270> it's<00:01:07.540> just<00:01:07.840> you're

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
of the hardest parts it's just you're

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
going to bring the nose up and with your

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.340 
going to bring the nose up and with your
heel<00:01:11.290> you're<00:01:11.470> going<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.649> push<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.520> across<00:01:13.350> spin

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
heel you're going to push it across spin

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.950 
heel you're going to push it across spin
it<00:01:14.470> around<00:01:14.700> then<00:01:15.700> once<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.509> start<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.750> get<00:01:16.899> the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
it around then once you start to get the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.550 
it around then once you start to get the
spinning<00:01:17.410> motion<00:01:17.619> good<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:19.270> getting<00:01:19.720> like

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
spinning motion good like getting like

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.030 
spinning motion good like getting like
