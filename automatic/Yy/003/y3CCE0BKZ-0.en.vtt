00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
game play and it's actually on hard

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.740 
game play and it's actually on hard
score<00:01:52.189> kill<00:01:53.189> confirmed<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.450> here

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
score kill confirmed as you can see here

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.340 
score kill confirmed as you can see here
there's<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.920> no<00:01:56.579> mini<00:01:57.180> map<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.810> course

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
there's like no mini map of course

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.139 
there's like no mini map of course
there's<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.740> mini<00:01:58.950> map<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.310> now<00:01:59.460> because<00:01:59.880> in

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
there's a mini map right now because in

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.660 
there's a mini map right now because in
orbital<00:02:00.540> vsat<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.170> overall<00:02:02.100> there's<00:02:02.340> no<00:02:02.460> mini

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
orbital vsat but overall there's no mini

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
orbital vsat but overall there's no mini
map<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:04.850> yeah<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.270> personally<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.500> that

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
map and yeah I personally think that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.510 
map and yeah I personally think that
hard<00:02:09.690> score<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.259> more<00:02:11.190> difficult<00:02:11.370> than

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
hard score is more difficult than

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.760 
hard score is more difficult than
you<00:02:12.910> know<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.330> normal<00:02:13.740> Kill<00:02:14.740> Confirmed

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
you know just normal Kill Confirmed

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.210 
you know just normal Kill Confirmed
because<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.490> if<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.900> make<00:02:16.930> some<00:02:17.710> stupid

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
because you if you make some stupid

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.880 
because you if you make some stupid
mistakes<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:19.120> can<00:02:19.330> die<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.290> quickly<00:02:20.680> of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
mistakes you can die so quickly of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.800 
mistakes you can die so quickly of
course<00:02:20.920> it's<00:02:21.250> easier<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.850> kill<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.240> enemy<00:02:22.630> but

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
course it's easier to kill the enemy but

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.430 
course it's easier to kill the enemy but
also<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.500> lot<00:02:24.100> easier<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.610> die<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.810> will<00:02:26.200> die<00:02:26.260> a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
also a lot easier to die you will die a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.230 
also a lot easier to die you will die a
lot<00:02:26.770> faster<00:02:27.340> in<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.870> hardcore<00:02:29.320> Kill<00:02:29.560> Confirmed

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
lot faster in in hardcore Kill Confirmed

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.150 
lot faster in in hardcore Kill Confirmed
so<00:02:31.240> let's<00:02:31.600> have<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.840> look<00:02:31.960> at<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.380> class<00:02:32.740> setup

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
so let's have a look at this class setup

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.310 
so let's have a look at this class setup
right<00:02:33.340> here<00:02:33.400> he's<00:02:34.090> using<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.660> peacekeeper<00:02:35.170> SMG

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
right here he's using a peacekeeper SMG

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.360 
right here he's using a peacekeeper SMG
of<00:02:35.830> course<00:02:36.480> with<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.780> quick-draw<00:02:38.380> attachment

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
of course with the quick-draw attachment

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.240 
of course with the quick-draw attachment
and<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:40.210> fast<00:02:40.630> mag<00:02:40.990> in<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.320> quick<00:02:41.530> draw<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.920> allows

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
and a fast mag in a quick draw it allows

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.570 
and a fast mag in a quick draw it allows
him<00:02:42.490> to<00:02:42.520> zoom<00:02:42.940> in<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.720> faster<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:44.560> faster<00:02:45.010> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
him to zoom in the faster and faster to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.820 
him to zoom in the faster and faster to
reload<00:02:45.850> faster<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.330> course<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.900> think

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
reload faster of course I think

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.800 
reload faster of course I think
personally<00:02:48.340> fast<00:02:48.730> Mac<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.240> little<00:02:49.630> better

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
personally fast Mac is a little better

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.420 
personally fast Mac is a little better
than<00:02:49.990> extended<00:02:50.590> mags<00:02:50.860> because<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.190> course

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
than extended mags because of course

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.410 
than extended mags because of course
extended<00:02:51.910> mags<00:02:52.150> give<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.660> ten<00:02:53.200> extra<00:02:53.620> bullets

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
extended mags give you ten extra bullets

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.690 
extended mags give you ten extra bullets
on<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.480> Peacekeeper<00:02:56.470> but<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.100> fast<00:02:57.400> Mac

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
on the Peacekeeper but the fast Mac

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.870 
on the Peacekeeper but the fast Mac
overall<00:02:58.180> lets<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.540> reload<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.170> lot<00:02:59.800> faster<00:03:00.430> so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
overall lets you reload a lot faster so

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.000 
overall lets you reload a lot faster so
I<00:03:00.910> would<00:03:01.120> recommend<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.780> using<00:03:02.170> fast<00:03:02.710> Mac

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
I would recommend you using fast Mac

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.070 
I would recommend you using fast Mac
like<00:03:03.400> like<00:03:04.300> wraps<00:03:04.540> her<00:03:04.720> did<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.170> as<00:03:05.950> his<00:03:07.080> first

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080
