headphones<00:00:20.539> I'll<00:00:21.539> start<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
headphones I'll start with the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.269 
headphones I'll start with the
headphones<00:00:22.289> actually<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
headphones actually because it's the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.880 
headphones actually because it's the
easiest<00:00:23.550> part<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.970> review<00:00:24.350> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.380> for

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
easiest part to that review you can for

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.800 
easiest part to that review you can for
some<00:00:26.039> reason<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.609> don't<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:26.970> why<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.630> does

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
some reason I don't really why it does

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.769 
some reason I don't really why it does
this<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.769> headphone<00:00:29.310> cord<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.760> pretty<00:00:30.539> short

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
this the headphone cord is pretty short

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.729 
this the headphone cord is pretty short
which<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.260> fine<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:32.030> the<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.500> headphone<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
which is fine but the one headphone is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.940 
which is fine but the one headphone is
much<00:00:35.460> shorter<00:00:35.730> than<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.450> other<00:00:36.600> which<00:00:37.290> maybe

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
much shorter than the other which maybe

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.229 
much shorter than the other which maybe
somebody<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.430> leave<00:00:38.550> me<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> comment<00:00:38.879> tell<00:00:39.210> me

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
somebody can leave me a comment tell me

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.880 
somebody can leave me a comment tell me
why<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.960> cuz<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.590> don't<00:00:40.739> know

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
why they do that cuz I really don't know

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.700 
why they do that cuz I really don't know
and<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.700> adjustable<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:43.350> terms<00:00:43.410> of

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and it's not adjustable in terms of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.639 
and it's not adjustable in terms of
sound<00:00:43.950> these<00:00:44.460> headphones<00:00:44.700> are<00:00:45.120> mediocre<00:00:46.020> at

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
sound these headphones are mediocre at

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.010 
sound these headphones are mediocre at
best<00:00:47.180> maybe<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> break<00:00:48.600> them<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.870> they'll

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
best maybe if you break them in they'll

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.110 
best maybe if you break them in they'll
get<00:00:49.200> slightly<00:00:49.379> better<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.640> there

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
get slightly better but as is there

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.750 
get slightly better but as is there
they're<00:00:52.110> quite<00:00:52.410> quite<00:00:52.770> poor<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:54.059> very<00:00:54.539> uh

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
they're quite quite poor so not very uh

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.459 
they're quite quite poor so not very uh
not<00:00:56.760> tinny<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.329> bassy<00:00:57.600> they're<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.230> real

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
not tinny not bassy they're just real

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.439 
not tinny not bassy they're just real
bland<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.070> sound<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> lot<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.149> lot<00:01:00.390> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
bland and sound not a lot of a lot of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.180 
bland and sound not a lot of a lot of
precursor<00:01:00.989> these<00:01:01.109> fans<00:01:01.320> across<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> board<00:01:01.949> so

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
precursor these fans across the board so

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.950 
precursor these fans across the board so
not<00:01:02.730> crisp<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.300> guess<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> best<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
not crisp I guess to be the best way to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600 
not crisp I guess to be the best way to
put<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> headphone<00:01:04.830> standpoint

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
put it so from a headphone standpoint

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.090 
put it so from a headphone standpoint
pretty<00:01:06.299> poor<00:01:06.470> I'll<00:01:07.470> tell<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:07.920> thing

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
pretty poor I'll tell you the one thing

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
pretty poor I'll tell you the one thing
I<00:01:08.189> really<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:08.580> care<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
I really don't care for and that is the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.200 
I really don't care for and that is the
way<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.260> clips<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.060> actually

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
way it clips in right here it's actually

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.490 
way it clips in right here it's actually
kind<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.600> tough<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> clip<00:01:13.409> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
kind of tough to get it to clip to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.859 
kind of tough to get it to clip to
anything<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.790> kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> kind<00:01:15.720> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
anything so that's kind of kind of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.620 
anything so that's kind of kind of
annoying<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> big<00:01:17.369> deal

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
annoying but it's not a big deal

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.249 
annoying but it's not a big deal
other<00:01:19.170> things<00:01:20.030> possible<00:01:21.030> connects<00:01:21.960> very

headphones it works great next in terms
of<00:01:43.530> range<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.280> seems<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.640> good<00:01:45.030> range<00:01:45.180> but

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
of range it seems to have good range but

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.270 
of range it seems to have good range but
the<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.079> thing<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.680> about<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.009> is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the one thing I do like about it is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.389 
the one thing I do like about it is
right<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:49.560> headphones<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.040> come<00:01:50.280> with

the jack are or with the Bluetooth are
quite<00:01:53.310> poor<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:54.950> using<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.070> Jack<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.939> can

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
quite poor but using that Jack you can

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.230 
make those Bluetooth capable using this
unit<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.710> maybe<00:02:05.430> that's<00:02:05.640> not<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.939> uncommon

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
unit so maybe that's not that uncommon

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.550 
unit so maybe that's not that uncommon
