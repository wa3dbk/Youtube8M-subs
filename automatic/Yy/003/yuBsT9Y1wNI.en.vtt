00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
a closer look at this so you see the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.499 
a closer look at this so you see the
ghost<00:01:45.840> logo<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:47.000> it's<00:01:48.000> made<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.479> of

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.359 
ghost logo right there it's made out of
really<00:01:49.170> good<00:01:49.290> material<00:01:49.770> actually<00:01:49.920> that'll

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
really good material actually that'll

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.450 
really good material actually that'll
hold<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:51.229> against<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.409> good<00:01:52.799> amount<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.159> things
