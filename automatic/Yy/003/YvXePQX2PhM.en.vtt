00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.819

 it is certainly a correct daily dietary regime and one who supports it 

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:33.820
 completely at nutritional points of view 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.609

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.850
 accentuated

 face the most substantial nutritional needs as to bear a 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.230
 continuous workload during the week 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.400
 for these people you can think then habbo enrich the two snacks 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.270
 in the morning and afternoon so that nutrient sources are a little bit 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.530

 therefore food that does not waste a complete management 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.310
 and instead not the sporting tellene you can think of with different type integrations 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.930
 in this case it is very important to focus on the quality of what
