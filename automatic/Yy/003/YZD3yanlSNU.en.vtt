00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
I think that's it's supposed to happen

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.260 
I think that's it's supposed to happen

- ok perfect so I'll let you take it
away<00:00:38.030> thank<00:00:38.450> you<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.970> right<00:00:40.970> here<00:00:41.180> we<00:00:41.420> have<00:00:41.450> my

away thank you so right here we have my

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.320 
away thank you so right here we have my
students<00:00:42.739> our<00:00:42.830> amplifier<00:00:43.700> from<00:00:43.879> Randall

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
students our amplifier from Randall

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.369 
students our amplifier from Randall

what's<00:00:48.379> unique<00:00:48.890> about<00:00:49.129> this<00:00:49.400> amplifier<00:00:49.970> is

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
what's unique about this amplifier is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.990 
what's unique about this amplifier is
the<00:00:50.360> fact<00:00:50.600> that<00:00:50.659> it<00:00:50.839> has<00:00:50.989> 3<00:00:51.710> K<00:00:51.949> knobs<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:52.940> you

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
the fact that it has 3 K knobs so you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.990 
the fact that it has 3 K knobs so you
can<00:00:53.830> basically<00:00:54.830> build<00:00:55.370> your<00:00:55.580> own<00:00:55.610> gain

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
can basically build your own gain

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.840 
can basically build your own gain
structure<00:00:56.390> for<00:00:56.930> your<00:00:57.140> particular<00:00:57.559> guitar<00:00:57.890> and

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
structure for your particular guitar and

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.549 
structure for your particular guitar and
it's<00:00:59.030> a<00:00:59.120> low<00:00:59.269> frequency<00:00:59.839> gain<00:00:59.870> a<00:01:00.050> high

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
it's a low frequency gain a high

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.090 
it's a low frequency gain a high
frequency<00:01:00.830> gain<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.550> an<00:01:01.610> overall<00:01:01.879> gain<00:01:02.269> and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
frequency gain and an overall gain and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.439 
frequency gain and an overall gain and
I'll<00:01:04.100> show<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:04.460> little<00:01:04.729> bit<00:01:04.850> later<00:01:05.030> what<00:01:05.300> it

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
I'll show you a little bit later what it

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.160 
I'll show you a little bit later what it
does<00:01:05.659> but<00:01:05.960> basically<00:01:06.440> you<00:01:06.680> can<00:01:06.710> down<00:01:07.580> below

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
does but basically you can down below

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.660 
does but basically you can down below
the<00:01:09.170> lows<00:01:09.409> of<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.740> guitar<00:01:10.070> if<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:10.340> have<00:01:10.490> an<00:01:10.580> a

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
the lows of the guitar if you have an a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.920 
the lows of the guitar if you have an a
string<00:01:10.850> guitar<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:11.270> can<00:01:11.330> still<00:01:11.540> keep<00:01:11.780> it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
string guitar you can still keep it

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.050 
string guitar you can still keep it
tight<00:01:12.170> by<00:01:12.440> pulling<00:01:13.010> down<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.190> low<00:01:13.549> frequency

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
tight by pulling down the low frequency

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.289 
tight by pulling down the low frequency
gain<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.979> also<00:01:16.130> has<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.370> sweep<00:01:16.729> knob<00:01:17.000> that

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
gain and it also has a sweep knob that

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.960 
gain and it also has a sweep knob that
changes<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.900> sweep<00:01:18.430> for<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.460> bass<00:01:19.670> middle

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
changes the sweep for the bass middle

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.940 
changes the sweep for the bass middle
and<00:01:20.060> treble<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:20.840> can<00:01:20.990> dial<00:01:21.200> in<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.500> whatever

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
and treble so you can dial in a whatever

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.490 
and treble so you can dial in a whatever
cab<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.520> are<00:01:22.579> using<00:01:23.020> has<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.079> kill<00:01:24.350> switch

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
cab you are using has a kill switch

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.760 
cab you are using has a kill switch
which<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.100> basically<00:01:25.719> another<00:01:26.719> gain<00:01:27.110> stage<00:01:27.439> it

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
which is basically another gain stage it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.520 
which is basically another gain stage it
adds<00:01:28.250> even<00:01:28.369> more<00:01:28.579> beef<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.689> already<00:01:30.200> beefy

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
adds even more beef to the already beefy

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.670 
adds even more beef to the already beefy
sound<00:01:30.829> a<00:01:31.180> clean<00:01:32.180> shell<00:01:32.450> it's<00:01:32.960> pretty<00:01:33.200> simple

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
sound a clean shell it's pretty simple

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.300 
sound a clean shell it's pretty simple
with<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.340> bright<00:01:34.579> switch<00:01:34.850> mid<00:01:35.689> shift<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.320> the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
with a bright switch mid shift and the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.800 
with a bright switch mid shift and the
cool<00:01:37.490> another<00:01:37.759> cool<00:01:37.969> thing<00:01:38.000> about<00:01:38.270> its<00:01:38.509> office

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
cool another cool thing about its office

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.929 
cool another cool thing about its office
that<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.049> can<00:01:39.159> shove<00:01:40.159> in<00:01:40.280> whatever<00:01:40.520> power

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
that you can shove in whatever power

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.580 
that you can shove in whatever power
tubes<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.479> want<00:01:41.689> in<00:01:41.899> it<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.259> can<00:01:42.409> buy

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
tubes you want in it and you can buy

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.459 
tubes you want in it and you can buy
sell<00:01:42.799> yourself<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:43.719> right<00:01:44.719> now<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.140> ships
