00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
bring her back and actually took me off

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.840 
bring her back and actually took me off
the<00:04:38.479> game<00:04:38.720> for<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.020> last<00:04:39.080> 14<00:04:39.620> seconds<00:04:40.040> so

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
the game for the last 14 seconds so

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.250 
the game for the last 14 seconds so
that's<00:04:41.060> why<00:04:41.180> I<00:04:41.210> just<00:04:41.479> kind<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.690> switched<00:04:41.990> over

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
that's why I just kind of switched over

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.870 
that's why I just kind of switched over
to<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.470> end<00:04:44.080> but<00:04:45.080> uh<00:04:45.400> let's<00:04:46.400> take<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.610> look<00:04:46.760> at
