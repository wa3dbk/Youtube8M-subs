I was kind of like Citigroup and I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.950 
I was kind of like Citigroup and I
wanted<00:01:52.670> something<00:01:52.850> that<00:01:52.970> gave<00:01:53.180> me<00:01:53.240> energy<00:01:53.660> but

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
wanted something that gave me energy but

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.280 
wanted something that gave me energy but
I<00:01:54.820> don't<00:01:55.820> feel<00:01:56.120> like<00:01:56.180> these<00:01:56.570> really<00:01:56.810> do<00:01:57.110> very

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
I don't feel like these really do very

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.580 
I don't feel like these really do very
much<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:58.160> I<00:01:58.910> want<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.210> say<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.479> was<00:01:59.600> about<00:01:59.720> $30

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
much and I want to say it was about $30

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.450 
much and I want to say it was about $30
and<00:02:01.420> I'd<00:02:02.420> probably<00:02:03.020> recommend<00:02:03.650> that<00:02:04.160> to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
and I'd probably recommend that to

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.850 
and I'd probably recommend that to
anyone<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:05.210> mean<00:02:05.870> I<00:02:06.110> don't<00:02:06.170> know<00:02:06.410> if<00:02:06.470> you've

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
anyone I mean I don't know if you've

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.940 
anyone I mean I don't know if you've
tried<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.420> results<00:02:08.420> but

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
tried it and results but

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.240 
tried it and results but

I'm really been using those I snapped

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.780 
I'm really been using those I snapped
because<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.340> wasn't<00:02:13.580> really<00:02:13.760> seeing<00:02:14.060> results

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
because I wasn't really seeing results
