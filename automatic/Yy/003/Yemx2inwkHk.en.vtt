of<00:00:18.960> travel<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.860> especially<00:00:20.070> fertile<00:00:20.850> places

like<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.780> bountiful<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.500> he<00:00:22.620> described<00:00:23.070> was

like the bountiful that he described was

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.760 
like the bountiful that he described was
really<00:00:23.910> quite<00:00:24.090> foreign<00:00:24.450> to<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:25.080> would<00:00:25.620> have

really quite foreign to what would have
been<00:00:25.920> expected<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.390> extremely<00:00:28.080> dubious

been expected and and extremely dubious

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.490 
been expected and and extremely dubious
so<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.520> find<00:00:29.970> places<00:00:30.270> that<00:00:30.480> look<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.289> like

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
so to find places that look just like

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.459 
so to find places that look just like
that<00:00:32.149> turns<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.539> be<00:00:33.570> really<00:00:34.140> quite

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
of this part of Arabia there is a fairly

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.359 
of this part of Arabia there is a fairly
cool<00:01:37.880> body<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.450> water<00:01:38.770> being<00:01:39.770> pulled<00:01:40.100> up<00:01:40.250> to

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
cool body of water being pulled up to

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.310 
cool body of water being pulled up to
the<00:01:40.490> surface<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.210> monsoon<00:01:41.690> winds<00:01:41.960> coming

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
the surface the monsoon winds coming

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.140 
the surface the monsoon winds coming
across<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.860> Indian<00:01:43.100> Ocean<00:01:43.369> pick<00:01:43.970> up<00:01:44.090> a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
across the Indian Ocean pick up a

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.810 
across the Indian Ocean pick up a
tremendous<00:01:44.570> amount<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.810> moisture<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.670> by

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
tremendous amount of moisture and so by

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.820 
tremendous amount of moisture and so by
the<00:01:46.880> time<00:01:47.119> they<00:01:47.420> they<00:01:47.660> reach<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.229> inland<00:01:48.680> the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
the time they they reach the inland the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.770 
the time they they reach the inland the
mainland<00:01:49.220> part<00:01:49.550> they<00:01:49.820> are<00:01:49.850> very<00:01:50.240> moisture

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
mainland part they are very moisture

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.530 
mainland part they are very moisture
Laden<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.259> very<00:01:51.590> very<00:01:51.740> heavy<00:01:51.979> and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
Laden and very very heavy and

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.160 
Laden and very very heavy and
consequently<00:01:53.540> they<00:01:53.690> don't<00:01:53.810> get<00:01:53.899> a<00:01:53.930> lot<00:01:54.050> of

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
consequently they don't get a lot of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.499 
consequently they don't get a lot of
altitude<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:54.890> they<00:01:55.009> build<00:01:55.369> up<00:01:55.520> along<00:01:56.000> the

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
altitude and so they build up along the

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.480 
altitude and so they build up along the
escarpment<00:01:56.869> or<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.320> big<00:01:57.500> bluff<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.190> runs

escarpment or this big bluff that runs
along<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.000> coast<00:01:59.680> as<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:00.860> hits<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.160> mountains

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
along the coast as it hits the mountains

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.620 
along the coast as it hits the mountains
the<00:02:03.950> mist<00:02:04.220> cannot<00:02:04.670> go<00:02:04.850> up<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.300> over<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the mist cannot go up and over the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.510 
the mist cannot go up and over the
mountains<00:02:05.930> because<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.380> hot<00:02:06.560> ER<00:02:06.770> blowing<00:02:07.220> from
