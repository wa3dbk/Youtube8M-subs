00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.529
 sexy people that the mere way but total 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.600
 youtube are welcome again 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.400
 let's talk about films where you 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.630
 youtube seers and I talked about 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.820
 of the new movies that are in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.900
 billboard and the odd war and in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.480
 this time we are going to talk about the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.480
 movie the amazing spiderman 2 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.480
 m 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.320
 anyway 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.670
 I do not know about you but when I found out 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.830
 that they were going to restart the franchise of 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.990
 spider-man I really believed that this was going 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.480
 I from bad to worse endure again 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.220
 the origins of spider man go back to 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.470
 having to go through the same thing was done to me 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.020
 extremely tedious and to tell the truth 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.090
 I was not 100% wrong since the 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.640
 first part had several flaws in my 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.129
 opinion on all that great sin of 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.690
 have omitted the famous phrase of a 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.940
 great power entails a great 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.640
 responsibility but certainly have 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.960
 learned many things in this sequel 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.970
 to appear the movie let's talk about 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.409
 the performances I do not know about you but to 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.390
 me andrew garfield the person that I 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.930
 like spider-man has a friend who 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.400
 I do not know who I do not know how but I do not like it 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.000
 how it acts except when it's 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.620
 spider-man 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.780
 in fact the parties where peter like 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.360
 talk are excellent it shows a 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.490
 chemistry so so cool so father so 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.720
 pretty that in fact that would explain why 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.360
 what are couples in real life 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.430
 they are very good scenes of indigenous 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.990
 I do not know if I say it like that, he plays harry 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.689
 osborn I can tell you 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.520
 It is excellent as a garden also as 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.360
 where green I liked it very much because 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.890
 missed time on screen but jamie foxx 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.810
 I do not know about you but I loved your 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.640
 performance from max dillon leaving 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.950
 take advantage of people as they hit 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.830
 how they abuse he is doing electro 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.420
 not that guy is a actorazo in terms of 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.640
 the special effects this is one of 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.140
 my favorite parts the effects were 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.600
 very good not at the level of the avengers 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.729
 but yes in his little fight especially in the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.610
 parts of slow its transformation the 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.990
 fight in times square was epic 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.090
 spectacular really is one of my 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.830
 favorite battles of all time 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.080
 that is one of my favorite actions of 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.420
 the film where the music combined 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.519
 effects and amount of destruction 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.799
 generated by the electro make an orgasm 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.330
 visual in that part one of the details 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.340
 what I really liked was the sense 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.959
 arachnid those parts are in slow motion 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.190
 and you can appreciate everything there 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.140
 around the scene those parts are 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.000
 was raffled the mark webber which is the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.560
 director by the way the music was 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.690
 composed by the legendary hans zimmer 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.220
 which we have talked about him several times 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.350
 he composed the music of inception batman 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.390
 sherlock holmes who is good 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.910
 work with someone or some 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.070
 called the magnificent six that are 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.600
 like the magnificent six among them 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.660
 defraud the Williams who did the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.970
 happy song to explain the myths or 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.960
 my favorite villain 2 very good song 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.220
 the music in general is good the great 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.810
 The problem is that it does not reach 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.030
 heels to the soundtrack of danny 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.070
 elfman the old composer of the other 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.810
 trilogy the music that I liked and I 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.730
 I had really learned are the parts 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.040
 of electro they gave him a touch of dubstep 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.780
 combined with orchestral music and some 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.450
 species of murmurs that the mind 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.680
 they made a broken but good so that it 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.540
 I tell them the expensive night here in the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.670
 description of the video what it is that 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.980
 the spider-man parts not if I do not 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.840
 they liked it or if you compare it with the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.820
 previous ones are much better 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.070
 earlier these are actually felt with 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.190
 so much patriotic I do not know there is something that does not 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.130
 I like it but good in conclusion this 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.810
 movie is the spiderman movie 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.610
 the acrobatics the typical jokes that 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.320
 they do the comics without mentioning several 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.270
 things that expand the universe as 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.370
 of the raven croft institute or even the 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.290
 appearance of the doctor kafka make this 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.480
 movie maybe the best of all 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.640
 taken out of spiderman is not perfect 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.109
 has one or another failure as the time 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.060
 appearance on the screen of the gift of verdeo 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.980
 as visually acting that to me 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.569
 I did not like to apply cold and 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.159
 Effects on certain parts of the film 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.290
 could I believe it has been a bit 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.790
 better is all this mix generates a 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.129
 movie that kills you with laughter in certain 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.690
 parts puts you on nerves makes you angry 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.400
 And till 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.400
 and even cry you do 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.590
 but good our rating of that 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.570
 movie is 9.5 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.799
 before I forget a lot of 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.080
 you are surely going to have this 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.400
 doubt if they stayed to the credits that to 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.080
 purpose at the end of appropriations not 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.060
 nothing comes out half of the credits 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.889
 It will be a small scene of x-men days 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.630
 of the future past the explanation of this 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.880
 do not think that you are going to join the 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.800
 Avengers style ' not what happened is that 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.840
 the director marc webb had a certain 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.240
 problem with the fox about directing 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.699
 a movie called 500 days of 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.620
 summer something like this the sequels have to 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.150
 I had to do it and then 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.979
 to let him direct this sequel 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.340
 of spider-man they had to make 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.900
 promotion to the x-men movie for free 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.700
 then very ingenious they grab and put 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.530
 an examination scene of half of the 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.440
 credits I tell you this so they do not go 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.300
 to say oh for god the x-men and 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.490
 spider-man are going to join or are the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.420
 fantastic stories 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.700
 that would be epic 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.050
 but at the moment it's not going to be good 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.850
