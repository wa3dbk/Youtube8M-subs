slideshow as you can see so let's import
our<00:00:50.879> three<00:00:51.300> buttons<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.199> they'll<00:00:52.350> file<00:00:52.670> import

library might have done something like

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.440 
library might have done something like
regenerated<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.250> symbols<00:01:08.790> are<00:01:08.970> ready<00:01:09.210> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
regenerated this as symbols are ready so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.539 
regenerated this as symbols are ready so
people<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.900> library<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.560> yes<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.920> did<00:01:11.130> it

people in your library and yes it did it
made<00:01:11.880> extra<00:01:12.479> symbols<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.140> us<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.530> made<00:01:13.979> next

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400

underscore buttons it put these in here

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.020 
underscore buttons it put these in here
but<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.040> made<00:01:17.159> symbols<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> these

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
but then it made symbols of these

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.899 
but then it made symbols of these
buttons<00:01:18.299> already<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.590> want<00:01:19.950> flash<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
buttons already we do not want flash to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.880 
buttons already we do not want flash to
do<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.630> want<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> delete<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.740> these

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
do this we want to delete all of these

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.310 
do this we want to delete all of these
symbols<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.119> also<00:01:24.479> happened<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.080> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
symbols so if this also happened in you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
symbols so if this also happened in you
delete<00:01:25.979> these<00:01:26.159> symbols<00:01:26.610> by<00:01:26.790> just

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
delete these symbols by just

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.710 
delete these symbols by just
highlighting<00:01:27.150> them<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.780> clicking<00:01:28.170> delete<00:01:29.720> 33

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
highlighting them in clicking delete 33

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.749 
highlighting them in clicking delete 33
so<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.409> should<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:32.009> next<00:01:32.369> underscore

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
so you should just have next underscore

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.370 
so you should just have next underscore
button<00:01:33.060> pause<00:01:33.390> underscore<00:01:33.930> button<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
button pause underscore button and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990 
button pause underscore button and
previous<00:01:34.799> underscore<00:01:35.189> button<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.909> you

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
previous underscore button so if you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090 
previous underscore button so if you
have<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.479> let's<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> next<00:01:37.350> step<00:01:37.530> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
have that let's go to the next step so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.469 
have that let's go to the next step so
now<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.549> want<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:39.299> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
now what we want to do is we want to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
now what we want to do is we want to
lock<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.259> layers<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.710> we've<00:01:40.860> made<00:01:41.100> so

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
lock all the layers that we've made so

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
it buttons and click enter so this is

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.889 
it buttons and click enter so this is
the<00:01:56.460> layer<00:01:56.670> where<00:01:56.969> our<00:01:57.060> buttons<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the layer where our buttons are going to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.050 
the layer where our buttons are going to
go<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.409> let's<00:01:58.469> drag<00:01:58.890> those<00:01:59.130> buttons<00:01:59.460> onto<00:01:59.729> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
go so let's drag those buttons onto the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.569 
go so let's drag those buttons onto the
stage<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.930> drag<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.680> previous<00:02:02.159> button<00:02:02.460> onto

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
stage so drag your previous button onto

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.600 
stage so drag your previous button onto
the<00:02:02.759> stage<00:02:03.469> drag<00:02:04.469> your<00:02:04.740> pause<00:02:05.040> button<00:02:05.460> onto

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the stage drag your pause button onto

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.719 
the stage drag your pause button onto
the<00:02:05.790> stage<00:02:06.740> try<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:08.009> more<00:02:08.039> time<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:08.610> go

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the stage try one more time there we go

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.440 
the stage try one more time there we go
and<00:02:09.020> drag<00:02:10.020> your<00:02:10.080> next<00:02:10.590> button<00:02:10.890> onto<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> stage

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
and drag your next button onto the stage

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.490 
and drag your next button onto the stage
so<00:02:12.450> now<00:02:12.629> we<00:02:12.690> want<00:02:12.840> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
so now we want to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500 
so now we want to
try<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.010> convert<00:02:14.370> these<00:02:14.550> two<00:02:14.790> symbols<00:02:15.060> like

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
try and convert these two symbols like

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.570 
try and convert these two symbols like
we<00:02:15.660> had<00:02:15.840> before<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:16.860> want<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.130> make<00:02:17.400> them

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
we had before but we want to make them

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.700 
we had before but we want to make them
button<00:02:18.300> symbols<00:02:18.840> they<00:02:19.020> weren't<00:02:19.290> buttons

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
button symbols they weren't buttons

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.320 
button symbols they weren't buttons
before<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.250> they<00:02:20.340> wouldn't<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.730> worked<00:02:21.060> so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
before so they wouldn't have worked so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.310 
before so they wouldn't have worked so
that's<00:02:21.480> what<00:02:21.630> we<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.050> them<00:02:22.230> ourselves

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
that's what we have to do them ourselves

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.500 
that's what we have to do them ourselves
so<00:02:23.070> let's<00:02:23.220> click<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.490> previous<00:02:23.970> button<00:02:24.330> and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
so let's click the previous button and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.770 
so let's click the previous button and
go<00:02:24.960> modify<00:02:25.470> convert<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.310> symbol<00:02:26.570> make<00:02:27.570> your

underscore<00:02:55.230> BTN<00:02:55.530> click<00:02:56.459> ok<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.000> let's<00:02:57.720> zoom

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
underscore BTN click ok now let's zoom

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.199 
underscore BTN click ok now let's zoom
in<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.470> get<00:02:58.650> these<00:02:58.770> aligned<00:02:59.250> nice<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.000> good

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
in and get these aligned nice and good

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.590 
in and get these aligned nice and good
so<00:03:00.540> let's<00:03:00.720> uh<00:03:00.930> let's<00:03:01.140> zoom<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.920> 800<00:03:02.459> zoom<00:03:02.730> so

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
so let's uh let's zoom in to 800 zoom so

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.540 
so let's uh let's zoom in to 800 zoom so
we<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.080> see<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.350> buttons<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.010> let's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
we can just see the buttons and let's

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.180 
we can just see the buttons and let's
highlight<00:03:05.850> all<00:03:06.270> three<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.570> these<00:03:06.690> buttons<00:03:07.190> and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
highlight all three of these buttons and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.710 
highlight all three of these buttons and
go<00:03:08.580> modify<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.600> line<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.980> let's<00:03:11.220> go<00:03:11.720> distribute

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
go modify a line and let's go distribute

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.210 
go modify a line and let's go distribute
widths<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.290> then<00:03:14.220> modify<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:15.239> line<00:03:16.220> distribute

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
widths and then modify a line distribute

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.210 
widths and then modify a line distribute
heights<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:19.470> works<00:03:19.709> sometimes

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
heights so this works sometimes

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.740 
heights so this works sometimes
sometimes<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.910> doesn't<00:03:21.180> work<00:03:21.209> if<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.540> didn't

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
sometimes it doesn't work if it didn't

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.449 
sometimes it doesn't work if it didn't
work<00:03:21.840> for<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.680> can<00:03:22.860> just<00:03:22.980> move<00:03:23.220> these

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
work for you you can just move these

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.210 
work for you you can just move these
around<00:03:23.519> until<00:03:24.330> they<00:03:24.420> look<00:03:24.630> pretty<00:03:24.810> good<00:03:26.989> and

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
around until they look pretty good and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.860 
around until they look pretty good and
this<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.370> totally<00:03:29.940> up<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.570> can<00:03:30.600> put
