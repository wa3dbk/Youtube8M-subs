00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
first one is the one I suggest second

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.330 
first one is the one I suggest second
one<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.280> little<00:01:17.060> harder<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:18.050> know<00:01:18.340> doesn't

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
one a little harder and you know doesn't

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.600 
one a little harder and you know doesn't
work<00:01:19.550> every<00:01:19.880> time<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.720> um<00:01:21.020> yeah<00:01:21.350> okay

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
work every time so um yeah okay

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.340 
work every time so um yeah okay
so<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.000> first<00:01:23.210> way<00:01:23.450> mine<00:01:24.260> DeWindt<00:01:24.680> is<00:01:25.160> on

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
so the first way mine DeWindt is on
