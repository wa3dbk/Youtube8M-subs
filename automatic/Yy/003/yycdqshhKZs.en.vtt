I wish that and I think as we move

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.540 
I wish that and I think as we move
forward<00:05:46.390> we'll<00:05:46.840> probably<00:05:47.250> consider<00:05:48.250> those

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
forward we'll probably consider those

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.659 
forward we'll probably consider those
those<00:05:49.530> those<00:05:50.530> options<00:05:51.040> and<00:05:51.280> I<00:05:51.310> think<00:05:51.340> that's

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
those those options and I think that's

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.020 
those those options and I think that's
very<00:05:51.940> attractive<00:05:53.550> you<00:05:54.550> know<00:05:54.610> one<00:05:54.729> thing<00:05:54.910> to

think about if you're considering an
online<00:05:56.729> solution<00:05:57.729> is<00:05:57.880> you<00:05:58.600> know<00:05:58.660> make<00:05:58.840> sure

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
online solution is you know make sure

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.430 
online solution is you know make sure
you<00:05:59.320> can<00:05:59.500> export<00:06:00.010> your<00:06:00.130> database<00:06:00.820> and<00:06:01.440> export
