00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 ay crafter sacchi centered from a 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.610
 new review video of many for in 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.530
 0.9 points 0.11 good this is a video 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.259
 quickie compensating videos that I do not upload 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.480
 several days is a video that lasts 4 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.010
 minutes a lot but good in this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.980
 I bring you a mod that fascinated me 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.960
 which is one of this multi coordinates 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.570
 coordinates makes us see the goal 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.550
 that although it is the x the yy the z what 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.900
 which allows us to locate ourselves is that without 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.000
 need to put what is the king 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.619
 minimal for things like that a little harder 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600
 but a little more pro because you would be 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.980
 learning coordinates good this 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.270
 very install module in the series sans 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.070
 word that those who are from the channel 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.070
 you know what the sans words series is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.450
 install and good going back with the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820
 tutorial we will need two enclosures 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.039
 good three tools 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.620
 will 11 only the abalone will not 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.149
 it works neither for 12 and I do not know if for 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.460
 down works I do not know if they work to 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.760
 diesel to 9 do not know only is approved 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.800
 build 11 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 and block lawn good block launchers and 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.609
 block launcher below I leave the link 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.989
 abalone in the plow launcher the block 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.729
 launcher has to be the one that I'm going to 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.140
 leave the description below if you already 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.700
 they saw some of my videos and do it 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.979
 if you already have it installed, obviously you are going to 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.869
 be that one that is a blazer that is 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.119
 specifically for version 0.9 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.950
 understood good and the mod that will be 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.869
 down that was created by good it was not 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.479
 created but it was modified because it's 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.780
 jmr pro bart that modified it for the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.659
 0.9 alpha bull version 11 good 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.759
 he is the creator my girl the modifier 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.289
 of the motorcycle the imitator and well good down 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.090
 he left his channel if I can if he did not leave 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.280
 your username and youtube so that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.100
 can get good as always 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.240
 we go up to the minecraft headquarters up 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.670
 and a visit above the headquarters 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.500
 we try here we give blue options 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.630
 clown be and here in safe mode that 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.969
 we want it to be in 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.189
 on off and on administrator for all 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.689
 we arrive that is in a and administer 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.930
 how do you write it 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.930
 good 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.170
 we go to where scripts are administered 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.030
 and that we are going to import here in the part 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.000
 bottom in the lower right 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.549
 How is it that this does not matter and is in 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.380
 this in local storage we look for the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.069
 mod that almost always goes to what 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.349
 it's storage 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.299
 the storage sorry the folder 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.810
 dollars now I do not know would be all the 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.519
 installation 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.319
 it's very easy to simply not have 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.060
 the secure mode installed that they have 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.349
 activated the script molds I repeat they go 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.749
 here we administer script part 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.370
 lower right they give if they matter the 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.629
 world and well this would be all for the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.780
 installation now let's show them 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.780
 how they work very good right now back 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.400
 but I'm here back and I'm going to 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.980
 show them how the engine works before 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.010
 that everything I did not record putting me in some 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.170
 world because it gives me error when recording and 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.730
 to put play and enter some world in 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.430
 minecraft gives me a little bit of error and I 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.200
 delete the recording understood good good 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.560
 here we are as you can see below and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.110
 some little arrows or some letters that say x 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.640
 2 points 32 00 10 69 z - it is in 609 with 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.959
 this I will be able to indicate what 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.680
 I have to do is an example this is my 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:11.680
 house I'm going to put the door here here in 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:13.720
 331 97 69 z 622 simply takes the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.489
 I put it in my notebook and well I 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.319
 I know my house is now, I can go 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.480
 very good but there is where my house is 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.340
 I'm just going down by adding and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.200
 way to here is a very mode 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.790
 efficient not to lose yourself not to do 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.319
 a little bit of work with the minimum king 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.690
 because it is a very very easy because 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.819
 We can find places that are far away and 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.110
 find our house I would say it is 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.420
 a little more but I a little bit more 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.030
 to pros this mode since good gives a 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.770
 little more than roe and now a little more d 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.180
 we can say that we use a little 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.819
 more the intelligence scoring the 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.569
 graphs checking 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.749
 coordinates all that this has been all 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.099
 very stupid and a video seems I'm going 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:54.069
 to use the simple truth I do know what 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.260
 well, he did it for me 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.999
 dismissal thank you very much and low will be 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.500
