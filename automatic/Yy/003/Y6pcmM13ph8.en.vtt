just because I had a really bad back

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.169 
just because I had a really bad back
ache<00:00:13.679> from<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.280> gas<00:00:14.519> because<00:00:14.820> they<00:00:14.940> bloat

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
ache from all the gas because they bloat

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.760 
ache from all the gas because they bloat
your<00:00:15.330> stomach<00:00:15.719> up<00:00:15.870> when<00:00:16.049> they<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.379> surgery

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
your stomach up when they do the surgery

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.179 
your stomach up when they do the surgery
and<00:00:17.270> haven't<00:00:18.270> had<00:00:18.359> anything<00:00:18.630> since<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.590> I'm

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
and haven't had anything since so I'm

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.740 
and haven't had anything since so I'm
kind<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.670> surprised<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.240> wasn't<00:00:21.570> as<00:00:21.720> bad

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
kind of surprised that it wasn't as bad

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.660 
kind of surprised that it wasn't as bad
as<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.500> thought<00:00:22.769> because<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.310> figure<00:00:23.490> if<00:00:23.550> they're

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
as I thought because I figure if they're

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.679 
as I thought because I figure if they're
getting<00:00:23.910> cut<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.300> you're<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> be

to throw up in and they blew it up

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889

because<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.000> normally<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.449> big<00:01:00.719> but

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
because it's not normally this big but

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.420 
because it's not normally this big but
they<00:01:01.050> blew<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.410> because<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:01.859> inspect<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.280 
but that's the part of the stomach that
they<00:01:05.790> took<00:01:06.030> out<00:01:06.180> that's<00:01:06.900> kind<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> interesting

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
they took out that's kind of interesting

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.580 
they took out that's kind of interesting
because<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.710> looks<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.040> swan<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.500> but<00:01:10.500> it

because it looks like a swan so but it
looks<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.830> lot<00:01:10.979> bigger<00:01:11.250> when<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.760> blow<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.030> up

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
looks a lot bigger when they blow it up

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.640 
looks a lot bigger when they blow it up
to<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.900> kind<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.260> inspect<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.120 
very very surprised i'm looking forward
to<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> results<00:01:34.229> i<00:01:34.650> know<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> take

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
to the results i know it's going to take

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.249 
to the results i know it's going to take
a<00:01:35.220> while<00:01:35.270> I'm<00:01:36.270> supposed<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.900> doing<00:01:36.960> about

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a while I'm supposed to be doing about

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.190 
a while I'm supposed to be doing about
80<00:01:37.470> grams<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.860> protein<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.220> day<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.939> I'm<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
80 grams of protein a day and I'm the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.149 
80 grams of protein a day and I'm the
little<00:01:40.439> things<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.740> showed<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.040> from

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
little things I just showed you from

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
little things I just showed you from
costco<00:01:41.640> they're<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.030> 30<00:01:42.299> grams<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.750> each<00:01:42.869> one

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
costco they're like 30 grams in each one

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.499 
costco they're like 30 grams in each one
so<00:01:43.470> i<00:01:43.680> should<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.130> well<00:01:44.340> okay<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.970> but

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
so i should be well okay with that but

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.810 
so i should be well okay with that but
it's<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:45.869> very<00:01:46.049> high<00:01:46.350> calorie<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.549> i<00:01:47.579> imagine

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it's not very high calorie so i imagine

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.030 
it's not very high calorie so i imagine
you<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.479> first<00:01:48.780> couple<00:01:49.079> weeks<00:01:49.200> until<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you know first couple weeks until you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.100 
you know first couple weeks until you
incorporate<00:01:50.490> more<00:01:50.640> food<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.149> its<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:52.020> know

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
incorporate more food in its you know

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.260 
incorporate more food in its you know
might<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> fairly<00:01:52.829> quick<00:01:53.220> weight<00:01:53.670> loss<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
might be a fairly quick weight loss I
