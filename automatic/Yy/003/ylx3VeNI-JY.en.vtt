00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.139 
website at all which is kind of weird so
but<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.630> did<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.710> Walgreens<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> my

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but I did get this at Walgreens and my

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.740 
but I did get this at Walgreens and my
display<00:01:54.689> had<00:01:55.640> three<00:01:56.640> different<00:01:56.790> shades<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.600> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
display had three different shades so I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.490 
display had three different shades so I
got<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> fair<00:01:58.740> shade<00:01:59.310> which<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.640> a<00:02:01.460> 111<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
got the fair shade which is a 111 and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.749 
got the fair shade which is a 111 and
that's<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> shade<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> picked<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.579> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that's the shade that I picked up this

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.890 
that's the shade that I picked up this
is<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.060> lightest<00:02:06.420> shade<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.380> have

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
is the lightest shade that they have

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.660 
is the lightest shade that they have
I<00:02:07.960> am<00:02:08.500> going<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.860> assume<00:02:09.130> because<00:02:09.310> it's<00:02:09.520> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
I am going to assume because it's the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.850 
I am going to assume because it's the
lightest<00:02:10.000> shade<00:02:10.240> in<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.660> display<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.740> then

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
lightest shade in the display and then

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.140 
lightest shade in the display and then
it<00:02:11.980> had<00:02:12.130> kind<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.460> like<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> medium<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.090> then

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
it had kind of like a medium and then

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.230 
it had kind of like a medium and then
kind<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.600> dark<00:02:13.870> color<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:15.030> got<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
kind of a dark color so I got the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.140 
kind of a dark color so I got the
lightest<00:02:16.630> color<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.610> brightening

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
lightest color for the brightening

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.820 
lightest color for the brightening
effect<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> little<00:02:20.290> bit<00:02:20.500> lighter

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
effect so this is a little bit lighter

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.970 
effect so this is a little bit lighter
than<00:02:20.950> my<00:02:21.730> skin<00:02:21.760> tone<00:02:22.060> even<00:02:22.480> though<00:02:22.570> I'm<00:02:22.690> very

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980

fair<00:02:23.980> white<00:02:24.430> skinned<00:02:24.820> this<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.750> little<00:02:25.960> bit

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
fair white skinned this is a little bit

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.300 
fair white skinned this is a little bit
lighter<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.530> got<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> little<00:02:26.830> bit<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.130> pink

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
lighter it's got a little bit of a pink

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.150 
lighter it's got a little bit of a pink
tone<00:02:27.550> which<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.730> good<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.180> brightening<00:02:29.160> so

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
tone which is good for brightening so

it up with your fingers a little bit
because<00:03:42.010> just<00:03:42.400> like<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.610> was<00:03:42.760> saying<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.090> is

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
because just like I was saying it is

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.050 
because just like I was saying it is
kind<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.600> amoliant<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:45.040> thick<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.610> so<00:03:46.000> you

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
kind of amoliant and thick and so you

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.820 
kind of amoliant and thick and so you
want<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.480> kind<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.780> warm<00:03:47.019> in<00:03:47.110> warm<00:03:47.530> up<00:03:47.650> their

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.920 

that's<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.670> way<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.910> I<00:04:13.000> used<00:04:13.270> it<00:04:13.420> today<00:04:13.570> and

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
that's the way that I used it today and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.820 
that's the way that I used it today and
I<00:04:14.080> really<00:04:14.550> like<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:15.700> way<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.060> turned<00:04:16.300> out

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
I really like the way that it turned out

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.039 
I really like the way that it turned out
now<00:04:18.150> keep<00:04:19.150> turning<00:04:19.420> around<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.720> look<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:19.959> my

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
now keep turning around to look in my

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.570 
now keep turning around to look in my
mirror<00:04:20.200> because<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.560> kind<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.130> have<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.400> weird

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
mirror because I kind of have a weird

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.980 
mirror because I kind of have a weird
setup<00:04:21.940> this<00:04:22.150> is<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.420> first<00:04:22.600> video<00:04:22.870> I've<00:04:22.930> done

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
setup this is the first video I've done

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.350 
setup this is the first video I've done
since<00:04:23.320> I've<00:04:23.440> been<00:04:23.560> here<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:23.950> anyways<00:04:24.790> I<00:04:25.060> think

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
since I've been here so anyways I think

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.450 
since I've been here so anyways I think
it<00:04:25.450> turned<00:04:25.690> out<00:04:25.750> pretty<00:04:25.810> good<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:26.800> does<00:04:27.010> like<00:04:27.310> I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
it turned out pretty good it does like I

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.120 
it turned out pretty good it does like I
said<00:04:27.640> it<00:04:27.760> is<00:04:27.790> pretty<00:04:28.240> full<00:04:28.420> coverage<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:29.560> say

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
said it is pretty full coverage I say

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.640 
said it is pretty full coverage I say
pretty<00:04:30.400> full<00:04:30.610> coverage<00:04:30.850> very<00:04:31.210> full<00:04:31.450> coverage

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
pretty full coverage very full coverage

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.790 
pretty full coverage very full coverage
what<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.680> would<00:04:33.040> compare<00:04:33.490> this<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:34.180> is<00:04:34.800> most

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
what I would compare this to is most

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.220 
what I would compare this to is most
closely<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.700> by<00:04:36.970> by<00:04:37.150> under<00:04:37.450> I<00:04:37.480> from<00:04:37.990> it

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
closely the by by under I from it

medium which I'll show you kind of see

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.610 
medium which I'll show you kind of see
it<00:04:45.250> can<00:04:45.460> tell<00:04:45.700> what<00:04:46.000> color<00:04:46.420> you<00:04:46.690> may<00:04:46.810> be<00:04:47.260> in<00:04:47.440> let

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
the bye-bye under-eye medium so you can

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.930 
the bye-bye under-eye medium so you can
kind<00:05:17.290> of<00:05:17.350> tell<00:05:17.590> I<00:05:17.830> think<00:05:18.280> if<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.640> had<00:05:18.820> the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
kind of tell I think if you had the

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
bye-bye under-eye and light that would

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.070 
bye-bye under-eye and light that would
probably<00:05:20.890> be<00:05:21.130> more<00:05:21.310> similar<00:05:21.790> but<00:05:22.660> as<00:05:22.780> far<00:05:23.050> as

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
probably be more similar but as far as

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.170 
probably be more similar but as far as
feel<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:23.890> texture<00:05:24.250> goes<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:24.790> mean<00:05:24.970> they're

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
feel and texture goes I mean they're

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.650 
feel and texture goes I mean they're
very<00:05:25.630> very<00:05:26.560> very<00:05:26.770> similar<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:27.760> if<00:05:28.510> you're

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660
