access sadly it's limited I think at the
bar<00:03:35.230> which<00:03:35.740> should<00:03:35.980> be<00:03:36.100> fix<00:03:36.400> their<00:03:36.640> own

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:51.000 
hopefully first change the vector an
advent<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.959> show<00:03:41.830> it<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.560> start<00:03:50.860> the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
advent to show it so you start the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:59.770 
advent to show it so you start the

Lee unya Dwarfs I think it's a bug
hopefully<00:04:41.480> to<00:04:41.570> fix<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.080> change<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.800> on
