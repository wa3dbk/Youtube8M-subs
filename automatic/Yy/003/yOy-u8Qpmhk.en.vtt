that I used mostly the big one and the
medium<00:00:54.809> size<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.949> then<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.850> cut<00:00:57.149> those<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.739> and

medium size and then I cut those out and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.209 
medium size and then I cut those out and
once<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.340> cut<00:00:59.550> them<00:01:00.199> you'll<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.410> shapes

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
once you cut them you'll have shapes

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.109 
once you cut them you'll have shapes
like<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:04.159> today<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.400> gonna<00:01:05.670> show<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.679 
how to make something like that so then
what<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.510> use<00:01:12.900> two<00:01:13.320> flowers<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.689> I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
what I do is I use two flowers and I

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.520 
what I do is I use two flowers and I
take<00:01:16.020> my<00:01:16.049> scissors<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.720> usually<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
take my scissors and usually I like to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.420 
take my scissors and usually I like to
use<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.250> tonic<00:01:21.210> scissors<00:01:21.650> but<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:22.950> have

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
use the tonic scissors but they do have

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.030 
use the tonic scissors but they do have
ridges<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.299> them<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.140> don't<00:01:25.200> want<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
ridges in them and I don't want the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.179 
ridges in them and I don't want the
ridges<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.580> show<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.060> my<00:01:27.240> flower<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.860> just

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
ridges to show up on my flower so I just

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.510 
ridges to show up on my flower so I just
use<00:01:29.869> scissors<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> flat<00:01:32.130> on

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
use scissors that are kind of flat on

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.940 
use scissors that are kind of flat on
the<00:01:32.850> edge<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the edge there so then you take the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.670 
the edge there so then you take the
bottom<00:01:35.460> flower<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.049> cut

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
bottom flower and you're going to cut

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:47.130 
bottom flower and you're going to cut
just<00:01:38.329> each<00:01:39.439> petal

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.550 

just<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.710> little<00:01:49.280> bit<00:01:49.579> in<00:01:49.840> then<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:50.960> take<00:01:51.320> it

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
just a little bit in then you take it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.330 
just a little bit in then you take it
and<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:51.920> kind<00:01:52.220> of<00:01:52.340> shape<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:53.680> fairly<00:01:54.680> simple

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
and you kind of shape it fairly simple

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.109 
and you kind of shape it fairly simple
curl<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.450> edges<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:58.060> like<00:01:59.060> so<00:01:59.259> and<00:02:01.119> set

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
curl the edges of it like so and set

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.350 
curl the edges of it like so and set
aside<00:02:02.979> then<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.130> take<00:02:04.340> your<00:02:04.369> second<00:02:05.030> flower

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
aside then you take your second flower

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.580 
aside then you take your second flower
and<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:07.070> will<00:02:07.670> find<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.360> smallest<00:02:08.959> petal

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
and you will find the smallest petal

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.910 
and you will find the smallest petal
size<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:11.360> will<00:02:11.390> actually<00:02:11.810> cut<00:02:12.680> that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
size and you will actually cut that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.910 
size and you will actually cut that
petal<00:02:13.430> out<00:02:19.450> then<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.630> take<00:02:20.989> that<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.799> you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
petal out then you take that and you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.210 
petal out then you take that and you
fold<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.549> together<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.530> don't<00:02:24.709> use<00:02:24.980> any

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
fold it together and I don't use any

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.800 
fold it together and I don't use any
glue<00:02:26.260> because<00:02:27.260> when<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.530> hot<00:02:27.920> glue<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.910> stays

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
glue because when I hot glue it it stays

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:38.020 
glue because when I hot glue it it stays
just<00:02:29.840> fine

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.750 

and<00:02:38.450> then<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.080> will<00:02:39.380> take<00:02:41.050> your<00:02:42.050> hot<00:02:42.440> glue<00:02:42.760> let

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
and then you will take your hot glue let

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.850 
and then you will take your hot glue let
me<00:02:43.820> just<00:02:44.090> put<00:02:44.360> some<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.930> middle<00:02:45.230> there<00:02:45.470> and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.390 

then<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.010> take<00:02:52.310> your<00:02:52.340> other<00:02:52.700> flower<00:02:54.280> let<00:02:55.280> me

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
then you take your other flower let me

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.860 
then you take your other flower let me
just<00:02:55.640> set<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.960> like<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:59.150> hot<00:02:59.450> so

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870
