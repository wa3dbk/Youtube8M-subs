 eleven tv series very happy very 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.920
 excited to be here with all the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.190
 actors and the production band about 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.760
 directors and my friends 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.080
 everything very well fernando the press 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.540
 we had after the conference 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.360
 we have the idea here is going to be almost 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.660
 almost a copy of I'm your fan to see this 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.790
 chapter we know that it is not a copy 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.710
 we know that it has a life of its own that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.900
 would you be from the public the reaction of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.500
 public before this new to this new 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.930
 series 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.930
 Well, I never use as a reference to 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.450
 your fan I worked with a base in Lyon that 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.730
 delivered and I discussed it with the 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.580
 directors who were going to perform their 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.780
 I work on this project so then 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.180
 certainly what what would be expected is 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.400
 that the public judges this project 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.480
 what I hope you try to compare with 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.340
 another thing 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.170
 as it approaches production 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.900
 to be integrated into the cast 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.570
 it seems to me that some people of canana 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.909
 they saw a movie that I'm in the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.930
 last year at the festival of Morelia that 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.180
 it's called tears 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.180
 and they really liked the work and I 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.180
 they called to do casting for the 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.910
 project and so I know that several 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.890
 castings until she finally 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.710
 they called to play the role 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.420
 of arturo mayer as you have felt in 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.920
 the project what has perhaps been the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.950
 main challenge that you have lived in the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.789
 project of this series 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.560
 well one of them maybe the biggest 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.560
 is to have shared scene with 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.610
 a lot of actors that I respect a lot 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.049
 for a long time because I've seen them 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.869
 both on stage and in movies 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.429
 or television and have the right now 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.110
 opportunity since I am the 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.159
 protagonist of having shared scene 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.299
 with almost all of them because he went to 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.500
 same time as a pleasure a great challenge 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.040
 finally you can give a greeting 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.410
 without explanation they are seeing right now 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.650
 yes, hello, I am Fernando 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.200
