00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
but yeah I don't feel he's as effective

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.770 
but yeah I don't feel he's as effective
why<00:03:52.049> he's<00:03:52.200> not<00:03:52.350> he's<00:03:52.890> iron<00:03:53.070> 86<00:03:53.609> rated<00:03:53.970> Robin<00:03:54.660> to

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
90 but feels not as effective he could

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.699 
90 but feels not as effective he could
sometimes<00:03:57.600> right<00:03:57.900> before<00:03:58.140> he<00:03:58.200> plays<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.500> left

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709

was actually giving some nice goals when
it<00:04:33.120> goes<00:04:33.270> I<00:04:33.300> think<00:04:33.569> it<00:04:33.689> was<00:04:33.780> this<00:04:33.870> game<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.229> I

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
it goes I think it was this game that I

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.300 
it goes I think it was this game that I
was<00:04:34.409> good<00:04:34.560> for<00:04:34.680> anyway

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
was good for anyway

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.040 
was good for anyway
but<00:04:35.849> basically<00:04:36.060> taught<00:04:36.509> them<00:04:36.599> come<00:04:36.750> back<00:04:36.900> into

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
but basically taught them come back into

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.899 
but basically taught them come back into
it<00:04:37.199> and<00:04:37.319> I<00:04:37.379> was<00:04:37.409> like<00:04:37.650> thinking<00:04:37.949> oh<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.550> hope

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
it and I was like thinking oh I hope

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.339 
it and I was like thinking oh I hope
they<00:04:39.000> come<00:04:39.120> back<00:04:39.300> in<00:04:39.449> so<00:04:39.569> it<00:04:39.629> might<00:04:39.750> be<00:04:39.870> fun

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
they come back in so it might be fun

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.709 
they come back in so it might be fun
and<00:04:40.680> then<00:04:40.860> um<00:04:41.069> they<00:04:41.939> sort<00:04:42.240> of<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.509> start

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:42.719 
and then um they sort of just start

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.330 
and then um they sort of just start
playing<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.169> coming<00:04:43.620> back<00:04:43.680> into<00:04:43.949> it<00:04:44.129> without

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
playing like coming back into it without

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.279 
playing like coming back into it without
me<00:04:44.580> having<00:04:44.879> much<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.539> say<00:04:45.780> in<00:04:45.930> it

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
they just kind of came back into it and

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.600 
they just kind of came back into it and
I<00:04:48.479> was<00:04:48.599> like<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:49.050> wasn't<00:04:49.919> actually<00:04:50.039> helping

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
I was like I wasn't actually helping

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.249 
I was like I wasn't actually helping
them<00:04:50.729> score<00:04:51.030> they<00:04:51.389> just<00:04:51.629> kind<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:51.990> scored

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
them score they just kind of scored

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.959 
them score they just kind of scored
which<00:04:53.069> can<00:04:53.250> bring<00:04:53.370> me<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.520> little<00:04:53.639> bit<00:04:53.759> nervous

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
which can bring me a little bit nervous

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.839 
which can bring me a little bit nervous
and<00:04:54.360> then<00:04:55.009> you<00:04:56.009> will<00:04:56.159> see<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.520> game<00:04:56.669> gets

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
and then you will see the game gets

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.830 
and then you will see the game gets
pretty<00:04:57.240> mental<00:04:57.719> at<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.930> end<00:04:59.449> shake<00:05:00.449> us<00:05:00.599> wiggle
