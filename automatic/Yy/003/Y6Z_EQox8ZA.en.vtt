00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi all guys be back in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.330
 this new gameplay video then today 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.120
 we're on assassin's creed and this time 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.490
 I present a gameplay where I destroy 2 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.559
 caglioni and boys was not much 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 difficult if I have to say why they were 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.810
 very very poor really thought 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.880
 they were much stronger but not at the end 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.010
 the technique is not to go in the middle 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.529
 to the two ships because otherwise they make you a 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.330
 double attack that ends up that you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.050
 they destroy both parts of the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.810
 ship 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 but it is true that I too have strengthened to the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.320
 up to my ship to make it right 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.410
 this battle I therefore did not have 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.390
 need no help and December ad 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.000
 example the fleet seem to me I don't know 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.149
 because I cracked the version and therefore 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.410
 I don't know if I can call my door 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.020
 for another Wednesday, however, the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.000
 secret first of all except for me and 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.940
 those of sticking the back of the ass 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.180
 really for hair it will provide legs and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.830
 most parts and also try to make a 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.870
 bit of attacks with 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.670
 then mortars anyway these ships have 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.860
 also a good technique that it would be 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.380
 the one to go around and try to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.960
 line up to lock yourself in one 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.820
 vice that is in this vice then not 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.400
 you can run away because in practice and 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.540
 they give you two cannon shots 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.930
 indeed 40 side guns each and no 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.750
 they do get out more easily anyway 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.430
 say for now and destroy one 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.830
 at the 9th time an example let's say that 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.479
 it's great advice is to 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.490
 both of them damage because otherwise 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.350
 if you concentrate on a ship, you can 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.360
 that the other person can 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.520
 take advantage of launching these two cannons 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.710
 that you don't even notice it then 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.810
 you find yourself without life and at the end 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.360
 that one will give him a shot that 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.390
 spur and you know that if a ship so of 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.150
 spur with the small ship so kids 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.090
 you don't have a lot of possibilities then 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.650
 here and they had taken a long tour and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.300
 so and visions of cutting a long one 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.190
 part for what the fuck they put us 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.989
 fifteen minutes to tour this 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.600
 I really liked it a lot 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.680
 because but I didn't make a killing with i 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.980
 guns rotating now here this part 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.500
 here you see this is the vice less 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.220
 I call the vise because now the cannon 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.690
 enemy with there behind me but attacks and 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.860
 It born of everything and like the other, however, are 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.800
 I could not resist fucking 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.600
 it could be resisted 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.140
 perhaps the armor would have been the crown lo 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.140
 metal digging he took let's say 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.440
 most choirs and and bodies and gods 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.300
 shots here guys roped what does what 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.380
 they make the two ships sync 11 between of 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.140
 them and it seems to me that you are going with her 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.660
 behind the sover in at least I think I don't know 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.730
 the fuck you watch what the fuck 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.500
 casina and however there are profits 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.650
 to launch mortars but they are not 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.270
 managed to do him great damage and 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.340
 so I decided to try again though 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.090
 this time I had to give a little bit 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.240
 more forward because they are let's say that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.150
 did not take the hit with mortars and 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.770
 so then here 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.910
 I try again to get that technique 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.850
 of the grip of turning around you go here 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:37.070
 why beautiful assholes but in the end this 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.070
 it is the part where I destroy 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.049
 the expected first the affair les me 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.189
 it seems in short at least this is the 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:49.350
 this clarification is the first one 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:51.690
 now it touches the other one since I also 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.480
 a lot of life I was expecting to 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.900
 have so much life with with this 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.880
 ship but maybe I will say it was the hull 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.860
 that it was beautiful armored that is the maximum 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.500
 you can see there are also cannons 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.120
 golden, however, it seems to me that the mortar 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.800
 they were bronze yet this is it 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.709
 the last shot seems to me that this one 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:21.239
 no to here the last part is beautiful 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.020
 look at the pedals and now we take 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.070
 the money that is ten thousand for one 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.810
 girls now look i do the last one 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.510
 shot compartment so I remained there 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.730
 shit anyway now with these 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.150
 last money and I just have that left 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:43.140
 send up the mortars that 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.050
 obviously I'm the last thing I have to do 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:50.550
 buy it seems you got mortar 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:53.550
 confirm and bo guys with this i have 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.530
 ship one hundred percent 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.530
 so thank you for giving this video 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.690
 if you want more gameplay because now 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.610
 I also unlocked the sword 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.410
 ap history then I will shortly be doing a 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.640
 gameplay rather especially for digit a 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.970
 assembly is then see you at 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.970
 passion
