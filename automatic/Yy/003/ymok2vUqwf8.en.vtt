 supersports at the time of that era 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.480
 in short, we loved 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.480

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.040

 today we are at the lido nereidi di nicola 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.550
 beautiful marine autumn afternoons 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.400
 to present a splendid motorcycle perhaps 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:38.430
 the most beautiful motorcycle of the 2000s la 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.890
 yamaha yz f 1000 r 1 of 1999 then the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.230
 first series the motorcycle strongly 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.630
 wanted to call to counteract the 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.180
 competition is designed and wanted e 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.060
 designed by the single engineer 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.890
 mi.va and the password of the team of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.960
 design of this beautiful motorcycle 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.790
 the race was uncompromising 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.560
 what did it mean without compromise in 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.590
 a real racing bike set up 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.510
 on the road without the compromises that 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.910
 at the time it was said that even today yes 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.700
 ie they make the bike frame lighter 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.190
 or we think of power, however, it is not 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.030
 think of nothing was a racing bike 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.480
 put on the motorcycle road from the line 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.140
 gorgeous beautiful looks drawn by 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.180
 wind a granite fork 41 mm 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.580
 298 mm brakes the engine was here 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.739
 revolution compared to its previous one 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.520
 that the very famous and that we already have 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.950
 presented yamaha fz r1000 xap the engine 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.140
 much smaller tight with i 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.130
 carburetors on the heads 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.360
 so it had this feature was 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.580
 particularly important in this 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.140
 way because it was an integral part of the 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.630
 so canvas is the engine was stressed and 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.010
 keep at a great rigidity 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.140
 chassis that was the feature 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.150
 principal of stability and by 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.910
 great handling of this 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.769
 beautiful brunette swinging arm with double 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.380
 aluminum trusses pivoted on 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.690
 splendid chassis with side members of 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.350
 extra long swingarm aluminum 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.840
 compared to the reduced length frame 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.630
 just to create this compromise of 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.170
 great rigidity and great stability la 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.140
 motorcycle had 150 horses at the wheel and already 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.270
 from 2,000 rpm it gave a power 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.280
 exciting an exceptional couple 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.740
 delight with which immediately they begin 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.560
 to challenge so many private pilots and seeds 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.960
 official in the races mainly the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.300
 workhorse of this fashion was 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.690
 endurance, in fact, many were made 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.160
 endurance tests officially with the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.170
 endurance is American and that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.590
 Australian is obviously another theater 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.890
 of great battles of the r1 tourist 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.890
 rose 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:14.640
 four inclined cylinders 16 valves 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.900
 xap valves really power 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.639
 let's say the bike is already full at 2,000 rpm 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.540
 will express began to give his shot to 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.360
 low speeds 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.810
 after the 5 thousand shoot ahead and then 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.280
 after of course it was a motorcycle that 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.560
 you really need to be a pilot 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.660
 experts and motorcyclists also of one 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.400
 unfortunately this is a great feeling 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.800
 this is especially the motorcycle 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.840
 first series, perhaps the most powerful one 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.740
 especially for those I have to in until 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.080
 2004 2005 and in short it was a motorcycle that 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.870
 you really had to be pilots 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.310
 experts because he had power 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.770
 exorbitant that then triggered one of the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.100
 adrenaline rushes to those who arrive on 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.979
 handlebar in hand so not not however 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.370
 you had to get caught 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:07.289
 in fact unfortunately some of them did 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.530
 bad experiences just because 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.940
 we approached this bike without it 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.400
 know what from what 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.280
 you bought things you went to 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.980
 charm was just owning an object 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.650
 detail of a beauty 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.200
 stratospheric but that was a motorcycle from 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.910
 made from a real track without like 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.740
 I said without compromise 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:35.170
 the euro series and that obviously means 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:37.360
 of racing r1 r6 and 7 then f6 600 of 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.400
 filter r7 the racing one for the 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.250
 world superbike approved in 500 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.810
 specimens certainly 150 infiltrators in all 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:50.200
 were your lives 500 thousand motorcycle ar 7 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.570
 I repeat it is a separate matter because the 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.080
 motorcycle with which he calls it disputed the 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.350
 world superbike is the heir of the 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.300
 chiana ovvi 0 juan 750 of displacement 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.160
 only 500 specimens causes the v 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.810
 of approval to be able to run between 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.390
 superbike is another matter 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.270
 strange said by what it cost so much 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.970
 I want to clarify that not like the 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.570
 he called in the 80s and 90s with the 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.210
 call fz r1000 rai company r600 that 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.860
 the 600 was derived from mine are two 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.650
 motorbikes and runes 36 different completions 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.290
 each assistant and they look alike 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.840
 a lot but the 1000 is a thing and ne 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.210
 took and is another we even say 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.940
 the evening we can compare a little like 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.860
 at the motobi of the sixties it was one 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:41.400
 motorcycle that is more approached the pilots 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.400
 private yamaha one races
