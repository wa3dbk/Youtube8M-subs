00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.810 
I think that you know they how would
they<00:02:15.840> will<00:02:16.020> have<00:02:16.170> huge<00:02:16.470> team<00:02:17.070> cohesion<00:02:17.340> at

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
they will have huge team cohesion at

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.490 
they will have huge team cohesion at
this<00:02:17.970> stage<00:02:18.210> they'll<00:02:18.750> obviously<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:19.080> carrying

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
this stage they'll obviously be carrying

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.350 
this stage they'll obviously be carrying
a<00:02:19.560> few<00:02:19.680> knocks<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.250> maybe<00:02:20.670> battered<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
a few knocks and maybe battered and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.180

it's<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.990> bit<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.560> change<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:35.130> think<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:35.520> our

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
it's a bit of a change I think all our

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.250 
it's a bit of a change I think all our
players<00:02:35.910> will<00:02:36.210> be<00:02:36.270> fresh<00:02:36.600> we're<00:02:36.930> excited

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
players will be fresh we're excited

we're looking forward to a big season
ahead<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.620> try<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:40.860> find<00:02:41.520> out<00:02:41.640> which<00:02:41.790> way

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
ahead and to try and find out which way

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.540 
ahead and to try and find out which way
is<00:02:42.000> better<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.420> suppose<00:02:42.600> it'll<00:02:43.380> tell<00:02:43.710> given<00:02:44.490> the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
is better I suppose it'll tell given the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.940 
is better I suppose it'll tell given the
end<00:02:44.700> result<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.360> weekend<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.080> think

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
that's certainly in the squad the middle

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
that's certainly in the squad the middle
everyone's<00:02:48.780> pause<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.260> we're<00:02:49.350> looking

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
hopefully we can get the result we want
