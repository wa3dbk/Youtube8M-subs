00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
happened was the yeah we lined up and

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.069 
happened was the yeah we lined up and
made<00:00:29.560> our<00:00:29.710> approach<00:00:30.040> and<00:00:30.820> took<00:00:31.360> quite<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.600> big<00:00:31.840> C

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
made our approach and took quite a big C

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.160 
made our approach and took quite a big C
on<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.349> outer<00:00:32.469> bye

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.639 

the<00:00:36.710> vessel<00:00:37.070> broached<00:00:37.370> quite<00:00:37.790> hard<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:38.649> took

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
the vessel broached quite hard and took

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.170 
the vessel broached quite hard and took
the<00:00:39.770> trawl<00:00:40.010> door<00:00:40.220> away<00:00:40.489> or<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.790> trawl<00:00:41.030> door

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
the trawl door away or the trawl door

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.030 
the trawl door away or the trawl door
actually<00:00:41.300> started<00:00:41.809> fishing<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.200> think<00:00:42.470> when

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
actually started fishing I think when

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.430 
actually started fishing I think when
the<00:00:43.129> vessel<00:00:43.399> laid<00:00:43.579> over<00:00:43.969> and<00:00:44.180> took<00:00:44.840> our<00:00:45.050> top

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
the vessel laid over and took our top

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.900 
the vessel laid over and took our top
and<00:00:45.590> bottom<00:00:45.620> bridles<00:00:46.250> with

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.850 

it<00:00:52.149> was<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.539> bit<00:00:52.750> hard<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.050> believe<00:00:53.350> for<00:00:53.590> a<00:00:53.620> start

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
it was a bit hard to believe for a start

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.830 
it was a bit hard to believe for a start
like<00:00:54.100> we<00:00:54.219> would<00:00:54.489> come<00:00:54.760> we<00:00:54.969> were<00:00:55.059> earn<00:00:55.270> we<00:00:55.660> was

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
like we would come we were earn we was

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.229 
like we would come we were earn we was
on<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.079> leads<00:00:56.440> we'd<00:00:56.920> had<00:00:57.070> but<00:00:57.699> it<00:00:57.940> had<00:00:58.090> been<00:00:58.210> a

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
on the leads we'd had but it had been a

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.939 
on the leads we'd had but it had been a
rough<00:00:58.449> crossing<00:00:58.960> but<00:00:59.110> it<00:00:59.230> was<00:00:59.379> it<00:00:59.649> was<00:00:59.800> nothing

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
rough crossing but it was it was nothing

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.569 
rough crossing but it was it was nothing
out<00:01:00.219> of<00:01:00.309> control<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:01.690> um<00:01:02.370> everything<00:01:03.370> sort<00:01:03.550> of

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
out of control but um everything sort of

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.710 
out of control but um everything sort of
happened<00:01:03.850> so<00:01:03.969> fast

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
happened so fast

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.899 
happened so fast
after<00:01:05.530> that<00:01:05.710> there<00:01:06.190> wasn't<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.490> great<00:01:06.610> deal<00:01:06.790> of

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
after that there wasn't a great deal of

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.219 
after that there wasn't a great deal of
time<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.210> reflect<00:01:07.390> on<00:01:07.600> at<00:01:07.750> all<00:01:07.899> it<00:01:08.110> was

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
time to reflect on at all it was

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.100 
time to reflect on at all it was
happening<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.680> was<00:01:08.800> just<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:10.659> happened<00:01:10.990> so

windows<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:15.440> by<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.800> time<00:02:16.040> we'd<00:02:16.220> actually

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
windows but by that time we'd actually

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.750 
windows but by that time we'd actually
got<00:02:17.330> round<00:02:17.569> our<00:02:18.140> head<00:02:18.440> back<00:02:18.709> into<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.160> sea<00:02:19.600> and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
got round our head back into the sea and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.880 
got round our head back into the sea and
at<00:02:22.760> when<00:02:23.540> we<00:02:23.690> broke<00:02:23.930> out<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.290> sea<00:02:24.500> there<00:02:24.709> we

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
at when we broke out to sea there we

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.160 
at when we broke out to sea there we
walked<00:02:25.370> through<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:26.390> windows<00:02:26.810> there<00:02:26.990> for

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
walked through the windows there for

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.690 
walked through the windows there for
about<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.350> quarter<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.770> an<00:02:27.860> hour<00:02:27.980> 20<00:02:28.430> minutes

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
about a quarter of an hour 20 minutes

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.360 
about a quarter of an hour 20 minutes
and<00:02:29.330> as<00:02:30.020> soon<00:02:30.200> as<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.410> see<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> wave<00:02:30.860> coming<00:02:31.130> over

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
and as soon as I see a wave coming over

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.800 
and as soon as I see a wave coming over
the<00:02:31.430> top<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.790> tell<00:02:31.970> him<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.120> get<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.390> edge<00:02:32.510> down

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the top I tell him to get the edge down

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.740 
the top I tell him to get the edge down
and<00:02:33.080> when<00:02:33.830> she<00:02:33.980> came<00:02:34.130> over<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.459> top<00:02:34.700> I'd<00:02:35.450> get

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
and when she came over the top I'd get

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.590 
and when she came over the top I'd get
my<00:02:35.900> head<00:02:36.140> down<00:02:36.250> but<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:38.030> amount<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.390> force

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
my head down but the the amount of force

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.050 
my head down but the the amount of force
to<00:02:38.750> be<00:02:38.810> used<00:02:38.840> we'd<00:02:39.410> actually<00:02:40.130> quite<00:02:40.700> actually

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
to be used we'd actually quite actually

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.300 
to be used we'd actually quite actually
pulled<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.840> console<00:02:42.350> away<00:02:42.769> from<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.100> front

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
pulled the console away from the front

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.190 
pulled the console away from the front
of<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.459> wheelhouse<00:02:43.690> by<00:02:44.690> about<00:02:44.930> two<00:02:45.170> inches

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
of the wheelhouse by about two inches

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.900 
of the wheelhouse by about two inches
and<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.410> just<00:02:48.620> sat<00:02:48.769> out<00:02:48.920> there<00:02:49.070> for<00:02:49.160> another<00:02:49.370> 24

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
and we just sat out there for another 24

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.690 
and we just sat out there for another 24
hours<00:02:50.150> until<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.870> came<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.280> next<00:02:52.430> day

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.009 
hours until we came in and the next day
it<00:02:52.760> was<00:02:52.820> just<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.150> long<00:02:53.360> greasy<00:02:54.170> swell<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:56.019> it

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
it was just a long greasy swell and it

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.930 
it was just a long greasy swell and it
was<00:02:57.170> quite<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.440> joy<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.739> put<00:02:58.040> my<00:02:58.160> feet<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:58.400> me<00:02:58.790> and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
cross and I was planning to be very

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.550

wall for the thing that did it totally

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.129 
wall for the thing that did it totally
out<00:05:33.360> of<00:05:33.479> control

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 
across that bar I feel a lot more

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:01.829 
across that bar I feel a lot more
confident<00:05:56.409> about<00:05:56.559> it<00:05:59.729> the<00:06:00.729> more<00:06:01.179> I<00:06:01.239> cross<00:06:01.629> it

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:01.839 
confident about it the more I cross it

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.929 
confident about it the more I cross it
the<00:06:01.959> more<00:06:02.139> I'm<00:06:02.319> determined<00:06:03.219> not<00:06:03.429> to<00:06:03.759> have

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:03.939

oh<00:06:08.639> well<00:06:09.639> basically<00:06:10.269> like<00:06:10.449> I<00:06:10.479> said<00:06:10.809> I<00:06:10.839> made<00:06:11.139> a

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
oh well basically like I said I made a

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.629 
oh well basically like I said I made a
mistake<00:06:11.259> oh<00:06:11.860> I<00:06:11.889> really<00:06:12.399> wanted<00:06:12.699> to<00:06:12.759> go

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.740 

we<00:06:17.509> approached<00:06:17.840> about<00:06:18.169> two<00:06:18.620> hours<00:06:18.889> before<00:06:19.750> the

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
we approached about two hours before the

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.570 
we approached about two hours before the
top<00:06:20.990> of<00:06:21.139> the<00:06:21.229> tide<00:06:21.470> we<00:06:21.949> knew<00:06:22.099> it<00:06:22.220> was<00:06:22.340> going<00:06:22.520> to

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
top of the tide we knew it was going to

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:29.950 
top of the tide we knew it was going to
be<00:06:22.900> touch<00:06:23.900> and<00:06:23.930> go<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:29.210> a<00:06:29.330> look<00:06:29.509> didn't<00:06:29.840> like

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
be touch and go and a look didn't like

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.230 
be touch and go and a look didn't like
the<00:06:30.110> look<00:06:30.259> of<00:06:30.409> it<00:06:30.620> so<00:06:30.830> we<00:06:31.430> steamed<00:06:31.729> out<00:06:31.879> another

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
the look of it so we steamed out another

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.540 
the look of it so we steamed out another
mile<00:06:32.509> or<00:06:32.689> two<00:06:32.930> back<00:06:33.889> to<00:06:34.039> safe<00:06:34.280> water<00:06:35.259> and

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
mile or two back to safe water and

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.760 
mile or two back to safe water and
basically<00:06:37.550> thought<00:06:37.909> rodeo<00:06:38.560> after<00:06:39.560> an<00:06:39.620> hour

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
basically thought rodeo after an hour

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.800 
basically thought rodeo after an hour
and<00:06:39.800> a<00:06:39.979> half<00:06:40.159> we've<00:06:40.819> got<00:06:41.060> half<00:06:41.300> an<00:06:41.479> hour<00:06:41.569> before

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
and a half we've got half an hour before

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.020 
and a half we've got half an hour before
the<00:06:42.020> tide<00:06:42.319> is<00:06:42.500> going<00:06:42.710> to<00:06:42.770> start<00:06:43.460> heaving<00:06:43.699> we've

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
the tide is going to start heaving we've

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.640 
the tide is going to start heaving we've
got<00:06:44.210> to<00:06:44.300> go<00:06:44.419> in<00:06:44.539> a<00:06:44.599> bit<00:06:44.750> closer<00:06:45.020> and<00:06:45.289> have<00:06:45.409> one

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
got to go in a bit closer and have one

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.510 
got to go in a bit closer and have one
more<00:06:45.800> look<00:06:47.620> so<00:06:48.620> we<00:06:48.800> got<00:06:48.949> in<00:06:49.069> a<00:06:49.159> bit<00:06:49.280> close<00:06:49.969> and

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
more look so we got in a bit close and

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.209 
more look so we got in a bit close and
like<00:06:52.520> I<00:06:52.580> said<00:06:52.909> one<00:06:53.150> of<00:06:53.180> the<00:06:53.389> big<00:06:53.930> green<00:06:54.919> waves

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:55.219 
like I said one of the big green waves

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:57.760 
like I said one of the big green waves
was<00:06:55.550> coming<00:06:55.879> in<00:06:56.000> behind<00:06:56.419> us<00:06:56.509> and<00:06:56.719> I<00:06:57.020> didn't<00:06:57.590> see

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
was coming in behind us and I didn't see

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.209 
was coming in behind us and I didn't see
it<00:06:58.419> as<00:06:59.419> it<00:06:59.690> was<00:06:59.840> the<00:07:00.080> first<00:07:00.349> one<00:07:00.560> went<00:07:00.830> under<00:07:01.099> us

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:01.219 
it as it was the first one went under us

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:05.569 
we went up on the top of it and slid

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.360 
we went up on the top of it and slid
down<00:07:05.780> the<00:07:05.870> back<00:07:06.110> of<00:07:06.289> it<00:07:06.440> and<00:07:06.469> I<00:07:06.710> was<00:07:06.889> holding<00:07:07.129> my
