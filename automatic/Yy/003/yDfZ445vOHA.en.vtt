00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.489
 other files will contain this m2 folder 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.180
 there would be no other files 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.370
 take this folder that r2 you go 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.789
 in back computer local disk c 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.039
 x86 programs and move them inside 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:59.250
 or programs looks like wired.it ok 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.469
 once done, shut up 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.339
 according to link description that will vote 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.409
 This page always do download now

 be download the installer will install 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.870
 game you have it ok 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.360
 will ask us to select the folder 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:24.090
 where to install the game it did 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.840
 bros computer local disk c programs 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 x6 and find the folder and ev ii 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.000
 we click once and we make silences 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.759
 of the folder and then install once 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.130
 that we have also done this step 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:44.300
 we always have a drain computer 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:50.580
 several future programs 6 mv 2 and up 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:53.340
 lounge i v4r we do right click of 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.320
 link and move it to the desktop 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.820
 for those horses 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.640
 at this point all that remains is a 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.460
 register on the site of ford earth hour 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:09.200
 that's what crack offers us 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.200
 so actually web we go to register 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.820
 enter your expectations here 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.800
 made from the agri and then here ingest the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.900
 your data 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.590
 once this is done for the first time 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.750
 once you have the game with 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.000
 the other on the desktop will ask you to 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.930
 enter username and password which 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.180
 you used on ford and high one then on 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.700
 that site insert sanremo with the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.170
 which you want to play then yours 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.650
 first name 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.709
 after which the game will be ready and there 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.900
 you can play safely though 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.170
 unfortunately British air because for two square meters 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.270
 there is an Italian crack already a 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.850
 approach in Italian 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.810
 so the young Englishman, however, is a lot 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.390
 thick 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.620
 so now I step between xvi wind like 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.290
 usual for is the expression of 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.209
 gameplay ok guys here we are on cod 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.060
 then first go to options 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.310
 and adjust the video settings a 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.209
 depending on your pc so if you have a 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.580
 more advanced pc you could put in a 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.650
 setting how I did the game 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.280
 however quite old therefore also 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.640
 PCs that aren't really the newest 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.430
 should be able to support it let's go 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.110
 on server browsers find a server ed 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.150
 we enter one of these here at random but not 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.160
 make home as a game because I have it 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.410
 played this game only once 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.170
 that is, before I played two games this is 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.519
 the second is therefore not a gameplay it is 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.130
 was to show you that the game 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:51.770
 really works 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:53.870
 so I would say to take this 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:04:00.290
 however the graphics despite being of a 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:02.480
 old and very good game this is 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.030
 37 now I don't know why this is the card 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.550
 like a pig I said the graphics are a lot 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.030
 good for asserting a game so- so 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.030
 old 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.789
 but what is the minimum minimum 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.250
 ok the commands are put a little strange there 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.760
 for real they were strange for me 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.330
 because I play so a little show 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.610
 with the commands a bit married, however, from the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.320
 options you can easily adjust 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.600
 at your leisure 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.740
 ah well meanwhile figures of shit on figures 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.740
 shit now the pump case 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:05:00.430
 Now let's see if I can do something 

00:04:52.929 --> 00:05:05.259
 decent thing the fuck did 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:09.639
 but the game is right and so is English 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:16.260
 but you understand very well what you want 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:20.490
 file and pass but I saw someone 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.630
 but this is what I wanted to talk to you about 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.490
 there was a small bug 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.320
 now it would have been safe for me here 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.710
 so I can talk there is a small one 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.370
 bug that when you run then keep 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.650
 pressed shift and try admire not there 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.110
 will invite the beat well do not lower me 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.960
 but in fact if you want to serve I am here 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.400
 the calvin aims because if you want it has you 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:49.080
 pressed shift does not aim you have to leave it 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:53.870
 and then turn then little this small 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:57.980
 bug I hope there isn't too much 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.790
 of cech and broader view too 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.770
 anyway if something doesn't work 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.400
 write it in the comments 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:08.150
 I will answer you in my possibilities 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.360
 let's say that is why she blake her 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.550
 these epic shit figures would say that 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.450
 then dagger bruised can suffice 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.930
 all 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.930
 hello everyone guys
