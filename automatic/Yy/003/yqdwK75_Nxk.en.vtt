 increasingly more and the second team are in the 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.629
 finding phase 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:06.490
 Euro and the Triba and Darmstadt 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.159
 known is super strong 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:10.009
 times great 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
 still blocked and there was a July on 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:19.050
 the last three home games in seven points for Darmstadt including a 1 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.050
 0 victory in Wiesbaden 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.630
 the Darmstädter a huge backlog to the finish and that's Preston 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.029
 Cinema 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.529
 An American who likes to pass the movement past chairs 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.730
 Whitsun active 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.560
 above Murray comes to yards but in the end one is at the baseline 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.559
 Steinmeier 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.630
 Weidlich explained now that Proll does the truth 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.920
 Andrews continues free kick Boliden Italy 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 we have another evening in Berlin 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.790
 up to 2 votes Morabito is counting 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.720
 let's say 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 until the 10th 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.300
 For a success urgently needed first Bouma screamed the elbow 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.890
 Mose Red's face does not appear to have been seen by Referee Robert 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.880
 Hartmann then Drexler purposely booked out the booked trip of the Trebbiner 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.460
 In Bahrain everything was just about the intentionally monthly twice luck 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.510
 done here 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.210
 they were allowed to continue with eleven players 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.700
 39 flights are the poet's 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 enter the ICE 3 there is the 1 0 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.400
 We also offer Marcel Reichwein the aggression he has 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.179
 took 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.480
 in the stadium 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.070
 Relief took 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 now with only 29 minutes again a goal 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.710
 the Essenes must now she is up again 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.210
 Cohn-Bendit 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.370
 what's happened 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.800
 continue 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.250
 at 4 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.470
 Hanover 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.790
 a letter click here 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.620
 now the chicks hatch 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.150
 Darmstadt by no means lovable and what young people substitute that 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
 then goes well Erfurt defense is a lot of fun 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:15.139
 Heinsberg district 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.909
 come from Mainz 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.539
 wonders about this gate 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:19.959
 first learn 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.949
 obviously 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.379
 is expected louder 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.069
 he's behind 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.969
 who else? 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.969
 fast stays at home and 4 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.659
 the two were once more intense than we were 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.889
 the 41 minutes of play Smail Morabit the 13 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.429
 and yet he is confident 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:54.289
 made strong gigs changer in the mutated with the new virus 60 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.559
 the captain crowd favorite on the lawn sown in the stands 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.400
 in the portfolio we are winners 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.220
 four times André long left but that says he has her partner in the stadium 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.409
 summa summed up for the first time ever 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.640
 he sees the title of Heineken Berger in the second half 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:21.599
 and good to see 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.029
 Who here more off or Til Schweiger a pils for the creation of the district 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:27.459
 with the left knee 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.039
 Even without the injured image of the institution always dangerous there were probably 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:37.079
 also the second goal Dominik Drexler in the back of Halak St to EUR 70 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.199
 like Ernst Zimmermann makes himself big 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.199
 modern goalkeeper game 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:46.879
 79 rose 7 percent 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.180
 Just oil the ball forward on Morabit as the tempers go and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.760
 Keyssner Mobulu Bern equal two 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.449
 difficult task he solves the years before the Blake Lively 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:58.399
 that 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:01.399
 the 13th 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.569
 79 so minute and one receives all the congratulations us-marine Morabit's 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.489
 ex-Brunswick's best man on the court 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.649
 To offer Vienna as a striker was a good idea from Emmerling and Geiger Sum 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.139
 The ball somehow Ernst Zimmermann over 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.189
 after his four goals in the red and white jersey 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.909
 Markus Hörwick of the CAC 40 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.159
 Rolf Henkel goalkeeper 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.889
 here in Erfurt and the next victory is retracted the question was only 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.749
 Bloodless also in the fourth home game without conceding the answer stay in the 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:44.709
 ninetieth minute probably smarter 12 only the post for Darmstadt was here 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 more in it but Erfurt won 2 1 2 0 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:54.119
 the few changes are only professionals loving
