00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
night while it's still fresh in my head

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.150 
night while it's still fresh in my head
so<00:00:15.330> basically<00:00:16.330> I<00:00:16.450> really<00:00:17.080> liked<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:17.619> k-12<00:00:18.040> I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
so basically I really liked the k-12 I

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.409 
so basically I really liked the k-12 I
really<00:00:18.430> did<00:00:18.550> it<00:00:18.730> was<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:20.410> was<00:00:20.619> an<00:00:20.739> interesting

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419 
really did it was it was an interesting

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.639 
really did it was it was an interesting
change<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:23.759> not<00:00:24.759> have<00:00:24.970> an<00:00:25.090> amp<00:00:25.329> onstage<00:00:26.200> but<00:00:26.559> to

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:26.649 
change to not have an amp onstage but to

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.030 
change to not have an amp onstage but to
have<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:28.630> know<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.750> speaker<00:00:29.320> with<00:00:30.009> a

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
have you know a speaker with a

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.549 
have you know a speaker with a
completely<00:00:30.790> different<00:00:31.149> profile<00:00:31.930> about<00:00:32.259> how

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
completely different profile about how

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.700 
completely different profile about how
it<00:00:33.010> deals<00:00:33.399> with<00:00:33.550> sound<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:35.200> I<00:00:35.230> mean<00:00:35.500> by<00:00:35.680> that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
it deals with sound what I mean by that

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.210 
it deals with sound what I mean by that
is<00:00:36.160> that<00:00:36.880> the<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:38.230> k-series<00:00:38.680> speakers

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
is that the that the k-series speakers

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.720 
is that the that the k-series speakers
spray<00:00:39.730> with<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.690> 75<00:00:41.290> degree<00:00:41.500> angle<00:00:42.190> right<00:00:42.340> so

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
spray with a 75 degree angle right so

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.940 
spray with a 75 degree angle right so
you've<00:00:42.850> got<00:00:43.030> a<00:00:43.060> lot<00:00:43.450> got<00:00:44.290> kind<00:00:44.560> of<00:00:44.590> a<00:00:44.710> wide

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
you've got a lot got kind of a wide

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.640 
you've got a lot got kind of a wide
spray<00:00:45.430> they're<00:00:45.990> really<00:00:46.990> used<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.290> having<00:00:47.350> an

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
spray they're really used to having an

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.690 
spray they're really used to having an
amp<00:00:47.829> that<00:00:48.430> sits<00:00:48.730> directly<00:00:48.970> behind<00:00:49.360> me<00:00:49.600> onstage

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
amp that sits directly behind me onstage

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.819 
amp that sits directly behind me onstage
and<00:00:51.700> kind<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.420> sprays<00:00:52.690> out<00:00:52.810> in<00:00:52.990> one<00:00:53.230> direction

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
and kind of sprays out in one direction

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.690 
and kind of sprays out in one direction
and<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:56.500> kind<00:00:56.770> of<00:00:56.890> you<00:00:57.250> know<00:00:57.280> we<00:00:57.550> make

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
and we kind of you know we make

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.780 
and we kind of you know we make
adjustments<00:00:57.820> based<00:00:58.420> on<00:00:58.660> that<00:00:59.130> and<00:01:00.130> it's<00:01:00.340> not

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
adjustments based on that and it's not

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.850 
adjustments based on that and it's not
always<00:01:01.000> an<00:01:01.210> ideal<00:01:01.480> situation<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:02.410> what<00:01:02.829> I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
always an ideal situation and what I

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.249 
always an ideal situation and what I
really<00:01:03.220> liked<00:01:03.520> about<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:04.030> k-12<00:01:04.239> was<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:05.079> it

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
really liked about the k-12 was that it

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.330 
really liked about the k-12 was that it
was<00:01:05.379> on<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.530> other<00:01:05.710> side<00:01:05.829> of<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.130> stage

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
was on the other side of the stage

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.480 
was on the other side of the stage
behind<00:01:07.000> Justin<00:01:07.840> because<00:01:08.530> there<00:01:08.770> was<00:01:08.950> no<00:01:09.220> other

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
behind Justin because there was no other

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
behind Justin because there was no other
place<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:09.940> put<00:01:10.360> it

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
place to put it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.080 
place to put it
last<00:01:11.740> night<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:13.600> arrived<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:15.370> wasn't

last night when I arrived so I wasn't
standing<00:01:16.390> in<00:01:16.600> front<00:01:16.750> of<00:01:16.870> it<00:01:17.050> but<00:01:17.440> I<00:01:17.470> could

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
standing in front of it but I could

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.610 
standing in front of it but I could
still<00:01:17.950> hear<00:01:18.010> it<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:19.600> had<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.840> really<00:01:20.350> really

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
still hear it it had a really really

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.060 
still hear it it had a really really
nice<00:01:21.450> round<00:01:22.590> beefy<00:01:23.590> bass<00:01:23.890> tone<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
nice round beefy bass tone to it and

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.370 
nice round beefy bass tone to it and
more<00:01:27.640> importantly<00:01:28.150> even<00:01:28.750> at<00:01:28.930> higher<00:01:30.030> gain<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
more importantly even at higher gain it

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.100 
more importantly even at higher gain it
was<00:01:32.560> super<00:01:32.890> clean<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.430> mean<00:01:34.030> super<00:01:34.540> clean<00:01:34.780> there

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
was super clean I mean super clean there

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.210 
was super clean I mean super clean there
were<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.229> couple<00:01:35.320> times<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.710> wondered<00:01:36.040> whether

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
were a couple times I wondered whether

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.870 
were a couple times I wondered whether
it<00:01:36.310> was<00:01:36.490> even<00:01:36.729> on<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:39.310> me<00:01:39.460> those<00:01:39.580> are<00:01:39.760> all

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
it was even on so to me those are all

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.580 
it was even on so to me those are all
pluses<00:01:40.119> there<00:01:40.450> was<00:01:40.540> only<00:01:40.659> one<00:01:40.900> thing<00:01:41.110> I<00:01:41.260> didn't

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
pluses there was only one thing I didn't

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.100 
pluses there was only one thing I didn't
like<00:01:41.650> about<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.979> without<00:01:42.970> anything<00:01:43.330> in<00:01:43.750> the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
like about it without anything in the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.200 
like about it without anything in the
front<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:44.619> didn't<00:01:44.950> run<00:01:45.190> anything<00:01:46.000> between

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
front and I didn't run anything between

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.730 
front and I didn't run anything between
my<00:01:46.990> bass<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:48.400> speaker<00:01:48.790> last<00:01:49.180> night<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
my bass and the speaker last night it

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.640 
my bass and the speaker last night it
lacked<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.220> little<00:01:51.369> bit<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:52.260> high-end<00:01:53.260> attack

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
lacked a little bit of high-end attack

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.020 
lacked a little bit of high-end attack
okay<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:55.770> when<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:56.799> really<00:01:57.100> wanted<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.430> get<00:01:57.700> some

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
okay so when I really wanted to get some

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.630 
okay so when I really wanted to get some
some<00:01:58.869> real<00:01:59.140> punch<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:02.710> like<00:02:03.220> if<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.490> was

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
some real punch in the like if I was

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.070 
some real punch in the like if I was
soloing<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.939> wasn't<00:02:07.299> there<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.750> if<00:02:07.869> you

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
soloing that wasn't there and if you

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.830 
soloing that wasn't there and if you
were<00:02:08.229> slapping<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:09.189> popping<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:10.330> high-end

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
were slapping and popping that high-end

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.470 
were slapping and popping that high-end
you<00:02:11.959> would<00:02:12.110> need<00:02:12.580> wasn't<00:02:13.580> quite<00:02:13.730> there<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:14.330> I

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
you would need wasn't quite there if I

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.680 
you would need wasn't quite there if I
did<00:02:14.629> it<00:02:14.720> again<00:02:15.019> would<00:02:16.360> either<00:02:17.360> put<00:02:17.660> a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
did it again would either put a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.390 
did it again would either put a
compressor<00:02:18.290> or<00:02:18.620> an<00:02:18.980> EQ<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.730> between<00:02:21.190> my<00:02:22.190> bass

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
compressor or an EQ in between my bass

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.400 
compressor or an EQ in between my bass
and<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.940> speaker<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.750> would<00:02:24.290> have

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
and the speaker and that would have

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.280 
and the speaker and that would have
solved<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> problem<00:02:25.069> completely<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.420> this

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
solved the problem completely so this

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.830 
solved the problem completely so this
little<00:02:28.040> bit<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.910> know<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.360> an<00:02:29.510> attack

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
little bit of a you know of an attack

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.309 
little bit of a you know of an attack
difference<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:31.040> isn't<00:02:31.610> necessarily<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.569> reason

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
difference it isn't necessarily a reason

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.559 
difference it isn't necessarily a reason
that<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.470> wouldn't<00:02:33.799> use<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.340> series<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
that I wouldn't use the series the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.210 
that I wouldn't use the series the
loudspeaker<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.620> actually<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:36.980> really

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
loudspeaker is actually a really

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.960 
loudspeaker is actually a really
interesting<00:02:37.340> idea<00:02:38.330> for<00:02:38.629> musicians<00:02:39.910> for<00:02:40.910> a

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
interesting idea for musicians for a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.449 
interesting idea for musicians for a
couple<00:02:41.209> reasons<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.750> first<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:43.280> was

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
couple reasons the first is that it was

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.000 
couple reasons the first is that it was
really<00:02:43.760> easy<00:02:43.940> load-in<00:02:44.450> okay<00:02:45.140> there's<00:02:45.650> no<00:02:45.769> head

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
really easy load-in okay there's no head

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.100 
really easy load-in okay there's no head
to<00:02:46.160> deal<00:02:46.310> with<00:02:46.549> everything<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.750> need<00:02:47.780> in

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
to deal with everything that you need in

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.170 
to deal with everything that you need in
terms<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.650> connections<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.430> on<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.819> back<00:02:49.970> of

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
terms of connections is on the back of

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.130 
terms of connections is on the back of
the<00:02:50.239> speaker<00:02:50.450> we<00:02:50.780> went<00:02:50.959> over<00:02:51.140> those<00:02:51.260> earlier

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
the speaker we went over those earlier

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.920 
the speaker we went over those earlier
so<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.680> was<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.370> was<00:02:55.400> really<00:02:55.790> easy<00:02:55.970> right

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
so it was a it was really easy right

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.050 
so it was a it was really easy right
