00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
let's talk a little bit about the finish

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.950 
let's talk a little bit about the finish
for<00:00:06.950> our<00:00:07.040> little<00:00:07.220> ghost<00:00:07.460> here<00:00:07.759> honestly<00:00:08.210> you

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
for our little ghost here honestly you

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.660 
for our little ghost here honestly you
could<00:00:09.139> use<00:00:09.260> just<00:00:09.530> about<00:00:09.679> anything<00:00:10.130> if<00:00:10.550> you

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
could use just about anything if you

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.520 
could use just about anything if you
like<00:00:10.849> oils<00:00:11.240> go<00:00:11.420> ahead<00:00:11.570> and<00:00:11.719> use<00:00:11.809> an<00:00:11.959> oil<00:00:12.169> if<00:00:12.410> you

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
like oils go ahead and use an oil if you

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.959 
like oils go ahead and use an oil if you
like<00:00:12.679> a<00:00:12.709> varnish<00:00:13.009> go<00:00:13.579> ahead<00:00:13.730> and<00:00:13.849> use<00:00:13.940> a

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
like a varnish go ahead and use a

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.000 
like a varnish go ahead and use a
varnish<00:00:14.450> water-based<00:00:14.990> whatever<00:00:15.349> you<00:00:15.499> want<00:00:15.769> I

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
varnish water-based whatever you want I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.680 
varnish water-based whatever you want I
don't<00:00:16.490> see<00:00:16.580> any<00:00:16.730> reason<00:00:17.119> why<00:00:17.240> this<00:00:17.300> particular

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
don't see any reason why this particular

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.510 
don't see any reason why this particular
thing<00:00:18.140> needs<00:00:18.350> to<00:00:18.440> be<00:00:18.530> food<00:00:18.860> safe<00:00:19.100> because

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
thing needs to be food safe because

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.280 
thing needs to be food safe because
although<00:00:20.150> you<00:00:20.330> may<00:00:20.480> be<00:00:20.510> putting<00:00:20.780> candy<00:00:21.200> in

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
although you may be putting candy in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.160 
although you may be putting candy in
there<00:00:21.470> it's<00:00:21.590> gonna<00:00:21.710> be<00:00:21.890> either<00:00:22.040> hard<00:00:22.370> candy<00:00:22.760> or

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
there it's gonna be either hard candy or

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.050 
there it's gonna be either hard candy or
pre-wrapped<00:00:24.170> candy<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:24.950> if<00:00:25.520> food<00:00:25.670> exposure

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
pre-wrapped candy so if food exposure

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.210 
pre-wrapped candy so if food exposure
really<00:00:26.420> isn't<00:00:26.540> much<00:00:26.750> of<00:00:26.930> a<00:00:26.990> concern<00:00:27.170> for<00:00:27.860> me<00:00:28.010> a

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
really isn't much of a concern for me a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.250 
really isn't much of a concern for me a
decent<00:00:28.520> durable<00:00:29.240> finish<00:00:29.390> that<00:00:29.690> dries<00:00:29.870> quickly

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
decent durable finish that dries quickly

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.979 
decent durable finish that dries quickly
is<00:00:30.590> going<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.040> be<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.280> key<00:00:31.430> because<00:00:31.820> I<00:00:32.480> may

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
is going to be the key because I may

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.049 
is going to be the key because I may
make<00:00:33.170> multiples<00:00:33.710> of<00:00:33.829> these<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.309> if<00:00:34.700> I<00:00:34.850> do<00:00:34.910> I

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
make multiples of these and if I do I

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.370 
make multiples of these and if I do I
want<00:00:35.420> to<00:00:35.450> make<00:00:35.570> sure<00:00:35.629> that<00:00:35.960> I<00:00:36.020> could<00:00:36.170> spray

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
want to make sure that I could spray

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.680 
want to make sure that I could spray
them<00:00:36.620> all<00:00:36.800> with<00:00:37.550> finish<00:00:37.880> get<00:00:38.210> them<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.480> dry

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
them all with finish get them to dry

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.200 
them all with finish get them to dry
really<00:00:38.960> quickly<00:00:39.130> oil-based<00:00:40.130> finishes<00:00:40.460> it

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
really quickly oil-based finishes it

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.700 
really quickly oil-based finishes it
takes<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.570> couple<00:00:41.720> days<00:00:41.840> right<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:42.440> know<00:00:42.530> to

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
takes a couple days right you know to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.920 
takes a couple days right you know to
get<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.950> finish<00:00:43.100> on<00:00:43.340> there<00:00:43.550> let<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.790> dry<00:00:44.120> sand

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
get the finish on there let it dry sand

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.170 
get the finish on there let it dry sand
it<00:00:45.079> back<00:00:45.260> you<00:00:45.920> know<00:00:46.040> and<00:00:46.340> this<00:00:46.460> process<00:00:46.730> takes

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
it back you know and this process takes

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.729 
it back you know and this process takes
a<00:00:47.300> couple<00:00:47.329> days<00:00:47.630> well<00:00:48.050> if<00:00:48.350> you're<00:00:48.500> trying<00:00:48.590> to

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
a couple days well if you're trying to

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:49.990 
a couple days well if you're trying to
get<00:00:48.890> through<00:00:49.040> these<00:00:49.190> things<00:00:49.399> in<00:00:49.520> a<00:00:49.579> weekend

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
get through these things in a weekend

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.150 
get through these things in a weekend
that<00:00:50.630> can<00:00:50.870> be<00:00:50.989> kind<00:00:51.230> of<00:00:51.290> an<00:00:51.410> inconvenience<00:00:51.649> so

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
that can be kind of an inconvenience so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.130 
that can be kind of an inconvenience so
a<00:00:52.190> quick<00:00:52.550> drying<00:00:52.850> finish<00:00:53.239> is<00:00:53.390> great<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:53.840> these

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
a quick drying finish is great and these

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.870 
a quick drying finish is great and these
water-based<00:00:54.680> varnishes<00:00:55.190> these<00:00:55.370> days<00:00:55.579> are

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
water-based varnishes these days are

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.760 
water-based varnishes these days are
really<00:00:56.420> really<00:00:56.660> good<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.200> that's<00:00:57.470> what<00:00:57.680> I'm

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
really really good so that's what I'm

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.710 
really really good so that's what I'm
gonna<00:00:57.890> go<00:00:58.100> for<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.579> I'll<00:00:59.329> probably<00:00:59.480> just

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
gonna go for and I'll probably just

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.330 
gonna go for and I'll probably just
spray<00:00:59.930> out<00:01:00.079> in<00:01:00.200> my<00:01:00.320> driveway<00:01:00.590> on<00:01:00.980> some<00:01:01.160> salt

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
spray out in my driveway on some salt

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.580 
spray out in my driveway on some salt
horses<00:01:01.700> now<00:01:02.540> if<00:01:02.750> you've<00:01:02.899> used<00:01:03.079> water-based

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
horses now if you've used water-based

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.259 
horses now if you've used water-based
finishes<00:01:03.920> before<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:04.519> know<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.670> as<00:01:04.909> soon<00:01:05.119> as

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
finishes before you know that as soon as

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.510 
finishes before you know that as soon as
that<00:01:05.390> material<00:01:05.509> hits<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.350> wood<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:07.340> wood

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
that material hits the wood and the wood

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.910 
that material hits the wood and the wood
dries<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:08.210> gets<00:01:08.600> really<00:01:08.930> rough<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.560> want

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
dries it gets really rough so you want

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.730 
dries it gets really rough so you want
to<00:01:09.979> pre<00:01:10.190> raise<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.610> grain<00:01:11.200> by<00:01:12.200> spraying<00:01:12.530> it

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
to pre raise the grain by spraying it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.370 
to pre raise the grain by spraying it
with<00:01:12.770> some<00:01:13.430> water<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:16.720> just<00:01:17.720> use<00:01:17.870> a<00:01:17.900> spray

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
with some water I just use a spray

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:27.330 
with some water I just use a spray
bottle<00:01:19.780> give<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:20.930> good<00:01:21.049> soak

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.569 

and<00:01:28.340> come<00:01:28.520> back<00:01:28.640> with<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.880> paper<00:01:29.119> towel<00:01:30.579> and

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
and come back with a paper towel and

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.090 
and come back with a paper towel and
wipe<00:01:31.970> up<00:01:32.149> all<00:01:32.299> that<00:01:32.509> extra<00:01:32.899> stuff<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:33.890> don't

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
wipe up all that extra stuff you don't

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.370 
wipe up all that extra stuff you don't
really<00:01:34.280> want<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:34.700> pull<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.299> much<00:01:35.509> but<00:01:35.750> you

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
really want it to pull so much but you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.889 
really want it to pull so much but you
just<00:01:36.560> want<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:36.860> saturated<00:01:37.369> briefly<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.180> then

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
just want it saturated briefly and then

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.529 
just want it saturated briefly and then
dry<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.590> off<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.820> what<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.210> will<00:01:41.360> do<00:01:41.509> is

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
dry it off and what that will do is

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.020 
dry it off and what that will do is
raise<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.590> grain<00:01:42.829> for<00:01:43.159> us<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:43.490> we<00:01:43.610> can<00:01:43.759> stand

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
raise that grain for us so we can stand

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.889 
raise that grain for us so we can stand
it<00:01:44.119> one<00:01:44.360> more<00:01:44.539> time<00:01:45.039> back<00:01:46.039> with<00:01:46.310> maybe<00:01:46.789> 220<00:01:47.179> 180

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
it one more time back with maybe 220 180

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.050 
it one more time back with maybe 220 180
whatever<00:01:48.560> your<00:01:48.679> preference<00:01:49.039> is<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:49.460> then<00:01:49.970> we

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
whatever your preference is and then we

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.050 
whatever your preference is and then we
could<00:01:50.210> start<00:01:50.420> applying<00:01:50.689> our<00:01:50.929> coats<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.229> finish

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
the HVLP gun has three fan settings

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
oddly shaped piece like this you'll

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.480 
oddly shaped piece like this you'll
probably<00:02:03.049> want<00:02:03.709> to<00:02:03.740> use<00:02:03.799> all<00:02:04.220> three

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
probably want to use all three

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:13.030 
probably want to use all three
strategically<00:02:10.989> once<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.140> top<00:02:12.319> dries<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.890> can

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
strategically once the top dries I can

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.650 
strategically once the top dries I can
flip<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.340> piece<00:02:13.489> over<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.000> finish<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
flip the piece over and finish the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.990 
flip the piece over and finish the
bottom<00:02:14.959> I'll<00:02:15.410> apply<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> total<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.519> four<00:02:16.730> coats

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000

lot<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.370> fun<00:02:28.640> really<00:02:29.480> straightforward<00:02:29.750> I

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
lot of fun really straightforward I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.009 
lot of fun really straightforward I
wouldn't<00:02:31.070> really<00:02:31.190> say<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.549> there's<00:02:31.730> any<00:02:32.019> you

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
wouldn't really say that there's any you

going to surprise you the one thing I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.170 
going to surprise you the one thing I
will<00:02:36.680> warn<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.100> though<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.880> be<00:02:37.970> very

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
will warn you though is to be very

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.449 
will warn you though is to be very
careful<00:02:38.570> about<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.870> thickness<00:02:39.140> if<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.310> go

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
careful about the thickness if you go

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.000 
careful about the thickness if you go
too<00:02:40.519> thick<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:41.390> most<00:02:42.200> routers<00:02:42.500> will<00:02:42.859> have

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
too thick on this most routers will have

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.520 
too thick on this most routers will have
a<00:02:43.040> problem<00:02:43.670> extending<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.840> bit<00:02:45.019> far<00:02:45.350> enough

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
a problem extending the bit far enough

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.080 
a problem extending the bit far enough
when<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.799> plunge<00:02:46.070> down<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:46.970> can

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
when you plunge down so that you can

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.789 
when you plunge down so that you can
actually<00:02:47.420> clean<00:02:47.690> out<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.079> bottom<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.650> just

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
actually clean out the bottom I just

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.069 
actually clean out the bottom I just
barely<00:02:49.340> made<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.670> with<00:02:49.910> my<00:02:49.940> router<00:02:50.359> so<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.750> cut

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
barely made it with my router so I cut

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.840 
barely made it with my router so I cut
it<00:02:51.109> very<00:02:51.380> very<00:02:51.560> close<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.370> that's<00:02:52.489> something<00:02:52.670> I

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
it very very close so that's something I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.490 
it very very close so that's something I
recommend<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.570> sort<00:02:54.049> of<00:02:54.109> look<00:02:54.320> at<00:02:54.410> your

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
recommend you sort of look at your

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.990 
recommend you sort of look at your
router<00:02:54.680> plunge<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.340> all<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.489> way<00:02:55.609> down<00:02:55.640> and

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
router plunge it all the way down and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.030 
router plunge it all the way down and
just<00:02:56.090> make<00:02:56.150> sure<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.569> know<00:02:56.750> how<00:02:56.900> far<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.859> can

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
just make sure you know how far you can

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.979 
just make sure you know how far you can
get<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.370> terms<00:02:58.579> of<00:02:58.819> depth<00:02:59.090> before<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.840> make

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
get in terms of depth before you make

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.599 
get in terms of depth before you make
your<00:03:00.140> decisions<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.709> how<00:03:00.890> thick<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.280> go<00:03:01.430> and

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
your decisions on how thick to go and

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.210 
your decisions on how thick to go and
how<00:03:01.700> thick<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.000> leave<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.840> bottom<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:04.190> know

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
how thick to leave the bottom you know

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.280 
how thick to leave the bottom you know
and<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.609> will<00:03:04.850> mention<00:03:05.209> about<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.660> finish<00:03:06.019> here
