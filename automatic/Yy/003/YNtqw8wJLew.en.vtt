00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.130
 good 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680
 Now I'm going to explain a little bit how 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 you have to refill the cartridges 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.690
 first we have to take out the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.590
 cartridges only to the left 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.449
 we put the black and to the right to the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.910
 colom has to reload the cartons 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.140
 very easy as we hunt is very simple 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.240
 we usually check you're watching here 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.210
 we return it here it's time immediately 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.930
 we take out the black cartridges here in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.109
 the sky we will not go 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.600
 play blue and yellow will then be 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.090
 placed here in particular this is that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.220
 of power less drought at one time 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.680
 this is the black have let's leave 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.600
 all the color as we are going to see 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.040
 our water to reduce a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.040
 complete in the seriousness 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.989
 as you know the cartridges above have 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.690
 solution out how to get down to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.930
 be able to run there's a hole that's going to 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.479
 feel the needle stop this is a pain 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.430
 a kind of pompoms we have here 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.930
 Here we have the black and dieting 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.009
 he had made a hole but he has already 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.030
 to continue the medium by removing a paper 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.070
 then I take a syringe and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.040
 we carry 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.729
 and then this week the other 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.800
 syringes 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.030
 well here we have the black where 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.830
 will be in the center backup and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.020
 find completely and in geology 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.460
 has separate as the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.049
 black liquid or in the syringe 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.080
 these criticisms have to be with a 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.570
 very fine lace you think you are the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.070
 degree that the objects give for it but 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.090
 you have 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.909
 you get in the blue on the left to 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.440
 the yellow to the right and the bottom to 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.630
 that we will inject as three syringes 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:05.229
 such as two syringes and a half of 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:09.509
 you will be the only example of the 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.840
 cartridges in the social order ante red 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.840
 blue and yellow 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.860
 the lid
