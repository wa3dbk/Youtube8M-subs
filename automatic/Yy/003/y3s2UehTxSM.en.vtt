00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
with the arena from reach hopefully they

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
with the arena from reach hopefully they
can<00:01:00.539> refine<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.530> competitive

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
can refine it and make it as competitive

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.189 
can refine it and make it as competitive
as<00:01:02.129> League<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.550> Legends<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.239> hopefully<00:01:03.719> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
as League of Legends well hopefully so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.840

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that would be they've got a long way to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
that would be they've got a long way to
go<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.360> certainly<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> ranking<00:01:07.560> system

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
with this one halo 4 launched it killed

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.520 
with this one halo 4 launched it killed
the<00:06:14.270> freaking<00:06:14.570> population<00:06:15.169> because<00:06:15.410> the

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
the freaking population because the

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.890 
the freaking population because the
playlist<00:06:16.010> were<00:06:16.100> horrible<00:06:16.669> it<00:06:16.880> took<00:06:17.270> over<00:06:17.690> like

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
playlist were horrible it took over like

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.540

we<00:06:18.020> got<00:06:18.169> one<00:06:18.380> week<00:06:18.410> of<00:06:18.710> team<00:06:18.919> snipers<00:06:19.190> and<00:06:19.340> then

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
we got one week of team snipers and then

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.090 
we got one week of team snipers and then
it<00:06:19.640> disappeared<00:06:20.240> for<00:06:20.720> a<00:06:20.750> month<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.500> you<00:06:21.919> just

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
it disappeared for a month and you just

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.370 
it disappeared for a month and you just
you<00:06:22.730> can't<00:06:22.760> do<00:06:23.210> that<00:06:23.360> to<00:06:23.630> a<00:06:23.660> fan<00:06:23.930> base<00:06:23.960> whose

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
you can't do that to a fan base whose

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.280 
you can't do that to a fan base whose
love<00:06:24.710> this<00:06:24.919> game<00:06:25.130> for<00:06:25.430> so<00:06:25.640> long<00:06:25.940> anyway<00:06:26.690> that's

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
love this game for so long anyway that's

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.770 
love this game for so long anyway that's
all<00:06:27.470> I<00:06:27.500> had<00:06:27.680> to<00:06:27.710> say<00:06:27.830> this<00:06:28.400> week<00:06:28.669> but<00:06:29.240> I'm<00:06:29.570> not

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
all I had to say this week but I'm not

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.360 
all I had to say this week but I'm not
going<00:06:29.900> to<00:06:29.990> be<00:06:30.080> negative<00:06:30.260> I<00:06:30.680> don't<00:06:31.010> want<00:06:31.220> to<00:06:31.280> be

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
going to be negative I don't want to be

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.010 
going to be negative I don't want to be
negative<00:06:31.550> because<00:06:32.060> there<00:06:32.630> is<00:06:32.750> a<00:06:32.780> lot<00:06:32.990> of

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
negative because there is a lot of

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.650 
negative because there is a lot of
potential<00:06:33.380> and<00:06:33.740> if<00:06:33.950> perhaps<00:06:34.370> 343<00:06:35.210> is<00:06:35.330> going<00:06:35.570> to

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
potential and if perhaps 343 is going to

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.090 
potential and if perhaps 343 is going to
nail<00:06:35.900> it<00:06:35.930> with<00:06:36.080> halo<00:06:36.440> 5

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
nail it with halo 5

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.160 
nail it with halo 5
but<00:06:37.160> if<00:06:37.250> you<00:06:37.340> could<00:06:37.460> have<00:06:37.640> one<00:06:37.820> thing<00:06:38.510> changed

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
but if you could have one thing changed

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.140 
but if you could have one thing changed
with<00:06:39.380> halo<00:06:39.560> for<00:06:39.830> one<00:06:40.370> thing<00:06:40.730> that<00:06:41.000> would<00:06:41.120> make

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
with halo for one thing that would make

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.270 
with halo for one thing that would make
it<00:06:41.330> a<00:06:41.480> better<00:06:41.690> experience<00:06:41.830> what<00:06:42.830> would<00:06:43.160> it<00:06:43.250> be

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
it a better experience what would it be

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.880 
it a better experience what would it be
only<00:06:43.580> one<00:06:43.970> thing<00:06:44.240> I<00:06:44.450> want<00:06:44.660> you<00:06:44.930> to<00:06:45.050> narrow<00:06:45.650> this

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 
only one thing I want you to narrow this

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.890 
only one thing I want you to narrow this
down<00:06:45.950> don't<00:06:46.760> make<00:06:46.850> it<00:06:47.000> too<00:06:47.150> long<00:06:47.390> just<00:06:47.690> make<00:06:47.870> it

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
down don't make it too long just make it

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.810 
down don't make it too long just make it
simple<00:06:48.200> and<00:06:48.530> probably<00:06:49.010> realistic<00:06:49.580> and<00:06:49.760> I'm

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
simple and probably realistic and I'm

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.880 
simple and probably realistic and I'm
looking<00:06:50.090> forward<00:06:50.330> to<00:06:50.900> what<00:06:51.080> you<00:06:51.440> say<00:06:51.680> have<00:06:51.860> a

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:51.890 
looking forward to what you say have a

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.160 
looking forward to what you say have a
good<00:06:51.980> week
