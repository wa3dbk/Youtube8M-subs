like<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> maps<00:00:35.550> there's<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.969> single

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
like all the maps there's not a single

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.000 
like all the maps there's not a single
map<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.559> DLC

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
map that I just like out of this DLC

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.799 
map that I just like out of this DLC
drop<00:00:38.250> as<00:00:38.460> well<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:42.239> enjoy<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
drop as well as I really enjoy the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.500 
drop as well as I really enjoy the
peacekeeper<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.910> an

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
peacekeeper I think that it's an

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.000 
peacekeeper I think that it's an
interesting<00:00:45.840> gun<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.320> because<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> feel<00:00:46.950> like

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
interesting gun just because I feel like

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000 
interesting gun just because I feel like
it<00:00:47.280> connection<00:00:47.910> really<00:00:48.300> does<00:00:48.660> put<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> big

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it connection really does put like a big

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.049 
it connection really does put like a big
impact<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:53.340> definitely<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
impact on it but it definitely is one of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.510 
impact on it but it definitely is one of
the<00:00:54.149> better<00:00:54.300> guns<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.469> personal<00:00:56.399> opinion

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the better guns in my personal opinion

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.740 
the better guns in my personal opinion
for<00:00:58.039> for<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.100> least<00:00:59.250> from<00:00:59.370> my<00:00:59.550> personal<00:01:00.329> I

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
for for at least from my personal I

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.170 
for for at least from my personal I
guess<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> could<00:01:01.109> say<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.820> just<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
guess you could say use just because it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.980 
guess you could say use just because it
is<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> hybrid<00:01:03.619> weapon<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.240> mostly<00:01:06.869> use

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
is a hybrid weapon and I do mostly use

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.109 
is a hybrid weapon and I do mostly use
smg's<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.070> game<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> think

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
smg's in this game just because I think

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.390 
smg's in this game just because I think
that<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.330> are<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> best<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.140> game<00:01:10.400> but

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that they are the best in this game but

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.399 
that they are the best in this game but
because<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.150> its<00:01:12.270> hybrid<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.869> lets<00:01:13.020> me<00:01:13.140> play<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
because of its hybrid it lets me play a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
because of its hybrid it lets me play a
little<00:01:13.710> more<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.369> defensive<00:01:14.670> role<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
little more of a defensive role with the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.710 
little more of a defensive role with the
SM<00:01:15.570> uses<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:17.189> more<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.420> guess<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
SM uses which I I like more I guess you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.719 
SM uses which I I like more I guess you
could<00:01:18.810> say<00:01:18.840> per<00:01:19.110> se<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:19.530> uh<00:01:19.729> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
could say per se then uh the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.620 
could say per se then uh the
in-your-face

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
in-your-face

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.840 
in-your-face
SMG<00:01:22.080> game<00:01:22.530> style<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
SMG game style because I do do that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.760 
SMG game style because I do do that
sometimes<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.900> prefer<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> more

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
sometimes but I prefer the more

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.660 
sometimes but I prefer the more
defensive<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.390> kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.130> SMG<00:01:29.130> style

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
defensive you know kind of SMG style

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.359 
defensive you know kind of SMG style
which<00:01:29.970> sometimes<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:30.930> hard<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.770> guess<00:01:32.280> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
which sometimes it's hard to I guess you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.550 
which sometimes it's hard to I guess you
could<00:01:32.520> say<00:01:32.700> complete<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> Peacekeeper

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
could say complete but the Peacekeeper

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.499 
could say complete but the Peacekeeper
because<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.130> hybrid<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:36.060> gives<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.390> those

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
because it's hybrid it gives it those

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.539 
because it's hybrid it gives it those
assault<00:01:36.930> rifle<00:01:37.409> attributes<00:01:38.100> where<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.369> kind

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
assault rifle attributes where it kind

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.770 
assault rifle attributes where it kind
of<00:01:38.579> feels<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.270> an<00:01:39.360> assault<00:01:39.689> rifle

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
of feels like it's just an assault rifle

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.920 
of feels like it's just an assault rifle
with<00:01:40.200> some<00:01:40.770> SMG<00:01:41.369> attributes<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.570> stock

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
with some SMG attributes and a stock

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.920 
with some SMG attributes and a stock
like<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.409> built<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.799> stock<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:45.000> overall<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.720> would

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
like a built in stock so overall I would

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.330 
like a built in stock so overall I would
have<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.170> say<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.649> gun<00:01:46.860> definitely

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
have to say it's a good gun definitely

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.499 
have to say it's a good gun definitely
not<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> best<00:01:47.759> gun<00:01:48.000> definitely<00:01:48.420> not

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
not the best gun definitely not

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.590 
not the best gun definitely not
overpowered<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.119> weapon

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
overpowered and I really like the weapon

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
overpowered and I really like the weapon
DLC<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.770> hope<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.189> bring<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.490> more

it a lot more than you know most people
so<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.100> do<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.520> good<00:02:26.700> grasp<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.830> yeah

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
so I do have a good grasp on it and yeah

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.140 
so I do have a good grasp on it and yeah
so<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.680> maps<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.280> getting<00:02:32.460> into<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.670> DLC

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.510 
so the maps it's getting into the DLC
maps<00:02:33.360> like<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.660> said<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.740> like<00:02:34.980> them<00:02:35.310> I

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
maps like I said I really do like them I

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.280 
maps like I said I really do like them I
do<00:02:35.580> think<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.270> they're<00:02:36.600> all<00:02:36.780> unique<00:02:37.170> in

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
do think that they're all unique in

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.060 
do think that they're all unique in
their<00:02:37.410> own<00:02:37.530> ways

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
their own ways

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.190 
their own ways
hydro<00:02:38.820> for<00:02:39.150> an<00:02:39.240> example<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.720> one<00:02:39.840> I'm<00:02:39.960> playing

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
hydro for an example the one I'm playing

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.570 
hydro for an example the one I'm playing
on<00:02:40.350> right<00:02:40.560> now<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:41.040> does<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
on right now it does have the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.360 
on right now it does have the
interactive<00:02:41.970> feature<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.990> watered<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.770> um

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
interactive feature of the watered it um

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.340 
interactive feature of the watered it um
it's<00:02:44.550> kind<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.820> annoying<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.080> don't

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
it's kind of annoying but I don't

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.070 
it's kind of annoying but I don't
dislike<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.280> because<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.910> really<00:02:48.840> does

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
dislike it just because it really does

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.920 
dislike it just because it really does
take<00:02:49.950> off<00:02:50.130> some<00:02:50.550> flanking<00:02:51.000> routes<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.540> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
take off some flanking routes and the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
take off some flanking routes and the
only<00:02:52.050> thing<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.470> don't<00:02:52.560> like<00:02:53.010> about<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.640> is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
only thing that I don't like about it is

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.370 
only thing that I don't like about it is
that<00:02:53.790> if<00:02:54.090> it's<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.330> really<00:02:54.600> competitive<00:02:54.960> game

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
that if it's a really competitive game

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.280 
that if it's a really competitive game
and<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:56.580> taking<00:02:56.940> my<00:02:57.240> opportunities<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> way

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
and it's taking my opportunities a way

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.800 
and it's taking my opportunities a way
of<00:02:58.410> getting<00:02:58.560> B<00:02:58.950> which<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.430> does<00:02:59.640> do<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.030> it

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
of getting B which it does do you it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.540 
of getting B which it does do you it
kind<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.650> don't<00:03:01.740> know<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.400> see<00:03:02.520> that

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
kind of I don't know I can see that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.910 
kind of I don't know I can see that
being<00:03:02.850> annoying<00:03:03.180> luckily<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.200> have<00:03:04.560> not<00:03:04.740> had

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
being annoying luckily I have not had

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.710 
being annoying luckily I have not had
the<00:03:05.040> problem<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.730> yet<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.450> have

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the problem with that yet because I have

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.510 
the problem with that yet because I have
not<00:03:06.840> ran<00:03:07.050> into<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.320> competitive<00:03:07.920> game<00:03:08.100> on<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
not ran into a competitive game on the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.940 
not ran into a competitive game on the
DLC<00:03:08.940> maps<00:03:09.150> really<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.660> well<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.350> had<00:03:10.560> one<00:03:10.800> but

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
DLC maps really that well I had one but

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.440 
DLC maps really that well I had one but
at<00:03:11.040> least<00:03:11.160> not<00:03:11.310> on<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.550> map<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.330> only

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
at least not on this map it's the only

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.640 
at least not on this map it's the only
thing<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.750> don't<00:03:12.810> really<00:03:12.930> like<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.410> better<00:03:13.500> but

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
thing I don't really like it better but

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.410 
thing I don't really like it better but
at<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.830> same<00:03:14.010> time<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.250> do<00:03:14.400> like<00:03:14.580> it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
at the same time I do like it

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.440 
at the same time I do like it
I<00:03:15.480> think<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:16.530> cool<00:03:16.800> but<00:03:17.580> there's<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.180> reason

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
I think it's cool but there's a reason

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.600 
I think it's cool but there's a reason
why<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.600> don't<00:03:18.780> think<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.380> map<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> very

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
why I don't think this map is a very

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.980 
why I don't think this map is a very
good<00:03:20.760> map<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.180> comes<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.480> competitive

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990

map is grind grind is a really fun map
definitely<00:03:31.320> in<00:03:31.470> your<00:03:31.500> face<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.820> go

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
definitely in your face and you know go

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.300 
definitely in your face and you know go
go<00:03:33.300> go<00:03:33.570> at<00:03:33.870> least<00:03:33.959> by<00:03:34.170> how<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> play<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.040> or

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
go go at least by how I play it or

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.540 
go go at least by how I play it or
attempt<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.760> play<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.080> I<00:03:37.080> really<00:03:37.950> think<00:03:38.220> the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
attempt to play it I really think the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.729 
attempt to play it I really think the
color<00:03:38.850> scheme<00:03:39.180> grind<00:03:40.020> is<00:03:40.230> actually<00:03:40.560> really

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
color scheme grind is actually really

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.350 
color scheme grind is actually really
cool<00:03:40.980> kind<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.340> reminds<00:03:41.550> me<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.730> stadium<00:03:42.060> for

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
cool kind of reminds me a stadium for

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.360 
cool kind of reminds me a stadium for
some<00:03:42.570> reason<00:03:42.930> I'm<00:03:43.050> not<00:03:43.170> sure<00:03:43.350> why<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.650> is

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
some reason I'm not sure why that is

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.300 
some reason I'm not sure why that is
but<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.050> really<00:03:46.260> cool<00:03:46.500> map<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.950> do<00:03:47.010> like

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
but it is a really cool map I do like

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.510 
but it is a really cool map I do like
grind<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:49.260> only<00:03:49.470> thing<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:50.070> think<00:03:50.280> is

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
grind and the only thing that I think is

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.070 
grind and the only thing that I think is
kind<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.730> silly<00:03:51.060> about<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.630> half<00:03:51.870> the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
kind of silly about it is that half the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.810 
kind of silly about it is that half the
head<00:03:52.320> glitches<00:03:52.709> aren't<00:03:53.340> really<00:03:53.550> head

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
head glitches aren't really head

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.280 
head glitches aren't really head
glitches<00:03:54.180> on<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.390> map<00:03:54.540> like<00:03:54.750> there's

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
glitches on the map like there's

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.020 
glitches on the map like there's
different<00:03:55.560> skateboard<00:03:56.220> jumps<00:03:56.610> everywhere

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
different skateboard jumps everywhere

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.250 
different skateboard jumps everywhere
and<00:03:57.270> all<00:03:57.330> these<00:03:57.450> different<00:03:57.600> things<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.020> head

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and all these different things that head

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
and all these different things that head
glitch<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:58.830> aren't<00:03:58.980> even<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.220> good

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
glitch but there aren't even that good

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.160 
glitch but there aren't even that good
of<00:03:59.550> head<00:03:59.730> glitches<00:04:00.090> which<00:04:00.270> I<00:04:00.510> kind<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.020> wish

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
of head glitches which I kind of wish

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.370 
of head glitches which I kind of wish
Trek<00:04:01.530> would<00:04:01.800> bring<00:04:02.010> back<00:04:02.540> like<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.959> way<00:04:04.110> head

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
Trek would bring back like the way head

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.740 
Trek would bring back like the way head
glitching<00:04:04.739> was<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.340> because<00:04:05.640> some<00:04:06.480> people

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
glitching was just because some people

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.390 
glitching was just because some people
called<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.080> cheap<00:04:07.290> but<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:07.860> definitely<00:04:07.980> part

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
called it cheap but it's definitely part

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.680 
called it cheap but it's definitely part
of<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.550> game<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.090> should<00:04:09.239> never<00:04:09.330> take

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
of the game and you should never take

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.850 
of the game and you should never take
that<00:04:09.840> out<00:04:10.020> because<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.290> kind<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.500> takes<00:04:10.709> it

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
that out because it kind of takes it

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.960 
that out because it kind of takes it
away<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.100> it<00:04:11.250> doesn't<00:04:11.280> really<00:04:11.640> feel<00:04:11.910> like

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
away and it doesn't really feel like

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.850 
away and it doesn't really feel like
call<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.480> duty<00:04:12.510> in<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.870> way<00:04:13.020> that's<00:04:13.530> just<00:04:13.739> my

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
call of duty in a way that's just my

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.030 
call of duty in a way that's just my
personal<00:04:14.280> opinion<00:04:14.720> not<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:16.500> kind<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.770> it<00:04:17.010> is

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
personal opinion not it kind of it is

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.070 
personal opinion not it kind of it is
kind<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.489> benefit<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.970> camping<00:04:18.390> but<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.870> kind

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
kind of a benefit to camping but it kind

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.830 
kind of a benefit to camping but it kind
of<00:04:19.140> helps<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.440> put<00:04:19.709> power<00:04:20.220> spots<00:04:20.640> up<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.180> kind

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
of helps you put power spots up and kind

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.360 
of helps you put power spots up and kind
of<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.020> guess<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.229> could<00:04:22.320> say<00:04:22.500> control<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.160> map

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
of I guess you could say control the map

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.750 
of I guess you could say control the map
a<00:04:23.400> little

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
a little

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.450 
a little
but<00:04:23.910> or<00:04:24.120> in<00:04:24.390> ways<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.530> that's<00:04:25.800> why<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:25.980> like<00:04:26.220> head

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
but or in ways so that's why I like head

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.530 
but or in ways so that's why I like head
glitches<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:26.850> I<00:04:26.910> kind<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.120> wish<00:04:27.210> they'd<00:04:27.420> bring

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
glitches and I kind of wish they'd bring

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.560 
glitches and I kind of wish they'd bring
them<00:04:27.720> more<00:04:27.960> back<00:04:28.260> but<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:29.370> do<00:04:30.150> like<00:04:30.360> what<00:04:30.450> they

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
them more back but I do like what they

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.930 
them more back but I do like what they
did<00:04:30.630> with<00:04:30.840> grime<00:04:31.080> for<00:04:31.320> sure<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:32.220> other<00:04:32.370> map<00:04:32.610> I

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
did with grime for sure the other map I

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.690 
did with grime for sure the other map I
can<00:04:33.510> never<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:34.260> can<00:04:34.740> never<00:04:34.830> remember<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.220> name

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700

can never I can never remember the name
for<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.180> this<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.780> sand<00:04:37.080> one<00:04:37.380> where<00:04:37.680> it's<00:04:37.770> like

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
for is this the sand one where it's like

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.270 
for is this the sand one where it's like
in<00:04:38.040> China<00:04:38.310> or<00:04:38.580> whatever<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.480> map<00:04:39.690> is<00:04:39.870> good

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.220 
in China or whatever that map is good
it's<00:04:41.280> got<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.670> triangle<00:04:42.090> effect<00:04:42.810> for

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
it's got like the triangle effect for

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.510 
it's got like the triangle effect for
call<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.530> duty<00:04:43.740> where<00:04:43.920> it's<00:04:44.070> like<00:04:44.250> the

just it's not it's my least favorite out
of<00:05:04.380> all<00:05:04.560> of<00:05:04.620> them<00:05:04.800> but<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.370> don't<00:05:05.490> think<00:05:06.000> it's<00:05:06.120> a

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
of all of them but I don't think it's a

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.770 
of all of them but I don't think it's a
bad<00:05:06.420> map<00:05:06.690> either<00:05:06.930> so<00:05:07.820> even<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.880> map<00:05:09.120> that<00:05:09.150> like<00:05:09.660> I

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
bad map either so even a map that like I

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.480 
bad map either so even a map that like I
said<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:10.050> my<00:05:10.140> least<00:05:10.350> favorite<00:05:10.470> I<00:05:10.830> still<00:05:11.160> like

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
said is my least favorite I still like

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.310 
said is my least favorite I still like
the<00:05:11.790> map<00:05:11.970> itself<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.570> like<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.870> lot<00:05:13.080> better

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
the map itself I like it a lot better

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.420 
the map itself I like it a lot better
than<00:05:13.350> some<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.770> maps<00:05:13.980> are<00:05:14.130> in<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.250> game

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
than some of the maps are in the game

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.840 
than some of the maps are in the game

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
black ops 1 track map like the people

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.980 
black ops 1 track map like the people
who<00:05:41.700> made<00:05:41.880> all<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.060> maps<00:05:42.240> in<00:05:42.390> that<00:05:42.570> game<00:05:42.780> made

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.690 
who made all the maps in that game made
the<00:05:43.080> same<00:05:43.290> maps<00:05:43.530> in<00:05:43.860> this<00:05:44.160> game<00:05:44.400> but<00:05:44.580> they're

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
the same maps in this game but they're

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.970 
the same maps in this game but they're
in<00:05:44.760> 2025<00:05:45.390> that's<00:05:46.230> what<00:05:46.350> I<00:05:46.380> really<00:05:46.770> like<00:05:46.950> about

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
everything works on that map which is

domination I really like the domination
on<00:06:10.260> that<00:06:10.410> map<00:06:10.620> and<00:06:10.860> it<00:06:11.310> just<00:06:11.490> overall<00:06:11.940> feels

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
on that map and it just overall feels

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.030 
on that map and it just overall feels
like<00:06:12.540> an<00:06:12.660> original<00:06:12.810> black<00:06:13.230> ops<00:06:13.500> 1<00:06:13.680> map<00:06:13.890> is

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
like an original black ops 1 map is

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.470 
like an original black ops 1 map is
which<00:06:14.190> I<00:06:14.310> really<00:06:14.550> like<00:06:14.730> is<00:06:14.910> because<00:06:15.090> I<00:06:15.210> love

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
which I really like is because I love

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.420 
which I really like is because I love
those<00:06:15.720> maps<00:06:15.960> so<00:06:16.350> much<00:06:16.710> they're<00:06:17.010> my<00:06:17.130> favorite

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
those maps so much they're my favorite

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.820 
those maps so much they're my favorite
map<00:06:17.610> sort<00:06:17.910> of<00:06:17.970> any<00:06:18.090> Call<00:06:18.360> of<00:06:18.390> Duty<00:06:18.690> and<00:06:18.870> I<00:06:19.620> just

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
map sort of any Call of Duty and I just

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.560 
map sort of any Call of Duty and I just
like<00:06:19.980> the<00:06:20.100> way<00:06:20.130> that<00:06:20.340> Treyarch<00:06:20.790> put<00:06:21.300> used<00:06:21.450> to

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
like the way that Treyarch put used to

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.970 
like the way that Treyarch put used to
put<00:06:21.750> maps<00:06:21.960> together<00:06:22.200> at<00:06:22.620> least<00:06:22.740> in<00:06:22.860> the

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
put maps together at least in the

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.830 
put maps together at least in the
original<00:06:23.310> black<00:06:23.550> ops<00:06:23.760> and<00:06:23.940> it<00:06:24.120> felt<00:06:24.420> like<00:06:24.600> that

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
original black ops and it felt like that

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.050 
original black ops and it felt like that
so<00:06:25.050> kind<00:06:25.230> of<00:06:25.320> recaptured<00:06:25.890> out<00:06:26.100> what<00:06:26.730> I<00:06:26.760> used<00:06:26.970> to

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
so kind of recaptured out what I used to

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.730 
so kind of recaptured out what I used to
love<00:06:27.240> about<00:06:27.450> the<00:06:27.660> original<00:06:27.990> black<00:06:28.200> ops<00:06:28.440> and

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
love about the original black ops and

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.550 
love about the original black ops and
they<00:06:28.800> put<00:06:28.980> it<00:06:29.070> in<00:06:29.160> this<00:06:29.250> game<00:06:29.490> so<00:06:30.230> that's<00:06:31.230> why<00:06:31.530> I

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
they put it in this game so that's why I

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.950 
they put it in this game so that's why I
I'm<00:06:32.490> not<00:06:32.670> sure<00:06:32.790> which<00:06:32.940> one<00:06:33.120> is<00:06:33.330> my<00:06:33.510> favorite

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
I'm not sure which one is my favorite

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.780 
I'm not sure which one is my favorite
map<00:06:34.140> I'm<00:06:34.440> not<00:06:34.620> sure<00:06:34.800> if<00:06:34.860> it's<00:06:34.980> I<00:06:35.340> think<00:06:35.670> it's

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
map I'm not sure if it's I think it's

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.040 
map I'm not sure if it's I think it's
gonna<00:06:36.030> be<00:06:36.210> downhill

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
gonna be downhill

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.029 
gonna be downhill
I<00:06:37.080> would<00:06:37.199> assume<00:06:37.470> so<00:06:37.669> but<00:06:39.560> if<00:06:40.560> any<00:06:40.740> of<00:06:40.800> you<00:06:40.889> guys

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
I would assume so but if any of you guys

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:43.760 
I would assume so but if any of you guys
are<00:06:41.430> controversial<00:06:41.940> or<00:06:42.300> like<00:06:42.680> skeptical<00:06:43.680> I

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
are controversial or like skeptical I

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.730 
are controversial or like skeptical I
guess<00:06:43.919> you<00:06:44.009> could<00:06:44.129> say<00:06:44.340> of<00:06:44.639> buying<00:06:45.629> the<00:06:46.050> DLC<00:06:46.500> if

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
guess you could say of buying the DLC if

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.110 
guess you could say of buying the DLC if
you<00:06:47.039> know<00:06:47.159> you're<00:06:47.310> thinking<00:06:47.639> about<00:06:47.729> it<00:06:47.970> but

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
you know you're thinking about it but

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.879 
you know you're thinking about it but
it's<00:06:48.210> like<00:06:48.300> an<00:06:48.539> DLC<00:06:49.139> isn't<00:06:49.349> the<00:06:49.440> net<00:06:49.590> great<00:06:49.800> in

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
it's like an DLC isn't the net great in

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:51.110 
it's like an DLC isn't the net great in
the<00:06:49.979> past<00:06:50.220> I<00:06:50.460> don't<00:06:50.550> know<00:06:50.669> if<00:06:50.729> I<00:06:50.789> want<00:06:50.970> to<00:06:51.030> waste

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
the past I don't know if I want to waste

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.510 
the past I don't know if I want to waste
my<00:06:51.270> money<00:06:51.300> on<00:06:51.690> it<00:06:51.870> I<00:06:51.990> would<00:06:52.530> personally<00:06:52.770> just

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
my money on it I would personally just

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.210 
my money on it I would personally just
buy<00:06:53.699> the<00:06:53.759> DLC<00:06:54.440> I'm<00:06:55.440> not<00:06:55.620> saying<00:06:55.889> you<00:06:56.009> have<00:06:56.039> to

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
buy the DLC I'm not saying you have to

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.710 
buy the DLC I'm not saying you have to
get<00:06:56.400> the<00:06:56.490> seasons<00:06:56.879> past<00:06:57.120> because<00:06:57.569> you

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
get the seasons past because you

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.839 
get the seasons past because you
obviously<00:06:58.199> don't<00:06:58.319> have<00:06:58.590> to<00:06:58.800> but<00:06:59.069> have<00:06:59.550> to<00:06:59.669> deal

00:06:59.839 --> 00:06:59.849 
obviously don't have to but have to deal

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.909 
obviously don't have to but have to deal
if<00:07:00.120> the<00:07:00.240> very<00:07:00.419> first<00:07:00.659> DLC<00:07:00.870> drop<00:07:01.319> was<00:07:01.530> this<00:07:01.680> good

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
if the very first DLC drop was this good

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.680 
if the very first DLC drop was this good
I<00:07:02.220> would<00:07:02.460> almost<00:07:02.759> say<00:07:03.000> that<00:07:03.150> if<00:07:03.449> you<00:07:03.509> don't

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
I would almost say that if you don't

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.839 
I would almost say that if you don't
have<00:07:03.780> a<00:07:03.840> season<00:07:04.229> pass<00:07:04.259> get<00:07:04.770> it<00:07:04.919> I<00:07:05.069> just<00:07:05.669> hope

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:05.849 
have a season pass get it I just hope

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:07.369 
have a season pass get it I just hope
that<00:07:05.879> you<00:07:06.569> know<00:07:06.690> some<00:07:06.900> people<00:07:06.990> don't<00:07:07.229> buy<00:07:07.319> the

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:07.379 
that you know some people don't buy the

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.559 
that you know some people don't buy the
season's<00:07:07.889> pass<00:07:08.069> just<00:07:08.340> because<00:07:08.639> the<00:07:08.819> first<00:07:09.150> DLC

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:09.569

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.850
