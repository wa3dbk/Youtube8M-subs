00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:02.520
 current technologies 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
 allow telecommunications to advance by leaps and bounds 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.199
 in many occasions we take advantage of 100% 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.029
 making use of information technologies tic communications is 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.029
 made a system for the transmission of medical images 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:18.939
 remotely 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.939
 that allows the diagnosis of patients 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.510
 the project was called 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.030
 feasibility study 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.519
 implementation through a pilot plan 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.160
 no medical image transmission system 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.970
 for the diagnosis of patients between general practitioners and doctors 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 specialists 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.400
 Current trends of different medical centers and hospitals 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.040
 thus reducing costs and optimizing resources 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.160
 inti in which a specialist doctor in each of them 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.310
 these difficulties 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.570
 and others such as efficiency, the timely provision of services 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.600
 doctors 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.490
 scarce coverage in health centers and hospitals 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.570
 geographical difficulties lack of communication exchange film of 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.690
 information 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.910
 between the different entities of health 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.340
 difficulty of accessing medical records 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.940
 and the lack of specialized medical equipment 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.910
 for reliable diagnosis 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.650
 require unnecessary transfer of patients and doctors from one point 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.650
 even though 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.880
 taking as a fundamental axis the cost reduction 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.350
 this project another is a solution through technology through the use of 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.790
 television 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.500
 that allows interaction 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.650
 between doctors and patients remotely 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.830
 between two geographically isolated points 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.220
 based on these circumstances 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.210
 it is proposed 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.030
 an application for the transmission of medical images among doctors 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.570
 general medical specialists remotely for the diagnosis of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.820
 patients 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.120
 When considering the problem, all the information is taken into account 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.670
 provided by employees belonging to the hospital network of the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.670
 goal 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.790
 after collecting compile all the relevant information 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.489
 it comes from the project in three fundamental stages 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.959
 In the first, the current study of the present data networks is carried out 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:26.969
 in the department 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.359
 which are xdsl 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.569
 gprs and basic switched public telephone network 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.949
 in the second stage the traffic study is carried out 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.450
 cost and coverage 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.139
 of the technologies present 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.139
 to finish the best cost-benefit ratio 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.549
 and in the last stage with easy 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.019
 the application is made 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.560
 well because it allows the management of different images 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.009
 and information 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.009
 to transmit from a point 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.689
 later 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.989
 to the previous feasibility study it can be concluded that the network was more than 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:10.989
 net 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.989
 more favorable for the transmission of medical images 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.139
 of vido at its transmission speed 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.399
 your coverage 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.399
 and its reliability 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.779
 Within what is worth we call medical images 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.129
 it is including images of current medical equipment 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.889
 which are capable of transmitting directly 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.209
 to a computer 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.139
 through serial interfaces iu is to be 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.199
 as well as the images 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.129
 taken by scanners and digital cameras 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.129
 for cases such as dermatological lesions 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.969
 images like these are what are taken into account at the moment of 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:53.119
 develop 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.079
 said application 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.839
 additionally, it is taken into account that the size of the images and the quantity 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.329
 of images to transmit 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.329
 in a certain time 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.439
 the final result 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.959
 is this application 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.859
 that allows us not only to transmit medical images but also 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.179
 their corresponding medical records 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:16.629
 solving like this 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:20.509
 the problem of moving patients and doctors from one point to another 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.129
 allowing 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.960
 to be done 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.830
 the analysis and diagnosis remotely and efficiently 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:31.650
 the expected impact 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.889
 We can not divide into three parts 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.280
 an economic impact that today will be the decrease 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.879
 of hospital expenses 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.979
 due to the unnecessary transfer of patients in ambulances 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.550
 a social impact 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.120
 that leads to a higher quality of life 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.830
 for all users of the hospital network 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.939
 avoiding co-management in the centers 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.229
 most important hospitals 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.240
 and a technological impact 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.080
 of vido alchemist hundred of the resources 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.400
 that can reinvent 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.400
 reinvest in other fields such as education 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.419
 additionally, an inclusion is generated 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:08.680
 technological 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.910
 encouraging the expansion of telecommunications coverage 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.110
 in those sectors 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:18.749
 Finally 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.769
 we can conclude that this solution becomes an application 

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:24.839
 technology on one of the existing ones 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:25.809
 robust 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.089
 that does not include the risks of loss of information and or for our neck 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.449
 or it could be fatal 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.189
 Sadly, digital inclusion is carried out in the most remote areas of 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.240
 our country 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.830
 helping like this is closed 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.129
 lahore made digital 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:43.219
 personally I want to thank slander to be a writer 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.360
 the meta department 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.100
 for the support
