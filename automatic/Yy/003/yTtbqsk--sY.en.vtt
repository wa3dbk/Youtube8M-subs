00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello how are you, I'm mon and welcome to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
 channel today I bring you this 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.099
 Nail design in shades of blue with 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.040
 little stars I hope you like it and stay 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.990
 to see the step by step look here I am 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240
 starting to put two layers of enamel 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.690
 white I'm using the brand's 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.670
 of surfing I put two layers as I tell them what 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.850
 let dry perfectly between layer and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.850
 cap 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.030
 now to achieve this blur we are going 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.510
 to use a sponge of these that 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.250
 we use to apply makeup 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.560
 and in a little corner we are going to place a 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.200
 little strong blue I put here blue 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.570
 king 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.870
 we 're going to apply something that you cited from 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.870
 the cuticle towards the middle of the nail 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.390
 I immediately took a green water here you see 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.670
 like blue but it's green water just like 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.679
 I'm going to put in little touches 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.729
 little towards the blue to achieve this 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.729
 blur effect 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.650
 if you like the most intense colors 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.040
 you can apply two layers but for 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.530
 achieve the effect that I wanted only 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.030
 I need a pass here because I'm already 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.360
 removing all excess enamel 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.310
 I use a cotonete 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.310
 I bathed in acetone 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.360
 i 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.220
 and then immediately to place the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.890
 little stars we are going to take a glaze 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.659
 transparent I'm also using the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.170
 of the be sure brand 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.509
 I put a layer of transparent enamel and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.240
 immediately began to place stars of 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.240
 a medium size glued to the cuticle 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.740
 we press a little bit so that they remain 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.200
 well adhered to the enamel and we are not 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 are going to fall down I'm going to put 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.880
 little stars 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.610
 without a defined pattern only 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.740
 place them where there is space 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.990
 and then to teach these 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.420
 little stars we are going to put enamel 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.510
 transparent again I put three 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.880
 layers of enamel because how are the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.580
 small and medium piquitos 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.100
 raised then we are pulling on 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.290
 the hair and it is very unpleasant 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.510
 so I put three layers of 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.020
 transparent enamel and in that way 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.930
 because there are no more piquitos with 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.060
 the stars thus raised and then 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.950
 good girls that's all it's a video 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.930
 very simple as he says but they 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.290
 I liked it if you liked it please 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.739

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.900
