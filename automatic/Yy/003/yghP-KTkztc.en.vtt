00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.870
 in a shop of typical products are 

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:09.240
 managed to find fresh ones 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.400
 Myrtle berries are freshly picked and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.559
 arrive directly from Sardinia e 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.200
 I will use them to prepare a delicious 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.780
 second course I want you to see how 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.240
 cook a delicious roast alberto 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.070
 we will also see how to verify the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.930
 perfect meat cooking time 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.030
 we immediately begin in a pan towards three 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.380
 or four tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.200
 obviously all the ingredients there 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.660
 find listed at the end of the video 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.970
 let's heat our oil for 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.140
 about thirty or forty seconds on flame 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.120
 high 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 let's go add the meat to this 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.540
 case of use a pork tenderloin 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.790
 which weighs about 500 grams 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.920
 you can choose the piece of meat that you 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.540
 the more you like it 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.329
 if you don't like pork you can too 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.820
 choose the calf I let it brown 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.280
 for about two minutes on one side then the other 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.260
 around and let it brown also 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.980
 on the other side always for a couple of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.559
 minutes 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.240
 I recommend that we do not throw away the tinsel 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.799
 because otherwise the roast would turn out 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.189
 too hard 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.069
 we pour 125 ml of red wine we leave 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.369
 brown for five minutes after which 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:18.659
 let's put aside the meat let's take care 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.020
 of the cooking bottom 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.109
 I got a ceramic dish and now 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.069
 the fund of 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.859
 cooking 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.859
 Meanwhile heat the oven to 180 degrees 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.700
 put in our pan 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:42.300
 fillet to which we will add 125 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.820
 g of myrtle berries and about 150 ml 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.800
 book where he talks like I have already salted the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.330
 then we put broth in the oven 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.280
 we check the cooking time by doing 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.470
 this test 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.560
 Twenty minutes have passed, and now I slip 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.610
 my fillet with a tip or with a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.410
 knife 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.420
 see what a liquid red show this 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.610
 it is not blood but the color determined by 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.720
 a protein that myosin the fillet 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.680
 it's not down yet after 25 minutes I do 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.260
 the proof and as you can see is stupid 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.110
 liquidino transparent this means 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.570
 that my fillet is ready after 45 minutes 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.250
 of cooking 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.459
 you can use this method or 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.959
 use a thermometer we review in the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.780
 left side the thread is not 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.760
 still cooked in fact you can see the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.640
 liquidino red while in the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.850
 right side the meat is cooked and leaves 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.040
 a very very clear liquid 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:47.220
 let's put the meat aside and filter 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.250
 our sauce that then the bottom of 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.250
 cooking 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.530
 let's go to thicken the sauce 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.480
 adding to a ladle of broth 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.700
 cold a teaspoon of potato starch 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.700
 or cornstarch what you prefer 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.930
 we combine the two compounds and let them cook 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.230
 for about 5 minutes so as to 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.880
 get a nice thick sauce and me 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.780
 I recommend we taste to regulate of 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.600
 salt 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.750
 we cut our meat as you can 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.040
 seeing is perfectly cooked let's put it 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.769
 on a nice dish of course 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:30.400
 and decorate with our beautiful sauce e 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.439
 I recommend a few myrtle berries 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.959
 really try this dish because 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.920
 myrtle berries really give a 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.659
 particular perfume here all the 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.220
 ingredients 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.700
 I hope you enjoyed the recipe there 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.700
 see you next time
