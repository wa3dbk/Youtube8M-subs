00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.600
 people this first thing we have to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.739
 do after generating the file that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.390
 is going to be the link to write the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.219
 decision that they are going to generate was going to 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.800

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.890

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.229
 I have located here on my right side 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.460

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.409
 this folder you the backed down 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.080

 I have here a folder of mods a this 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.310
 I have some that I was trying not to

 you support him in that so that he does not 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.869
 miss him 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.509
 after that what they are going to do is 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.509
 vote because we're going to erase everything boom 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.329
 let's erase everything I'm deleting 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.430
 absolutely everything will be clean 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.530
 once I have that, what I'm going to do 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.520
 is to open my launcher milan jr de 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 minecraft whatever and download it 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.060
 download all our launcher that 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 begins to charge as you can see here 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.020
 on the right it will start loading 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.340
 over here because here it will start 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.310
 load everything that is this 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.840
 all audio not then here you 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.879
 they know your username and all the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.459
 question I have here the video and 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.580
 I'll wait for the launcher to load 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.460
 ok ok I'll position here 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.860
 ok as after I just finished the guide 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.970
 right now it's good for me after 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.380
 you see it they are going to throw here so what 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.820
 what is going to do here, this is very 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.620
 important that you have to put a lot 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.530
 attention is to leave here in this part of 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.360
 edith ok and here, instead of leaving it 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.980
 where it says the latest version for 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.370
 choose version 1 6 4 ok 104 - 1 64 and 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.080
 they give him 6 profile and they give him play this what 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.330
 what you are going to do here, wait for 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.310
 start loading what is version 1 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.780
 64 annoying here for you 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.520
 can appreciate that here they begin to 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.290
 load the bookstores and all that roll 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.180
 this begins to fill this bar 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.680
 they depend on what they have then they are going to 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.450
 fill fast slow it has taken me 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.250
 quite because min 39 very fast so 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.100
 that I'm going to wait for the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.390
 version 1 6 4 and the return that although 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.450
 there are people how can they see that we have the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.490
 version 1 64 totally clean here is 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.700
 what we are going to do is close this 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.260
 we close and now we are going to decompress or 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.100
 remove the files that we have downloaded 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.890
 we drag what we drag all these 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.830
 we make all these go and we take them out 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.950
 we take them out of the file folder 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.350
 real or that it is not that it helps here well 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.620
 once you get all the files what 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.360
 that what you have to do is give it 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.860
 to see that this one that forces us to go to 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.960
 install the version of force this 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.340
 version of force that I am 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.430
 putting here we stayed in the version 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.740
 of forums or that we double-click and 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.210
 We install client and accept that 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.120
 will install towards the force ok 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.890
 you have to follow the steps as well 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.200
 I'm doing it because if they do not 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.540
 so they will not have the package 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.290
 of multi installed correctly as 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.860
 must be 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.510
 okay 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.519
 everything is being downloaded 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.829
 and that may take depends on the internet 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.959
 because what he does is stay strong 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.960
 they begin to create a few things and nothing 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.990
 plus 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.810
 there they were here I do not know what dance 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.480
 sometimes it makes it worse sometimes late 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.610
 there is how the force was installed 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.840
 there has already been installed foxx you 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.880
 it can be compared so that of being 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.730
 version and they're going to have this that says ok 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.130
 force 9 points I do not know how much no 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.350
 now what they are going to do is that these 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.360
 three files, we're going to 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.340
 drag to the folder 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.689
 to the micro point folder once 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.930
 done that we see again in our 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.930
 launcher 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.980
 and we go so I know what is charged and the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.840
 launcher no 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.930
 as normally as they do 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.520
 usually 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.400
 there is 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.319
 there is now here if what I want that 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.180
 pay attention because here where 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.310
 you are going to make him carry the fort 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.560
 they are going to go to this part of here and 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.800
 you are going to see here what force says 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.750
 of great power here force ok and great play 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.599
 with the same user logically not 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.490
 because what what fortes if they want 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:17.249
 you can modify it you can change to 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:21.689
 whose series of mods 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:23.909
 and we will be as you can see and this 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.559
 would we say your serial profile of 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.779
 modes and I already wanted you to complete now that 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:30.089
 we are going to give him play and now he expects 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:32.459
 load all the mods already with the force 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.469
 ready here have we say that I already had the 

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:38.249
 ready everything I'm going to pass here the video 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:40.649
 for while loading the folder that it takes 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:43.470
 I think a little because they are hundred or so 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:45.090
 let's hope he wanted to come back 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.180
 because there are people like you can see it says 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.940
 that we have 122 mutz that are already like me 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.880
 I am left with my final package and even in the 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.170
 oct efe has already installed and all that would be 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.820
 everything is this what the interaction of 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.440
 Couple that I have I hope you enjoy it and 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.730
 do not forget to leave your law and a comment 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.200
 and burn the social networks that are in 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:05.390
