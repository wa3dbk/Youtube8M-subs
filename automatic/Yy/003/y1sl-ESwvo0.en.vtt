this<00:00:33.390> might<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.750> interesting<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.500> around

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
this might be interesting to do around

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.160 
this might be interesting to do around
the<00:00:34.890> active<00:00:35.280> site<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:36.420> protein<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.899> your

mind while drawing objects using Jaimal

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.009 
mind while drawing objects using Jaimal
is<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.649> every<00:01:02.100> object<00:01:02.340> has<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.910> name<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> this

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
is that every object has a name and this

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
is that every object has a name and this
includes<00:01:04.559> isosurfaces<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.760> molecular

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
includes isosurfaces and molecular

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.330 
includes isosurfaces and molecular
orbitals<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.750> well<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.710> assign<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> name

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
orbitals as well you can assign a name

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.910 
orbitals as well you can assign a name
to<00:01:08.700> every<00:01:09.030> object<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> draw<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.650> first

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
to every object you draw as the first

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.580 
to every object you draw as the first
parameter<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.760> any<00:01:12.090> command<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.689> issue<00:01:12.869> if

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
parameter of any command you issue if

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
parameter of any command you issue if
you<00:01:13.799> don't<00:01:14.070> specify<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.700> name<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> an<00:01:15.180> object

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you don't specify the name of an object

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840 
you don't specify the name of an object
then<00:01:15.990> every<00:01:16.320> time<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.560> try<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> draw<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> second

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
then every time you try to draw a second

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.160 
then every time you try to draw a second
object<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> same<00:01:18.600> type

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
object of the same type

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.710 
object of the same type
the<00:01:19.470> first<00:01:19.770> object<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.430> replaced<00:01:20.729> so

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the first object will get replaced so

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870 
the first object will get replaced so
for<00:01:21.900> instance<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> had<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> Jaimal<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.250> which

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
for instance if I had a Jaimal on which

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270 
for instance if I had a Jaimal on which
I<00:01:24.030> wanted<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> draw<00:01:24.540> two<00:01:24.900> arrows<00:01:25.380> then<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> would

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I wanted to draw two arrows then I would

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.980 
I wanted to draw two arrows then I would
have<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.520> provide<00:01:26.759> two<00:01:27.060> different<00:01:27.600> names<00:01:27.810> for

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
have to provide two different names for

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.080 
have to provide two different names for
each<00:01:28.170> arrow<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.799> order<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.250> both<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.579> appear<00:01:29.939> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
each arrow in order for both to appear I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.020 
each arrow in order for both to appear I
could<00:01:30.479> use<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.869> draw<00:01:31.200> obj<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.310> command<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
could use the draw obj one command to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
could use the draw obj one command to
draw<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> first<00:01:33.840> arrow<00:01:34.170> from<00:01:34.470> atom<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
draw the first arrow from atom one to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.280 
draw the first arrow from atom one to
atom<00:01:35.310> three<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.659> draw<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> second

atom three and then to draw the second

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.020 
atom three and then to draw the second
arrow<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> change<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.640> label

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
arrow I would have to change that label

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.719 
arrow I would have to change that label
from<00:01:39.210> obj<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.740> something<00:01:41.100> different<00:01:41.520> say
