downside of that and what the in took
advantage<00:04:13.960> of<00:04:14.230> is<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:14.800> these<00:04:16.080> implants<00:04:17.549> can

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
advantage of is that these implants can

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.920 
advantage of is that these implants can
be<00:04:18.580> hacked<00:04:18.910> into<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.590> guys<00:04:21.370> definitely<00:04:21.930> hope

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
be hacked into so guys definitely hope

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.200 
be hacked into so guys definitely hope
