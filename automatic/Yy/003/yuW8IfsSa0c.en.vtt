00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
out the seats at the back and put a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.369 
out the seats at the back and put a
shirt<00:00:48.930> there<00:00:49.250> however<00:00:50.250> as<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.120> see

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
shirt there however as you can just see

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.069

the<00:00:52.379> doors<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.480> kit<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.690> actually

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the doors on this kit are actually

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
the doors on this kit are actually
rather<00:00:55.350> some<00:00:56.539> they<00:00:57.539> come<00:00:57.780> off<00:00:57.899> easily<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:59.600> yo

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
rather some they come off easily and yo

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
rather some they come off easily and yo
so<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.289> only<00:01:01.500> open<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.219> door<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so you can only open one door at the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.200 
so you can only open one door at the
time<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.080> example<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.010> open<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.939> door

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
time so for example if I open this door

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.080 
time so for example if I open this door
I<00:01:06.510> cannot<00:01:06.990> open<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.680> door<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.189> blocks<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.880> if

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
I cannot open this door it blocks and if

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.289 
I cannot open this door it blocks and if
you<00:01:09.210> try<00:01:09.510> they'll<00:01:09.780> fall<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.850> well<00:01:11.850> they<00:01:12.060> go

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you try they'll fall up and well they go

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.719 
you try they'll fall up and well they go
and<00:01:12.659> also<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.680> could<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.130> seen<00:01:14.369> there's

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and also as you could have seen there's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.700 
and also as you could have seen there's
no<00:01:14.970> actual<00:01:15.390> steering<00:01:15.750> wheel<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> guess<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
no actual steering wheel but I guess I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.469 
no actual steering wheel but I guess I
mean<00:01:16.890> who<00:01:17.159> cares<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.850> add<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
mean who cares you can add one if you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.620 
mean who cares you can add one if you
modify<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.670> that's<00:01:20.670> about<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
modify it and that's about it I think it

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.160 
modify it and that's about it I think it
well<00:01:22.200> also<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:23.040> before<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.400> finish<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.780> size

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
well also just before we finish the size

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.770 
well also just before we finish the size
is<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> bit<00:01:26.040> too<00:01:26.340> large<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:26.970> actual<00:01:27.240> minifig

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
is a bit too large for an actual minifig

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.990 
is a bit too large for an actual minifig
if<00:01:28.110> they<00:01:28.530> still<00:01:28.799> fit<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.310> however<00:01:29.549> in

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
if they still fit in there however in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
if they still fit in there however in
terms<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.259> scale<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.130> bit<00:01:32.280> too<00:01:32.460> large

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
terms of the scale it's a bit too large

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.109 
terms of the scale it's a bit too large
for<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.970> minifig<00:01:33.390> sadly<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.470> see<00:01:35.119> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
for a minifig sadly as you can see the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.760 
for a minifig sadly as you can see the
minifig<00:01:36.509> barely<00:01:36.869> makes<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.560> height

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
minifig barely makes it up to the height

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.069 
minifig barely makes it up to the height
of<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.040> actual<00:01:38.310> doors<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.540> terms<00:01:39.840> of

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
of the actual doors so in terms of

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.929 
of the actual doors so in terms of
animation<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.829> makes<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.159> bit<00:01:41.369> difficult<00:01:41.579> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
animation it makes a bit difficult to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.260 
animation it makes a bit difficult to
animate<00:01:42.450> them<00:01:42.659> getting<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.250> also<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
animate them getting in also if the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.719 
animate them getting in also if the
actual<00:01:45.659> thing<00:01:45.689> looks<00:01:46.110> more<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> truck<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
actual thing looks more like a truck to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.450 
actual thing looks more like a truck to
the<00:01:47.820> minifigs<00:01:48.240> scale<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> car

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the minifigs scale then and then a car

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.520 
the minifigs scale then and then a car
which<00:01:50.729> was<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.299> kuba<00:01:51.659> wagons<00:01:52.079> real<00:01:52.649> purpose

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
which was the kuba wagons real purpose

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
which was the kuba wagons real purpose
overall<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.740> would<00:01:55.979> recommend<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.549> kit<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
overall we would recommend this kit it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.410 
overall we would recommend this kit it
is<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> decent<00:01:57.869> price<00:01:58.079> here<00:01:58.490> for<00:01:59.490> $35<00:02:00.270> you're

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
is a decent price here for $35 you're

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.389
