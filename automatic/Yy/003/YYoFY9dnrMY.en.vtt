00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
I was hoping for more cards especially

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.190 
I was hoping for more cards especially

gekido bond that is why he is easily a
miss<00:03:09.440> but<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.099> feel<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.090> incomplete<00:03:11.630> form

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
miss but I feel that the incomplete form

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.080 
miss but I feel that the incomplete form
is<00:03:12.140> much<00:03:12.410> better<00:03:12.709> than<00:03:13.160> Kamen<00:03:13.579> Rider<00:03:13.849> decade

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090
