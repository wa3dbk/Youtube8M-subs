00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.120
 but very welcome to this your 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.799
 channel we talk android today 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.639
 we are going to teach how to install the club 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.170
 world in this galaxy 6 m version but 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.300
 it will also be compatible for the version 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.139
 and the version was so they called us 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.139
 we start 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.140
 Well let's start with this 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.610
 installation first of all I have to 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.620
 make an observation is 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.650
 normal club installation for this 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.160
 specific version that is the m 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.170
 Well, give a little problem, do not install 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.030
 completely you work laziness 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.160
 if you can use it without any problem 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.050
 but when restarting your computer 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.060
 it does not stay permanent so they go to 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.770
 have to flash it every time 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.660
 want to use it, that's the only one 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.670
 negative point everything else works 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.800
 perfectly so well let's go to 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.020
 start first they need root 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.750
 on your phone and download the file 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.090
 I'm going to leave here in 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.070
 description of the video if your phone does not 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.260
 he has root so we also leave him the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.840
 link so they can root it but 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.030
 well already having root on your phone and 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.070
 having already downloaded the file have 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.470
 that put it here in external memory 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.930
 of your phone and that is the first step 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.450
 the second they have to rebound in what 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.079
 it's recovery let's turn off this phone 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.079
 we are going to 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.570
 to give him to pay 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 I do not put here 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.420
 ok once it's off we have to 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.880
 do the volume combination above 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.050
 home and power at the same time we are going to 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.050
 wait for it to restart 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.760
 look at missionals 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.840
 here starts the second and we let go 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.200
 ok and we already have the normal record now 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.250
 what we have to do is go to play 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.780
 out for medicare or menu and look for the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.090
 file that is this club work 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.920
 here is this is for the version is 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.210
 we give him 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.220
 here and we go to the recovery 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.800
 we have everything already activated 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.110
 flyer kernel is custom rooms 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.930
 we can make waves what you 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.580
 want so this is ready as they 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.320
 I repeat the only negative point 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.600
 is that when restarting again 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.370
 the phone if we want to center the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.100
 recovery is going to be normal 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.310
 that this is the only negative thing we are going 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.230
 then to 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.230
 Root the phone 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.719

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.969
