okay we're gonna be making this flower
thing<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:03.060> don't<00:00:03.179> know<00:00:03.449> what<00:00:03.659> it's<00:00:03.870> called<00:00:04.230> but

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 
thing I don't know what it's called but

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:45.869 
thing I don't know what it's called but
first<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.850> need<00:00:06.000> square

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:01:30.380 

now<00:00:46.879> fold<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:47.600> in<00:00:47.930> half<00:00:56.650> then<00:00:57.650> you<00:00:57.830> cut<00:00:58.129> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.260 

you<00:01:31.390> don't<00:01:31.600> need<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.930> other<00:01:31.960> half<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:34.210> you

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
you don't need the other half now you

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:47.789 
you don't need the other half now you
fold<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:35.020> one<00:01:35.320> in<00:01:35.560> half<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.409> fold<00:01:47.649> it

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
fold this one in half then you fold it

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:59.070 
fold this one in half then you fold it
in<00:01:47.920> half<00:01:47.950> again<00:01:57.000> make<00:01:58.000> sure<00:01:58.209> their<00:01:58.450> openings

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
in half again make sure their openings

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:18.990 
in half again make sure their openings
there<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.390> fold<00:02:01.659> into<00:02:02.080> force

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.100 

now<00:02:20.000> make<00:02:20.450> sure<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.810> fold<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.320> this<00:02:21.710> way<00:02:26.110> with

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
now make sure you fold it this way with

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.250 
now make sure you fold it this way with
both<00:02:27.350> sides<00:02:28.209> they're<00:02:29.209> pretty<00:02:29.570> much<00:02:29.720> doing<00:02:30.020> a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
both sides they're pretty much doing a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.430 
both sides they're pretty much doing a
mirror<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:31.220> know

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.650 

then<00:02:39.440> just<00:02:39.860> unfold<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.700> all<00:02:42.070> now<00:02:43.070> grab<00:02:43.520> that

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
then just unfold it all now grab that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.610 
then just unfold it all now grab that
opening<00:02:44.660> there<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:48.050> edge<00:02:48.260> right<00:02:48.560> there

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
opening there and the edge right there

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.320 
opening there and the edge right there
just<00:02:49.550> move<00:02:49.850> it

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
just move it

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.500 
just move it
hold<00:02:51.020> it<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.489> should<00:02:52.730> look<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.000> this

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
hold it but it should look like this

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.190 
hold it but it should look like this
later<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:56.209> do<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:58.510> just<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.780> way<00:03:00.020> and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
later then you do this just that way and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.710 
later then you do this just that way and
then<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.650> make<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:00.890> flat<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.820> should<00:03:02.180> have<00:03:02.420> DS

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
then you make it flat it should have DS

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.150 
then you make it flat it should have DS
and<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.930> do<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.320> same<00:03:06.530> thing<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.130> other

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
and you do the same thing to the other

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:44.380 
and you do the same thing to the other
side<00:03:14.440> now<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.500> start<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.220> fold<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:17.239> this

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:58.710 

now<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.450> fold<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.440> back

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.310 

now<00:03:59.720> this<00:04:00.230> party<00:04:00.710> gets<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.100> little<00:04:01.250> tricky<00:04:02.320> you

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
now this party gets a little tricky you

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:20.190 
now this party gets a little tricky you
have<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.530> open<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.600> insert<00:04:06.010> their<00:04:07.010> DS

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:34.900 

just<00:04:21.200> keep<00:04:21.500> doing<00:04:21.980> it<00:04:22.220> with<00:04:22.460> both<00:04:22.670> sides<00:04:33.910> now

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
just keep doing it with both sides now

00:04:34.910 --> 00:05:02.750 
just keep doing it with both sides now
you<00:04:34.970> did<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.420> same<00:04:35.660> thing<00:04:35.720> with<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.230> back

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.160 

now<00:05:03.760> start<00:05:04.510> folding<00:05:04.780> these<00:05:05.200> edges<00:05:06.070> they're<00:05:07.170> so

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
now start folding these edges they're so

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:28.740 
now start folding these edges they're so
aligned<00:05:26.370> then<00:05:27.370> just<00:05:27.669> fold<00:05:27.850> it<00:05:28.030> again<00:05:28.120> but<00:05:28.600> the

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
aligned then just fold it again but the

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:39.330 
aligned then just fold it again but the
opposite<00:05:29.350> direction<00:05:29.740> now<00:05:37.919> this<00:05:38.919> part<00:05:39.220> gets

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
opposite direction now this part gets

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.510 
opposite direction now this part gets
hard<00:05:40.770> grab<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.970> bottom<00:05:43.480> here<00:05:43.750> see<00:05:44.230> then<00:05:45.220> just

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
hard grab the bottom here see then just

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.460 
hard grab the bottom here see then just
open<00:05:46.410> make<00:05:47.410> sure<00:05:47.620> these<00:05:47.950> sides<00:05:48.370> go<00:05:48.940> in

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
open make sure these sides go in

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.310 
open make sure these sides go in
pointing<00:05:50.470> down<00:05:50.770> when<00:05:51.310> you're<00:05:51.460> lifting<00:05:51.730> it

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
pointing down when you're lifting it

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.890 
pointing down when you're lifting it
then<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.680> inside<00:05:54.160> right<00:05:55.060> on<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.419> back<00:05:55.600> just

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
then the inside right on the back just

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:17.339 
then the inside right on the back just
push<00:05:56.229> it<00:05:56.500> with<00:05:56.710> your<00:05:56.740> finger<00:05:57.310> or<00:05:57.550> something

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
now just open it from the middle where a

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.640 
now just open it from the middle where a
look<00:06:24.439> like<00:06:24.650> this<00:06:24.919> with<00:06:25.189> both<00:06:25.400> sides<00:06:26.650> except

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
look like this with both sides except

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.700 
look like this with both sides except
one<00:06:27.889> side<00:06:28.159> will<00:06:28.340> have<00:06:28.520> this<00:06:28.699> opening<00:06:29.710> we're

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
one side will have this opening we're

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.679 
one side will have this opening we're
not<00:06:30.889> at<00:06:31.039> that<00:06:31.219> part<00:06:31.460> yet<00:06:31.729> but<00:06:34.330> not<00:06:35.330> the<00:06:35.479> one

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:35.689 
not at that part yet but not the one

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:40.140 
not at that part yet but not the one
without<00:06:36.139> opening<00:06:36.680> you<00:06:36.889> just<00:06:37.129> fold<00:06:37.430> it<00:06:38.169> yeah

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
without opening you just fold it yeah
