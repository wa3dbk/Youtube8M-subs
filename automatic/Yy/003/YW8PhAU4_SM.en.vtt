00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
types of mass that we have low volume

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.920 
types of mass that we have low volume
high<00:00:31.050> volume<00:00:31.980> frameless<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.210> purge<00:00:33.600> and

let's<00:00:47.370> talk<00:00:47.550> about<00:00:47.610> low<00:00:48.149> volume<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:48.989> that

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
let's talk about low volume because that

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.740 
let's talk about low volume because that
fits<00:00:49.530> 90%<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> people<00:00:50.760> spaces<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
fits 90% of the people spaces in the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.630 
fits 90% of the people spaces in the
world<00:00:51.780> low<00:00:52.770> volume<00:00:53.280> masts<00:00:53.520> are<00:00:55.219> either<00:00:56.219> with

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
world low volume masts are either with

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.319 
world low volume masts are either with
one<00:00:56.969> huge<00:00:57.600> window<00:00:58.199> frame<00:00:58.640> they<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.879> come<00:01:00.120> with

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
one huge window frame they can come with

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
one huge window frame they can come with
two<00:01:00.600> window<00:01:01.320> frames<00:01:01.879> or<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:04.049> they<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.619> come

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
two window frames or and they can come

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.539 
two window frames or and they can come
in<00:01:05.189> clear<00:01:05.760> silicone<00:01:06.540> now<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:08.010> depends

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
in clear silicone now it really depends

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.090 
in clear silicone now it really depends
on<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.939> style<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.049> type<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.530> mass<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
on the style or the type of mass and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.370 
on the style or the type of mass and
this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> personal<00:01:12.210> preference<00:01:12.810> whether

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
this is the personal preference whether

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.550 
this is the personal preference whether
you<00:01:13.650> buy<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> mass<00:01:14.369> with<00:01:14.790> black<00:01:15.420> silicone<00:01:16.110> or

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you buy a mass with black silicone or

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.039 
you buy a mass with black silicone or
you<00:01:16.920> buy<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.670> clear<00:01:18.000> silicone<00:01:18.270> now

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
you buy one with clear silicone now

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
you buy one with clear silicone now
personally<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.040> wear<00:01:20.310> sunglasses<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
personally I like to wear sunglasses a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.899 
personally I like to wear sunglasses a
lot<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.930> wearing<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.439> black<00:01:22.710> mask<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.549> same

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
lot so wearing a black mask is the same

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
lot so wearing a black mask is the same
as<00:01:24.150> football<00:01:24.570> players<00:01:24.619> baseball<00:01:25.619> players

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
as football players baseball players

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
as football players baseball players
wearing<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.700> black<00:01:26.939> underneath<00:01:27.390> their<00:01:27.840> eyes

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
wearing the black underneath their eyes

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.219 
wearing the black underneath their eyes
it<00:01:28.500> helps<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> shave<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.610> mass<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> like

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it helps to shave the mass so I like

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.469 
it helps to shave the mass so I like
wearing<00:01:31.590> sunglasses<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> prefer<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> black

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
wearing sunglasses so I prefer a black

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359 
wearing sunglasses so I prefer a black
mask<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.290> don't<00:01:34.470> need<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.890> light

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
mask because I don't need all that light

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.460 
mask because I don't need all that light
proof<00:01:35.729> now<00:01:36.240> some<00:01:36.509> people<00:01:36.689> don't<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
proof now some people don't like it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
proof now some people don't like it
because<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.189> too<00:01:38.400> dark<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.970> again<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.360> is

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
because it's too dark and again this is

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.300 
because it's too dark and again this is
a<00:01:39.570> personal<00:01:40.110> preference<00:01:40.650> whether<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.130> go

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
a personal preference whether you go

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.569 
a personal preference whether you go
black<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.090> go<00:01:42.299> clear<00:01:42.750> frame<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:44.340> is

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
black or you go clear frame and this is

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.890 
black or you go clear frame and this is
a<00:01:44.880> mask<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.869> course<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> clear

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
a mask of course with the clear

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.460 
a mask of course with the clear
frame<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.940> it<00:01:49.180> lets<00:01:49.480> a<00:01:49.630> lot<00:01:49.840> more<00:01:50.170> light

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
frame and it lets a lot more light

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.400 
frame and it lets a lot more light
through<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.280> clear<00:01:51.700> silicone<00:01:52.050> now<00:01:53.050> this<00:01:53.230> is

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
through the clear silicone now this is

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.070 
through the clear silicone now this is
one<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.830> largest<00:01:54.430> windowpane<00:01:55.330> masks<00:01:55.690> this

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
one of the largest windowpane masks this

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.680 
one of the largest windowpane masks this
is<00:01:56.320> called<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.190> visualizer<00:01:57.790> it's<00:01:58.150> called

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
is called the visualizer it's called

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.570 
is called the visualizer it's called
something<00:01:59.170> else<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.650> different<00:02:00.040> brand

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
something else and different brand

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.020 
something else and different brand
styles<00:02:01.120> but<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.920> probably<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.880> most

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
styles but this is probably the most

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.940 
styles but this is probably the most
visually<00:02:07.030> large<00:02:07.510> reference<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.440> masks<00:02:08.710> that

visually large reference that masks that

over<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.730> feet<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.270> ears<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.050> so<00:04:04.920> it

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
over the feet of the ears and so it

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.150 
over the feet of the ears and so it
doesn't<00:04:05.400> cut<00:04:05.610> into<00:04:05.970> my<00:04:06.120> ears<00:04:06.510> okay<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:07.980> is

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
doesn't cut into my ears okay so this is

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.220 
doesn't cut into my ears okay so this is
a<00:04:08.190> perfect<00:04:08.760> fitting<00:04:08.940> mask<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.600> this<00:04:09.720> happens

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
a perfect fitting mask and this happens

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.080 
a perfect fitting mask and this happens
to<00:04:10.380> be<00:04:10.410> my<00:04:10.560> men's<00:04:11.010> this<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.580> one<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.760> wear

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
to be my men's this is the one I wear

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.950 
to be my men's this is the one I wear
all<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.330> time<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.840> teach<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:13.980> this<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.400> a

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
all the time to teach it so this is a

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.020 
all the time to teach it so this is a
again<00:04:15.960> a<00:04:15.990> low<00:04:16.380> volume<00:04:16.739> mass<00:04:17.190> these<00:04:17.670> three

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
again a low volume mass these three

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.510 
again a low volume mass these three
let's<00:04:18.600> go<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.050> high<00:04:19.230> volume<00:04:19.500> mass<00:04:19.950> quickly

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
let's go to the high volume mass quickly

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.360 
let's go to the high volume mass quickly
as<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.210> can<00:04:21.390> see<00:04:21.690> these<00:04:22.350> have<00:04:22.650> window<00:04:23.070> panes

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
as you can see these have window panes

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.420 
as you can see these have window panes
on<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:23.850> side<00:04:24.090> so<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.930> volume<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.770> mask<00:04:26.040> of

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
on the side so the volume of the mask of

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.640 
on the side so the volume of the mask of
that<00:04:26.640> volume<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.300> air<00:04:27.510> inside<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:28.290> greater

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
that volume of the air inside is greater

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.800 
that volume of the air inside is greater
and<00:04:29.310> some<00:04:29.700> people<00:04:30.030> like<00:04:30.210> these<00:04:30.540> better

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
and some people like these better

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.080 
and some people like these better
because<00:04:31.380> they<00:04:31.560> do<00:04:31.620> allow<00:04:32.070> more<00:04:32.400> peripheral

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
because they do allow more peripheral

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.720 
because they do allow more peripheral
vision<00:04:33.510> okay<00:04:33.870> but<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.470> problem<00:04:35.370> with<00:04:35.520> these

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
vision okay but the problem with these

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.140 
vision okay but the problem with these
is<00:04:35.790> it<00:04:36.390> takes<00:04:36.720> more<00:04:37.080> air<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:38.220> clear<00:04:38.610> these<00:04:38.760> and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
is it takes more air to clear these and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.390 
is it takes more air to clear these and
how<00:04:39.600> do<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.780> clear<00:04:40.110> your<00:04:40.320> mask<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:40.890> blow<00:04:41.190> out

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
how do you clear your mask you blow out

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.100 
how do you clear your mask you blow out
your<00:04:41.430> nose<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.240> mean<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.450> can<00:04:42.570> take<00:04:42.720> a<00:04:42.780> deep

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
your nose I mean you can take a deep

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.140 
your nose I mean you can take a deep
breath<00:04:43.380> in<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:43.740> you<00:04:43.890> blow<00:04:44.130> out<00:04:44.340> your<00:04:44.370> nose<00:04:44.760> and

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
breath in and you blow out your nose and

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.110 
breath in and you blow out your nose and
that's<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.540> topic<00:04:46.110> for<00:04:46.500> another<00:04:46.560> video<00:04:47.040> but<00:04:47.580> it

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
that's a topic for another video but it

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.480 
that's a topic for another video but it
does<00:04:48.360> take<00:04:48.690> more<00:04:48.720> air<00:04:49.320> to<00:04:49.680> clear<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.220> type<00:04:50.460> of

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
does take more air to clear this type of

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.150 
does take more air to clear this type of
mask

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
mask

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.070 
mask
here's<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.250> high<00:04:53.520> another<00:04:53.880> volume<00:04:54.270> high<00:04:54.660> volume

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
here's a high another volume high volume

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.920 
here's a high another volume high volume
mask<00:04:55.380> with<00:04:56.040> up<00:04:56.280> again<00:04:56.550> more<00:04:56.970> windowpanes<00:04:57.690> on

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
mask with up again more windowpanes on

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.050 
mask with up again more windowpanes on
the<00:04:58.080> side<00:04:58.320> now<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:58.920> personally<00:04:59.370> have<00:04:59.760> tried

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
the side now I personally have tried

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.720 
the side now I personally have tried
these<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.720> don't<00:05:00.780> prefer<00:05:01.560> them<00:05:01.830> but<00:05:02.490> some

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
these and I don't prefer them but some

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.730 
these and I don't prefer them but some
people<00:05:03.090> really<00:05:03.300> like<00:05:03.600> them

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
people really like them

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.530 
people really like them
it's<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.520> again<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:05.940> is<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.240> personal

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
it's the again this is a personal

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.410 
it's the again this is a personal
preference<00:05:07.110> which<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:07.830> would<00:05:08.040> like<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:09.180> then

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
preference which you would like and then

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.470 
preference which you would like and then
we<00:05:09.690> have<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.200> purge<00:05:10.470> mask<00:05:10.860> which<00:05:11.730> has<00:05:12.150> a

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
we have the purge mask which has a

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.830 
we have the purge mask which has a
little<00:05:13.080> valve<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.830> underneath<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.850> nostrils

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
little valve and underneath the nostrils

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.100 
little valve and underneath the nostrils
so<00:05:16.320> when<00:05:16.770> you<00:05:16.890> do<00:05:17.100> get<00:05:17.250> water<00:05:17.550> in<00:05:17.850> it<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.750> can

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
so when you do get water in it you can

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.160 
so when you do get water in it you can
just<00:05:19.140> blow<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:19.920> out<00:05:20.100> now<00:05:21.060> with<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.330> regular<00:05:21.630> mask

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
just blow it out now with a regular mask

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.230 
just blow it out now with a regular mask
you're<00:05:22.530> gonna<00:05:22.620> have<00:05:22.920> to<00:05:23.100> tilt<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.580> up<00:05:23.760> just<00:05:24.090> a

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
you're gonna have to tilt it up just a

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.050 
you're gonna have to tilt it up just a
little<00:05:24.270> off<00:05:24.750> your<00:05:25.020> lip<00:05:25.230> while<00:05:25.530> you<00:05:25.680> blow<00:05:25.980> out

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
little off your lip while you blow out

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.240 
little off your lip while you blow out
to<00:05:27.060> clear<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.390> mask<00:05:27.780> however<00:05:28.500> with<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.980> purge

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
to clear the mask however with the purge

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.940 
to clear the mask however with the purge
valve<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.940> don't<00:05:30.300> need<00:05:30.600> to<00:05:30.810> do<00:05:31.020> that<00:05:31.200> okay

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
valve you don't need to do that okay

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.580 
valve you don't need to do that okay
it's<00:05:32.820> again<00:05:33.240> this<00:05:33.480> is<00:05:33.660> a<00:05:33.690> personal<00:05:34.320> preference

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
it's again this is a personal preference

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.040 
it's again this is a personal preference
whether<00:05:35.070> you<00:05:35.400> like<00:05:35.640> it<00:05:35.670> or<00:05:35.940> not<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.690> then<00:05:36.900> the

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
whether you like it or not and then the

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.340 
whether you like it or not and then the
fourth<00:05:37.380> style<00:05:37.800> is<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.850> children's<00:05:39.360> mask<00:05:39.630> now

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
fourth style is the children's mask now

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.890 
fourth style is the children's mask now
some<00:05:40.680> adults<00:05:41.280> are<00:05:41.460> not<00:05:41.640> big<00:05:42.000> enough<00:05:42.030> people<00:05:42.720> in

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
some adults are not big enough people in

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.100 
some adults are not big enough people in
their<00:05:43.080> face<00:05:43.410> to<00:05:44.160> wear<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.700> regular<00:05:45.120> adult<00:05:45.720> mask

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
their face to wear a regular adult mask

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.220 
their face to wear a regular adult mask
there<00:05:46.620> are<00:05:46.830> small<00:05:47.220> adults<00:05:47.790> usually<00:05:48.180> four<00:05:48.870> five

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
there are small adults usually four five

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.550 
there are small adults usually four five
foot<00:05:49.590> people<00:05:49.920> by<00:05:50.490> foot<00:05:50.820> to<00:05:51.090> need<00:05:51.840> a<00:05:51.870> kid's<00:05:52.260> mat

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
foot people by foot to need a kid's mat

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.940 
foot people by foot to need a kid's mat
so<00:05:52.890> as<00:05:53.010> you<00:05:53.190> can<00:05:53.370> see<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:54.360> kids<00:05:54.660> mask<00:05:54.990> here<00:05:55.530> is

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
so as you can see the kids mask here is

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.060 
so as you can see the kids mask here is
much<00:05:56.310> smaller<00:05:56.790> than<00:05:57.450> the<00:05:57.750> adult<00:05:58.110> mask<00:05:58.410> so<00:05:59.040> it

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
much smaller than the adult mask so it

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.550 
much smaller than the adult mask so it
just<00:05:59.430> depends<00:05:59.820> again<00:06:00.180> on<00:06:00.240> your<00:06:01.050> personal
