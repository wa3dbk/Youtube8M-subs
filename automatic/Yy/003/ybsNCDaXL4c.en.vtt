with this figure even for older figure
the<00:02:20.480> articulation<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.990> kind<00:02:22.530> of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
the articulation on it is kind of

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.660 
the articulation on it is kind of
hindered<00:02:23.010> by<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.460> jacket<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.740> still<00:02:26.520> is

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
hindered by that jacket but it still is

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.610 
hindered by that jacket but it still is
pretty<00:02:26.940> good<00:02:27.150> articulation<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:28.050> we<00:02:28.230> will<00:02:28.440> go

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
pretty good articulation and we will go

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.880 
pretty good articulation and we will go
into<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.160> detail<00:02:29.459> soon<00:02:30.230> kalu<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.470> stand

here in the face and all the tentacles
the<00:03:31.860> tentacle<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.400> his<00:03:32.489> hand<00:03:32.760> get<00:03:33.390> some<00:03:33.540> 3d

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the tentacle in his hand get some 3d

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.680 
the tentacle in his hand get some 3d
action<00:03:34.320> there<00:03:34.530> his<00:03:34.890> head<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.970> doesn't<00:03:36.269> move

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
action there his head it doesn't move

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.960 
action there his head it doesn't move
you<00:03:37.440> probably<00:03:37.739> can<00:03:38.190> move<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.489> but<00:03:38.640> it's<00:03:38.790> so

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
you probably can move it but it's so

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.229 
you probably can move it but it's so
stiff<00:03:39.330> there's<00:03:39.600> not<00:03:40.110> even<00:03:40.140> can<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.799> try<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.459> so

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
stiff there's not even can I try it so

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.840 
stiff there's not even can I try it so
ball<00:03:42.450> joint<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:43.019> this<00:03:43.350> shoulder<00:03:43.650> here<00:03:44.750> is

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
ball joint in this shoulder here is

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.460 
ball joint in this shoulder here is
articulation<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.590> upper<00:03:49.590> arm<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:52.290> in

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
articulation in that upper arm and in

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.370 
articulation in that upper arm and in
the<00:03:52.590> elbow<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.959> hand<00:03:55.290> spin<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.100> ramp<00:03:57.380> its

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
the elbow and the hand spin the ramp its

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.640 
the elbow and the hand spin the ramp its
articulation<00:03:58.709> in<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.310> waist

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.280 

the<00:04:02.489> legs<00:04:02.879> are<00:04:04.069> underneath<00:04:05.069> this<00:04:05.750> suit<00:04:06.750> here

the legs are underneath this suit here

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.640 
the legs are underneath this suit here
so<00:04:08.189> it<00:04:08.310> doesn't<00:04:08.700> move<00:04:08.939> other<00:04:09.450> than<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.349> knee

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
so it doesn't move other than the knee

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.229 
so it doesn't move other than the knee
joint<00:04:10.920> here<00:04:11.610> it<00:04:11.819> bends<00:04:13.250> it's<00:04:14.250> like<00:04:14.519> nothing

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
joint here it bends it's like nothing

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.300 
joint here it bends it's like nothing
that<00:04:15.510> moves<00:04:15.720> other<00:04:15.900> than<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.199> knee<00:04:16.380> and

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
that moves other than the knee and

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.330 
that moves other than the knee and
there's<00:04:17.579> no<00:04:18.019> there's<00:04:19.019> no<00:04:19.109> feet<00:04:19.560> articulation

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
there's no there's no feet articulation

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.400 
there's no there's no feet articulation
here<00:04:20.579> well<00:04:21.060> here's<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.329> paint<00:04:21.600> job<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.139> legs

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
here well here's a paint job of the legs

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.100 
here well here's a paint job of the legs
you<00:04:23.039> can<00:04:23.220> tell<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.669> it's<00:04:23.699> got<00:04:24.060> some<00:04:24.660> paint

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
you can tell that it's got some paint

you can tell that it's got some paint
splatter<00:04:25.500> here<00:04:26.240> I'm<00:04:27.240> gonna<00:04:27.509> assume<00:04:27.900> this<00:04:28.500> is

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
splatter here I'm gonna assume this is

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.670 
splatter here I'm gonna assume this is

this a tentacle here also rotates you

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.020 
this a tentacle here also rotates you
can't<00:05:45.900> take<00:05:46.169> this<00:05:46.440> piece<00:05:46.830> off<00:05:47.039> the<00:05:47.310> arm<00:05:47.430> so

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
can't take this piece off the arm so

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.490 
can't take this piece off the arm so
that<00:05:48.060> that's<00:05:48.389> kind<00:05:48.690> of<00:05:48.720> a<00:05:48.840> Down<00:05:49.139> point

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
that that's kind of a Down point

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.830 
that that's kind of a Down point
honestly<00:05:49.789> because<00:05:50.789> if<00:05:51.180> you<00:05:51.360> could<00:05:51.510> take<00:05:51.659> this

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
honestly because if you could take this

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.399 
honestly because if you could take this
off<00:05:52.080> it<00:05:52.380> would<00:05:53.000> be<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.330> be<00:05:54.599> more<00:05:54.810> manageable

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
off it would be and be more manageable

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.610 
off it would be and be more manageable
instead<00:05:56.250> it<00:05:56.340> has<00:05:56.430> to<00:05:56.639> stay<00:05:56.970> there<00:05:57.320> and<00:05:58.320> kind<00:05:58.560> of

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
instead it has to stay there and kind of

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.700 
instead it has to stay there and kind of
be<00:05:58.770> a<00:05:58.800> hindrance<00:05:59.570> but<00:06:00.570> all<00:06:00.810> in<00:06:01.080> all<00:06:01.229> this<00:06:01.470> is<00:06:01.530> a

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
be a hindrance but all in all this is a

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.570 
be a hindrance but all in all this is a
really<00:06:02.130> cool<00:06:02.310> figure<00:06:03.169> and<00:06:04.169> just<00:06:05.070> take<00:06:05.250> a<00:06:05.340> look

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
really cool figure and just take a look

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.709 
really cool figure and just take a look
at<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.180> Stinger<00:06:06.889> right<00:06:07.889> there<00:06:08.479> it's<00:06:09.479> pretty

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:09.719 
at the Stinger right there it's pretty

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:14.390 
at the Stinger right there it's pretty
basic<00:06:09.990> and<00:06:12.320> this<00:06:13.320> is<00:06:13.560> from<00:06:13.800> like<00:06:13.979> trying<00:06:14.340> to

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
basic and this is from like trying to

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.830 
basic and this is from like trying to
put

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
put

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.680 
put
in<00:06:14.990> his<00:06:15.110> hand<00:06:15.380> and<00:06:15.680> kind<00:06:16.669> of<00:06:16.850> made<00:06:17.270> these<00:06:17.419> marks

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
in his hand and kind of made these marks

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.379 
in his hand and kind of made these marks
which<00:06:18.080> is<00:06:18.260> honestly<00:06:19.130> you<00:06:19.340> know<00:06:19.460> that's<00:06:19.669> that's

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
which is honestly you know that's that's

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.300 
which is honestly you know that's that's
not<00:06:20.660> something<00:06:20.960> that<00:06:21.050> you<00:06:21.139> look<00:06:21.320> forward<00:06:21.740> to

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
not something that you look forward to

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.800 
not something that you look forward to
so<00:06:22.669> that's<00:06:22.880> kind<00:06:23.180> of<00:06:23.240> that's<00:06:23.540> kind<00:06:23.810> of<00:06:23.870> crappy

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
so that's kind of that's kind of crappy

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.010 
so that's kind of that's kind of crappy
this<00:06:26.810> is<00:06:27.110> the<00:06:27.440> base<00:06:27.770> that<00:06:28.010> it<00:06:28.100> comes<00:06:28.280> with

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
this is the base that it comes with

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.530 
this is the base that it comes with
let's<00:06:30.020> brainy<00:06:30.760> all<00:06:31.760> in<00:06:31.970> all<00:06:32.090> this<00:06:32.240> is<00:06:32.300> an
