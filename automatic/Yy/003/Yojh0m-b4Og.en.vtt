00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:08.380
 hi my name is andrea again here 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.870
 with the video of the week so 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.269
 say it and now this time 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.210
 I bring the unlocking of the pattern or 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.030
 factory reset of the sony xperia 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.160
 this is the model that I have here but 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.789
 what I am going to teach you is used to 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.300
 any of 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.730
 of the xperia without any problem here 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.859
 I already have my team totally good 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.210
 I have it with applications and I'm going 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.250
 little bit excuse me but I'm 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.390
 going through the camera again here I record 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.839
 and here they are taught this good there are two 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.360
 modes to restart the phone I would 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.030
 I'll teach that everyone is 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.100
 he knows they go to configurations when they 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.519
 open settings are going to go up 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.989
 where it says backup and restoration almost 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.479
 it is not the case to distinguish them in fact 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.250
 I go to the camera and take it to where 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.049
 it says reset factory data that 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.519
 this option here that is going to 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.699
 appear the accounts that you have 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:08.299
 linked and in this part of here below 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.390
 they will appear to erase everything and itch 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.890
 here to erase everything good and I'm going to 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.040
 ask for the pattern and then as long as 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.900
 have it to start restarting this 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.479
 case I 'm not going to restart what this 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.310
 I'll show you another trick 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.530
 because because in my channel I already have 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.200
 one of a samsung galaxy 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.570
 is practically with the button of the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.049
 volume down the ignition and 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.070
 off and with the menu button in this 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.320
 xperia does not have the button 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.580
 it sounds but it's not a fact button 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.910
 they are tactile and I am thinking of doing them 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.280
 boxing of this team because it fascinates me 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.500
 what is the range is getting some 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.110
 good application without so much rodeo we 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.970
 let's go simply with the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.119
 following steps are very simple not 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.310
 they have nothing complicated nothing nothing nothing 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.140
 and I repeat it here in this part here and 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.690
 all my applications appear 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.270
 I have the ones that I downloaded as websites or 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.509
 pixar to manage the page at 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.370
 famous game candy core the application of 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.220
 the mark of forgiveness blue telephony 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.100
 etcetera but it is very simple I 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.810
 I will restart completely without the 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.489
 need the buttons because because 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.030
 until this year I'm investigating and I think 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.300
 I think that for xperia there is no 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.769
 buttons if you know leave it to me 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.650
 I work on the comment because I 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.920
 I would like very much to also know a third 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.140
 option but well quickly I'm going to 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.299
 explain is very simple just follow 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.360
 the steps if you have any questions 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.760
 I repeat, comment here below and I 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.190
 I'll give some good solution let's start 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.470
 let's phone 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.180
 is using the dialing here appears the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.760
 dialing and I get the calls that 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.370
 I have done but we are going to be based on 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.730
 this keyboard that is here we are going to 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.540
 mark the following is asterisk let me 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.540
 quickly 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.530
 I'm sorry I did not expect something like that 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.310
 7 200 200 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.280
 sorry 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.620
 it's over quickly with good again 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.200
 we leave with an asterisk 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.129
 cat 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.500
 asterisk cat 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:40.850
 73 78 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:44.510
 4 2 3 and again cat asterisk cat 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.420
 asterisk in automatic sends you to this 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.430
 the minor appears to them that good service 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.440
 Configuration services information 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.740
 it's something that says go services tests and 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.910
 customization settings are the say so 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.080
 farm and he took very bad English but it is 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.430
 for you to understand me is the 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.610
 last the last customization option 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.820
 settings or something like that they bite you there and you 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.510
 it's going to look like something that says custom reset 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.860
 and xÃ tiva if it is networks but really that 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.109
 if you are showing this because if 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.700
 there's no return quickly and go back to 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.370
 start because then I do not know what 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.590
 is happening they are stung there and they are going to 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.930
 appear in a legend they will put 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.580
 in accept 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.580
 and the phone is shutting down 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.600
 already the legend says that it is 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:40.750
 paying but I repeat it here is the 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.520
 cell phone and recording but then it 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.170
 is turning off and as for restart and 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.170
 the phone we come back 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.810
 and returned it did not take much longer 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.900
 the legend of sony appeared and I 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.410
 appeared the legend now of experian what 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.509
 I repeat this model is the xperia and I already 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:06.100
 I'm going to do the unboxing of this team 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:08.140
 I just acquired it but not no 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.970
 I could wait when I found this 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.320
 secret and I did it I said god I have to 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:18.390
 teach good I repeat is still there and in 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.390
 how much pledge I come back again 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.710
 ready I have returned now you have already learned 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:30.180
 they learned the little light of 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.190
 notification I hope and no longer late 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.930
 remains the same with the same legend that 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.220
 I do it this way is that I do not know 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.080
 reaches to distinguish but continues with the 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.650
 same legend of the xperia that is 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.479
 and keep learning it is normal that when 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.610
 well I at least when you update 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.520
 the phone to what is ice cream 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:53.830
 sanwich took too long to undertake not to 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.830
 worry is normal to keep delaying 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.990
 ready the phone made a small 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.930
 vibration 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.360
 and that's when I started recording it did not take long 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.460
 more than 5 seconds in showing this already 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.169
 are the language settings of everything that 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.400
 We have here we put in Spanish 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.949
 we skip 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.979
 all the options here come here 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:21.400
 I just put you wifi you can put 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.370
 search networks synchronize all your 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.060
 bills 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.490
 and as soon as step 8 of 8 ends 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.770
 there immediately we will see what 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.680
 is the android 4.0 that is the one that brings 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.090
 installed and once finished the 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.440
 configurations that you can 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:43.680
 slow down we practically have the 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.639
 phone restarted this can if of 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.729
 Suddenly the blockade is passed to them 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.990
 they finish their and their attempts with this what 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.479
 can do from the dialing of 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.160
 phones without any problem again 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.990
 we go here and how they will realize 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.690
 I do not have applications that had everything 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.120
 It's factory start and well, that's 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:07.110
 would be right now my video apologize for 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.330

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.990
 I hope and it has served them I already have it 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.190

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.889

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:58.080
 is the sony xperia 

00:07:55.009 --> 00:08:00.120
 For my part, everything is taken care of and I hope
