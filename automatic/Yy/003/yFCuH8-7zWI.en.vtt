I'll show you a video where I tested the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
I'll show you a video where I tested the
results<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.210> think<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.630> pretty<00:01:45.780> good<00:01:46.020> okay

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
results I think it's pretty good okay

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.670 
results I think it's pretty good okay
now<00:01:46.740> here's<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> test

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
now here's the test

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.370 
now here's the test
get<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.520> windscreen<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.570> new<00:01:50.690> windscreen<00:01:51.020> on

fan<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.590> just<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:02.710> see<00:02:03.710> how<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.880> deals<00:02:05.090> with

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
fan and just to see how it deals with

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.070 
fan and just to see how it deals with
the<00:02:05.720> wind<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:07.300> now<00:02:08.300> I'm<00:02:08.450> bringing<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:08.929> back

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:32.960 
down the fan I'm going to wring the
windscreen<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:17.710> Mike<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.880> same<00:02:20.270> height

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:48.149 

we'll<00:02:33.970> put<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.450> windscreen<00:02:35.230> back<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:47.159> will

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
move it back up to the fan again very

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.680 
move it back up to the fan again very
much<00:02:52.870> like<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.860> other<00:02:54.010> one<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:55.269> now<00:02:55.420> I'm<00:02:55.540> just

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
much like the other one so now I'm just

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.970 
much like the other one so now I'm just
talking<00:02:56.170> with<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.470> very<00:02:56.709> close<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.670> fans

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
talking with it very close to the fans

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.589 
talking with it very close to the fans
to<00:02:59.980> simulate<00:03:00.220> wind<00:03:01.150> conditions<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:04.030> there<00:03:04.420> is

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
to simulate wind conditions and there is

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.360 
to simulate wind conditions and there is
actually<00:03:05.379> some<00:03:06.060> metal<00:03:07.060> wind<00:03:07.269> here<00:03:07.510> right<00:03:07.720> now

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
actually some metal wind here right now

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.970 
actually some metal wind here right now
so<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.480> test<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:11.049> will<00:03:11.200> listen<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.829> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
so that is the test I will listen to the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.489 
so that is the test I will listen to the
results
