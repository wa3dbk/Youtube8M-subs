00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.959
 protection 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.959
 and lost a point 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.570
 thousands will fall buy 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.570
 people met know 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.380
 everything 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.960
 and again obeya seemingly what's new 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.780
 you can say about running I can try 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.879
 tactic hare so-called which 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.860
 used in some Fedor offices 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.650
 this is 5 martial arts school on 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.500
 the street where the battle situation is not a ring 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.629
 you need to move avoid if 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.480
 many opponents dodge them and 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.129
 here naturally tears should 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.050
 definitely preparing arable one of 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.309
 Such good mail is certainly the best 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.009
 This is a mountain run in the Crimea. The first type 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.500
 running is interval high 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.530
 interval that is jerking but by 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.740
 vector will tell the offset direction then 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.100
 there, it looks like the example of the same 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.140
 back the second type of bega when you 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.600
 run the same on your arms hold so 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.220
 of this martial arts school and for the knotted 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.670
 hands on sleep vape run tied 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.979
 so that the hand can fall 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.100
 put your hands the same who 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.299
 interval vector pitch with lighting 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.400
 and the same back god since your 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.329
 in principle, fantasy work and 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:45.229
 include the third type of running stage 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:52.670
 eights or in circles that is you 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:57.140
 run something like this 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:01.549
 with my hands just laid out for the day I 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.130
 currently loads the last of these types 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.500
 runs it all the same yes 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.310
 offsets 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.459
 by the level of attack that is when you run 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.939
 you squat something you stick 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.700
 Well, the real try certainly not 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.189
 tilt the body 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.230
 you so that your permanent center of gravity 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:30.510
 to control you don't prompt no 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:34.019
 dropped with such without need for massive 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.069
 fights that street moved to attack 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:42.150
 run away tactics hare well for especially 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.879
 cool all the same with just closed 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.629
 eyes even lower 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:54.379
 closed both eyes and ears and in such 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:57.030
 same format ran here therefore recommend 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.790
 such a cyber for street fighters 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.189
 fighters and for general physical training 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.829
 crazy load 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.819
 control body moving with attacks and 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.299
 counterattacks 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.299
 from a glass you run to catch up with HIV 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.489
 at the same time have a very good hole 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.989
 this is not a ring this is the street best 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.819
 of course come to the mountains 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:23.340
 Crimea is not possible to do yourself 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.260
 use these techniques well, clearly, he 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.750
 look for and how hard the load 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.750
 it is for seo to work and understand
