think that's really what Jay was all

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.760 
think that's really what Jay was all
about<00:01:30.979> was<00:01:31.189> about<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:31.700> know<00:01:32.200> teaching<00:01:33.200> and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
about was about you know teaching and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.700 
about was about you know teaching and
keeping<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.899> forward<00:01:35.899> progress<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.560> terms

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
keeping that forward progress in terms

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.859 
keeping that forward progress in terms
of<00:01:36.890> like<00:01:37.099> our<00:01:37.340> culture<00:01:37.789> in<00:01:37.849> our<00:01:37.939> community<00:01:38.450> so

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
of like our culture in our community so

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.809 
of like our culture in our community so
I<00:01:39.500> think<00:01:39.830> we're<00:01:40.099> going<00:01:40.189> to<00:01:40.310> be<00:01:40.399> able<00:01:40.459> to<00:01:40.640> get<00:01:40.789> a

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
I think we're going to be able to get a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.089 
I think we're going to be able to get a
feel<00:01:41.299> of<00:01:41.330> that<00:01:41.630> out<00:01:41.899> of<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.140> movie<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:42.770> should<00:01:43.009> I

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
feel of that out of the movie I should I

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:44.710 
feel of that out of the movie I should I
sure<00:01:43.280> hope<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.819> sure<00:01:44.119> hope<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.599> I<00:01:44.689> think

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
sure hope so I sure hope so and I think

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.669 
sure hope so I sure hope so and I think
like<00:01:45.110> it's<00:01:46.099> just<00:01:46.599> it's<00:01:47.599> apparent<00:01:48.289> in<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.409> man

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
like it's just it's apparent in the man

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.770 
like it's just it's apparent in the man
I<00:01:48.709> mean<00:01:49.009> like<00:01:49.159> he's<00:01:49.429> he's<00:01:50.390> one<00:01:50.599> of<00:01:50.689> those

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
I mean like he's he's one of those

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.730 
I mean like he's he's one of those
characters<00:01:51.289> where<00:01:51.500> it's<00:01:51.649> like<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.459> can<00:01:52.610> feel

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.260 

I<00:01:54.799> think<00:01:55.430> that's<00:01:55.579> something<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:55.880> definitely

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
I think that's something that definitely

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.289 
I think that's something that definitely
translate<00:01:57.110> over<00:01:57.259> anything<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.670> watch

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
translate over anything that you watch

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.899 
translate over anything that you watch
