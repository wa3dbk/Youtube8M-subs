00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.099
 I very much was burning this video is a video to confirm the bug trick of command up to now 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.900
 There is neither fancy nor frying in particular, so it feels like it's non-frying, so looking forward to looking at white rice 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.820
 I feel like I'm eating only 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:22.500
 This video is accelerated because not be together too There are many bug 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:28.200
 Summarize basic tricks of flyover 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.420
 At first basic acceleration I call super acceleration This is r on the triangle while pressing the triangle 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.630
 It is a technique to accelerate by getting on the board with a button 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.960
 Be careful not to have a board on it 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:43.300
 It is to rush and dash before to accelerate 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:48.250
 The timing is the moment you enter the slope and it will fail if only a slight timing lags 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.440
 In case go Ne Seize at all tips please continue to do to get the hang is 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:56.989
 It should be easier than flying or grabbing 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.860
 In other words, every trick you learn with your body is at the frame level so it's light 300 times 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.600
 Let's go 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:08.630
 Next to the wall acceleration This is the acceleration was carried out the work of ultra-accelerated in the wall 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.580
 The point to be careful of the triangle button at the moment you hit the wall with pressing ãƒ¼ 1 is 20 degrees to the wall 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.430
 Entering from a moderate angle 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.130
 This acceleration 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:20.370
 The acceleration is different depending on the wall. In the case of a straight wall, it doesn't fly up like this before 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.820
 You are about to go to 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:28.020
 If it is a curved wall, you can accelerate while flying up 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.420
 If you predict the direction to fly by the wall and check if it will arrive 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:37.030
 I'm sure that the width of the trick is spread of Yeah yeah 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.830
 There's nothing wrong with it Next time it accelerates this is the trick I'm calling Poseidon 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.590
 It is an acceleration method using 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.900
 In the acceleration type, this is the most difficult acceleration method After jumping with the square button 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.770
 Oh 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.580
 Join from 1 This is not r 1 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.420
 r The timing to press the triangle with 1 is really in frame units 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.260
 I can not do this I can not do it at all 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:04.890
 The timing is the highest point in the jump r 1 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:09.880
 It is not possible if you push participation as it flows as it is. 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.450
 I think I would be lucky if I could 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:18.520
 Next reflection This is also acceleration using Poseidon 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:24.850
 The difference is how to use a wall or object to jump in the impact of the board touching 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:27.400
 The point to be careful is to open the proper gap of the wall fly jet and feel with the hand holding the board 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.870
 Or the left side needs adjustment 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.580
 If you call the board from the right hand a little 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:39.920
 Adjust the right shoulder so that the board hits the wall 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:43.489
 Reflection is highly applicable and various things occur in steps and objects 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.290
 Come on now, it's back , and then grind acceleration 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.860
 This isn't a bug, and it's not a constant board tilt 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.840
 It is a phenomenon that accelerates 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:03:00.150
 It is not a technique that can be done anywhere, as this place is the easiest to meet the conditions 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.020
 Occasionally it will accelerate from grind, but there should be another place to accelerate certainly 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.220
 but 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.940
 I can not use it so much because the route is limited Grind acceleration 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.220
 He is the weakest of the four heavenly kings 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:17.810
 Next, Nose Blanc and Acceleration This is a technique to accelerate from Nosebrandt with low steps . 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:22.430
 Please keep in mind that there is a tackin to use in this online match 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:26.660
 It is recommended that you practice here as it is often used by ska in this place 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.930
 Since the style is different between Goofy and Regular, the start button's command collection 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.290
 Please check from 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.290
 West 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.730
 Next grab fly This is a slide and the moment you hit and leave to ask r in a row 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.460
 It is a technique to fly to 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:50.220
 Controller is the recommended equipped with a continuous shooting function because if do with human power controller and the finger will die 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.700
 I massage only to waste the controller board since this no use next to blown off 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.739
 Necessary ground diving 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:01.989
 If it's an easy way to get in touch, contact with the ground from flick to r 2 simultaneously 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:07.540
 You can also recommend l to a plate at a moment or vice versa to get the first r 2 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:09.819
 To both of you properly used by the reduction to be caused occur phenomenon is the difference in the l they 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.720
 Diving into the ground is easy to get sick 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.380
 It is about to be played by r 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.530
 By the way, you can only slip through the ground 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:25.160
 It is easy to understand that there are horns such as meetings 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:31.710
 It's a thin one last night, but you need an area that fits into it, is it an area or a math ? 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:35.220
 To fly math even physical be utilized is a nice game I Now the ground diving can study 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.500
 In this way, if the angle of the slope is possible 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:45.930
 But I'm not landing too jump can be blown off in his et al ground diving to r 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:49.100
 Ground diving is also please to experiment because the decrease depending on such a place is different 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.100
 It is back now 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:58.069
 Let's add a supplement about super acceleration 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:03.229
 Super acceleration is possible even in steps, so you can also accelerate from the stairs like this 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:05.960
 If you put the command in front of a little end of the stairs of adult since it is possible to fly the remains 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:09.600
 Let's break through the stairs further from the stairs 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:14.430
 Super-accelerated with the next to the practice of my crotch 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:19.500
 If it is about this phase it can be triggered. Take a distance to do a dash. 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:25.380
 Make it easy to grasp timing Understand when to fail and when to succeed 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:29.620
 Soak in the body and place the weight from above and complete it 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:35.449
 The object is convenient in this lamp shape This big lamp is this 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:41.680
 Also available this odd lamp is two-ply inside out in mama 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:45.880
 When overlapping , shift the second sheet slightly forward and make the tip firmly in contact with the ground 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:50.229
 Let's adjust the angle by tilting the ramp with no angle on the step 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:53.560
 A good angle is about 45 to 60 degrees maybe 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:58.210
 This is the order from the left to the deepest 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.670
 Use the lamp at the angle you want to fly 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:05.090
 I like this way of flying like ah Oh I want to hit the ceiling 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:09.520
 If this is this 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.520
 When I dived into the ground I penetrated it 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:19.350
 The two-ply lamp is a little hard to use 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:25.020
 I use a lot because the direction of the flight is stable without taking place 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:26.810
 If it's hard to use, objects move little by little without overlapping 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.470
 I'm going to slip 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.470
 The third is 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:42.350
 As this is not enough for the missing step, let's replace it or put the big one on the left instead 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.350
 I think this will probably work as an accelerator 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:51.120
 It flew than I thought over 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:57.870
 I didn't think there would be a successful landing on the underground there either. 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:07:03.570
 It is true that the sockon's true cherry blossoms in long boots so that sliding like this is unexpected 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:08.400
 By the way, I explained it up to now, but the difficulty level Easy is a premise, and it is called hardcore 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:13.260
 Pride can't be solved if you take it to the train station, maybe it's hard core 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:17.860
 Because there is good core, you can play this game fully if you use properly 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:24.009
 If you play with bugs, do you think that it will be a body that can not be satisfied with hardcore ? 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:29.009
 Edo next time I would like to do bug description using the object and finally one word 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:29.009
 Seriously skateboard Shiroyo next time your Tamori
