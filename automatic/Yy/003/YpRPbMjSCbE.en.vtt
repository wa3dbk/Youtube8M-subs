00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.180
 bmw series 7 4 on instruments this good 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.730
 It is the instrument of bmw 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.940
 Series 7 is a dashboard 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.560
 completely digital that has 10 with 2 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.840
 inches and is standard throughout the range 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.060
 what I want to teach with this video are 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.939
 the different aspects and information 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.329
 which is displayed depending on the mode of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.230
 driving we selected this series 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.449
 7 in particular are 730 of with kit m and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.170
 has 5 driving modes are the 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.220
 buyer comfort plus comfort sport and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.020
 sport plus 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.030
 we started with the first one that is this the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.280
 that you see right now and it's the look 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.720
 what do you have with the comfort driving that 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.820
 is the one that is selected so 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.150
 default just start the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.530
 car as you can see it is a 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.830
 conventional instrumentation with a 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.790
 look very similar to any bmw 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.440
 has a speedometer in the part 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 left how many revolutions in the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.940
 right part and two other small 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.800
 indicators that indicate us on the one hand 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.230
 the fuel level in the part 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.810
 left and on the other the temperature of the 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.130
 oil is curious as well as being a 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.100
 oil temperature indicator 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.960
 because then the usual is usually the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.740
 coolant temperature 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.180
 but it is not the case 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.120
 if we switch to comfort plus mode 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.100
 is this we can see that it does not change with 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.990
 regarding the mode according to the changes in 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.600
 this case focus on the adjustments of 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.070
 the direction of the suspension 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.560
 and the change of gears but not the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.659
 aspect of the picture the first change 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.610
 great is when we pass the eco mode 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.680
 I think it's this 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.960
 As you can see, the picture goes to 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.490
 have a blue light on 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.650
 Speedometer keeps the part 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.510
 left but on the right the 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.270
 revolution counter is replaced by a 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.020
 efficiency meter this meter we 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.100
 indicates how is our driving from 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.500
 the point of view of saving 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.780
 gas 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 is divided into several parts in several 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.560
 zones and one of them the first one 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.370
 calls chats and tells us the energy 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.190
 which recovers when braking or when 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.130
 the accelerator is released another part that 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.500
 it is the largest is power that is the area 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.670
 where we should move if we want to have 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.310
 a low fuel consumption 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.069
 and finally the gray area that you see 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.640
 at the bottom is the area that 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.750
 we must avoid if we want to consume little 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.420
 also with this driving mode 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.520
 selected the travel computer has 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.200
 an additional function and that is that we 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.870
 indicates the kilometers we have won 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.500
 by deposit driving in a manner 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.450
 efficient is the small digit in color 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.830
 blue that appears at the bottom in 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.840
 this case we have 33 with 6 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.480
 well then the next change 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.920
 important is given when we select the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.920
 sport mode that is 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.230
 in the instrument cluster right now 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.569
 happens to be red the speedometer 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.189
 tells us the speed through digits 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.299
 instead of being with traditional needles 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.090
 and counterrevolution has an aspect 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.769
 also different 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.629
 if we put it also in manual change 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.730
 now I can not put it because the car 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.800
 is standing 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.599
 we see the number that indicates the 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.730
 march that we have selected in each 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.940
 moment and finally the sport plus mode 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.860
 this 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.420
 It has almost the same appearance as 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.750
 sport mode except for a small 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.500
 witness that appears on the top 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.510
 and that tells us that we have 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.960
 selected traction control in 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.790
 dynamic or sports mode is nothing this 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.380
 traction control the only thing it does is 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.970
 that allows a small slip of 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.720
 the wheels before entering 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.680
 functioning 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.680
 and this is all
