00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 because of the events in Ukraine and others 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.160
 negative external factors 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.950
 Transnistrian economy again 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.840
 It found itself in a difficult situation is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.570

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.910
 state treasury in the month of April 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.160
 we had some days before admission 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.060
 execution of the income plan in the amount of 5 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.609
 percent 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.800
 Already in May, 15 percent revenue 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.400
 republican budget were not 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.980
 met and in june month is similar 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.169
 situation the bulk of budget revenues 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.059
 goes to provide social articles 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.129
 salaries and pensions purchase 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.680
 medicine and nutrition in budget 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.839
 institutions and for lower incomes in 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.489
 state treasury money for all this is not enough 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.010
 so the government decided to make 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.239
 budget changes government 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.790
 given the opportunity 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.170
 do not freeze wages at 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.750
 put on June 30, 2014, that is 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.790
 raising which first yuliana was 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.600
 probably will be delayed at least 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.309
 receipt of funds budget main goal 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.960
 budget transformation find 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.540
 additional sources of financing 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.939
 it was decided to reduce costs 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.350
 bodies of state power of the government 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.600
 allowed to use funds 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.270
 reserve customs road and 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.369
 environmental funds to form 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.439
 special 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.030
 stabilization fund this and profits 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.880
 Transnistrian Republican Bank 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.979
 and funds in the fund accounts 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.479
 state reserve ie all those 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.640
 measures that could be taken 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.289
 to budget arrived 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.399
 additional income that could be 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.009
 time to pay 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.399
 both on pensions and on wages 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.840
 despite all the measures taken in the budget 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.210
 insufficient funds for timely 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.179
 fulfillment of all social obligations 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.639
 Due to this the government was taken 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.520
 unpopular but necessary decision was 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.549
 decided to limit 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.840
 payroll funding 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.359
 80 five percent i.e. 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.479
 way your salary accrued 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.189
 paid at 85 percent and 15 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.200
 percent the state will have to 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.230
 I would like to note that this 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.370
 forced measure due to the fact that 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.800
 perimeter situation transnistria 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.080
 worsen decrease in wages 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.270
 no pay wages occurred 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.820
 will be charged will be charged 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.160
 volume but funding will be 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.200
 be carried out in parts as soon as we have 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.960
 there will be additional sources in 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.280
 budget including as a result taken 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.170
 today is a research solution 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.020
 additional sources of debt 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.070
 will be repaid in particular in 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.900
 government 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.430
 indicated the order that until December 1 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.770
 the finance ministry must 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.640
 analyze the situation and in the case 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.290
 if this debt is not repaid 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.030
 suggest measures to her 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.700
 pay off before the end of the current financial 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.920
 years in the government consider the main 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.810
 the task to keep the existing size 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.770
 pay and take action 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.210
 necessary to stabilize the situation 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.290
 Andrei Maleleo not Egor Kharlamov first 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.290
