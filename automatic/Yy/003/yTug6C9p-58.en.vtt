problem with silver filling is that it
starts<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.309> break<00:01:02.670> down<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.899> margin<00:01:04.500> where

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
starts to break down at the margin where

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.179 
starts to break down at the margin where
it<00:01:05.339> meets<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.820> tooth<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:07.500> by<00:01:07.890> itself

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
it meets the tooth and that by itself

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.120 
it meets the tooth and that by itself
starts<00:01:08.640> cracking<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> causing<00:01:10.470> more

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
starts cracking and causing more

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.039 
starts cracking and causing more
problems

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049

now these cracks that you see are the
hiding<00:01:16.110> places<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.830> bacteria<00:01:17.400> these<00:01:18.270> are

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
hiding places for the bacteria these are

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.090 
hiding places for the bacteria these are
the<00:01:18.750> places<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.009> decay<00:01:20.520> starts<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
the places that the decay starts and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.550 
the places that the decay starts and
what<00:01:23.100> happens<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.330> tooth<00:01:24.630> starts<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.320> hurt

root canal or other issues so these

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.999 
root canal or other issues so these
cavities<00:01:32.450> usually<00:01:33.450> start<00:01:33.840> under<00:01:34.439> your

causes the two to break now I see this
every<00:01:44.939> day<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.570> my<00:01:45.780> practice<00:01:45.979> people<00:01:46.979> come<00:01:47.369> in

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
of the tooth has broken so unfortunately

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.830

tooth and not only that we also every
time<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:03.090> smile<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:04.290> show<00:02:04.680> those<00:02:04.950> silver

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759

time we smile we show those silver
fillings<00:02:06.180> which<00:02:06.979> becomes<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.129> cosmetic<00:02:08.700> issue

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
fillings which becomes a cosmetic issue

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.260 
fillings which becomes a cosmetic issue
so<00:02:10.610> sometimes<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.790> discolors<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.599> hole<00:02:12.810> too

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
so sometimes it discolors the hole too

as<00:02:40.000> possible<00:02:40.090> now<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.500> benefit<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:43.470> white

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
as possible now the benefit of white

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.320 
as possible now the benefit of white
filling<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.740> bonded<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
filling is that it is bonded to the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.430 
filling is that it is bonded to the
tooth<00:02:49.690> structure<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.730> silver<00:02:51.730> filling<00:02:52.110> we<00:02:53.110> used

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
tooth structure a silver filling we used

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.670 
tooth structure a silver filling we used
to<00:02:53.770> you<00:02:54.730> know<00:02:54.850> we<00:02:55.450> don't<00:02:55.600> do<00:02:55.900> very<00:02:55.930> much<00:02:56.410> silver

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
to you know we don't do very much silver

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.630 
to you know we don't do very much silver
filling<00:02:57.100> anymore

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
filling anymore

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.720 
filling anymore
but<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.240> very<00:02:58.480> silver<00:02:58.930> filling<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.440> done<00:02:59.740> you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
but the very silver filling is done you

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.420 
but the very silver filling is done you
make<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.940> hole<00:03:01.270> inside<00:03:01.510> your<00:03:01.960> tooth<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.560> you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
make a hole inside your tooth and you

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.370 
make a hole inside your tooth and you
pack<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.840> silver<00:03:05.350> inside<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.880> hole<00:03:07.380> the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
pack the silver inside that hole the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.470 
pack the silver inside that hole the
difference<00:03:09.010> between<00:03:09.250> silver<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.450> white

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
difference between silver and the white

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.530 
difference between silver and the white
filling<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.410> that<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.970> white<00:03:13.180> feeling

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
filling is that you the white feeling

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.450 
filling is that you the white feeling
you<00:03:13.720> don't<00:03:13.930> need<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.410> make<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.590> big<00:03:14.890> hole<00:03:15.130> you

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
you don't need to make a big hole you

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.410 
you don't need to make a big hole you
make<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.180> small<00:03:16.660> hole<00:03:16.740> hole<00:03:17.740> and<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.940> filling

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
make a small hole hole and the filling

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.420 
make a small hole hole and the filling
is<00:03:19.570> actually<00:03:20.110> bonded<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.130> tooth

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
is actually bonded to the tooth

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.880 
is actually bonded to the tooth
structure<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.680> there<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.310> better<00:03:25.890> seal

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
structure so it there is a better seal

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.810 
structure so it there is a better seal
between<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:28.650> white<00:03:29.650> filling<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.580> tooth

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
between the white filling and the tooth

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.390 
between the white filling and the tooth
compared<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.870> silver<00:03:32.740> filling<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
compared to the silver filling and the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.020 
compared to the silver filling and the
truth<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.890> bonding<00:03:36.310> material<00:03:36.460> has

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
truth so the bonding material has

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.570 
truth so the bonding material has
improved<00:03:37.660> tremendously<00:03:37.990> over<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:39.010> last<00:03:39.190> few

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
improved tremendously over the last few

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.850 
improved tremendously over the last few
years<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.570> that's<00:03:40.840> what<00:03:41.050> I<00:03:41.080> would<00:03:41.200> recommend

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
years so that's what I would recommend
