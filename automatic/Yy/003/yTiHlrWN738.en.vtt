00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.510 

now<00:01:46.659> we've<00:01:46.810> plugged<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.350> house<00:01:47.530> ECU<00:01:48.310> and

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
now we've plugged in the house ECU and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.880 
now we've plugged in the house ECU and
I've<00:01:49.060> connected<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.140> map<00:01:50.380> sensor<00:01:50.650> up

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
I've connected the the map sensor up

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.340 
I've connected the the map sensor up
because<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.549> this<00:01:51.790> case<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.360> base<00:01:52.630> map<00:01:52.869> is<00:01:53.110> set

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
because in this case the base map is set

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.649 
because in this case the base map is set
up<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.530> run<00:01:53.680> using<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.670> internal<00:01:55.240> map<00:01:55.360> sensor

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
up to run using the internal map sensor

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.410 
up to run using the internal map sensor
on<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.409> heartache<00:01:56.740> ECU<00:01:57.220> which<00:01:57.700> means<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.270> can

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
on the heartache ECU which means you can

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.359 
on the heartache ECU which means you can
eliminate<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:59.050> air<00:01:59.170> flow<00:01:59.409> meter<00:01:59.650> which<00:01:59.920> is

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
eliminate the air flow meter which is

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.969 
eliminate the air flow meter which is
good<00:02:00.580> for<00:02:00.700> high-performance<00:02:00.909> applications

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
good for high-performance applications

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.249 
good for high-performance applications
now<00:02:02.979> we've<00:02:03.190> got<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.550> software<00:02:04.360> installed<00:02:05.170> on

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
now we've got the software installed on

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.930 
now we've got the software installed on
our<00:02:05.409> laptop<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.340> we<00:02:06.430> should<00:02:06.610> be<00:02:06.729> able<00:02:06.790> to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
our laptop and we should be able to

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.820 
our laptop and we should be able to
start<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.300> carnage<00:02:07.690> should<00:02:07.930> just<00:02:08.170> run<00:02:10.830> there

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
start the carnage should just run there

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.710 
start the carnage should just run there
you<00:02:11.890> have<00:02:12.040> it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
you have it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.080 
you have it
so<00:02:13.720> now<00:02:13.959> let's<00:02:14.470> get<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.800> tuning<00:02:15.160> now<00:02:15.880> that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
so now let's get the tuning now that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.449 
so now let's get the tuning now that
we're<00:02:16.209> online<00:02:16.330> with<00:02:16.720> ESU<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:18.160> engines

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
we're online with ESU and the engines

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.160 
we're online with ESU and the engines
already<00:02:18.790> tuned<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.540> important<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.019> note

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
already tuned it's important to note

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.780 
already tuned it's important to note
that<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.470> don't<00:02:20.709> want<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> use<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.370> long<00:02:21.580> term

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
that you don't want to use the long term

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.400 
that you don't want to use the long term
and<00:02:21.940> short<00:02:21.970> term<00:02:22.209> fuel<00:02:22.660> trims<00:02:22.930> as<00:02:23.110> a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and short term fuel trims as a

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.530 
and short term fuel trims as a
replacement<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:24.400> correct<00:02:24.940> engine<00:02:25.269> tuning

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
replacement for correct engine tuning

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.470 
replacement for correct engine tuning
but<00:02:26.140> once<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.890> engine<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.250> tuned<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:28.269> want<00:02:28.420> to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
but once the engine is tuned you want to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.500 
but once the engine is tuned you want to
go<00:02:28.600> online<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.310> f4<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.060> get<00:02:31.209> into

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
go online and it's the f4 to get into

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.990 
go online and it's the f4 to get into
the<00:02:31.930> main<00:02:32.170> setup<00:02:32.440> from<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.310> main<00:02:33.519> setup<00:02:33.820> we

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the main setup from the main setup we

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.360 
the main setup from the main setup we
want<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.209> go<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.600> Advanced<00:02:34.959> tab<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.500> in

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
want to go to the Advanced tab and in

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.729 
want to go to the Advanced tab and in
here<00:02:36.730> you'll<00:02:37.720> notice<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.080> we<00:02:38.320> have<00:02:38.350> both<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
here you'll notice that we have both the

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.280 
here you'll notice that we have both the
o2<00:02:39.100> control<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.390> long<00:02:40.570> term<00:02:40.780> fuel<00:02:41.050> trim

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
o2 control and the long term fuel trim

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.830 
o2 control and the long term fuel trim
turned<00:02:41.709> on<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.550> important<00:02:43.120> because<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
turned on this is important because the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.290 
turned on this is important because the
long<00:02:44.050> term<00:02:44.350> fuel<00:02:44.709> trim<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.280> actually<00:02:45.730> based<00:02:46.030> on

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
long term fuel trim is actually based on

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.720 
long term fuel trim is actually based on
the<00:02:46.750> short<00:02:47.019> term<00:02:47.260> fuel<00:02:47.530> trim<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:48.190> short<00:02:48.580> term

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
the short term fuel trim is short term

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.750 
the short term fuel trim is short term
fuel<00:02:49.030> trim<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.420> simply<00:02:49.870> odor<00:02:50.470> control<00:02:50.860> so

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
fuel trim is simply odor control so

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.150 
fuel trim is simply odor control so
let's<00:02:51.940> go<00:02:52.090> into<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.390> menu<00:02:52.600> first<00:02:53.040> within<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
let's go into that menu first within the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.800 
let's go into that menu first within the
o2<00:02:54.459> control<00:02:54.820> you<00:02:54.910> can<00:02:55.060> see<00:02:55.239> that<00:02:55.420> we<00:02:55.480> have<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
o2 control you can see that we have the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.380 
o2 control you can see that we have the
sensor<00:02:56.230> type<00:02:56.410> set<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.100> narrowband<00:02:57.730> now<00:02:58.239> that's

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
sensor type set to narrowband now that's

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.670 
sensor type set to narrowband now that's
important<00:02:58.870> because<00:02:59.019> on<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.440> car<00:02:59.650> the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
important because on this car the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.310 
important because on this car the
factory<00:03:00.310> center<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.820> narrowband<00:03:01.299> sensor<00:03:01.930> if

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
factory center is a narrowband sensor if

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.990 
factory center is a narrowband sensor if
you<00:03:02.500> wanted<00:03:02.799> to<00:03:02.950> use<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.250> wideband

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
you wanted to use a wideband

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.300 
you wanted to use a wideband
then<00:03:04.269> that's<00:03:04.540> fine<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:05.380> can<00:03:05.410> install<00:03:06.250> that

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
then that's fine you can install that

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.940 
then that's fine you can install that

this sensor is not capable therefore
we're<00:04:03.310> not<00:04:03.340> going<00:04:03.550> to<00:04:04.030> enable<00:04:04.300> any<00:04:04.690> trim<00:04:05.610> ok<00:04:06.610> so

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
we're not going to enable any trim ok so

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.600 
we're not going to enable any trim ok so
now<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.720> we've<00:04:07.990> set<00:04:08.230> up<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.500> basics<00:04:08.890> what<00:04:09.490> we

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
now that we've set up the basics what we

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.370 
now that we've set up the basics what we
want<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.880> do<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.090> actually<00:04:10.270> go<00:04:10.600> from<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.230> o2

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
want to do is actually go from the o2

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.500 
want to do is actually go from the o2
control<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.069> look<00:04:12.550> at<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.760> long-term<00:04:13.180> trim

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
control and look at the long-term trim

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.990 
control and look at the long-term trim
remembering<00:04:14.380> that<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:14.890> long-term<00:04:15.220> trim<00:04:15.819> is

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
remembering that the long-term trim is

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.150 
remembering that the long-term trim is
based<00:04:16.750> on<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.019> short-term<00:04:17.320> trim<00:04:17.709> which<00:04:18.010> is

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
based on the short-term trim which is

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.940 
based on the short-term trim which is
the<00:04:18.280> o2<00:04:18.459> control<00:04:18.970> within<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:20.019> long-term<00:04:20.530> trim

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
the o2 control within the long-term trim

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.909 
the o2 control within the long-term trim
you<00:04:21.669> see<00:04:21.850> we<00:04:21.970> have<00:04:22.090> quite<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.389> few<00:04:22.510> different

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
you see we have quite a few different

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.770 
you see we have quite a few different
values<00:04:23.919> to<00:04:23.950> program<00:04:24.490> all<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.210> values<00:04:25.750> that

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
values to program all the values that

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.840 
values to program all the values that
are<00:04:25.960> currently<00:04:26.350> programmed<00:04:26.620> have<00:04:27.370> been<00:04:27.610> set

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.400 
are currently programmed have been set
up<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.150> are<00:04:28.300> running<00:04:28.480> on<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:28.750> vehicle<00:04:29.139> so<00:04:29.290> they

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
up and are running on a vehicle so they

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.440 
up and are running on a vehicle so they
should<00:04:29.710> work<00:04:29.919> pretty<00:04:30.640> well<00:04:30.790> in<00:04:31.120> most

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
should work pretty well in most

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.420 
should work pretty well in most
applications<00:04:32.169> but<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.770> still<00:04:33.040> may<00:04:33.190> want<00:04:33.310> to

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
applications but you still may want to

applications but you still may want to
tweak<00:04:33.669> these<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.660> what<00:04:34.810> we<00:04:34.900> have<00:04:35.050> is<00:04:35.169> the

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
tweak these so what we have is the

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.560 
tweak these so what we have is the
activation<00:04:35.950> point<00:04:36.250> now<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:36.910> activation

30 seconds then the long term fuel trim
is<00:05:16.000> kicked<00:05:16.240> in<00:05:16.419> how<00:05:16.960> much<00:05:17.260> gets<00:05:17.530> kicked<00:05:17.800> in

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
is kicked in how much gets kicked in

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.370 
is kicked in how much gets kicked in
well<00:05:18.550> that's<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.180> increment<00:05:19.690> it<00:05:19.780> starts<00:05:20.260> in

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
well that's the increment it starts in

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.820 
well that's the increment it starts in
half<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.830> percent<00:05:21.220> increments<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:22.830> basically

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
half a percent increments so basically

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.469 
half a percent increments so basically
what<00:05:24.100> happens<00:05:24.400> is<00:05:24.520> we<00:05:24.640> get<00:05:24.789> half<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.150> percent

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
what happens is we get half a percent

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.210 
what happens is we get half a percent
more<00:05:25.720> or<00:05:25.840> less<00:05:26.020> fuel<00:05:26.260> depending<00:05:26.680> on<00:05:26.770> which<00:05:26.950> way

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
more or less fuel depending on which way

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.390 
more or less fuel depending on which way
the<00:05:27.700> trim<00:05:28.000> is<00:05:28.120> going<00:05:28.479> for<00:05:29.110> a<00:05:29.380> period<00:05:29.950> of<00:05:30.039> one

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
the trim is going for a period of one

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.100 
the trim is going for a period of one
second<00:05:31.180> in<00:05:31.270> this<00:05:31.360> case<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.600> thousand

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
second in this case a thousand

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.050 
second in this case a thousand
milliseconds<00:05:32.289> this<00:05:33.100> keeps<00:05:33.430> on<00:05:33.580> adding<00:05:33.910> up

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
milliseconds this keeps on adding up

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.159 
milliseconds this keeps on adding up
until<00:05:34.510> it<00:05:34.630> gets<00:05:34.660> to<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.970> maximum<00:05:37.510> trim<00:05:37.930> per

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
until it gets to the maximum trim per

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.719 
until it gets to the maximum trim per
session<00:05:38.440> in<00:05:38.680> this<00:05:38.800> case<00:05:39.039> I've<00:05:39.250> got<00:05:39.310> it<00:05:39.490> set<00:05:39.700> to

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
session in this case I've got it set to

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.480 
session in this case I've got it set to
two<00:05:39.970> and<00:05:40.120> a<00:05:40.150> half<00:05:40.330> percent<00:05:40.539> so<00:05:41.490> essentially

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
two and a half percent so essentially

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.920 
two and a half percent so essentially
what's<00:05:42.669> going<00:05:42.820> to<00:05:42.850> happen<00:05:43.180> is<00:05:43.300> my<00:05:43.479> long<00:05:43.720> term

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
what's going to happen is my long term

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.840 
what's going to happen is my long term
fuel<00:05:44.140> trim<00:05:44.289> is<00:05:44.380> going<00:05:44.500> to<00:05:44.560> work<00:05:44.710> in<00:05:44.919> in<00:05:45.100> slots

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
fuel trim is going to work in in slots

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.719 
fuel trim is going to work in in slots
of<00:05:46.060> thirty<00:05:46.330> seconds<00:05:46.930> ok<00:05:47.740> so<00:05:48.160> it<00:05:48.280> looks<00:05:48.310> at<00:05:48.610> the

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
of thirty seconds ok so it looks at the

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.690
