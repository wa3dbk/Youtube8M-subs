alright we're going to go over how to
get<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:04.020> 2.5<00:00:04.859> attacks<00:00:05.790> attacks<00:00:06.359> per<00:00:06.569> second

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
get the 2.5 attacks attacks per second

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960 
get the 2.5 attacks attacks per second
break<00:00:07.290> point<00:00:07.560> for<00:00:07.830> your<00:00:07.950> sprint<00:00:08.429> run<00:00:08.790> like<00:00:08.910> the

wind tornadoes so I'll show you exactly
how<00:00:11.250> much<00:00:11.460> attack<00:00:11.790> speed<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.090> need<00:00:12.120> based<00:00:12.660> on

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
how much attack speed you need based on

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.530 
how much attack speed you need based on
which<00:00:13.710> type<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.309> echoing<00:00:14.700> fury<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.089> purchase

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
which type of echoing fury you purchase

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.560 
which type of echoing fury you purchase
I'm<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:17.160> 2.5<00:00:17.580> break<00:00:17.880> point<00:00:18.119> gives<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
I'm the 2.5 break point gives you a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.960 
I'm the 2.5 break point gives you a
seven<00:00:19.080> frame<00:00:19.260> tick<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.710> that's<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.400> 8.5

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
seven frame tick and that's like 8.5

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.970 
seven frame tick and that's like 8.5
takes<00:00:21.180> per<00:00:21.300> second<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:22.529> basically<00:00:22.830> is

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
takes per second like basically is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.380 
takes per second like basically is
tornado<00:00:23.310> take<00:00:23.580> 26<00:00:23.939> times<00:00:25.970> that's<00:00:26.970> usually<00:00:27.210> the

break point that I aim for on any said I
build<00:00:29.130> from<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.580> mil<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.210> 300<00:00:30.630> mil

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
build from one mil to like 300 mil

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.450 
build from one mil to like 300 mil
obviously<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> much<00:00:31.769> higher<00:00:31.890> budget<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
obviously was a much higher budget you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
obviously was a much higher budget you
might<00:00:32.640> aim<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.239> two<00:00:33.390> point<00:00:33.710> billions

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
might aim for like two point billions

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.780 
might aim for like two point billions
2.86<00:00:36.559> will<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.649> round<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:40.579> some<00:00:41.579> people

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
2.86 will you round up and some people

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
2.86 will you round up and some people
go<00:00:41.940> for<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> two-point<00:00:42.270> 23<00:00:42.899> by<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.980> think

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
go for the two-point 23 by I just think

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.020 
go for the two-point 23 by I just think
the<00:00:44.160> 2.5<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.899> good<00:00:46.219> good<00:00:47.219> spot<00:00:47.489> tame

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the 2.5 is just a good good spot tame

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
the 2.5 is just a good good spot tame
for<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.350> pretty<00:00:49.469> much<00:00:49.530> always

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
for it and I pretty much always

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
for it and I pretty much always
recommend<00:00:50.309> mm<00:00:50.610> fo<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.120> either<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.050> Cooney<00:00:52.320> or

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
recommend mm fo and either the Cooney or

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.049 
recommend mm fo and either the Cooney or
in<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.920> his<00:00:53.129> pants<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.640> from<00:00:53.850> there<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
in a in his pants and from there you

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.689 
in a in his pants and from there you
only<00:00:54.390> need<00:00:54.690> two<00:00:55.680> more<00:00:55.710> attack<00:00:56.070> speed<00:00:56.309> items<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
only need two more attack speed items to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.549 
only need two more attack speed items to
get<00:00:56.820> 2.5<00:01:00.140> okay<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.199> we're<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> start

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
get 2.5 okay so we're going to start

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.090 
get 2.5 okay so we're going to start
with<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> point<00:01:02.850> two<00:01:03.239> three<00:01:03.589> echoing<00:01:04.589> fury<00:01:04.799> I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
with a point two three echoing fury I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.340 
with a point two three echoing fury I
usually<00:01:05.430> don't<00:01:05.820> remember<00:01:06.810> anything<00:01:07.080> lower

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
usually don't remember anything lower

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.340 
usually don't remember anything lower
than<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.040> 2.22<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.600> sorry<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.020> point

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
than this like a 2.22 or sorry I point

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.480 
than this like a 2.22 or sorry I point
22<00:01:10.500> or<00:01:11.159> point<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.950> think<00:01:13.950> point<00:01:14.130> 23<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
22 or point to one I think point 23 is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.800 
22 or point to one I think point 23 is
probably<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> minimum<00:01:15.119> might<00:01:15.240> ever<00:01:15.390> purchase

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
probably the minimum might ever purchase

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.730 
probably the minimum might ever purchase
or<00:01:16.020> ever<00:01:16.229> recommend<00:01:16.740> purchasing<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.680> this

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
or ever recommend purchasing so for this

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.020 
or ever recommend purchasing so for this

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
we need to get to 2.1 for a tax per

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.710 
we need to get to 2.1 for a tax per
second<00:01:32.909> which<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.180> give<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.390> two<00:01:33.509> point

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
second which will give you two point

after<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.780> Berserker<00:01:37.170> gives<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.650> an

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
after the Berserker gives you an

after the Berserker gives you an
additional<00:01:38.040> twenty<00:01:38.460> five<00:01:38.490> percent<00:01:38.640> attack

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
additional twenty five percent attack

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.680 
additional twenty five percent attack
speed<00:01:41.060> okay<00:01:42.060> so

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.810 

I'm<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> start<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.800> just<00:01:47.130> nine

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I'm going to start with just nine

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.390 
I'm going to start with just nine
percent<00:01:48.090> gloves<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:49.830> believe<00:01:50.040> an<00:01:50.250> eight

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
percent gloves and I believe an eight

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.030 
percent gloves and I believe an eight
percent<00:01:50.640> ring<00:01:50.820> should<00:01:51.000> do<00:01:51.120> it<00:01:51.240> yep<00:01:51.750> 2.14<00:01:53.660> and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
percent ring should do it yep 2.14 and

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.800 
percent ring should do it yep 2.14 and
we'll<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.280> pop<00:01:56.880> assert<00:01:57.390> wrath<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
we'll just pop assert wrath of the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.090 
we'll just pop assert wrath of the
berserker<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:58.980> guys<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.130> see<00:02:01.100> so

berserker just so you guys can see so

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.250 
berserker just so you guys can see so
this<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.310> nine<00:02:02.490> percent<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.900> percent

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
this is a nine percent in a percent

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.430 
this is a nine percent in a percent
that's<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.310> total<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.820> thirty-five<00:02:06.420> percent

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440

35-percent attack speed from gear

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.620 
35-percent attack speed from gear
obviously<00:02:11.700> plus<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> dual<00:02:12.210> wield<00:02:12.420> attack

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
obviously plus the dual wield attack

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.320 
obviously plus the dual wield attack
speed<00:02:12.840> bonus<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.800> point<00:02:14.340> 23<00:02:14.520> ApS<00:02:15.060> from

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
speed bonus and the point 23 ApS from

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:28.640 
speed bonus and the point 23 ApS from
echoing<00:02:15.660> fury<00:02:24.350> okay<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.320> where<00:02:28.530> at

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
echoing fury okay so is this where at

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.170 
echoing fury okay so is this where at
2.5<00:02:31.310> I'll<00:02:32.310> be<00:02:32.490> switched<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.940> an<00:02:33.030> eight

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
2.5 I'll be switched this to an eight

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.600 
2.5 I'll be switched this to an eight
percent<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.690> drops<00:02:33.840> at<00:02:33.990> 2.49<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.430> misses

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
percent it drops at 2.49 so that misses

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.920 
percent it drops at 2.49 so that misses
the<00:02:35.820> very<00:02:35.970> point<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:36.780> 2.5<00:02:37.200> will<00:02:37.320> put<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.530> over

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.090 

alright<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.110> that's<00:02:43.200> was<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> point<00:02:43.860> two<00:02:44.070> three

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
alright so that's was a point two three

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.800 
alright so that's was a point two three
echoing<00:02:44.970> theory<00:02:45.240> now<00:02:45.420> we're<00:02:45.510> going<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.660> try<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
echoing theory now we're going to try a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.600 
echoing theory now we're going to try a
point<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.170> four<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:51.200> with<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.610> 35-percent

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
point to four so with a 35-percent

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.130 
point to four so with a 35-percent
increased<00:02:54.030> attack<00:02:54.239> speed<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.690> puts<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.959> at<00:02:55.110> a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
increased attack speed it puts you at a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.690 
increased attack speed it puts you at a
2.16<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:57.209> we<00:02:57.660> don't<00:02:57.810> need<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.050> much<00:02:58.670> now<00:02:59.670> I

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
2.16 so we don't need this much now I

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.170 
2.16 so we don't need this much now I
getting<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.270> nine<00:03:00.480> percent<00:03:00.780> on<00:03:00.930> gloves

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
getting like a nine percent on gloves

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.100 
getting like a nine percent on gloves
there's<00:03:03.180> gonna<00:03:03.300> be<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> lot<00:03:03.570> more<00:03:03.630> expensive

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
there's gonna be a lot more expensive

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.270 
there's gonna be a lot more expensive
than<00:03:04.200> getting<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.500> percent<00:03:04.800> on<00:03:04.890> glove<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.220> you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
than getting a percent on glove so you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.830 
than getting a percent on glove so you
should<00:03:05.489> be<00:03:05.520> able<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.030> much<00:03:06.120> more<00:03:06.300> damage

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
should be able to get much more damage

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.630 
should be able to get much more damage
stats<00:03:07.080> not<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> lot<00:03:07.770> more<00:03:07.950> expensive<00:03:08.160> but<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.550> is

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
stats not a lot more expensive but it is

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.220 
stats not a lot more expensive but it is
noticeable<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.690> it's<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.900> perfect

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
noticeable just because it's a perfect

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.320 
noticeable just because it's a perfect
attack<00:03:10.470> speed<00:03:10.680> roll<00:03:10.850> people<00:03:11.850> kind<00:03:12.270> of

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
attack speed roll people kind of

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.090 
attack speed roll people kind of
overcharge<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.410> now<00:03:13.770> I'm<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.040> to

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
overcharge for that so now I'm going to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.320 
overcharge for that so now I'm going to
be<00:03:14.190> able<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.489> get<00:03:14.640> an<00:03:14.760> eight<00:03:14.880> percent<00:03:15.120> glove

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
be able to get an eight percent glove

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.840 
be able to get an eight percent glove
and<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.750> percent<00:03:16.080> ring<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.920> puts<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.130> at<00:03:17.220> 2.15

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
and a percent ring that puts you at 2.15

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.940 
and a percent ring that puts you at 2.15
you<00:03:18.720> can't<00:03:18.989> drop<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.260> down<00:03:19.500> any<00:03:19.860> further

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
you can't drop it down any further

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.520 
you can't drop it down any further
because<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.670> puts<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:20.880> at<00:03:20.970> 2.13<00:03:21.390> maybe<00:03:22.230> drop

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
because it puts you at 2.13 maybe drop

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.140 
because it puts you at 2.13 maybe drop
this<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.800> percent<00:03:23.160> gloves<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> seven<00:03:23.940> percent

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
this a percent gloves to a seven percent

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.660 
this a percent gloves to a seven percent
gloves<00:03:24.800> so<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:25.980> won't<00:03:26.070> be<00:03:26.220> high<00:03:26.340> enough<00:03:26.519> this

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
gloves so this won't be high enough this

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.150 
gloves so this won't be high enough this
will<00:03:26.760> put<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.000> at<00:03:27.120> 2.49<00:03:27.830> so<00:03:28.830> as<00:03:28.950> an<00:03:29.040> eight

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
will put you at 2.49 so as an eight

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.759 
will put you at 2.49 so as an eight
percent<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.930> person<00:03:30.930> gloves<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.260> percent<00:03:31.590> ring

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
percent a person gloves a percent ring

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.190 
percent a person gloves a percent ring
it'll<00:03:32.670> put<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.910> at<00:03:33.030> 2.51<00:03:33.600> when<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.080> have

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
it'll put you at 2.51 when you have

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.490 
it'll put you at 2.51 when you have
wrath<00:03:34.410> up<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> thirty-four

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
wrath up and that is a thirty-four

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.540 
wrath up and that is a thirty-four
percent<00:03:37.620> total<00:03:39.890> so<00:03:40.890> you<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.130> get<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.400> eight

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
percent total so you can get to eight

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.009 
percent total so you can get to eight
percent<00:03:41.940> sand<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.269> nine<00:03:42.420> percent<00:03:42.720> or<00:03:42.810> any

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
percent sand to nine percent or any

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.600 
percent sand to nine percent or any
combination<00:03:43.320> obviously<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.100> get<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> seven

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
combination obviously you get a seven

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.660 
combination obviously you get a seven
percent<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.180> 39<00:03:45.660> per<00:03:45.840> cents<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:47.100> all<00:03:47.489> works

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
percent and 39 per cents it all works

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.810 
percent and 39 per cents it all works
the<00:03:47.880> same<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:49.920> was<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.070> point<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.550> for<00:03:50.790> a

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
the same so this was a point to for a

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.759 
the same so this was a point to for a
tax<00:03:51.180> per<00:03:51.330> second<00:03:51.600> deck<00:03:51.750> or<00:03:51.840> inferior<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.709> I

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
tax per second deck or inferior and I

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.030 
tax per second deck or inferior and I
will<00:03:52.920> do<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.310> point<00:03:54.030> 25<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.710> one<00:03:55.860> should

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
will do a point 25 and this one should

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.590 
will do a point 25 and this one should
allow<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.550> drop<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.850> down

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
allow you to drop it down

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.570 
allow you to drop it down
one<00:03:57.750> more<00:03:57.900> percent<00:03:58.230> attack<00:03:58.440> speed<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.370> now<00:03:59.490> you

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
one more percent attack speed so now you

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.600 
one more percent attack speed so now you
can<00:03:59.700> get<00:03:59.880> seven<00:04:00.870> percent<00:04:01.140> gloves<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.460> put

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
can get seven percent gloves and I put

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.670 
can get seven percent gloves and I put
you<00:04:02.700> at<00:04:02.760> 2.15<00:04:03.300> have<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.200> tried<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.470> switch

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
you at 2.15 have you tried to switch

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.050 
you at 2.15 have you tried to switch
this<00:04:04.800> ring<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.220> seven<00:04:05.520> percent<00:04:05.760> ring<00:04:05.940> as

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
this ring to a seven percent ring as

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.540 
this ring to a seven percent ring as
well<00:04:06.560> they'll<00:04:07.560> drop<00:04:07.740> you<00:04:07.860> too<00:04:08.010> low<00:04:08.160> it's<00:04:08.430> going

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
well they'll drop you too low it's going

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.370 
well they'll drop you too low it's going
to<00:04:08.610> put<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.790> at<00:04:08.880> 2.13<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.780> that's<00:04:10.110> going<00:04:10.260> to

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
to put you at 2.13 and that's going to

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.970 
to put you at 2.13 and that's going to
be<00:04:10.530> 2.49<00:04:11.160> when<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.730> pop<00:04:11.910> wrath<00:04:12.770> I'll<00:04:13.770> show<00:04:13.920> you

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
be 2.49 when you pop wrath I'll show you

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:23.660 
be 2.49 when you pop wrath I'll show you
just<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.370> uh<00:04:15.620> just<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.709> make<00:04:16.830> sure

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.190 

you

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
you

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.470 
you
oh<00:04:25.940> really<00:04:27.980> there's<00:04:28.980> some<00:04:29.100> nice<00:04:29.190> boxes<00:04:29.400> there

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.200 

ok<00:04:33.480> so<00:04:33.540> we're<00:04:33.930> head<00:04:34.080> there<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.040> go<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:36.090> we're

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
ok so we're head there you go so we're

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.770 
ok so we're head there you go so we're
at<00:04:36.270> 2.49<00:04:36.810> right<00:04:37.140> now<00:04:37.880> that's<00:04:38.880> was<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.450> seven

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
at 2.49 right now that's was a to seven

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.690 
at 2.49 right now that's was a to seven
percent<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.410> we<00:04:40.890> put<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.160> ring<00:04:41.310> back<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.580> eight

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
percent so we put the ring back to eight

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.270 
percent so we put the ring back to eight
percent<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.510> puts<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.750> at<00:04:42.840> 2.51<00:04:43.350> so

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
percent and it puts you at 2.51 so

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.740 
percent and it puts you at 2.51 so
that's<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.580> total<00:04:44.700> of<00:04:45.000> thirty-three<00:04:45.480> percent

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
that's a total of thirty-three percent

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.540 
that's a total of thirty-three percent
attack<00:04:46.140> speed<00:04:46.380> from<00:04:46.500> gear<00:04:49.040> was<00:04:50.040> at<00:04:50.220> point<00:04:50.430> two

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
attack speed from gear was at point two

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.120 
attack speed from gear was at point two
five<00:04:50.730> attacks<00:04:51.120> per<00:04:51.240> second<00:04:51.570> echo<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.840> fear<00:04:52.130> so

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
five attacks per second echo in fear so

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.290 
five attacks per second echo in fear so
it<00:04:53.220> should<00:04:53.370> make<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:53.520> easier<00:04:53.910> for<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.270> to

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
it should make it easier for you to

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.210 
it should make it easier for you to
purchase<00:04:54.870> items<00:04:55.290> you<00:04:55.440> won't<00:04:55.590> have<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.950> you

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
purchase items you won't have to you

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.580 
purchase items you won't have to you
know<00:04:56.340> buy<00:04:56.520> rings<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.150> like<00:04:57.270> or<00:04:58.050> by<00:04:58.200> random

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
know buy rings and like or by random

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.050 
know buy rings and like or by random
items<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.070> kind<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.310> test<00:04:59.520> out<00:04:59.730> where<00:04:59.940> your

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
items and kind of test out where your

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.690 
items and kind of test out where your
break<00:05:00.240> point<00:05:00.480> is<00:05:01.040> so<00:05:02.040> I<00:05:02.070> know<00:05:02.220> exactly<00:05:02.610> how

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
break point is so I know exactly how

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.120 
break point is so I know exactly how
much<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:02.940> need<00:05:03.500> we'll<00:05:04.500> have<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.680> written<00:05:04.890> guide

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
much you need we'll have a written guide

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.320 
much you need we'll have a written guide
for<00:05:05.280> this<00:05:05.340> as<00:05:05.490> well<00:05:05.610> on<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.820> website<00:05:06.150> so<00:05:06.180> you

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
for this as well on the website so you

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.300 
for this as well on the website so you
can<00:05:06.390> check<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.660> out<00:05:06.780> into<00:05:07.140> info<00:05:07.410> below<00:05:07.590> maybe

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
can check that out into info below maybe

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.430 
can check that out into info below maybe
that<00:05:08.550> will<00:05:08.700> explain<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.420> little<00:05:09.510> little<00:05:10.320> bit

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
that will explain it a little little bit

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.740 
that will explain it a little little bit
better<00:05:10.640> that<00:05:11.640> I<00:05:11.700> can<00:05:11.850> articulate<00:05:12.240> my<00:05:12.480> points

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
better that I can articulate my points

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.130 
better that I can articulate my points
better<00:05:12.870> in<00:05:13.050> writing<00:05:14.780> but<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.840> think<00:05:16.080> that's

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
better in writing but I think that's

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.070 
better in writing but I think that's
about<00:05:16.290> it<00:05:16.410> for<00:05:16.560> this<00:05:16.860> breakpoint<00:05:17.250> guide<00:05:17.550> and
