double<00:04:13.310> check<00:04:13.489> that<00:04:13.519> but<00:04:16.510> obviously<00:04:17.510> being

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
double check that but obviously being

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.670 
double check that but obviously being
1952<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:19.579> year<00:04:19.760> 2000<00:04:20.419> they<00:04:20.989> will<00:04:21.289> have<00:04:21.500> the

could<00:05:26.710> possibly<00:05:26.890> make<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.550> film<00:05:27.820> look<00:05:28.030> so<00:05:28.810> I

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
could possibly make the film look so I

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.430 
could possibly make the film look so I
think<00:05:30.130> they<00:05:30.490> get<00:05:30.700> 5<00:05:31.270> stars<00:05:31.630> out<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:31.870> 5<00:05:32.110> for<00:05:32.350> the

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
think they get 5 stars out of 5 for the

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.210 
think they get 5 stars out of 5 for the
picture<00:05:32.740> quality<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:35.740> know<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:35.890> mean

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
picture quality and you know I mean

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.500 
picture quality and you know I mean
there<00:05:36.370> might<00:05:36.460> even<00:05:36.520> be<00:05:36.730> some<00:05:36.850> people<00:05:37.210> who

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
there might even be some people who

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.620 
there might even be some people who
might<00:05:37.750> be<00:05:37.960> disappointed<00:05:38.590> that<00:05:38.620> this<00:05:39.450> grain<00:05:40.450> in

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
might be disappointed that this grain in

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.850 
might be disappointed that this grain in
it<00:05:40.750> but<00:05:40.930> I<00:05:40.960> think<00:05:41.830> it<00:05:41.979> looks<00:05:42.130> great<00:05:42.280> so<00:05:43.090> well

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.000 
not much but the restorations done on
the<00:06:06.280> film<00:06:06.490> are<00:06:07.270> fantastic<00:06:08.020> and<00:06:08.350> you<00:06:08.800> can't

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
beat the first one it's hands-down the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.170
