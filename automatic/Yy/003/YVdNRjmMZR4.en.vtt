00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.679 

and<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.310> these<00:01:50.429> stores<00:01:50.759> below<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.509> your

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and in these stores below you have your

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.349 
and in these stores below you have your
different<00:01:51.990> types<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.560> blades<00:01:53.240> for<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
different types of blades for the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:02.300 
different types of blades for the
different<00:01:54.780> size<00:01:57.619> cuts<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.520> want<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
different size cuts that you want so and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.660 
different size cuts that you want so and
it<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.179> just<00:02:03.450> slide<00:02:03.990> these<00:02:04.350> inherent<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
it you just slide these inherent so I

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
it you just slide these inherent so I
don't<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.569> this<00:02:06.719> device<00:02:07.170> could<00:02:07.469> get<00:02:07.770> any

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
don't know if this device could get any

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.380 
don't know if this device could get any
more<00:02:08.190> simple<00:02:08.399> Matt<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:11.390> blade

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
more simple Matt out so this blade

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.100 
more simple Matt out so this blade
creates<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.230> small<00:02:13.530> spaghetti-like<00:02:14.280> cuts

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
creates the small spaghetti-like cuts

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.100 
creates the small spaghetti-like cuts
the<00:02:16.110> medium<00:02:16.590> thick<00:02:16.980> cuts<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:18.540> straight<00:02:18.900> blade

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
the medium thick cuts the straight blade

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.819 
the medium thick cuts the straight blade
creates<00:02:19.769> ribbon<00:02:20.370> light<00:02:20.579> cuts<00:02:21.349> so<00:02:22.349> I'm<00:02:22.560> going

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
creates ribbon light cuts so I'm going

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:28.520 
creates ribbon light cuts so I'm going
to<00:02:22.950> pop<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.880> small<00:02:24.599> one<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:26.190> pull<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:28.200> off

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to pop in a small one and pull this off

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.520 
to pop in a small one and pull this off
and<00:02:29.069> I'm<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.579> run<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.299> under<00:02:30.690> some<00:02:30.720> soapy

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
and I'm going to run it under some soapy

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.720 
and I'm going to run it under some soapy
warm<00:02:31.860> water<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:34.170> slide<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
warm water and slide this in with the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.270 
warm water and slide this in with the
blade<00:02:36.030> facing<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:39.269> handle<00:02:40.099> now<00:02:41.099> I'm

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
blade facing the handle now I'm

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.069 
blade facing the handle now I'm
right-handed<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.180> I'm<00:02:42.450> going<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.630> just<00:02:42.840> turn
