00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay I'm gonna do a quick tutorial on

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.619 
okay I'm gonna do a quick tutorial on
how<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.659> install<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.259> resistors<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:05.220> the

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:05.629 
how to install the resistors on the

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.480 
how to install the resistors on the
Recon<00:00:06.629> smoked<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.379> clear<00:00:07.680> front<00:00:08.130> headlights

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
Recon smoked and clear front headlights

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.370 
Recon smoked and clear front headlights
lots<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.179> people<00:00:09.420> have<00:00:09.570> problems<00:00:10.050> on

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
lots of people have problems on

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.830 
lots of people have problems on
installing<00:00:11.070> them<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:12.030> I'm<00:00:12.360> just<00:00:12.480> gonna<00:00:12.599> give<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
installing them so I'm just gonna give a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.600 
installing them so I'm just gonna give a
little<00:00:12.929> tutorial<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:14.040> how<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.250> do<00:00:14.460> it

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
little tutorial on how to do it

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.260 
little tutorial on how to do it
basically<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.830> headlight<00:00:17.699> wiring

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
basically you have the headlight wiring

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.500 
basically you have the headlight wiring
harness<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.810> stock<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.260> right<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.510> it's

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
harness the stock one right here it's

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.679 
harness the stock one right here it's
got<00:00:22.010> two<00:00:23.010> white<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.310> green<00:00:23.699> wires<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
got two white and green wires and then a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.710 
got two white and green wires and then a
black<00:00:25.080> wire<00:00:25.400> you<00:00:26.400> want<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> find<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> outside

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
black wire you want to find the outside

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720 
black wire you want to find the outside
white<00:00:28.320> wire<00:00:28.529> ones<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> outside<00:00:29.250> right

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
white wire ones on the outside right

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.569 
white wire ones on the outside right
here<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.119> then<00:00:30.779> ones<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> middle<00:00:31.579> find

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
here and then ones in the middle find

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.690 
here and then ones in the middle find
the<00:00:32.669> outside<00:00:33.149> white<00:00:33.360> wire<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.700> your

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the outside white wire and you have your

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
the outside white wire and you have your
tap<00:00:36.210> connectors<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:36.960> what<00:00:37.110> they're

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
tap connectors that's what they're

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.100 
tap connectors that's what they're
called<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.899> what<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.989> want

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
called they look like this what you want

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.610 
called they look like this what you want
to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.980> has<00:00:41.129> two<00:00:41.760> channels<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:43.260> want<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
to do is it has two channels you want to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.150 
to do is it has two channels you want to
put<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> wire<00:00:45.710> into<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:48.379> channel<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:50.070> like

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
put the wire into a channel just like

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
put the wire into a channel just like
that<00:00:50.840> right<00:00:51.840> there<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:54.500> let's<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.680> up

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that right there and then let's get up

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.150 
that right there and then let's get up
alright<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.570> slip<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.289> resistor

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
alright and then you slip the resistor

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.569 
alright and then you slip the resistor
wire<00:01:00.170> into<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> other<00:01:01.559> part<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> channel

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
wire into the other part of the channel

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.500 
wire into the other part of the channel
I'm<00:01:03.500> just<00:01:04.500> gonna<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.610> then

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
I'm just gonna like that and then

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.230 
I'm just gonna like that and then
there's<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.260> metal<00:01:07.409> tab<00:01:08.090> what<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
there's this little metal tab what you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
there's this little metal tab what you
do<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.290> want<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.130> wire

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
do is I don't want to do it on this wire

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.359 
do is I don't want to do it on this wire
but<00:01:11.960> once<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> two<00:01:13.470> wires<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:14.189> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
but once the two wires are in there you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
but once the two wires are in there you
just<00:01:14.760> push<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.900> down<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.409> thumb

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
just push this down with your thumb

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.289 
just push this down with your thumb
sometimes<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.580> kind<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> hard<00:01:18.000> use<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
sometimes it can be kind of hard use a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.480 
sometimes it can be kind of hard use a
pair<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.570> pliers<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:19.979> sit<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
pair of pliers and it will sit there and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.130 
pair of pliers and it will sit there and
it<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.869> put<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:22.259> crimp<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.670> wires

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
it will put a little crimp in the wires

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.990 
it will put a little crimp in the wires
I've<00:01:25.140> got<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.759> barely

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
I've got it on this one it's barely

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.410 
I've got it on this one it's barely
noticeable<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.659> looks<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.420> then

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
noticeable it looks like that and then

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.359 
noticeable it looks like that and then
what<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> other<00:01:31.590> end<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> other<00:01:32.070> end

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
what with the other end the other end

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.370 
what with the other end the other end
that<00:01:32.460> isn't<00:01:32.729> attached<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.090> anything<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:34.259> go

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that isn't attached to anything you go

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.469 
that isn't attached to anything you go
to<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> black<00:01:34.860> wire<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> same

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
to the black wire and you do the same

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.200 
to the black wire and you do the same
thing<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> black<00:01:37.140> wire<00:01:37.909> once<00:01:38.909> you've<00:01:39.060> done

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
thing on the black wire once you've done

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.600 
thing on the black wire once you've done
that<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.900> mount<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.979> mounted<00:01:41.520> the
