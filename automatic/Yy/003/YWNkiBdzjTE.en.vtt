00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.050
 in the quarry 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.730
 It born in Peru of the 90 hand 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.800
 abel who can be said to work 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.340
 well in martial arts with the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.570
 natural method of displacement and is is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.990
 a discipline that takes 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.759
 fundamentally out 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.540
 the help is to go from a point to a 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.500
 point as smoothly as possible with 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.540
 efficient and safe movements 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.390
 using let's say the body 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.310
 then in the 2000 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.530
 it can be said fundamentally that the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 discipline was divided in two 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.119
 in the parkour that keeps the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.479
 more orthodox movements and the fair run 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.119
 that adds to the stunts and the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.180
 competitiveness since parkour let's say 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.740
 in its basic form is self-improvement 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.740
 and very competitive 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.780
 The practice of parkour is not needed 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.030
 security elements such as knee guards and 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.970
 helmets because the idea of ​​parkour is 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.190
 be aware of the 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 movements that are performed one of the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.480
 mottos of parkour is to be and last 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.760
 it means doing the practices of 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.390
 sure way to be able to last in the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.170
 time and not suffer injuries that consumes 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.170
 the practice 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.160
 for me parkour is much more than a 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.490
 discipline is a lifestyle because 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.340
 all the philosophy that was learning the 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.160
 carried out not only at the time of 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.950
 practice exercise but also all 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.320
 rest of the day I happened to go there to go 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.080
 walking and go see the structures of 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.750
 the places where I can make a 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.720
 movement or also if there are some 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.260
 pipes go walking in pipes 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.120
 train is the time to download 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.070
 everything that happens all the bad 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.210
 frustrations out there so much the faculty 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.330
 like family 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.020
 it's a time to be with a 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.020
 uncomfortably 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.000
 personally the practice of parkour in 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.120
 the profession in several aspects 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.280
 the progress not only progress 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.260
 personally but it feels at all 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.470
 the group the group was always 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.090
 constantly supporting and also me 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.000
 it offered the possibility of parkour of 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.530
 travel to many cities 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.750
 and make commercials or events what 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.720
 let's say for me it was amazing 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.600
 and there is simply the possibility of 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.030
 have friends and not to compete with them 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.030
 but to progress together
