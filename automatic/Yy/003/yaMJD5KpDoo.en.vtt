on<00:00:30.439> a<00:00:30.500> viewers<00:00:31.070> question<00:00:31.610> asking<00:00:32.150> about<00:00:32.509> salt

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
on a viewers question asking about salt

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.380 
on a viewers question asking about salt
and<00:00:33.200> water<00:00:33.440> retention<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.640> I've<00:00:34.850> mentioned<00:00:35.030> in

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
and water retention so I've mentioned in

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.600 
and water retention so I've mentioned in
previous<00:00:35.420> videos<00:00:36.140> that<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:37.010> know<00:00:37.100> consuming

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
previous videos that you know consuming

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.760 
previous videos that you know consuming
salt<00:00:37.879> in<00:00:38.030> one's<00:00:38.180> diet<00:00:38.449> can<00:00:38.750> lead<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:39.140> puffiness

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
salt in one's diet can lead to puffiness

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.950 
salt in one's diet can lead to puffiness
and<00:00:40.100> bloating<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:40.760> perceived<00:00:41.390> weight<00:00:41.690> gain

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
and bloating and perceived weight gain

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.869 
and bloating and perceived weight gain
so<00:00:42.410> today's<00:00:42.680> video<00:00:42.860> will<00:00:43.220> discuss<00:00:43.550> why<00:00:43.820> this

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
so today's video will discuss why this

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.240 
so today's video will discuss why this
happens<00:00:44.449> and<00:00:44.750> how<00:00:44.960> you<00:00:45.019> can<00:00:45.379> prevent<00:00:45.620> it<00:00:45.980> so

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
happens and how you can prevent it so

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.520 
happens and how you can prevent it so

400 milligrams of sodium your body will

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.210 
400 milligrams of sodium your body will
compensate<00:01:59.030> by<00:01:59.600> retaining<00:02:00.020> 4<00:02:00.470> cups<00:02:00.890> of<00:02:01.159> water

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
compensate by retaining 4 cups of water

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.640 
compensate by retaining 4 cups of water
within<00:02:01.820> your<00:02:02.150> body<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.720> this<00:02:03.080> is<00:02:03.260> roughly

and that's only for 400 milligrams of
sodium<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:13.140> know<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.319> think<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.769> how<00:02:13.980> much<00:02:14.190> is

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
sodium you know you think of how much is

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.390 
sodium you know you think of how much is
in<00:02:14.489> one<00:02:14.700> teaspoon<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.599> table<00:02:16.080> salt<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.190> get

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
in one teaspoon of table salt and we get

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.949 
in one teaspoon of table salt and we get
two<00:02:17.670> thousand<00:02:18.269> three<00:02:18.540> hundred<00:02:18.690> and

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
two thousand three hundred and

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.530 
two thousand three hundred and
twenty-five<00:02:19.379> milligrams<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.489> sodium<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.090> so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
twenty-five milligrams of sodium and so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.170 
twenty-five milligrams of sodium and so
if<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> math<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:23.069> know<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.519> you

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
if we do the math and we know that you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.759 
if we do the math and we know that you
know<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:24.480> average<00:02:24.629> person<00:02:24.840> will<00:02:25.409> consume

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
know the average person will consume

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.740 
know the average person will consume
three<00:02:26.069> thousand<00:02:26.549> four<00:02:26.730> hundred<00:02:26.790> milligrams<00:02:27.329> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
three thousand four hundred milligrams a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.619 
three thousand four hundred milligrams a
day<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.620> equates<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.220> 17<00:02:29.940> pounds<00:02:30.510> of

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
day this equates to 17 pounds of

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.899 
day this equates to 17 pounds of
retained<00:02:31.049> water<00:02:31.379> in<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.739> body<00:02:31.980> roughly<00:02:32.549> and

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
retained water in the body roughly and

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.930 
retained water in the body roughly and
that's<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.720> due<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.019> added<00:02:34.680> salts<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> high

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
that's just due to added salts so a high

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.330 
that's just due to added salts so a high
sodium<00:02:36.239> diet<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:37.019> cause<00:02:37.230> more<00:02:37.769> issues<00:02:38.310> than

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
sodium diet can cause more issues than

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.970 
sodium diet can cause more issues than
just<00:02:38.549> water<00:02:39.060> weight<00:02:39.329> gain<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:40.140> also<00:02:40.500> elevates

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
just water weight gain it also elevates

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.770 
just water weight gain it also elevates
your<00:02:41.160> blood<00:02:41.430> pressure<00:02:41.760> because<00:02:42.090> there's<00:02:42.569> more

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
your blood pressure because there's more

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.869 
your blood pressure because there's more
water<00:02:43.079> in<00:02:43.379> your<00:02:43.560> blood<00:02:43.799> trying<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.310> dilute<00:02:44.489> the

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
water in your blood trying to dilute the

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.910 
water in your blood trying to dilute the
salt<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.450> therefore<00:02:46.170> there's<00:02:46.349> more<00:02:46.560> pressure

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
salt and therefore there's more pressure

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.490 
salt and therefore there's more pressure
in<00:02:47.340> your<00:02:47.489> vessels<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.269> in<00:02:48.629> your<00:02:48.780> arteries<00:02:49.260> and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
in your vessels and in your arteries and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.470 
in your vessels and in your arteries and
this<00:02:50.069> actually<00:02:50.459> increases<00:02:50.760> your<00:02:51.150> risk<00:02:51.299> of

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
this actually increases your risk of

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.750 
this actually increases your risk of
having<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.959> heart<00:02:52.200> attack<00:02:52.260> or<00:02:52.650> stroke<00:02:52.859> so

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
having a heart attack or stroke so

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.180 
having a heart attack or stroke so
sodium<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.329> highly<00:02:54.810> tied<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.470> water<00:02:55.709> within

within our body when sodium is consumed

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.460 
within our body when sodium is consumed
our<00:03:11.459> bodies<00:03:11.819> release<00:03:12.060> water<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.109> it<00:03:13.139> can

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
our bodies release water and so it can

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.559 
our bodies release water and so it can
escort<00:03:13.919> the<00:03:14.099> sodium<00:03:14.489> out<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.880> our<00:03:15.030> urine<00:03:15.389> and

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
escort the sodium out in our urine and

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.990 
escort the sodium out in our urine and
then<00:03:16.019> we<00:03:16.169> are<00:03:16.319> left<00:03:16.500> with<00:03:16.769> less<00:03:16.980> water<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
then we are left with less water so the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.449 
then we are left with less water so the
same<00:03:18.299> Osmo<00:03:18.810> receptors<00:03:19.380> detect<00:03:19.859> this<00:03:20.069> states

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
same Osmo receptors detect this states

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.240 
same Osmo receptors detect this states
and<00:03:20.790> trigger<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.450> sensation<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.380> thirst<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:23.069> get

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
and trigger a sensation of thirst to get

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.830 
and trigger a sensation of thirst to get
you<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.459> drink<00:03:23.730> more<00:03:23.910> water<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.510> replenish

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
you to drink more water to replenish

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.930 
you to drink more water to replenish
your<00:03:25.019> water<00:03:25.349> stores<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.519> your<00:03:26.669> body<00:03:26.849> can

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
your water stores so your body can

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.000 
your water stores so your body can
return<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.599> proper<00:03:28.019> concentrations<00:03:28.889> of

return to the proper concentrations of
electrolytes<00:03:29.549> this<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.629> a<00:03:30.660> big<00:03:30.900> reason<00:03:31.109> why

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
electrolytes this is a big reason why

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.039 
electrolytes this is a big reason why
places<00:03:31.919> like<00:03:32.099> bars<00:03:32.400> will<00:03:32.730> offer<00:03:32.970> salty<00:03:33.690> snacks

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
places like bars will offer salty snacks

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.009 
places like bars will offer salty snacks
like<00:03:34.260> pretzels<00:03:34.590> or<00:03:35.010> peanuts<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:36.209> salt<00:03:36.480> causes

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
like pretzels or peanuts the salt causes

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.930 
like pretzels or peanuts the salt causes
us<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.169> become<00:03:37.440> thirsty<00:03:38.129> and<00:03:38.280> then<00:03:38.400> order<00:03:38.730> more

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
us to become thirsty and then order more

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.720 
us to become thirsty and then order more
alcoholic<00:03:39.540> drinks<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.709> water<00:03:40.949> tension<00:03:41.310> may

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
alcoholic drinks so water tension may

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.939 
alcoholic drinks so water tension may
occur<00:03:42.150> because<00:03:42.449> the<00:03:42.930> pressure<00:03:43.199> inside<00:03:43.530> our

fluid which is composed of nutrients
oxygen<00:03:51.629> etc<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.949> our<00:03:53.099> capillaries<00:03:53.430> carry<00:03:54.030> this

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
oxygen etc so our capillaries carry this

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.720

retention of this fluid within our small

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.180 
retention of this fluid within our small
capillaries<00:04:09.150> causes<00:04:10.019> pressure<00:04:10.379> within<00:04:10.769> them

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
capillaries causes pressure within them

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.250 
capillaries causes pressure within them
and<00:04:11.400> then<00:04:11.760> they<00:04:11.879> start<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.359> leak<00:04:12.660> out<00:04:12.840> this

tissue<00:04:18.060> space<00:04:18.479> between<00:04:18.930> our<00:04:18.989> cells<00:04:19.440> this

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
tissue space between our cells this

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.610 
tissue space between our cells this
causes<00:04:20.280> edema<00:04:20.669> which<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.150> water<00:04:21.390> retention<00:04:21.719> so

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
causes edema which is water retention so

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.120 
causes edema which is water retention so
the<00:04:22.800> more

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
the more

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.130 
the more
fluid<00:04:23.400> that's<00:04:23.550> released<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.420> more<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.930> more

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
fluid that's released the more and more

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.050 
fluid that's released the more and more
of<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.380> will<00:04:25.500> actually<00:04:25.680> remain<00:04:26.280> in<00:04:26.610> our<00:04:26.700> skin

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
of it will actually remain in our skin

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.180 
of it will actually remain in our skin
tissue<00:04:27.330> rather<00:04:28.050> than<00:04:28.320> returning<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:29.100> our

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
tissue rather than returning to our

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.430 
tissue rather than returning to our
capillaries<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:30.420> this<00:04:30.540> results<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.200> swelling

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
capillaries so this results in swelling

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.020 
capillaries so this results in swelling
and<00:04:31.980> water<00:04:32.220> logging

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
and water logging

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.140 
and water logging
so<00:04:33.390> basically<00:04:33.990> when<00:04:34.380> we<00:04:34.500> consume<00:04:34.980> salts<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.760> is

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
so basically when we consume salts it is

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.810 
so basically when we consume salts it is
the<00:04:36.330> water<00:04:36.570> moving<00:04:37.230> from<00:04:37.650> our<00:04:37.830> bloodstream<00:04:38.160> to

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
the water moving from our bloodstream to

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.270 
the water moving from our bloodstream to
our<00:04:39.000> skin<00:04:39.360> tissue<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:40.020> causes<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.740> puffy

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
our skin tissue that causes that puffy

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.580 
our skin tissue that causes that puffy
look<00:04:41.520> so<00:04:41.970> if<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.330> are<00:04:42.540> consuming<00:04:43.200> cells<00:04:43.440> in

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
look so if you are consuming cells in

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.320 
look so if you are consuming cells in
your<00:04:43.740> diet<00:04:43.950> water<00:04:44.250> retention<00:04:44.670> is<00:04:45.000> something

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
your diet water retention is something

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.270 
your diet water retention is something
that<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:45.570> may<00:04:45.690> be<00:04:45.750> experiencing<00:04:46.500> I<00:04:46.680> think

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
that you may be experiencing I think

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.040 
that you may be experiencing I think
it's<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.490> real<00:04:47.640> pity<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.210> people<00:04:48.600> stop<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
it's a real pity that people stop the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.480 
it's a real pity that people stop the
diet<00:04:49.260> when<00:04:49.530> they<00:04:49.650> perceive<00:04:50.040> weight<00:04:50.250> gain

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
diet when they perceive weight gain

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.610 
diet when they perceive weight gain
because<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:51.390> know<00:04:51.510> salt<00:04:51.840> is<00:04:52.020> just<00:04:52.290> another

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
because you know salt is just another

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.310 
because you know salt is just another
influencing<00:04:53.370> factor<00:04:53.850> as<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.510> said<00:04:54.720> before<00:04:54.900> you

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
influencing factor as I said before you

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.570 
influencing factor as I said before you
know<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.500> could<00:04:55.740> be<00:04:55.830> holding<00:04:56.160> up<00:04:56.370> to

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
know you could be holding up to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.820 
know you could be holding up to
seventeen<00:04:57.120> pounds<00:04:57.420> of<00:04:57.930> water<00:04:58.290> weight<00:04:58.440> if

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
seventeen pounds of water weight if

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.920 
seventeen pounds of water weight if
you're<00:04:59.010> consuming<00:04:59.430> what<00:04:59.970> average<00:05:00.180> Americans

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
you're consuming what average Americans

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.220 
you're consuming what average Americans
do<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:02.190> your<00:05:02.400> minimum<00:05:02.850> sodium<00:05:03.300> requirement<00:05:04.020> is

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
do so your minimum sodium requirement is

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.810 
do so your minimum sodium requirement is
a<00:05:04.260> hundred<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:04.890> eighty<00:05:05.070> milligrams<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.790> day

a hundred and eighty milligrams a day

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.910 
a hundred and eighty milligrams a day
and<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.750> will<00:05:06.870> definitely<00:05:07.140> reach<00:05:07.680> this

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
and you will definitely reach this

you'd find in animal products if you

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.730 
you'd find in animal products if you
still<00:05:29.280> do<00:05:29.490> want<00:05:29.730> to<00:05:29.910> use<00:05:30.120> additional<00:05:30.780> salt<00:05:31.110> on

still do want to use additional salt on

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.500 
still do want to use additional salt on
your<00:05:31.800> starch<00:05:32.340> meals<00:05:32.640> if<00:05:32.970> they're<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.390> little

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
your starch meals if they're a little

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.030 
your starch meals if they're a little
bit<00:05:33.660> bland<00:05:33.960> and<00:05:34.170> you<00:05:34.260> just<00:05:34.440> want<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.650> flavor<00:05:34.920> it

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
bit bland and you just want to flavor it

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.010 
bit bland and you just want to flavor it
a<00:05:35.160> little<00:05:35.310> bit<00:05:35.550> then<00:05:36.060> I'd<00:05:36.270> say<00:05:36.540> you<00:05:36.600> can<00:05:36.870> do

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
a little bit then I'd say you can do

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.260 
a little bit then I'd say you can do
this<00:05:37.200> but<00:05:37.500> just<00:05:37.710> don't<00:05:37.980> add<00:05:38.610> any<00:05:38.850> salt<00:05:39.150> when

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
this but just don't add any salt when

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.000 
this but just don't add any salt when
you're<00:05:39.390> preparing<00:05:39.810> your<00:05:40.020> meal<00:05:40.200> so<00:05:40.860> when

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
you're preparing your meal so when

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.500 
you're preparing your meal so when
you're<00:05:41.160> cooking<00:05:41.310> your<00:05:41.610> soup<00:05:41.820> don't<00:05:42.060> add<00:05:42.240> any

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
you're cooking your soup don't add any

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.810 
you're cooking your soup don't add any
when<00:05:43.020> it's<00:05:43.170> in<00:05:43.380> your<00:05:43.560> bowl<00:05:43.770> just<00:05:44.370> sprinkle<00:05:44.760> a

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
when it's in your bowl just sprinkle a

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.310 
when it's in your bowl just sprinkle a
little<00:05:44.940> bit<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.270> salt<00:05:45.450> on<00:05:45.570> the<00:05:45.660> surface<00:05:46.080> and

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
little bit of salt on the surface and

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.230 
little bit of salt on the surface and
then<00:05:46.770> those<00:05:46.920> salt<00:05:47.190> granules<00:05:47.610> are<00:05:47.880> going<00:05:48.060> to<00:05:48.120> be

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
then those salt granules are going to be

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.910 
then those salt granules are going to be
hitting<00:05:48.480> your<00:05:48.690> taste<00:05:48.930> buds<00:05:49.170> directly<00:05:49.680> and

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
hitting your taste buds directly and

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.260 
hitting your taste buds directly and
you're<00:05:50.040> going<00:05:50.220> to<00:05:50.310> get<00:05:50.460> that<00:05:50.640> satisfaction

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
you're going to get that satisfaction

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.390 
you're going to get that satisfaction
from<00:05:51.540> the<00:05:51.690> salt<00:05:51.900> without<00:05:52.290> having<00:05:52.920> to<00:05:53.010> take<00:05:53.190> in

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
from the salt without having to take in

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.430 
from the salt without having to take in
a<00:05:53.490> lot<00:05:53.610> of<00:05:53.670> sodium<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.360> if<00:05:54.930> you<00:05:55.080> think<00:05:55.320> you're

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
a lot of sodium and if you think you're

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.140 
a lot of sodium and if you think you're
still<00:05:55.680> experiencing<00:05:56.280> water<00:05:56.490> retention<00:05:56.790> I

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
still experiencing water retention I

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.300 
still experiencing water retention I
would<00:05:57.330> bring<00:05:57.540> down<00:05:57.780> your<00:05:58.290> salt<00:05:58.590> allowance<00:05:59.010> to

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
would bring down your salt allowance to

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.790
