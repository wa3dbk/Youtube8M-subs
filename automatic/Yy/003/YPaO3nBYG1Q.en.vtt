combat and i might do more of these not
sure<00:00:11.610> yet<00:00:11.820> but<00:00:11.880> as<00:00:12.570> i<00:00:12.599> said<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.170> possible

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
sure yet but as i said it's a possible

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.689 
sure yet but as i said it's a possible
series<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.549> let's<00:00:14.910> just<00:00:15.030> go<00:00:15.150> right<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.450> and

series so let's just go right to it and
the<00:00:17.699> support<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> class<00:00:19.289> i<00:00:19.560> would<00:00:19.710> recommend

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the support is a class i would recommend

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.269 
the support is a class i would recommend
for<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:21.080> beginner<00:00:22.080> at<00:00:22.380> super<00:00:22.890> manga<00:00:23.039> like

combat<00:00:23.789> as<00:00:24.060> i<00:00:24.840> assessed<00:00:25.830> by<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:25.980> easiest

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
combat as i assessed by the easiest

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.470 
combat as i assessed by the easiest
class<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.269> useful<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.140> team<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
class to be useful to your team with and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
class to be useful to your team with and
the<00:00:30.480> game<00:00:30.750> itself<00:00:30.960> also<00:00:33.500> describes<00:00:34.500> the

the game itself also describes the
support<00:00:35.100> has<00:00:35.250> been<00:00:35.280> quite<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.180> easy<00:00:36.930> class<00:00:38.180> so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
support has been quite an easy class so

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450 
support has been quite an easy class so
you<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.110> two<00:00:40.320> weapons<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.219> your

you have two weapons you have your
shotgun<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.780> practically<00:00:43.260> useless<00:00:43.829> out

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
shotgun which is practically useless out

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.880 
shotgun which is practically useless out
of<00:00:44.309> Ainge<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:45.200> slightly<00:00:46.200> better<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.680> close

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
of Ainge but slightly better at close

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.340 
of Ainge but slightly better at close
range<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.460> use<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> map<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.750> imagine

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
range as use a map as you them imagine

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.639 
range as use a map as you them imagine
for<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> shotgun<00:00:50.239> but<00:00:51.239> Tim<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.199> usually

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
for a shotgun but Tim it's not usually

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.830 
for a shotgun but Tim it's not usually
the<00:00:52.860> risk<00:00:53.129> i<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.610> say<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:53.879> getting<00:00:54.690> in

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the risk i would say for getting in

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.610 
the risk i would say for getting in
close<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.590> extra<00:00:55.920> damage<00:00:56.510> as<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.620> support

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
close for that extra damage as a support

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.689 
close for that extra damage as a support
you<00:00:58.920> generally<00:00:59.340> want<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.730> avoid<00:01:00.690> them

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
you generally want to avoid them

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.380 
you generally want to avoid them
straight<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.730> combat<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.899> enemies<00:01:04.549> but<00:01:05.549> you

also use it to damage enemies with the
secondary<00:01:17.369> fire<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.030> Sam<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.810> use

secondary fire but Sam if you do use

secondary fire but Sam if you do use
this<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> secondary<00:01:19.979> fire<00:01:20.280> you'll<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
this as a secondary fire you'll have to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.730 
this as a secondary fire you'll have to
reload<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.229> weapon<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:24.110> you<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.320> free

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
reload the weapon so you have your free

reload the weapon so you have your free
skills<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.880> shift<00:01:27.090> key<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.659> have

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
skills on the shift key you have

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.499 
skills on the shift key you have
overclocked<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:29.460> increases<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.299> speed

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
overclocked this increases your speed

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.340 
overclocked this increases your speed
and<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:31.229> skill<00:01:31.650> recovery<00:01:32.329> but<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:34.110> also

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and your skill recovery but it also

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
and your skill recovery but it also
increases<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.280> damage<00:01:35.520> output<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.240> your

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
increases the damage output for your

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
increases the damage output for your
firebase<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> century<00:01:38.159> which<00:01:38.310> I'll

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
firebase which is the century which I'll

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.859 
firebase which is the century which I'll
get<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> later<00:01:39.020> but<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.650> find<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.520> this

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
get to later but then I find that this

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
get to later but then I find that this
skill<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:42.899> particularly<00:01:43.500> useful<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:44.280> getting

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
skill is particularly useful for getting

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
skill is particularly useful for getting
out<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.909> sticky<00:01:45.240> situations<00:01:45.540> where<00:01:46.350> you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
out of sticky situations where you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.730 
out of sticky situations where you
expect<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> die<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:48.360> I'm<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.990> support<00:01:49.560> in

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
expect to die and as I'm the support in

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590 
expect to die and as I'm the support in
particular<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.430> very<00:01:50.640> important<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> stay

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
particular it's very important to stay

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.020 
particular it's very important to stay
alive<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.290> should<00:01:52.950> hope<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.399> alive<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.850> heal

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
alive I should hope to be alive to heal

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.530 
alive I should hope to be alive to heal
your<00:01:54.180> teammates<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.990> obviously<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> is

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
your teammates and obviously that is

your teammates and obviously that is
quite<00:01:57.540> important<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.729> sometimes<00:01:59.969> tip

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
quite important and it can sometimes tip

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.240 
quite important and it can sometimes tip
the<00:02:00.810> balance<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> game<00:02:01.469> if<00:02:01.740> you

you're<00:02:12.120> graded<00:02:12.600> but<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.310> use<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
you're graded but you can use the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.600 
you're graded but you can use the
secondary<00:02:15.360> fire<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.080> heel<00:02:16.470> /<00:02:16.950> third<00:02:17.280> gone

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
secondary fire of the heel / third gone

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.810 
secondary fire of the heel / third gone
to<00:02:18.420> concentrate<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> specific<00:02:20.310> target

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
to concentrate it's on a specific target

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.100 
to concentrate it's on a specific target
I<00:02:23.240> find<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.330> particularly<00:02:24.660> useful<00:02:24.900> for

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
I find it particularly useful for

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.620 
I find it particularly useful for
keeping<00:02:25.410> enemies<00:02:25.980> away<00:02:26.340> from<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.790> certain<00:02:27.240> spot

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
keeping enemies away from a certain spot

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.540 
keeping enemies away from a certain spot
especially<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.160> Annihilator<00:02:29.820> area<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
especially the Annihilator area and

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.729 
especially the Annihilator area and
especially<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.940> loco<00:02:33.360> moco<00:02:33.840> avena<00:02:34.260> map<00:02:34.560> I

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
especially on the loco moco avena map I

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.290 
especially on the loco moco avena map I
think<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.190> called<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.610> particular<00:02:35.850> where

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
think it's called in particular where

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.140 
think it's called in particular where
the<00:02:36.920> Annihilator<00:02:37.920> spot<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.700> particularly

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
the Annihilator spot is particularly

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.660 
the Annihilator spot is particularly
small<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.110> e<00:02:43.320> key<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.070> have<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.280> air

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
small and on the e key you have the air

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.090 
small and on the e key you have the air
strike<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.959> froze<00:02:46.320> out<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.500> beacon<00:02:46.980> that

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
strike this froze out the beacon that

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.910 
strike this froze out the beacon that
you<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.280> attach<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.580> enemies<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.239> walls<00:02:48.920> and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
you can attach to enemies and walls and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.370 
you can attach to enemies and walls and
of<00:02:50.280> course<00:02:50.550> it's<00:02:50.910> useless<00:02:51.239> if<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.900> target<00:02:52.260> is

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
of course it's useless if the target is

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.290 
of course it's useless if the target is
under<00:02:52.680> cover<00:02:52.890> since<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.520> air<00:02:53.820> strikes<00:02:54.060> going

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
under cover since the air strikes going

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.540 
under cover since the air strikes going
to<00:02:54.390> come<00:02:54.540> from<00:02:54.690> above<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.250> particularly

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
to come from above but it's particularly

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.410 
to come from above but it's particularly
useful<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:57.030> whittling<00:02:57.480> down<00:02:57.720> alpha<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.560> its

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
useful for whittling down alpha to its

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.630 
useful for whittling down alpha to its
without<00:03:00.420> having<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.870> get<00:03:00.989> too<00:03:01.200> close<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.860> then

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
without having to get too close and then

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.990 
without having to get too close and then
fix<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.360> dying<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.959> course<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:05.820> also

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
fix this dying of course and it's also

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.300 
fix this dying of course and it's also
particularly<00:03:06.630> useful<00:03:07.049> for<00:03:07.320> knocking<00:03:08.010> enemy

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
particularly useful for knocking enemy

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.970 
particularly useful for knocking enemy
players<00:03:08.580> off<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.850> side<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.450> map<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.989> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
players off the side of the map and the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.449 
players off the side of the map and the
Annihilator<00:03:11.610> area<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.739> loco<00:03:14.070> moco

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
Annihilator area so on the loco moco

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.380 
Annihilator area so on the loco moco
arena<00:03:15.120> map<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.720> particularly<00:03:16.170> useful

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
arena map and it is particularly useful

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.699 
arena map and it is particularly useful
so<00:03:18.390> that's<00:03:18.750> pretty<00:03:19.019> much<00:03:19.110> everything<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.590> have

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
so that's pretty much everything I have

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.060 
so that's pretty much everything I have
