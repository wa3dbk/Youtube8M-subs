are<00:00:05.370> two<00:00:05.549> different<00:00:06.480> ways<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.600> can<00:00:06.980> do<00:00:07.980> this

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
are two different ways you can do this

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.169 
are two different ways you can do this
both<00:00:09.030> require<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.410> sanding<00:00:11.040> block<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.519> some

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
both require a sanding block and some

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.270 
both require a sanding block and some
colored<00:00:12.809> cardstock<00:00:13.139> but<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.190> either

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
colored cardstock but you can either

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.730 
colored cardstock but you can either
leave<00:00:14.519> your<00:00:14.700> paper<00:00:14.910> flat<00:00:15.269> or<00:00:15.660> like<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.560> one

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
leave your paper flat or like this one

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
leave your paper flat or like this one
you<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.520> bent<00:00:17.760> up<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.630> little

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
you can have it bent up in the little

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.380 
you can have it bent up in the little
bumps<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.470> we'll<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> quicker<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.090> first

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
bumps so we'll do the quicker one first

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.019 
bumps so we'll do the quicker one first
which<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> flat<00:00:22.320> surface<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
which is just the flat surface and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.769 
which is just the flat surface and
literally<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.180> take<00:00:24.359> your<00:00:24.539> colored

cardstock<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.529> your<00:00:25.949> sanding<00:00:26.279> block<00:00:26.510> you

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
cardstock and your sanding block you

surface<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> paper<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.510> you<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.719> turn

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
surface of the paper and you just turn

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
surface of the paper and you just turn
the<00:00:34.620> paper<00:00:34.739> around<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:36.059> keep<00:00:36.329> rubbing<00:00:37.940> you'll

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the paper around and keep rubbing you'll

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.200 
the paper around and keep rubbing you'll
notice<00:00:39.210> that's<00:00:40.040> great<00:00:41.040> starts<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> come<00:00:42.059> off

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
notice that's great starts to come off

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.510 
notice that's great starts to come off
the<00:00:42.360> top<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> paper<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.399> recommend<00:00:44.399> doing

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the top of the paper I recommend doing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.000 
the top of the paper I recommend doing
it<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.850> different<00:00:45.000> directions<00:00:45.649> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.680> stand

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it in different directions you can stand

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.819 
it in different directions you can stand
it<00:00:47.129> even<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.730> hard<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
it even as hard as you want and

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.290 
it even as hard as you want and
eventually<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.190> may<00:00:50.399> read<00:00:50.670> down<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> top

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
eventually it may read down the top

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.830 
eventually it may read down the top
layer<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.649> paper<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.539> you<00:00:54.539> will<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.750> able

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
layer of the paper and you will be able

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
layer of the paper and you will be able
to<00:00:55.020> feel<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.379> difference<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.340> more<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
to feel the difference so it's more of a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.110 
to feel the difference so it's more of a
textural<00:00:57.360> thing<00:00:57.390> than<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.079> visual<00:00:58.980> thing<00:00:59.280> with

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
textural thing than a visual thing with

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.020 
textural thing than a visual thing with
when<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.050> flat<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.430> should<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> choose

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
when it's flat now it should you choose

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.590

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that's what you're going to want that's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.280 
that's what you're going to want that's
what's<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.200> soften<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.649> paper<00:02:05.000> so

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
what's going to soften up the paper so

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.469 
what's going to soften up the paper so
shake<00:02:07.290> off<00:02:07.469> any<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> excess<00:02:08.239> lay<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> down

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
shake off any of the excess lay it down

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.609 
shake off any of the excess lay it down
flat<00:02:09.780> all

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
flat all

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.229 
flat all
any<00:02:11.209> colored<00:02:12.209> cardstock<00:02:13.400> glue<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.519> down<00:02:14.549> now

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
any colored cardstock glue it down now

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.630 
any colored cardstock glue it down now
for<00:02:15.269> this<00:02:15.659> one<00:02:15.900> my<00:02:16.440> recommendation<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.310> use

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
for this one my recommendation is to use

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.570 
for this one my recommendation is to use
the<00:02:17.819> tombow<00:02:18.239> multi-way<00:02:19.170> adhesive<00:02:19.709> because<00:02:20.430> it

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
the tombow multi-way adhesive because it

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.640 
the tombow multi-way adhesive because it
takes<00:02:20.760> longer<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.390> dry<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.349> can<00:02:22.500> get<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
takes longer to dry and you can get a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.220 
takes longer to dry and you can get a
smoother<00:02:23.040> surface<00:02:23.069> on<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.879> edges<00:02:24.269> so<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:24.930> lies

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
smoother surface on the edges so it lies

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.399 
smoother surface on the edges so it lies
flat<00:02:25.819> but<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.959> how<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.110> make<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
flat but that is that is how to make the

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.450 
flat but that is that is how to make the
faux<00:02:28.560> suede<00:02:28.620> technique<00:02:29.340> good<00:02:30.030> luck<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.390> enjoy
