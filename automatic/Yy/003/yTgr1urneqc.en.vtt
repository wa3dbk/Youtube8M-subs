00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.210
 the us has it on youth tournament 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.590
 won and surprising achievement 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.420
 lead the amateurs out 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.570
 let the professional club like twente 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.500
 PSV Ajax and Club Brugge behind them 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.730
 started and asked him 9am present 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.710
 then we must be our first match 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.860
 against 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.920
 so suspect against jeroen css 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.690
 yes pc and we won one zero the second 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.030
 lost with two no of groningen 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.870
 well everyone and a bit tired 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.540
 between 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.980
 the last one against Twente is very ahead 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.079
 last minute one one 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.630
 said yes on no long-arc steps 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.370
 backwards and he understood the keeper 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.770
 Someone came to love us here 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.540
 so down penotti and then two and you through 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.670
 to get that seed in the dressing room 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.899
 yes against ajax was of course ajax 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.700
 too favorite in the final 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.530
 but the uvs boys started well and 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.250
 even with a 0 after three minutes 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.600
 in front of 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.610
 get right with those that have ghoul 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.470
 I really nice cross ball speed two 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.740
 players and can put him in the long corner 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.740
 to give 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.320
 names a lot you lose vs the grip on 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.270
 the match and gets ajax chance after chance 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.509
 which in the second half leads to a one 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.509
 a 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.650
 and from that moment you lose 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.290
 you actually get a grip on how to match 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.210
 comes that I think laziness 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.350
 yes and ajax yes you must you need a bit 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.120
 lucky and they have a good chance 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.670
 They also have had much opportunity to 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.600
 score big chance in the case and yes we 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.990
 bitch lucky that they are not 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.030
 cases 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.070
 she is the only one and then comes the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.410
 penalty range that your genes 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.880
 yes you have two stopped two yes 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.950
 the latter you that the people less 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.850
 yes I know you as 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.350
 body postures 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.450
 and I saw that he can go into that how 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.410
 shoot no we are sorry write sub question 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.410
 comes down 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.770
 What did you think instance and like going 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.630
 organize gamo inside 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.360
 no certainly not sure we are not looking at two 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.520
 amateur clubs and 6b videos and then know 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.200
 you that you are going to end with 7 8 yes that 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.600
 happens is not it is an happening 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.090
 made a goal last year 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.560
 last minten became standard and now 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.210
 first 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.770
 there got atmosphere and the first against PSV 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.600
 wins what he does not my favorite together 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.860
 with ajax in it you win then it goes 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.200
 what happened to the boys and the goat 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.730
 believe in and then you come to an ultimate 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.730
 sports performance as it delivers today 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.350
 is being here this is a soccer tournament 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.730
 with big clubs' start vs 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.440
 actually organizes because everyone 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.080
 very satisfied happened last year 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.820
 will be played here again next year 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.530
 I assume almost a preliminary percent of it 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.420
 that again next year at Schiphol three 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.959
 sweets and what can we expect 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.400
 becomes a this line through z 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.050
 we are now a bit out of the box ' 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.470
 we are thinking about my 60 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.390
 watts 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.290
 barcelona but maybe to this one 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.290
 just keep doing it
