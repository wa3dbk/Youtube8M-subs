00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.930
 preixan the symmetric a printer of the point m 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.140
 compared to central symmetry two mean among other things the contest and 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.349
 so in the middle 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.489
 of the same crime segment 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.159
 besides his lack a straight 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:18.349
 Going through 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.220
 he pointed hannezo 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.890
 then three from a counter 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.339
 according to their problems 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.339
 we trace to marco de serre on the other side of the point 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.649
 who gives us as well 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.740
 the point m crim 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.800
 image of m it is estimated that center central why 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.870
 we will now trace the asymmetry of the sell through the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.550
 central window are too big 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.300
 for that we taking two points on poverty we will look for 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000
 the images of these two points 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 that's it for the first 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.100
 a picture 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 for the second point now 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.600
 these two images allow us to build 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
 the symmetrical of the 3d 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.940
 could notice that this straight and parallel 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.440
 at 3d is one of the properties of central asymmetry that the image of a 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.770
 right is a straight line parallel to it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.800
 we spent a little bit like the quadrilateral to die 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.860
 by the central bank of his flock 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 for that we had the four capri images built 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
 dd we start with the lighthouse point 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.060
 so we hold his image that we will call 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.180
 april group 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 we do the same with the point 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.189
 so everyone at the point of crimes 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.510
 so we could go on to build these premiums and prices 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.669
 but we did a little differently 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.449
 we are at the fact that the low point 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.449
 premiums and located at mid-distance 2 euros 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.949
 but gallas others my contract will be a definite asset like these 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.639
 and as at every plant keep length we know that 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.369
 the length at d will also be at length 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:45.889
 at premium 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.559
 bonuses and us - 6 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.179
 bonus point 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.929
 we do the same with the board we have known 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.609
 at these premiums be equal 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.169
 ocÃ© 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.249
 and on the other hand as those who consume in clear the bearish segment 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.419
 will be the same length as the segment 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.349
 bonuses 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.369
 and we get 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.079
 point 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.229
 it is not enough then to connect 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.229
 at crime premium 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.109
 bonuses these bonuses 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.859
 these crimes of bonuses 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.029
 bonuses after the flight 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.379
 we held together the image 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.049
 the quadrilateral we dropped from the foot
