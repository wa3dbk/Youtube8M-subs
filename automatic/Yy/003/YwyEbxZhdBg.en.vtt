00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.490
 The first thing I do when I start doing 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.510
 the oven is 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.300
 I gave myself the diameter of the table and then 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.789
 strip of center point and cotton 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.239
 the linen and the chalk mark say 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.650
 to take the beam of what is the 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.770
 Oven size 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.550
 after that we mark what is the 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.220
 opening what would be the door we measure 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.070
 within the circle more or less that is 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.809
 a margin of 7 centimeters and from 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.829
 there we start with what is all the 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.829
 part of opening 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.839
 this is really so that one can 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.170
 maneuver the opening that is to be able to 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.930
 handle what is the oxygen that is if 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.570
 door is in false squad it 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.539
 would close or it would open alone then one 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.520
 I could not keep the heat when it 's 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.380
 turning on or heating the oven because 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.960
 is this closing the flame goes off in 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.820
 change so one can maneuver it well 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.590
 because the door is in squares 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.369
 then you give him the oxygen that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.369
 needs to 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.200
 and the door is completely voided 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.640
 firm with sponge and water to seal 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.640
 well all that is the board 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.460
 well once we have the part of the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.399
 purple door everything has been uniform already 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.619
 we started to put together what is the circle 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.619
 with brick and refractory clay 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:35.020
 would use the burner for gas 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.150
 of the oven the line is always used 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.460
 This is a condition that we 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.370
 if we add one day tomorrow 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.390
 firewood wants to turn whatever it 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 can use the gas 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.130
 we already made half of the oven 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.530
 with refractory clay now let's 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.870
 continue doing the same thing or be the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.690
 same mechanism of sticking bricks in 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.349
 circle with the mud with the adobe that 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.349
 we prepare 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.739
 what is the dome part of the oven 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.510
 It works differently than the temperature 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.950
 then the mud has another 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.950
 consistency than yours 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.330
 to black earth is enlarged with a little 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.650
 salt takes sand and a little broth and 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.650
 mix everything with water 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.490
 to comment 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.510
 now we are going to locate the clock 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.810
 temperature 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.790
 that will mark the temperature of the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.549
 brick 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.280
 and always more or less placed in the middle 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.900
 of the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.900
 rare 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.900
 plus 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.010
 here 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.160
 here we would already be in the last stage that 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.020
 let's place what is the output of 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.780
 smoke that always goes in the opposite direction 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.280
 what is the flamethrower for the subject 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.500
 of fire travel 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.840
 now we are going to use the system 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.139
 cross to wedge it and lock all the 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.139
 oven 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:03.710
 the exterior is plastered with 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:06.560
 mud and bale so that the brick does not 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.439
 be so unprotected and have more 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.719
 conservation of temperature and apart 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:14.599
 to be outdoors this protects a 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:16.810
 little weather weather water and everything 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.810
 that 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.590
 this is the audio
