00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.689
 two 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.880
 I have bartolo and I have wing and that 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.820
 We are preparing to go out and give 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.710
 walk down the street one lap and it's that 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.450
 both for people and for 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.630
 ferrets go out to the street to do 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.000
 exercise is fundamental worth then 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.790
 what do we need to get them out on the street 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.079
 Well, it's just brought here, it's super easy 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.210
 just some harness and cough that 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.980
 they are fine that they hold on to them I am 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.660
 finishing putting the harness here to 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.100
 talk to the bartolo to see if he leaves me 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.899
 because as they do not stop 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.899
 it's a little complicated 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.780
 and you see in principle the first days 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.180
 it will be difficult for them to walk with him 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.900
 because they feel weird they notice that 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.880
 something squeezes them and they are not comfortable 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.800
 It is also interesting to take them out 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.449
 places as you see here you have surrounded me 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.430
 of tubes, since the tubes 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.200
 they love ferrets to play and 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.840
 you will see that as soon as 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.460
 we put them near them right away they go 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.660
 to start poking and they're going to start 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.960
 well then to play and investigate and 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.470
 looking for things is an exercise that 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.110
 usually like pretty 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.090
 therefore nothing more than to say of 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.250
 this topic carefully with the heat of 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.490
 the hottest days should not come out 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.510
 especially at the hottest hours 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.210
 look there come 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.310
 how they play how they spend it when you see 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.259
 and try to try to bite the rope 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.840
 so you can teach them how to spin 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.430
 also and in principle little more than 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.829
 just tell you what to do 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.539
 mention that recently a 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.939
 study that says that coexistence with 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.070
 animals in children reduces a lot of 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.979
 diseases when these children are made 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.860
 greater worth so my advice is to 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.509
 have pets that you enjoy them 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.670
 that you go out a lot to the street that 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.380
 you pass well because in addition also 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.140
 Sociological studies say that 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.209
 people who have animals are a lot 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.209
 more sociable with other people 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.030
 for me
