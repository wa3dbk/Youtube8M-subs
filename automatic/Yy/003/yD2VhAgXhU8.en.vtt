alright<00:00:02.370> we're<00:00:02.550> ready<00:00:02.669> for<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:03.000> next<00:00:03.179> section

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
alright we're ready for the next section

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.950 
alright we're ready for the next section
of<00:00:03.720> our<00:00:04.279> cable<00:00:05.279> hookup<00:00:05.609> we're<00:00:06.509> actually<00:00:06.690> going

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
of our cable hookup we're actually going

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.200 
of our cable hookup we're actually going
to<00:00:07.049> run<00:00:07.259> our<00:00:07.589> SATA<00:00:08.460> data<00:00:08.849> connections<00:00:09.570> first

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.910 

so<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:15.630> those<00:00:15.839> done<00:00:16.049> before<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.740> do

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so that we have those done before we do

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.099 
so that we have those done before we do
the<00:00:17.220> power<00:00:18.000> connection<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> motherboard

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the power connection to the motherboard

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.410 
the power connection to the motherboard
so<00:00:19.350> I'm<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.279> go<00:00:20.400> ahead<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.670> grab<00:00:20.850> my

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.400 

cable<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.660> can<00:00:24.810> show<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.050> what<00:00:25.199> those<00:00:25.380> look

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
cable so I can show you what those look

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
cable so I can show you what those look
like<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.650> SATA<00:00:28.980> cable<00:00:31.189> as<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.309> can

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
like so this is a SATA cable as you can

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.560 
like so this is a SATA cable as you can
see<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.700> one<00:00:32.940> kind<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> has<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.800> flat<00:00:34.800> side

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
see this one kind of has a flat side

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.780 
see this one kind of has a flat side
there's<00:00:36.570> other<00:00:36.750> ones<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.440> both<00:00:38.010> sides<00:00:38.370> are

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
there's other ones that both sides are

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.639 
there's other ones that both sides are
kind<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> same<00:00:40.670> we're<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:41.969> using

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
kind of the same we're going to be using

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.299 
kind of the same we're going to be using
a<00:00:43.649> mixture<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.760> two<00:00:45.649> now<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.829> first<00:00:47.010> want

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
a mixture of the two now we first want

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.779 
a mixture of the two now we first want
to<00:00:47.370> kind<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.579> show<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.200> connections<00:00:49.789> on

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
to kind of show you the connections on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.000 
to kind of show you the connections on
the<00:00:50.910> cd-rom<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.199> hard<00:00:52.379> drive<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the cd-rom and the hard drive and the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
the cd-rom and the hard drive and the
SSD<00:00:53.610> drive<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.210> where<00:00:54.840> they're<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> go

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
SSD drive and where they're going to go

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.630 
SSD drive and where they're going to go
on<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> motherboard<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:56.460> we'll

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
on the motherboard and then we'll

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.130 
on the motherboard and then we'll
actually<00:00:57.059> walk<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.270> through<00:00:57.629> picking<00:00:57.960> those

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
actually walk you through picking those

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.619 
actually walk you through picking those
up<00:00:58.609> so<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> first<00:00:59.820> thing<00:01:00.030> let's<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> look

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
up so the first thing let's take a look

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.680 
up so the first thing let's take a look
at<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> cd-rom<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.969> data<00:01:03.149> connection

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
at is on the cd-rom the data connection

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
at is on the cd-rom the data connection
for<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> cd-rom<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> go<00:01:05.010> right<00:01:05.159> next

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
for the cd-rom is going to go right next

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.330 
for the cd-rom is going to go right next
to<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> power<00:01:05.850> connection<00:01:07.010> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.159> see

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to the power connection you can see

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.929 
to the power connection you can see
there<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:11.220> go<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.610> here

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
there you go right here

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
there you go right here
in<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> slot<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> little

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
in the slot you see it's a little

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.570 
in the slot you see it's a little
smaller<00:01:14.460> l-shaped<00:01:15.180> connection<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:20.369> that's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
smaller l-shaped connection and that's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.880 
smaller l-shaped connection and that's
going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> connect<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.670> these<00:01:23.909> cena

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
going to connect to one of these cena

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.850 
going to connect to one of these cena
six<00:01:25.890> view<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> second<00:01:29.450> port<00:01:30.680> which<00:01:31.680> you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
six view but the second port which you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.330 
six view but the second port which you
can<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:33.659> four<00:01:33.960> great<00:01:34.530> ports<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
can see here the four great ports of the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.390 
can see here the four great ports of the
six<00:01:35.610> gigabit<00:01:36.180> per<00:01:36.720> second<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.200> before<00:01:37.680> black

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
six gigabit per second one before black

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.920 
six gigabit per second one before black
boards<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:41.369> three<00:01:41.820> gigabit<00:01:42.329> per<00:01:42.540> second

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
boards are the three gigabit per second

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.990 
boards are the three gigabit per second
towards<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.369> all<00:01:44.520> three<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> these

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
towards so for all three of these

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.609 
towards so for all three of these
devices<00:01:45.360> we're<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:46.049> running<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
devices we're going to be running the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.889 
devices we're going to be running the
SATA<00:01:46.920> 6<00:01:47.369> gigabits<00:01:47.549> per<00:01:48.030> second<00:01:48.450> which<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
SATA 6 gigabits per second which is the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.749 
SATA 6 gigabits per second which is the
gray<00:01:50.329> connectors<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> right-hand<00:01:54.360> area

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
gray connectors to the right-hand area

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.730 
gray connectors to the right-hand area
so<00:01:56.759> we're<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.180> using<00:01:57.390> those<00:01:57.740> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
so we're going to be using those and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.370 
so we're going to be using those and
then<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.850> look<00:01:59.880> down<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.930> hard

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
then if we look down here on the hard

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.780 
then if we look down here on the hard
drive<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:02.189> well<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> SSD<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
drive as well as the SSD you can see the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:17.550 
drive as well as the SSD you can see the
data<00:02:06.149> connection

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.660 

right<00:02:18.560> here<00:02:18.799> next<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.819> power<00:02:20.060> connection

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
right here next to the power connection

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.820 
right here next to the power connection
see<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.760> there<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.900> we<00:02:23.989> have<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> same<00:02:24.500> down

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
see it there and we have the same down

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:38.020 
see it there and we have the same down
on<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.370> SSD<00:02:26.330> drive<00:02:36.700> you're<00:02:37.700> bringing<00:02:37.940> a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
on the SSD drive you're bringing a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.930 
on the SSD drive you're bringing a
better<00:02:38.360> shot<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.870> here<00:02:39.640> it's<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.700> little

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
better shot of that here it's a little

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.490 
better shot of that here it's a little
tricky<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.299> see<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.640> can<00:02:43.790> see<00:02:44.030> there<00:02:44.239> by<00:02:45.170> next

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
tricky to see you can see there by next

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.110 
tricky to see you can see there by next
to<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.680> SATA<00:02:45.950> power<00:02:46.160> connection<00:02:46.760> we<00:02:46.879> got<00:02:46.910> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
to the SATA power connection we got the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.660 
to the SATA power connection we got the
state<00:02:47.299> of<00:02:47.450> data<00:02:47.660> connection<00:02:48.400> right<00:02:49.400> there

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
state of data connection right there

in till it clicks and we're good to go

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.200 
in till it clicks and we're good to go
kind<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.400> get<00:04:44.550> this<00:04:44.640> out<00:04:44.820> of<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:44.940> way<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> little

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
kind of get this out of the way a little

00:04:45.210 --> 00:05:05.589 
kind of get this out of the way a little
bit<00:04:50.960> let's<00:04:51.960> see<00:04:52.140> it<00:04:52.260> plugged<00:04:52.560> in<00:04:52.650> down<00:04:52.890> there

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.600 

and<00:05:06.599> now<00:05:06.719> we're<00:05:06.870> gonna<00:05:07.020> plug<00:05:07.319> in<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.740> two

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
and now we're gonna plug in the two

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.080 
and now we're gonna plug in the two
connections<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.689> SSD<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:10.979> the<00:05:11.520> hard
