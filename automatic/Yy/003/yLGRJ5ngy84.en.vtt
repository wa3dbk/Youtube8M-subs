 completely new let's talk about what 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.580
 which is the kind of phone cameras has 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.490
 a 2 megapixel camera can take 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.060
 photos of 1600 x 1200 pixels and record in 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.590
 video I saw 25 fps is basically the TV 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.410
 with the phone does not have front camera 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.269
 only has rear camera does not have flash 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.119
 it only has here what is a 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.480
 we are going to enter the camera and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.750
 look for your options to see what they are 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 your configurations then we search 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.920
 here the camera 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.829
 in this case the camera comes here in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.600
 orange we enter her 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.989
 it will usually end 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.120
 the sheet just like the magin in how 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.100
 enter here by setting to see 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.530
 what are the different 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.870
 options he has says he has new 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.960

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.229
 Unique smile detector has option 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.090
 to create panoramic scenes with a 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.540
 archetype of scenes manages panorama 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.610
 turn party sunset sunrise light 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.740
 of candles has several scene options 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.049
 it is interesting to learn to manage all 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.470
 these options to take photos of 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.520
 very good quality exposure value 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.230
 timer is the case that let's leave 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.720
 the camera in one place and then 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.750
 activate the timer and be part of 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.400
 the camera as we can see the camera 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.620
 also allows you to zoom through 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.380
 what are the buttons and here below the 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.680
 volume you have to zoom in heim of 2 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.720
 x 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.160
 let's go back to the center of the option to 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.560
 see what other defect other 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.470
 configurations that has effects 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.990
 we can add some filters in the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.390
 black and white and sepia filters we can 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.490
 configure the resolution option as 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.830
 I had said it has its maximum 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.659
 resolution is 2 megapixels 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.280
 it can also go down to 1.5 1.3 0.3 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.439
 where what to think about doing a good 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.509
 resolution to take pictures and to upload 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.180
 through social networks has 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.060
 adjustment of quality measurement balances 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.030
 the image and we can activate the gps is 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.069
 say the gps labeling is to say that 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.930
 record inside the data of the photos 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.299
 the gps location 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.299
 other configurations that you have here is 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.689
 This box is parallel effect to the photos 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.659
 as we had seen this has here 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:36.540
 we can configure firing we enter 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.879
 to which the camera going down here 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.790
 and we are already within the option of 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.769
 Video recording 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.409
 We can click here to see which ones 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:50.730
 are the resolutions that video handles 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:53.450
 here this resolution 320 x 240 176 x 144 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.610
 let's look to see if this allows 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.120
 pause let's start here a 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.120
 recording 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.629
 it does not allow to pause the 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.349
 video recording as if allowed by the 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.930
 galaxy 73 is practically start and the 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.180
 have the video that was all basically 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.580
 with what is the kind of camera that 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.200
