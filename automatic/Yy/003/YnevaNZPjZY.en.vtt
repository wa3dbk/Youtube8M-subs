00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
give it about a finger space and you can

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.679 
give it about a finger space and you can
place<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:58.979> chips<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.790> onto<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> tape<00:02:00.450> and

again try to get one part of the foam
onto<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> tape<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> chips<00:02:05.430> aren't<00:02:05.700> moving

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
onto the tape so the chips aren't moving

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
onto the tape so the chips aren't moving
around

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.660 
around all the sides
now<00:04:20.170> remember<00:04:20.590> string<00:04:20.860> cheese<00:04:21.130> still<00:04:21.430> has<00:04:21.640> a

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
now remember string cheese still has a

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.720 
now remember string cheese still has a
little<00:04:21.970> bit<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.890> packaging<00:04:23.890> around<00:04:24.250> it<00:04:24.460> so

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
little bit of packaging around it so

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.310 
little bit of packaging around it so
don't<00:04:24.910> cut<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.210> too<00:04:25.240> close<00:04:25.420> because<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.110> want

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
don't cut it too close because you want

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.090 
don't cut it too close because you want
it<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.560> look<00:04:26.710> like<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.340> real<00:04:27.550> thing<00:04:28.920> just<00:04:29.920> like

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
it to look like the real thing just like

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.500 
it to look like the real thing just like
that<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.840> your<00:04:31.990> dog<00:04:32.170> can<00:04:32.200> still<00:04:32.590> peel<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.040> open

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
that so your dog can still peel it open

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.730 
that so your dog can still peel it open

a<00:04:38.890> dark<00:04:39.160> brown<00:04:39.720> once<00:04:40.720> it's<00:04:40.900> dry<00:04:41.230> you're<00:04:41.470> going

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
a dark brown once it's dry you're going

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.930 
a dark brown once it's dry you're going
to<00:04:41.620> put<00:04:41.890> some<00:04:42.130> light<00:04:42.340> paint<00:04:42.640> on<00:04:42.820> your

brownie and that's the powdered sugar

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:57.170 
brownie and that's the powdered sugar
that's<00:04:47.260> on<00:04:47.470> top

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.490 

for<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.270> lunch<00:04:58.480> tray<00:04:58.900> you're<00:04:59.110> going<00:04:59.260> to<00:04:59.320> make

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
for the lunch tray you're going to make

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.650 
for the lunch tray you're going to make
the<00:04:59.680> base<00:04:59.830> by<00:05:00.340> cutting<00:05:00.820> out<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:00.970> rectangle

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
the base by cutting out a rectangle

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.570 
the base by cutting out a rectangle
trace<00:05:02.380> it<00:05:02.560> on<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.920> your<00:05:03.040> paper<00:05:03.340> board<00:05:05.370> make<00:05:06.370> I

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
trace it on to your paper board make I

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.220 
trace it on to your paper board make I
made<00:05:06.910> four<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.360> them<00:05:07.540> you<00:05:07.780> can<00:05:07.930> make<00:05:07.960> it

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
made four of them you can make it

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.200 
made four of them you can make it
thicker<00:05:08.410> if<00:05:08.650> you<00:05:08.770> like<00:05:09.010> but<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.580> think<00:05:09.610> four<00:05:10.090> is

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
thicker if you like but I think four is

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.510 
thicker if you like but I think four is
just<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.600> right<00:05:10.720> thickness<00:05:11.070> make<00:05:12.070> sure<00:05:12.340> you

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
just the right thickness make sure you

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.270 
just the right thickness make sure you
don't<00:05:12.670> have<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.870> design<00:05:14.260> showing<00:05:14.800> on<00:05:14.950> it<00:05:15.100> so

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
don't have the design showing on it so

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.340 
don't have the design showing on it so
flip<00:05:15.700> one<00:05:15.970> inside<00:05:16.360> out<00:05:16.510> if<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:16.750> need<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:17.110> and

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
flip one inside out if you need to and

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.430 
flip one inside out if you need to and
then<00:05:17.410> just<00:05:18.250> glue<00:05:18.850> stick<00:05:19.180> them<00:05:19.420> together<00:05:22.440> now

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
then just glue stick them together now

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.140 
then just glue stick them together now
you're<00:05:23.590> going<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.770> take<00:05:23.920> another<00:05:24.370> rectangle

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
you're going to take another rectangle

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.910 
you're going to take another rectangle
the<00:05:25.240> same<00:05:25.480> size<00:05:25.780> as<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.170> bottom<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.650> tray

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
the same size as the bottom of the tray

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.920 
the same size as the bottom of the tray
and<00:05:27.160> then<00:05:27.640> you're<00:05:27.790> going<00:05:27.880> to<00:05:27.940> trace<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.390> smaller

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
and then you're going to trace a smaller

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.400 
and then you're going to trace a smaller
rectangle<00:05:29.260> in<00:05:29.920> the<00:05:30.190> inside<00:05:30.670> I<00:05:31.080> chose<00:05:32.080> an

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
rectangle in the inside I chose an

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.320 
rectangle in the inside I chose an
object<00:05:32.890> that<00:05:33.010> had<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.250> little<00:05:33.490> shape<00:05:33.790> to<00:05:34.060> it<00:05:34.210> the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
object that had a little shape to it the

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.060 
object that had a little shape to it the
curves<00:05:34.690> but<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.140> can<00:05:35.410> just<00:05:35.620> do<00:05:35.770> a<00:05:35.800> plain

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
curves but you can just do a plain

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.520 
curves but you can just do a plain
rectangle<00:05:36.600> this<00:05:37.600> is<00:05:37.660> going<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.020> build<00:05:38.230> up<00:05:38.470> your

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
rectangle this is going to build up your

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.940 
rectangle this is going to build up your
tray<00:05:39.330> so<00:05:40.330> once<00:05:40.510> you've<00:05:40.660> traced<00:05:40.930> it<00:05:41.140> on<00:05:41.290> use

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
tray so once you've traced it on use

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.150 
tray so once you've traced it on use
your<00:05:41.980> exacto<00:05:42.730> knife<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:43.830> you're<00:05:44.830> just<00:05:45.010> going

your exacto knife and you're just going

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.540 
your exacto knife and you're just going
to<00:05:45.190> cut<00:05:45.460> it<00:05:45.580> out<00:05:46.800> now<00:05:47.800> you're<00:05:48.010> also<00:05:48.160> going<00:05:48.340> to

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
to cut it out now you're also going to

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.640 
to cut it out now you're also going to
need<00:05:48.730> four<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.090> these<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.840> you're<00:05:50.380> just<00:05:50.530> going

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.500 
need four of these and you're just going
to<00:05:50.710> glue<00:05:51.070> them<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.610> bottom<00:05:51.850> of<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.240> tray

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
to glue them to the bottom of the tray

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.310 
to glue them to the bottom of the tray
to<00:05:53.080> build<00:05:53.470> up<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.950> sides<00:05:54.250> if<00:05:54.670> you<00:05:55.660> want<00:05:56.140> a

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
to build up the sides if you want a

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.410 
to build up the sides if you want a
thicker<00:05:56.590> side<00:05:57.190> you'll<00:05:57.700> have<00:05:57.760> to<00:05:58.060> add<00:05:58.180> more

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
thicker side you'll have to add more

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.150 
thicker side you'll have to add more
than<00:05:58.600> four<00:05:59.520> now<00:06:00.520> for<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:00.820> inside<00:06:01.360> tray

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160

I didn't leave room for any utensils on
my<00:06:12.700> tray<00:06:13.000> but<00:06:13.240> of<00:06:13.330> course<00:06:13.630> that's<00:06:13.840> up<00:06:14.020> to<00:06:14.170> you

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
my tray but of course that's up to you

you can design your tray any way you'd
like<00:06:16.470> but<00:06:17.470> this<00:06:17.590> gives<00:06:17.830> you<00:06:17.920> an<00:06:18.070> idea<00:06:18.160> of<00:06:18.520> how
