gonna eat through your paint then the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.899 
gonna eat through your paint then the
second<00:01:13.759> thing<00:01:15.190> there<00:01:16.190> is<00:01:16.310> something<00:01:16.640> wrong

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
second thing there is something wrong

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.359 
second thing there is something wrong
with<00:01:17.060> your<00:01:17.149> bikes<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:17.690> probably<00:01:18.319> want<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.860> fix

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
with your bikes you probably want to fix

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.719 
with your bikes you probably want to fix
it<00:01:19.610> before<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.940> are<00:01:20.470> fun<00:01:21.470> next<00:01:22.190> time<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.550> ride

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
it before you are fun next time you ride

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.740 
it before you are fun next time you ride
it<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:24.850> that's<00:01:27.819> then<00:01:28.819> after<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:29.390> you

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
it and that's then after that you

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.980 
it and that's then after that you
probably<00:01:30.170> i<00:01:31.130> would<00:01:31.520> recommend<00:01:32.300> if<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.659> like

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
probably i would recommend if you like

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.719 
probably i would recommend if you like
you<00:01:33.289> even<00:01:33.710> if<00:01:33.770> you've<00:01:34.100> been<00:01:34.190> around<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.580> bike

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
you even if you've been around a bike

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.539 
you even if you've been around a bike
once<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.630> week<00:01:35.810> during<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.289> winter<00:01:36.590> or<00:01:36.860> yeah

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
once a week during the winter or yeah

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.240 
once a week during the winter or yeah
then<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:39.020> probably<00:01:39.049> don't<00:01:39.860> need<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:42.250> change

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
then you probably don't need to change

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.730 
then you probably don't need to change
the<00:01:43.520> oil<00:01:43.549> before<00:01:44.179> you<00:01:44.420> store<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.899> or<00:01:45.140> otherwise

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
the oil before you store it or otherwise

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.499 
the oil before you store it or otherwise
i<00:01:46.549> would<00:01:47.240> recommend<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:49.299> change<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.509> oil

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
i would recommend you to change the oil

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
i would recommend you to change the oil
because<00:01:53.509> i<00:01:53.539> heard<00:01:54.110> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
because i heard that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.170 
because i heard that
the<00:01:56.460> crap<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:57.000> oil<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.570> gonna<00:01:58.159> settle<00:01:59.159> down<00:01:59.430> so

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the crap in oil is gonna settle down so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
the crap in oil is gonna settle down so
that's<00:02:00.479> probably<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.289> pretty<00:02:01.320> bad

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
that's probably going to be pretty bad

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.480 
that's probably going to be pretty bad
yeah<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.480 

for<00:02:09.120> those<00:02:09.240> of<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.540> guys<00:02:09.720> who<00:02:09.780> have

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
for those of you guys who have

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.450 
for those of you guys who have
who<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> garages<00:02:12.890> it's<00:02:13.890> pretty<00:02:14.190> simple

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
who have a garages it's pretty simple

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.710 
who have a garages it's pretty simple
just<00:02:14.690> park<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.930> inside<00:02:16.650> your<00:02:17.040> garage<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:18.510> it

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
just park it inside your garage of it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.180 
just park it inside your garage of it
with<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> maybe<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.430> bath<00:02:21.150> sheet<00:02:21.540> that's<00:02:22.410> that

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
with a maybe a bath sheet that's that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.570 
with a maybe a bath sheet that's that
would<00:02:23.310> work<00:02:23.520> too<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.410> if<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.680> don't<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.550> a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
would work too and if you don't have a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.730 
would work too and if you don't have a
garage<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.720> you're<00:02:27.900> going<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.140> probably<00:02:28.320> park

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
garage so you're going to probably park

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.900 
garage so you're going to probably park
your<00:02:28.950> bike<00:02:29.210> outside<00:02:30.210> I<00:02:30.990> would<00:02:31.980> recommend<00:02:32.370> you

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
your bike outside I would recommend you

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.720 
your bike outside I would recommend you
to<00:02:33.090> get<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:34.250> nice<00:02:35.720> motorcycle<00:02:36.720> cover<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:40.170> know

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
to get a nice motorcycle cover you know

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.940 
to get a nice motorcycle cover you know
something<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.360> cover<00:02:42.570> up<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:43.490> motorcycle

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
something to cover up your motorcycle

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.120 
something to cover up your motorcycle
you<00:02:47.390> won't<00:02:48.390> what<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.170> want<00:02:49.380> don't<00:02:49.650> cover<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
you won't what you want don't cover to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.190 
you won't what you want don't cover to
the<00:02:50.160> waterproof<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.240> don't<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.720> also

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
the waterproof but you don't you also

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.030 
the waterproof but you don't you also
want<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.590> cover<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.300> breathe<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.440> moisture

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
want to cover to breathe so the moisture

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.500 
want to cover to breathe so the moisture
doesn't<00:02:56.910> get<00:02:57.180> caught<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.990> under<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.710> cover

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
doesn't get caught in under the cover

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.180 
doesn't get caught in under the cover
which<00:03:00.590> would<00:03:01.590> probably<00:03:01.860> cause<00:03:03.020> rust

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
which would probably cause rust

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.420 
which would probably cause rust
something<00:03:05.190> yeah

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
something yeah

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.530 
something yeah
so<00:03:07.000> get<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:07.269> nice<00:03:07.810> cover<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.950> if<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:10.000> live<00:03:10.269> in<00:03:10.299> a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
so get a nice cover and if you live in a

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
so get a nice cover and if you live in a
windy<00:03:10.959> area<00:03:11.469> get<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> good<00:03:12.700> one<00:03:12.909> that<00:03:13.150> has<00:03:13.560> there

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
windy area get a good one that has there

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.200 
windy area get a good one that has there
you<00:03:14.650> can<00:03:14.829> strap<00:03:15.430> them

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:26.250 

so<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.140> doesn't<00:03:20.680> get<00:03:20.800> blown<00:03:21.130> away<00:03:21.490> like<00:03:23.580> ya<00:03:25.260> see

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
so it doesn't get blown away like ya see

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.590 
so it doesn't get blown away like ya see
that<00:03:26.410> drivers

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.740 

I'm<00:03:34.600> going<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.960> turn<00:03:35.110> left<00:03:36.750> scary<00:03:39.600> come<00:03:40.600> on

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
I'm going to turn left scary come on

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:52.150 
I'm going to turn left scary come on
come<00:03:41.020> on<00:03:44.760> here<00:03:45.760> we<00:03:45.910> go

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.440 

yeah<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.060> those<00:03:53.540> are<00:03:54.050> pretty<00:03:54.290> simple<00:03:54.650> and

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
yeah so those are pretty simple and

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.270 
yeah so those are pretty simple and
probably<00:03:56.450> can<00:03:56.810> do<00:03:56.960> all<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.620> them<00:03:57.890> by<00:03:58.160> yourself

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
probably can do all of them by yourself

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.820 
probably can do all of them by yourself
and<00:04:00.280> many<00:04:01.280> people<00:04:01.430> might<00:04:02.360> ask<00:04:02.660> what<00:04:03.260> about<00:04:03.410> the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
and many people might ask what about the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.000 
and many people might ask what about the
battery<00:04:04.220> I<00:04:04.400> mean<00:04:04.580> I<00:04:04.820> had<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.360> ninja<00:04:05.900> 250<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.800> i

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
battery I mean I had a ninja 250 and i

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.630 
battery I mean I had a ninja 250 and i
just<00:04:07.340> i<00:04:07.460> left<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.000> battery<00:04:08.300> on<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:09.410> bike<00:04:09.640> for

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
just i left the battery on the bike for

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.420 
just i left the battery on the bike for
the<00:04:10.700> whole<00:04:11.420> winter<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.620> next<00:04:12.980> spring<00:04:13.280> and

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
the whole winter and the next spring and

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.630 
the whole winter and the next spring and
started<00:04:13.970> just<00:04:14.270> fine<00:04:14.570> but<00:04:15.230> if<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.740> are<00:04:15.770> concern

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
started just fine but if you are concern

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.039 
started just fine but if you are concern
of<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.600> battery<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:19.850> can<00:04:19.880> get<00:04:20.180> pretty<00:04:20.840> much

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
of the battery you can get pretty much

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.900 
of the battery you can get pretty much
everything<00:04:21.650> on<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.799> market<00:04:22.220> like<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.760> can

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
everything on the market like you can

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.160 
everything on the market like you can
get<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.090> very<00:04:23.720> tender<00:04:24.730> basically<00:04:25.730> they<00:04:26.210> say<00:04:27.140> a

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
get a very tender basically they say a

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.650 
get a very tender basically they say a
very<00:04:27.940> charger<00:04:28.940> but<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:31.760> keeps<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.720> very

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
very charger but it it keeps the very

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.270 
very charger but it it keeps the very
fully<00:04:35.660> charged<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.820> if<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:38.000> have<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.210> garage

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
fully charged and if you have a garage

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.610 
fully charged and if you have a garage
you<00:04:40.280> can<00:04:40.310> probably<00:04:40.820> they<00:04:41.390> think<00:04:41.600> most<00:04:42.350> of<00:04:42.530> them

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
you can probably they think most of them

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.920 
you can probably they think most of them
come<00:04:44.220> with<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:45.290> cable<00:04:47.240> wiring<00:04:48.240> that<00:04:48.630> it<00:04:48.750> came

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
come with a cable wiring that it came

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.060 
come with a cable wiring that it came
wired<00:04:49.229> directly<00:04:49.520> onto<00:04:50.520> your<00:04:51.000> battery<00:04:52.040> so<00:04:53.040> you

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
wired directly onto your battery so you

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.340 
wired directly onto your battery so you
don't<00:04:53.340> have<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.580> remove<00:04:53.940> there<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.449> yeah<00:04:55.110> those

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
don't have to remove there so yeah those

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.230 
don't have to remove there so yeah those
are<00:04:55.500> pretty<00:04:55.530> nice<00:04:55.889> and<00:04:56.370> they<00:04:56.580> work<00:04:57.060> pretty

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
are pretty nice and they work pretty

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.830

pretty much everything can use it for

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.980 
pretty much everything can use it for
cleaning<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.140> injectors<00:06:04.680> and<00:06:04.710> stop

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.780 
make sure tank is very full and I just
keep<00:06:20.370> it<00:06:20.520> like<00:06:20.550> that<00:06:20.700> so<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:22.070> air<00:06:23.070> and<00:06:23.430> tank

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
keep it like that so the air and tank

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.370 
keep it like that so the air and tank
won't<00:06:25.700> oxidizes<00:06:26.700> your<00:06:26.910> gas<00:06:27.360> in<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.200> winner

and also if your have cooperated

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.210 
and also if your have cooperated
motorcycle<00:06:32.880> make<00:06:33.510> sure<00:06:33.540> you<00:06:34.380> know<00:06:34.560> you<00:06:34.620> out

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
motorcycle make sure you know you out

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.390 
motorcycle make sure you know you out
drain<00:06:35.790> the<00:06:35.820> carbs<00:06:36.680> before<00:06:37.970> you<00:06:38.970> believe<00:06:39.270> it

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
drain the carbs before you believe it

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.200 
drain the carbs before you believe it
in<00:06:40.880> the<00:06:41.030> garage

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.600 

yeah<00:06:44.630> because<00:06:45.699> i<00:06:46.699> think<00:06:46.850> the<00:06:47.210> gas<00:06:48.460> gassing<00:06:49.460> the

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
yeah because i think the gas gassing the

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.900 
yeah because i think the gas gassing the
carburetor<00:06:50.259> it's<00:06:51.259> going<00:06:51.530> to

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.590 

energy<00:06:55.190> components<00:06:56.190> into<00:06:56.490> the<00:06:56.550> carb<00:06:56.910> so<00:06:57.240> it

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
energy components into the carb so it

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.620 
energy components into the carb so it
might<00:06:57.840> be<00:06:57.870> a<00:06:58.050> problem<00:06:58.800> if<00:06:59.130> you<00:06:59.430> leave<00:06:59.760> it<00:06:59.910> too

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
might be a problem if you leave it too

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.010 
might be a problem if you leave it too
long<00:07:00.960> I<00:07:02.030> mean<00:07:03.030> draining<00:07:03.390> a<00:07:03.510> car<00:07:03.810> if<00:07:03.930> it's
