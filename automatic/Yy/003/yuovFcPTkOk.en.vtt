a high-tech tinium here the same that
was<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.070> there<00:01:20.189> before<00:01:20.540> Chris<00:01:21.540> tearing<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.140> up

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
was in there before Chris tearing it up

before<00:01:34.430> anyone<00:01:34.610> comments<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:35.270> know<00:01:35.390> these<00:01:35.720> are

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
before anyone comments I know these are

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.870 
before anyone comments I know these are
up<00:01:36.020> high<00:01:36.200> these<00:01:36.620> bachelor<00:01:37.040> mounts<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:37.820> I've

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
up high these bachelor mounts but I've

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.460 
up high these bachelor mounts but I've
tested<00:01:38.300> it<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.510> center<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.900> gravity<00:01:39.260> is<00:01:39.320> still

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
tested it the center of gravity is still

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.000 
tested it the center of gravity is still
okay

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
okay

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.130 
okay
I<00:01:40.390> thought<00:01:41.390> about<00:01:41.600> mounting<00:01:41.960> them<00:01:42.050> in

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
I thought about mounting them in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.510 
I thought about mounting them in
different<00:01:42.260> place<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:42.740> they<00:01:42.860> fit<00:01:43.070> really<00:01:43.310> nice

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
different place but they fit really nice

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.640 
different place but they fit really nice
under<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.940> hood<00:01:44.090> here<00:01:44.300> good<00:01:45.080> space<00:01:45.350> under

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
under the hood here good space under

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.780 
under the hood here good space under
here<00:01:45.680> for<00:01:45.980> mounting<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.370> rest<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.700> the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
here for mounting the rest of the

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.230 
here for mounting the rest of the
electronics<00:01:47.300> I<00:01:47.540> can<00:01:48.530> get<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.830> one<00:01:49.100> track<00:01:49.460> up

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
electronics I can get the one track up

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.410 
electronics I can get the one track up
and<00:01:50.930> it<00:01:51.590> still<00:01:51.860> wants<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.190> come<00:01:52.340> back<00:01:52.490> like

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
and it still wants to come back like

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.790 
and it still wants to come back like
it'll<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:53.900> won't<00:01:54.110> tip<00:01:54.380> back<00:01:54.980> a<00:01:55.010> nap<00:01:55.220> and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
it'll it won't tip back a nap and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.040 
it'll it won't tip back a nap and
articulated<00:01:57.800> up<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.070> six<00:01:58.310> inches<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:59.750> I'm

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
articulated up to six inches so I'm

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.660 
articulated up to six inches so I'm
thinking<00:02:00.410> it's<00:02:00.560> good<00:02:00.770> center<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.340> gravity<00:02:01.610> is

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
thinking it's good center of gravity is

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.140 
thinking it's good center of gravity is
still<00:02:01.790> good

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
still good

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.270 
still good
