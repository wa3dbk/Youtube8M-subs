00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
your device now as it's installing I

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
would like to kind of throw a little

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.040 
would like to kind of throw a little
sidenote<00:02:38.170> out<00:02:38.560> there<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:40.050> installed

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
sidenote out there I have this installed

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.350 
sidenote out there I have this installed
on<00:02:41.230> my<00:02:41.350> other<00:02:41.530> device<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.090> little

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
on my other device and it is a little

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.500 
on my other device and it is a little
bit<00:02:43.570> laggy<00:02:43.900> at<00:02:44.170> times<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:46.090> could<00:02:46.330> be<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
bit laggy at times and that could be the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.030 
bit laggy at times and that could be the
reason<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.080> they<00:02:47.320> didn't<00:02:47.650> make<00:02:47.830> it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
reason that they didn't make it

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.150 
reason that they didn't make it
available<00:02:48.370> on<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.480> Nexus<00:02:49.870> 7<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.440> as<00:02:50.980> you'll

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
available on the Nexus 7 but as you'll

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.250 
available on the Nexus 7 but as you'll
see<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.610> workaround<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.510> works<00:02:53.020> quite

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
see this workaround it works quite

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.830 
see this workaround it works quite
nicely<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.460> lag<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.820> only<00:02:55.000> periodic<00:02:55.690> it's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
nicely and the lag is only periodic it's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.540 
nicely and the lag is only periodic it's
not<00:02:55.990> all<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.230> time<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:57.010> still<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.280> really

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
not all the time you still have really

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.090 
not all the time you still have really
good<00:02:57.790> functionality<00:02:58.570> on<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.720> game<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.290> it's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
good functionality on the game and it's

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.120 
good functionality on the game and it's
a<00:03:00.190> lot<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.460> fun<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:02.350> it<00:03:02.440> should<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:02.800> done

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
a lot of fun so it should be done

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:14.580 
a lot of fun so it should be done
installing<00:03:03.580> here<00:03:04.090> any<00:03:04.300> second<00:03:04.780> now<00:03:12.600> also<00:03:13.600> one

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
installing here any second now also one

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.740 
installing here any second now also one
thing<00:03:14.830> that<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.040> noticed<00:03:15.550> when<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.150> open<00:03:16.630> the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
thing that I noticed when you open the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.260 
thing that I noticed when you open the
game<00:03:17.140> for<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.500> first<00:03:17.710> time<00:03:17.890> at<00:03:18.550> least<00:03:18.610> on<00:03:19.150> my

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
game for the first time at least on my

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.960 
game for the first time at least on my
other<00:03:19.480> device<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.200> did<00:03:20.380> give<00:03:20.590> me<00:03:20.740> an<00:03:20.830> error<00:03:21.160> so

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
other device it did give me an error so

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.090 
other device it did give me an error so
all<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.090> did<00:03:22.450> is<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:22.810> exit<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.380> out<00:03:23.530> there<00:03:23.860> and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
all I did is I exit it out there and

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.160 
all I did is I exit it out there and
reopen<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.640> app<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.630> worked<00:03:25.840> again

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
reopen the app and it worked again

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.820 
reopen the app and it worked again
nicely<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:27.190> we<00:03:27.220> will<00:03:27.700> see<00:03:27.970> at<00:03:28.270> this<00:03:28.480> time<00:03:28.780> if<00:03:29.080> we
