00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hi i am abbot what I say and I'm 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.929
 potter head which has only been 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.650
 today has nothing has conditions and opinion 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.650
 glory tug 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.740
 ae 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.010
 the comments of the last video you me 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.470
 asked to talk about the sagas and 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.059
 They asked what is my favorite to 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.070
 my favorite saga 'elton but I always 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.629
 I'm changing the saga that I'm more 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.970
 accompanying the moment I am 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.199
 more expecting that they are more associated 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.330
 lately most traded in series 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.460
 can not but the last to know what 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.020
 made me completely crazy 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.850
 Last two series that left me 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.470
 completely crazy and still leaving me 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.750
 what is she waiting for movies are 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.309
 divergent in games at the time 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.170
 I'm very anxious waiting for your 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.790
 and it's really cool if you do not 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.409
 divergent views if you did not 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.629
 People read books that are worth it. 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.370
 It's really cool, even I went to watch. 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.290
 divergent because of a trailer that 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.450
 I watched on television and I said my 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.520
 this movie should be much better accurate 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.610
 watch but until then did not know it was 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.560
 threatened after I watched the movie that 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.659
 I discovered that divergent is a 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.370
 saga and I borrowed the first league and I 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.440
 I was completely in love, I read 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.360
 very fast and I was very anxious 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.120
 for others and I bought very fast 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.430
 It's also very good to read the book. 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.330
 incredibly good despite the verÃ´nica being 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.860
 a killer 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.290
 but I do not go from history is also the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.080
 movie troubled with the second with final 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.270
 in the second book , and as a third because 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.380
 I did not wait what happened but I 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.590
 I do not go from history either 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.210
 read the situation is very cool and stay 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.600
 How I waiting for the next bid? 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.060
 obviously I always look for a van 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.650
 that are super cool and that do not 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.590
 Be expensive because I think it's absurd. 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.370
 pay 30 40 50 reais in a van 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.340
 cell phone 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.290
 So I will not pay all these years. 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.880
 all these reals 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.620
 Okay, I did not pay all this in a van 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.450
 and she still does not know exactly how she is 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.159
 in fact I never came to see or imagine 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.590
 the hoods on series are rooms 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.940
 I've never seen, I see so many people in the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.099
 internet you find you thing 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.050
 legal and yet it is not always as 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.269
 cheap and not always the way you 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.200
 wants and I'll show you how I do. 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.879
 made 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.409
 the way I wanted her to do it 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.390
 It's like I could not choose 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.370
 about what I was going to do I chose to do 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.590
 my neighbor's dog is very annoying 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.150
 We force pandora could have shut the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.950
 But it's not when I can not. 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.910
 have to stay here you're actually have to 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.520
 talk and you have 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.600
 The dog is restless but it is not 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.340
 happening so ignore the natives 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.230
 side colleague 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.780
 I mean, I could not decide which one was 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.060
 saga that I was going to show you 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.410
 so I did four hood on four 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.290
 different rooms 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.660
 I really hope you like it and these 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.590
 are my four favorite rooms in the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.410
 time 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.810
 It may be that in a little while, 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.560
 time for four more favorite rooms 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.720
 I really hope you like it and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:19.160
 still being a drug in the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.940
 moment is not to make the cover of 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.910
 cell phone 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.300
 You're going to need a cap. 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.770
 transparent of these more plastic 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.870
 What do you need on the internet for the image? 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.010
 the simpler you find the theme 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.900
 that you chose 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.480
 if you have too hard to find 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.150
 simple pictures you put the theme 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.709
 writes minimalist side because from there 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.750
 will appear in images much more 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.160
 simplified 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.320
 it is only you to print the image that you 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.910
 find the size you want 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.060
 stay in the cell phone's hood 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.190
 then you cut and glue on the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.010
 inside the hood with the image facing 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.320
 up there you only get a glue 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.330
 relief no matter what it may be 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.330
 any color you have in your house 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.209
 and you go around the image I did 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.860
 my black and white images that 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.360
 It is easier to see where I have to 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.360
 put ink and where you do not need 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.710
 after I finished making the picture 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:29.750
 income I wrote and shonan 10 to stay 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.190
 even cooler if you do not want 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.200
 freehand writing 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.030
 you can also print the words and 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.030
 covered the ink the same way 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.260
 you can also do with layers that 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.700
 are colored or drawn 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.080
 But for this you have to have a certain 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.300
 drawing ability 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.100
 you can do freehand using the 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.479
 reference image on your side of the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.020
 same way I used harry 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.660
 potter wants a simpler image or 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.210
 You can draw on your captain. 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.430
 first a permanent pen like this. 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.270
 that I did that is the symbol of the audacity of 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.270
 divergent 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.080
 I also did the drawing to do the 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.880
 around voracious games because it was very 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.010
 hard to make an eye after you 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.350
 finish doing all this let it dry 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.510
 very well let me accept for a long time 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.910
 We like it because the ink stays 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.920
 chubby she takes a lot to stay for 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.330
 inside she forms a film and you 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.430
 Believes it is dry 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.380
 but then if you hit the hand you find out 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.540
 that she was not spoiling all her 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.640
 Work after she's all right, you? 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.530
 going to get a spray paint can be 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.660
 anything does not have to be the same 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.610
 color of the relief ink you used because 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.680
 She will cover everything and it will not happen. 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.450
 to any one I chose to wear silver 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.550
 and the golden because I think these 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.260
 coolest spray things I 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.860
 be very cool in these images that 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.540
 I chose 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.970
 Whenever you use spray paint 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.130
 covers the space you're using to 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.320
 do not dirty anything and leave the spray at least 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.610
 20 centimeters away from work 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.020
 What are you doing to not have 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.150
 danger of spotting is giving small 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.310
 squeezes so as not to tarnish your work 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.800
 after you finish let it dry 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.670
 new and then you can use 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.460
 the governor frei frosted or brilliant 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:43.370
 depending on the table you want or the 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.590
 our super bright new range that 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.780
 was the one I used one more time to 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.800
 make it very bright I think very 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.380
 beautiful 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.570
 just compensate the soft good in 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.170
 every corner you find and 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.170
 ready 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:13.460
