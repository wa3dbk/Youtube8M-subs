00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
awesome figure the gene ocean ya Yin

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.490 
awesome figure the gene ocean ya Yin
ocean<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:46.240> actually<00:01:46.720> called<00:01:46.930> Geonosian

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
ocean it's actually called Geonosian

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.499 
ocean it's actually called Geonosian
pilot<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:51.579> for<00:01:52.060> me<00:01:52.149> it's<00:01:52.299> a<00:01:52.360> regular

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
pilot so but it's for me it's a regular

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.120 
pilot so but it's for me it's a regular
Jane<00:01:52.930> ocean<00:01:53.259> they<00:01:53.439> didn't<00:01:53.770> include<00:01:54.040> a

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
Jane ocean they didn't include a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.950 
Jane ocean they didn't include a
generation<00:01:54.759> blaster<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.450> guess<00:01:55.659> it's<00:01:55.840> because

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
generation blaster I guess it's because

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.859 
generation blaster I guess it's because
he's<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.350> pilot<00:01:56.619> but<00:01:57.070> should<00:01:57.909> be<00:01:57.939> nice<00:01:58.210> would<00:01:58.840> be

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
he's a pilot but should be nice would be

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.480 
he's a pilot but should be nice would be
nice<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.659> we've<00:02:02.110> got<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.500> really<00:02:02.710> detailed<00:02:02.979> face

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
nice so we've got a really detailed face

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.150 
nice so we've got a really detailed face
and<00:02:04.390> see<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.399> torso<00:02:06.570> leg<00:02:07.570> decals<00:02:08.160> like

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
and see and torso leg decals like

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.750 
and see and torso leg decals like
printing<00:02:09.580> back<00:02:10.360> printing<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.320> a<00:02:12.250> special

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
printing back printing and a special

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.560 
printing back printing and a special
face<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.260> it's<00:02:14.500> actually<00:02:15.040> hard<00:02:15.850> plastic

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
face and so it's actually hard plastic

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.460 
face and so it's actually hard plastic
so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
so

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.860 
so
it's<00:02:18.470> not<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.459> can't<00:02:19.700> really<00:02:19.849> sound<00:02:20.690> like

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
it's not you can't really sound like

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.660 
it's not you can't really sound like
rubber<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.730> he's<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.239> great<00:02:23.599> figure<00:02:23.840> really

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
rubber and so he's a great figure really

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.070 
rubber and so he's a great figure really
liked<00:02:25.670> him<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.910> lot<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:27.040> last<00:02:28.040> one<00:02:28.300> Cody<00:02:29.300> it's

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
liked him a lot and last one Cody it's

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.690 
liked him a lot and last one Cody it's
kind<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.319> nice<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.500> they<00:02:30.830> included<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.459> Cody

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
kind of nice that they included a Cody

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.930 
kind of nice that they included a Cody
because<00:02:32.120> he<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.709> actually<00:02:33.709> in<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.160> gin<00:02:34.610> ocean

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:44.529 
actually one part and this is one point

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.559 
actually one part and this is one point
and<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:45.610> thing<00:04:45.789> in<00:04:45.909> the<00:04:45.969> middle<00:04:46.210> is<00:04:46.300> kind<00:04:46.449> of

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569 
and this thing in the middle is kind of

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.739 
and this thing in the middle is kind of
holding<00:04:46.689> it<00:04:47.099> so<00:04:48.099> when<00:04:48.339> here's<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.729> engine<00:04:49.089> I'm

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:49.749 
holding it so when here's the engine I'm

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:51.929 
holding it so when here's the engine I'm
guessing<00:04:50.110> it's<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.259> engine<00:04:50.650> looks<00:04:51.550> like<00:04:51.759> the

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
guessing it's the engine looks like the

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:57.420 
guessing it's the engine looks like the
onion<00:04:52.059> and<00:04:53.759> so<00:04:54.759> yeah<00:04:55.449> that's<00:04:56.439> not<00:04:56.710> much<00:04:57.009> to<00:04:57.219> say

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
onion and so yeah that's not much to say

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.929 
onion and so yeah that's not much to say
about<00:04:57.550> this<00:04:57.819> set<00:04:58.409> so<00:04:59.409> it's<00:05:00.279> nice<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.520> they

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:00.939
