00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.990
 Salmon sauce to all the guys I am 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.740
 welcome to this megamessi 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.440
 video explanation I will draw two cuts 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.780
 two cuts of the basic cartomagia that is 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.370
 are the cuts in matters are this 1 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.290
 while the second is slightly more 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.760
 difficult but nothing that is this here 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.340
 both of these two cuts allow for 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.110
 check the first card so if we 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.090
 we are going to perform this cut the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.340
 first we see that the card remains on top 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.890
 the same thing happens that to the second 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 we do not do this the paper remains 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.630
 always unchanged so we immediately 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.020
 see the first antonio cut number 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.020
 one 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.390
 then we start with the position of the 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.730
 fingers then thumbs and on the short side in 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.160
 down to the right try to keep it 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.220
 closer to the corner possible while 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.810
 middle and index on the short side of the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.700
 card higher up closer and closer 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.040
 at the corner possible at this point what 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.619
 let's go and let's separate a 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.979
 bunch raising with the index in this 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.810
 way 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.430
 what are we going to do this to them 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.960
 role I love you and carry it in your hand 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.330
 left as we do 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.979
 support the fingertip you see the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.900
 we place it on the side 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.090
 short of paper in low where there is the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.979
 thumb and at this point holding the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.560
 bunch between index of the left hand 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.540
 index of the right hand we vote for it 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.280
 in this way up to bring it into the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.229
 service position in the hand 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.270
 left we do the same thing 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.010
 then we raise another portion of 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.140
 wads in this way always with 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.670
 the index and this bunch what is there 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.040
 we make this sketch of it 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 we put between the ring finger and thumb of the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.140
 right hand 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.659
 so in this way for this 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.490
 position we pass which one is thinking 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.049
 then this sketch between words 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.240
 handcuffs and thumb 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.650
 then take the left hand between 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.380
 forefinger and thumb 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.360
 we think the bunch in the middle what 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.990
 held it between thumb and middle in 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.850
 this way 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.050
 at this point we do the same thing 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.180
 then we turn to the first mass 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.380
 in this way always keeping it between 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.840
 thumb and forefinger so obx finally 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.540
 let's put the last bunch on this 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.250
 tutorial of the first cut is really 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.590
 very simple so if we do it again 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.570
 slowly we see that automatically 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.640
 the card remains on top 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.920
 let's see the second now 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.600
 I already cut a number 1 down then 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.620
 second cut slightly harder 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.810
 why we will have to perform this kind of 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.290
 charlie and that doesn't excel but hinges me 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.300
 it seems that we go to this then 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.740
 immediately see how it works then the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.840
 initial part can be varied can 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.700
 simply be done that way and then 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.390
 then having some norm will happen 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.300
 etc. or we can turn it around and do it 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.970
 this thing here i'll show you the 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.280
 easiest method so let's go 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.680
 so the deck we kill like 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.500
 before then average index thumbs 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.150
 this way and let's go up one 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.160
 portion of bundles just like before 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.770
 in this way 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.180
 we think with the left hand 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.239
 at this point what are we going to do 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.010
 we are going to position the ring finger in 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.040
 this position of the left hand 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.080
 so perfect at this point old with 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.090
 the other with the right index finger 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.930
 of bundles in this way and for 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.430
 many i love 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.580
 we notice just like we did before 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.930
 always keeping the one working here 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.480
 that we are going to do then have a 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.040
 annual below 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.440
 then we think the bunch up with better e 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.989
 better in this way if we now 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.420
 we extend the cancel under what 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.610
 This will happen then this 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.560
 position we will arrive but this thing 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.860
 let's go ahead and do this now 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.400
 bunch below we are with thumb and 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.860
 index in this way so as to 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.780
 get this thing then we go to for 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.420
 return folded to the ring finger 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.920
 in this way and when 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.920
 we close it we also insert the 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.040
 right hand bunch so then let's go to 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.930
 do it all slowly 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.570
 let's do this we raise the other portion 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.680
 in March, remember nothing to re-tie 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.120
 let's put this position 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.700
 we turn completely in this manner 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.580
 so let's think between the middle and little finger 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.810
 under the ring finger we extend to work in 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.150
 this way obviously if you don't 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.520
 slow it will be difficult then if it is 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.460
 do fast will not create you so many problems 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.070
 we extend and extend the other as well 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.270
 bundle with thumb and forefinger in this 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.060
 way 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.330
 let's drop this bunch e 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.020
 we insert minimized reverse we understand 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.540
 in the right hand 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.310
 and we close all these so there are two 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:03.560
 false mixtures the first let's read 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.080
 excuse the second slightly difficult 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.669
 the first however are basic cuts but 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.650
 however, they are both fakes 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.419
 mixtures that you can apply 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.690
 poker game or in our games of 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.820
 magic 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.860
 this was all I leave you with a queue 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.510
 budget balance with LED caps, therefore where 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.640
 you can go to see all my 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.500
 explanations of mixtures and non-mixtures 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.900
 and all my performances nothing else 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.310
 follow me on facebook on facebook yes 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.140
 because drowning here will be a page 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.060
 facebook and I also opened a site 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.310
 find the link in the site description 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.560
 what even more important has come out 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.479
 the force pass tutorial maybe fas per 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.460
 who did not know about my invention 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.979
 you can find it here you know exactly 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.840
 how exact and nothing went to see 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.490
 if you want tutorials find all the links 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.080
 in description so you have no via e 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.080
 look at description now 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.229
 one hundred
