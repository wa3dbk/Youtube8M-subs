and<00:00:09.960> it's<00:00:10.769> amazing<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.550> them<00:00:11.759> I'll<00:00:12.420> just<00:00:12.630> take

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
and it's amazing in them I'll just take

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.870 
and it's amazing in them I'll just take
you<00:00:12.929> through<00:00:12.960> some<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> sounds<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.880> it's

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
you through some of the sounds it's it's

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.720 
you through some of the sounds it's it's
not<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.480> most<00:00:15.719> versatile<00:00:16.379> amp<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.550> world

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
not the most versatile amp in the world

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.450 
not the most versatile amp in the world
I've<00:00:17.940> ever<00:00:18.119> seen<00:00:18.420> there's<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.920> on/off<00:00:19.920> switch<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I've ever seen there's a on/off switch a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.330 
I've ever seen there's a on/off switch a
tone<00:00:20.730> knob<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.240> volume<00:00:21.630> knob<00:00:22.039> but<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
tone knob and a volume knob but what it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.970 
tone knob and a volume knob but what it
does<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.910> does<00:00:25.039> really<00:00:26.039> well<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.230> it's<00:00:28.230> 15<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
does it does really well so it's 15 to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.519 
does it does really well so it's 15 to
20<00:00:29.279> watts<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.730> not<00:00:29.910> quite<00:00:30.150> sure<00:00:30.179> how<00:00:30.390> many<00:00:30.599> his

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
20 watts I'm not quite sure how many his

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.010 
20 watts I'm not quite sure how many his
own<00:00:31.679> little<00:00:31.949> circuit<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.520> he<00:00:32.640> designed<00:00:33.020> I'm

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
own little circuit that he designed I'm

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.750 
own little circuit that he designed I'm
sure<00:00:34.320> based<00:00:34.559> off<00:00:34.829> some<00:00:35.100> other<00:00:35.250> classic

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
sure based off some other classic

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.280 
sure based off some other classic
circuits<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.360> that's<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:37.020> about

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
circuits but that's all I know about

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.709 
circuits but that's all I know about
it's<00:00:37.590> got<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.090> el84<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.870> 12ax7<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.190> an<00:00:41.370> easy<00:00:41.719> 81

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it's got to el84 to 12ax7 and an easy 81

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.709 
it's got to el84 to 12ax7 and an easy 81
rectifier<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> here's<00:00:44.789> our<00:00:44.910> volume<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.450> about

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
rectifier so here's our volume on about

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
rectifier so here's our volume on about
two<00:00:46.940> nothing<00:00:47.940> yet<00:00:48.770> about<00:00:49.770> two<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> half<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
two nothing yet about two and a half it

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
two nothing yet about two and a half it
comes<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.649> speaking

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
comes in and that's about speaking

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.140 
comes in and that's about speaking
volume

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.910 

I've<00:00:58.750> got<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.080> tone<00:00:59.320> rolled<00:00:59.590> all<00:00:59.770> the<00:00:59.800> way

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
I've got the tone rolled all the way

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.910 
I've got the tone rolled all the way
down<00:01:00.160> i<00:01:00.190> usually<00:01:00.700> like<00:01:00.880> it<00:01:01.120> up<00:01:01.330> a<00:01:01.570> bit<00:01:01.920> about

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
down i usually like it up a bit about

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.280 
down i usually like it up a bit about
halfway<00:01:05.520> it's<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.580> little<00:01:06.790> bit<00:01:06.910> bright<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.900> bit

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
halfway it's a little bit bright a bit

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.860 
halfway it's a little bit bright a bit
of<00:01:08.410> a<00:01:08.500> bright<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:08.980> it's<00:01:09.130> really<00:01:09.430> punchy<00:01:10.000> so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
of a bright and it's really punchy so

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of a bright and it's really punchy so
I'm<00:01:10.960> going<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.170> shut<00:01:11.320> up<00:01:11.410> and<00:01:11.560> just<00:01:11.620> start

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
I'm going to shut up and just start

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.080 
I'm going to shut up and just start
playing<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.310> I'll<00:01:12.460> just<00:01:12.610> play<00:01:12.790> with<00:01:12.940> the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
playing and I'll just play with the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.910 
playing and I'll just play with the
volume<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.600> tell<00:01:13.780> them<00:01:13.900> that's<00:01:14.080> all<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.260> all<00:01:14.860> I

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.380 

I<00:04:06.890> like<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.040> on<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.250> edge<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.549> breakup<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:09.209> if<00:04:09.269> I

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
I like it on the edge of breakup so if I

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.259 
I like it on the edge of breakup so if I
play<00:04:09.599> Sauk<00:04:10.129> stays<00:04:11.129> clean<00:04:11.459> if<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:11.730> dig<00:04:11.939> in<00:04:12.120> its

dirty

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.439 

plenty<00:04:21.010> of<00:04:21.130> volume<00:04:21.459> for<00:04:21.699> anything<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:22.150> will

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
plenty of volume for anything I will

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.840 
plenty of volume for anything I will
ever<00:04:22.570> need
