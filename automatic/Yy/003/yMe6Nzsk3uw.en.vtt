gonna be some nursing of a broken heart

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.440 
gonna be some nursing of a broken heart
which<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.040> what<00:01:55.190> I<00:01:55.220> would<00:01:55.610> have<00:01:55.730> just<00:01:55.760> heard<00:01:56.270> a

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
which is what I would have just heard a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.760 
which is what I would have just heard a
second<00:01:56.780> ago<00:01:56.900> so<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.350> don't<00:01:57.560> even<00:01:57.620> know

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
second ago so that I don't even know

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.080 
second ago so that I don't even know
what<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:57.980> you<00:01:58.130> know<00:01:58.250> what<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.760> entails

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
what that you know what that entails

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
what that you know what that entails
because<00:01:59.480> they<00:01:59.630> don't<00:01:59.780> tell<00:01:59.930> us<00:01:59.960> anything

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
because they don't tell us anything

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.420 
because they don't tell us anything
until<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:00.680> get<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.860> script<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.160> night<00:02:01.310> before

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
until we get the script the night before

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.760 
until we get the script the night before
