00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
you have a new terminal block let's

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.600 
you have a new terminal block let's
replace<00:03:13.180> it

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
replace it

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.270 
replace it
first<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.630> will<00:03:15.810> need<00:03:15.960> to<00:03:16.020> determine<00:03:16.560> which
