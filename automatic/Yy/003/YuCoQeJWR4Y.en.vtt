00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.520
 someone how are we going to perform in 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.769
 the next ride riding technique 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.630
 clear to the point of snow and meringue 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.880
 many ask for this technique 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.799
 because sometimes you do not mount the 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.250
 clear enough consistent 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.810
 as to hold on a cake but 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.070
 let's do it is very simple what 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.590
 first that we help is a container 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.779
 that is completely clean in leaders 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.859
 of fats that is very important and that 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.490
 the rods that we are going to use 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.199
 also a pinch of salt the eggs 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.530
 that are not fresh of the day but that 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.510
 have a couple of days the sugar for the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.930
 merengue but let's proceed to the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.930
 recipe 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.190
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.629
 separate the whites from the yolks and that 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:54.550
 we stay when we separate it from nothing 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.550
 yolk because if not yes it will not mount 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.560
 we do it very carefully all the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.329
 clear that we need for our 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.790
 fill our cake 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.159
 for our recipe we do it with a lot 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.390
 be careful that nothing more than the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.710
 clear 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.710
 it is very important 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.719
 when the whites already have them 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.719
 separated 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.360
 then add a pinch of salt before 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.360
 AndrÃ© Vetar to start beating 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.310
 I'm going to use the electric mixer 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.770
 with the rods 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.320
 in this case it gets to the minimum 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.750
 power is always not changed 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.549
 speed because if it will not spoil us 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.110
 in the recipe it is important that you beat the 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.430
 at the same speed at a speed 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.070
 minimum 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.260
 constant until consistency is 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.810
 if you do it by hand it 's the same 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.780
 process 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.320
 but if you have electricity it's faster and 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.920
 easier and less tired you are going 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.160
 and you see that he is taking 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.410
 sponginess 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.410
 the whites are riding 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.040
 and they are leaving us with the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.290
 consistency that we want is not this 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.870
 durito is very consistent that is not 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.490
 It collapses as you see, you see, we give it 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.120
 return to tree 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.730
 and it does not fall is at its point there are 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.960
 lifted the egg whites mounted to the point 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 of snow but now let's do 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.330
 merengue and for this we need sugar 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.640
 in this case we will put a spoonful 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.440
 sugar tureen for each egg if you 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.690
 like it sweeter because it's just 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.080
 add more but more or less that's the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.080
 measure 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.160
 we return to beat at the same speed 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.250
 you raise the speed to the minimum and what 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.980
 we do for a little while 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.820
 until the sugar mixes well and 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.600
 as you see we have our meringue 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.650
 consistent 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.140
 it's done and we have the recipe in 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.810
 the blog you can find more tricks for 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.030
 do it and that you get it perfect 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.190
 and there you have the merengue to be able 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.490
 enjoy 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.990
 you also have the ingredients here and 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.220
