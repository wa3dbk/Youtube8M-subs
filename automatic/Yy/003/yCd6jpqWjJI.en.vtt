00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.780 

in<00:00:04.780> this<00:00:05.770> lesson<00:00:06.010> we're<00:00:06.460> going<00:00:06.550> to<00:00:06.609> talk<00:00:06.730> about

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
in this lesson we're going to talk about

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.970 
in this lesson we're going to talk about
the<00:00:07.060> brush<00:00:07.240> palette<00:00:07.480> which<00:00:08.260> is<00:00:08.380> located<00:00:08.680> in

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
the brush palette which is located in

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.320 
the brush palette which is located in
the<00:00:09.130> top<00:00:09.309> left<00:00:09.610> hand<00:00:09.700> corner<00:00:10.059> of<00:00:10.150> your

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
the top left hand corner of your

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.379 
the top left hand corner of your
interface<00:00:11.129> as<00:00:12.129> you<00:00:12.309> can<00:00:12.430> see<00:00:12.610> there<00:00:12.940> are<00:00:13.150> a<00:00:13.180> lot

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
interface as you can see there are a lot

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.789 
interface as you can see there are a lot
of<00:00:13.510> brushes<00:00:13.660> that<00:00:13.959> are<00:00:14.020> already<00:00:14.320> made<00:00:14.469> for<00:00:14.650> you

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
of brushes that are already made for you

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.890 
of brushes that are already made for you
and<00:00:15.160> we're<00:00:16.030> probably<00:00:16.209> not<00:00:16.539> going<00:00:16.630> to<00:00:16.690> cover

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
and we're probably not going to cover

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.970 
and we're probably not going to cover
all<00:00:17.080> of<00:00:17.110> them<00:00:17.289> because<00:00:17.590> that<00:00:17.710> would<00:00:17.830> take<00:00:17.949> a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
all of them because that would take a

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.070 
all of them because that would take a
fairly<00:00:18.220> large<00:00:18.400> amount<00:00:18.520> of<00:00:18.760> time<00:00:19.000> so<00:00:19.720> instead

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
fairly large amount of time so instead

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.769 
fairly large amount of time so instead
we're<00:00:20.619> just<00:00:20.769> gonna<00:00:20.859> cover<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.220> basics<00:00:21.779> okay

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
we're just gonna cover the basics okay

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.089 
we're just gonna cover the basics okay
so<00:00:22.839> the<00:00:23.080> first<00:00:23.199> thing<00:00:23.410> to<00:00:23.470> understand<00:00:23.859> is<00:00:24.039> that

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
so the first thing to understand is that

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.370 
so the first thing to understand is that
each<00:00:24.460> one<00:00:24.640> of<00:00:24.730> your<00:00:24.849> brush<00:00:25.029> types<00:00:25.269> has<00:00:25.810> its<00:00:26.199> own

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
each one of your brush types has its own

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.400 
each one of your brush types has its own
Z<00:00:26.800> intensity<00:00:27.279> focal<00:00:27.999> shift<00:00:28.029> and<00:00:28.570> draw<00:00:29.140> size

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
Z intensity focal shift and draw size

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.679 
Z intensity focal shift and draw size
you<00:00:30.220> can<00:00:30.369> further<00:00:30.579> change<00:00:30.999> the<00:00:31.150> stroke<00:00:31.449> type

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
you can further change the stroke type

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.990 
you can further change the stroke type
add<00:00:32.320> an<00:00:32.560> alpha<00:00:32.950> or<00:00:33.130> if<00:00:33.400> you're<00:00:33.520> using<00:00:33.670> poly

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
add an alpha or if you're using poly

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.900 
add an alpha or if you're using poly
paint<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.590> texture<00:00:35.590> or<00:00:35.800> change<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.489> material

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
paint a texture or change the material

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.090 
paint a texture or change the material
type<00:00:37.120> okay<00:00:38.020> so<00:00:38.289> how<00:00:38.649> does<00:00:38.710> this<00:00:38.800> all<00:00:39.039> work

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
type okay so how does this all work

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.910 
type okay so how does this all work
together<00:00:39.430> well<00:00:40.300> using<00:00:40.989> the<00:00:41.199> default<00:00:41.530> settings

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
together well using the default settings

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.410 
together well using the default settings
we're<00:00:42.280> gonna<00:00:42.399> use<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.820> standard<00:00:43.180> brush

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
we're gonna use the standard brush

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
we're gonna use the standard brush
whoops

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
whoops

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.049 
whoops
okay<00:00:46.000> so<00:00:46.620> default<00:00:47.620> settings<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.190> the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
okay so default settings and the

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.650 
okay so default settings and the
standard<00:00:49.359> brush<00:00:49.559> looks<00:00:50.559> like<00:00:50.710> this<00:00:51.210> yeah<00:00:52.210> not

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
standard brush looks like this yeah not

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.750 
standard brush looks like this yeah not
very<00:00:52.690> impressive<00:00:53.219> however<00:00:54.219> if<00:00:54.460> we<00:00:54.579> mess<00:00:54.730> with

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
very impressive however if we mess with

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.790 
very impressive however if we mess with
a<00:00:54.910> Z<00:00:55.090> intensity<00:00:55.600> which<00:00:55.929> is<00:00:56.109> pretty<00:00:56.379> much<00:00:56.500> the

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
a Z intensity which is pretty much the

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.660 
a Z intensity which is pretty much the
power<00:00:57.219> setting<00:00:57.730> raise<00:00:58.449> it<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.719> hundred<00:00:59.670> it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
power setting raise it to a hundred it

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.880 
power setting raise it to a hundred it
now<00:01:00.820> looks<00:01:01.059> like<00:01:01.120> this<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.500> does<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
now looks like this so does the

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.619 
now looks like this so does the
intensity<00:01:03.250> is<00:01:03.429> basically<00:01:03.760> how<00:01:03.940> powerful<00:01:04.449> your

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
intensity is basically how powerful your

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.440 
intensity is basically how powerful your
brush<00:01:04.839> is<00:01:05.850> next<00:01:06.850> we're<00:01:07.000> gonna<00:01:07.120> look<00:01:07.240> at<00:01:07.360> the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
brush is next we're gonna look at the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.950 
brush is next we're gonna look at the
focal<00:01:07.750> shift<00:01:07.780> this<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:08.950> your<00:01:09.250> fall<00:01:09.490> off<00:01:09.700> so<00:01:10.210> if

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
focal shift this is your fall off so if

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.220 
focal shift this is your fall off so if
you<00:01:11.110> set<00:01:11.260> this<00:01:11.350> thing<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.980> hundred<00:01:13.230> get

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
you set this thing to a hundred get

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.440 
you set this thing to a hundred get
little<00:01:14.470> spikes<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.670> reason<00:01:15.910> for<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.270> is

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
little spikes and the reason for that is

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.960 
little spikes and the reason for that is
that<00:01:16.510> there<00:01:17.110> are<00:01:17.200> actually<00:01:17.500> two<00:01:17.530> circles<00:01:18.250> to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
that there are actually two circles to

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.060 
that there are actually two circles to
your<00:01:19.180> brush<00:01:19.420> if<00:01:20.260> you<00:01:20.380> notice<00:01:20.740> you<00:01:20.860> have<00:01:20.950> an

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
your brush if you notice you have an

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.190 
your brush if you notice you have an
interior<00:01:21.400> circle<00:01:21.910> and<00:01:22.090> an<00:01:22.210> exterior<00:01:22.660> the

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
interior circle and an exterior the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.930 
interior circle and an exterior the
interior<00:01:23.230> is<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.190> size<00:01:24.400> of<00:01:24.490> your<00:01:24.550> actual

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
interior is the size of your actual

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.660 
interior is the size of your actual
brush<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:26.350> distance<00:01:26.680> between<00:01:26.830> that<00:01:27.220> to

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
brush and the distance between that to

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.450 
brush and the distance between that to
the<00:01:27.820> outer<00:01:27.970> circle<00:01:28.270> is<00:01:28.600> your<00:01:28.930> fall<00:01:29.230> off<00:01:29.440> so<00:01:30.310> if

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
the outer circle is your fall off so if

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.390 
the outer circle is your fall off so if
you<00:01:30.580> increase<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.350> focal<00:01:32.350> shift<00:01:32.380> size<00:01:32.890> you're

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
you increase the focal shift size you're

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.280 
you increase the focal shift size you're
basically<00:01:33.730> killing<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.210> brush<00:01:34.420> size<00:01:34.660> itself

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
basically killing the brush size itself

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.860 
basically killing the brush size itself
and<00:01:35.700> instead<00:01:36.700> you're<00:01:36.850> getting<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.150> huge<00:01:37.510> fall

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
and instead you're getting a huge fall

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.840 
and instead you're getting a huge fall
off<00:01:38.080> which<00:01:38.350> means<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.430> you're<00:01:39.550> getting<00:01:39.640> a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
off which means that you're getting a

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.900 
off which means that you're getting a
very<00:01:40.030> very<00:01:40.150> small<00:01:40.810> brush<00:01:41.170> radius<00:01:41.670> however<00:01:42.670> if

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
very very small brush radius however if

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.030 
very very small brush radius however if
you<00:01:43.120> reverse<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.480> and<00:01:43.990> say<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:44.710> there's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
you reverse that and say that there's

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.790 
you reverse that and say that there's
pretty<00:01:45.190> much<00:01:45.310> no<00:01:45.580> fall-off<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:47.500> your<00:01:47.650> brush

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
pretty much no fall-off then your brush

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.070 
pretty much no fall-off then your brush
looks<00:01:48.070> like<00:01:48.190> this<00:01:49.770> okay<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.690> that<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:52.720> your

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
looks like this okay so that is your

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.600 
looks like this okay so that is your
focal<00:01:53.470> shift<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.920> yours<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.250> intensity

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
focal shift and yours the intensity

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.950 
focal shift and yours the intensity
we're<00:01:54.790> gonna<00:01:54.880> put<00:01:55.060> them<00:01:55.180> back<00:01:55.330> at<00:01:55.600> their

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
we're gonna put them back at their

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.840 
we're gonna put them back at their
defaults<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.830> go<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.000> oops<00:01:58.530> 25<00:01:59.550> go<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.610> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
defaults and go to the oops 25 go to the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.370 
defaults and go to the oops 25 go to the
draw<00:02:01.090> size<00:02:01.390> now<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.930> one's<00:02:02.110> actually<00:02:02.230> pretty

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
draw size now this one's actually pretty

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.640 
draw size now this one's actually pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:02.830> it's<00:02:03.820> just<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.690> size<00:02:05.470> that

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
self-explanatory it's just the size that

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.760 
self-explanatory it's just the size that
your<00:02:05.770> brush<00:02:05.980> draws<00:02:06.930> which<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.080> 67<00:02:08.619> is<00:02:08.739> the

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
your brush draws which is 67 is the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.430 
your brush draws which is 67 is the
default<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.310> raise<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:09.610> 200<00:02:10.030> gets<00:02:10.840> really

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
default you raise it 200 gets really

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.289 
default you raise it 200 gets really
really<00:02:11.650> big<00:02:12.450> yeah<00:02:13.650> okay<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.099> another<00:02:15.969> thing<00:02:16.060> to

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
really big yeah okay so another thing to

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.270 
really big yeah okay so another thing to
know<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.659> that<00:02:16.689> you<00:02:17.260> actually<00:02:17.530> don't<00:02:18.040> have<00:02:18.189> to

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
know is that you actually don't have to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.890 
know is that you actually don't have to
keep<00:02:18.459> going<00:02:18.640> back<00:02:18.939> up<00:02:19.150> here<00:02:19.359> to<00:02:19.390> change<00:02:19.689> these

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
keep going back up here to change these

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.860 
keep going back up here to change these
things<00:02:19.959> if<00:02:20.379> you<00:02:20.920> hold<00:02:21.099> down<00:02:21.280> spacebar<00:02:21.719> you<00:02:22.719> get

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
things if you hold down spacebar you get

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.449 
things if you hold down spacebar you get
a<00:02:22.900> cool<00:02:23.079> little<00:02:23.200> popup<00:02:23.650> menu<00:02:23.799> for<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:24.219> so<00:02:24.370> you

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
a cool little popup menu for it so you

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.520 
a cool little popup menu for it so you
can<00:02:24.579> change<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.939> draw<00:02:25.090> size<00:02:25.359> here<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.409> can

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
can change the draw size here you can

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.339 
can change the draw size here you can
change<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.890> focal<00:02:27.250> shift<00:02:28.230> pretty<00:02:29.230> much

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
change the focal shift pretty much

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.720 
change the focal shift pretty much
anything<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.739> need<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.099> do<00:02:30.250> including<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
anything you need to do including the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.819 
anything you need to do including the
intensity<00:02:31.209> now<00:02:31.870> something<00:02:32.650> else<00:02:32.709> you

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
intensity now something else you

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.709 
intensity now something else you
probably<00:02:32.950> noticed<00:02:33.640> was<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.629> m<00:02:34.959> RGB<00:02:35.560> RGB<00:02:36.459> m<00:02:37.030> z

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
probably noticed was the m RGB RGB m z

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.009 
probably noticed was the m RGB RGB m z
ad<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.260> z<00:02:38.560> sub<00:02:38.859> these<00:02:39.640> are<00:02:40.030> basically<00:02:40.810> how

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
ad and z sub these are basically how

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.259 
ad and z sub these are basically how
your<00:02:41.230> brush<00:02:41.499> affects<00:02:41.980> your<00:02:42.189> model<00:02:42.549> the

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
your brush affects your model the

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.080 
your brush affects your model the
material<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.379> prettier<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:45.099> M<00:02:45.249> is<00:02:45.549> your

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
material is prettier the M is your

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.000 
material is prettier the M is your
material<00:02:46.329> which<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.409> thing<00:02:47.590> down<00:02:47.709> here

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
material which is this thing down here

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.050 
material which is this thing down here
the<00:02:48.879> RGB<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.540> colour<00:02:49.749> the<00:02:50.499> M<00:02:50.680> RGB<00:02:51.249> is<00:02:51.459> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
the RGB is the colour the M RGB is the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.179 
the RGB is the colour the M RGB is the
color<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.569> material<00:02:53.079> so<00:02:53.560> if<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.739> have<00:02:53.890> any

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
color and material so if you have any

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.190 
color and material so if you have any
one<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.459> these<00:02:54.609> three<00:02:54.969> selected<00:02:55.540> if<00:02:55.719> your

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
one of these three selected if your

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.160 
one of these three selected if your
model<00:02:57.069> actually<00:02:57.340> has<00:02:57.519> UV<00:02:58.120> x'<00:02:58.150> then<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.930> can

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
model actually has UV x' then you can

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.160 
model actually has UV x' then you can
use<00:02:59.349> poly<00:02:59.620> paint<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.159> paint<00:03:00.609> on<00:03:00.909> a<00:03:01.209> new

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
use poly paint to paint on a new

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.970 
use poly paint to paint on a new
material<00:03:02.489> via<00:03:03.489> Chrome<00:03:04.180> or<00:03:04.599> maybe<00:03:05.469> a<00:03:05.560> jelly

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
material via Chrome or maybe a jelly

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.360 
material via Chrome or maybe a jelly
bean<00:03:06.159> or<00:03:06.900> whatever<00:03:07.900> else<00:03:08.170> really<00:03:08.950> good<00:03:09.159> for

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
bean or whatever else really good for

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.309 
bean or whatever else really good for
like<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:09.969> difference<00:03:10.239> between<00:03:10.299> skin<00:03:11.049> and

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
like the difference between skin and

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.569 
like the difference between skin and
your<00:03:11.439> lips<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:13.139> we'll<00:03:14.139> get<00:03:14.200> into<00:03:14.319> that<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.799> in

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
your lips but we'll get into that and in

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.509 
your lips but we'll get into that and in
another<00:03:15.849> tutorial<00:03:16.120> but<00:03:16.780> anyway<00:03:17.379> let's<00:03:18.370> move

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
another tutorial but anyway let's move

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.839 
another tutorial but anyway let's move
on<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.849> Z<00:03:19.239> ad<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.810> Z<00:03:20.200> sub<00:03:20.560> now<00:03:21.040> Z<00:03:21.370> ad<00:03:21.549> is<00:03:21.819> the

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
on to Z ad and Z sub now Z ad is the

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.970 
on to Z ad and Z sub now Z ad is the
default<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:22.959> basically<00:03:23.379> means<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.739> your

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
default that basically means that your

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.149 
default that basically means that your
brush<00:03:24.219> adds<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.849> your<00:03:25.239> mesh<00:03:25.480> but<00:03:26.260> if<00:03:26.379> you<00:03:26.469> say<00:03:26.680> Z

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
brush adds to your mesh but if you say Z

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.470 
brush adds to your mesh but if you say Z
sub<00:03:28.109> it'll<00:03:29.109> take<00:03:29.290> away<00:03:29.499> from<00:03:30.299> kind<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.389> like

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
sub it'll take away from kind of like

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.899 
sub it'll take away from kind of like
carving<00:03:31.779> into<00:03:32.019> it<00:03:32.319> think<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.680> like<00:03:32.920> whittling

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
carving into it think of like whittling

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.000 
carving into it think of like whittling
wood<00:03:33.969> to<00:03:34.389> create<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:34.749> a<00:03:34.779> totem<00:03:35.200> or<00:03:35.529> you<00:03:35.889> know

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
wood to create like a totem or you know

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.000 
wood to create like a totem or you know
a<00:03:36.159> little<00:03:36.279> wood<00:03:36.579> sculpture<00:03:37.060> okay<00:03:38.079> so<00:03:38.349> there's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
a little wood sculpture okay so there's

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.459 
a little wood sculpture okay so there's
actually<00:03:39.219> a<00:03:39.459> hotkey<00:03:39.879> for<00:03:40.420> Z<00:03:40.749> sub<00:03:41.079> so<00:03:41.260> you<00:03:41.319> don't

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:41.469 
actually a hotkey for Z sub so you don't

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.000 
actually a hotkey for Z sub so you don't
have<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.709> actually<00:03:42.040> select<00:03:42.279> it<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.840> have<00:03:44.439> Z

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
have to actually select it if you have Z

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.369 
have to actually select it if you have Z
add-on<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:45.969> you're<00:03:46.209> just<00:03:46.389> drawing<00:03:46.749> if<00:03:47.049> you

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
add-on and you're just drawing if you

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.250 
add-on and you're just drawing if you
hold<00:03:47.590> down<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.889> Alt<00:03:48.099> key<00:03:48.189> it<00:03:48.969> will<00:03:49.180> turn<00:03:49.389> on<00:03:49.659> Z

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
hold down the Alt key it will turn on Z

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.369 
hold down the Alt key it will turn on Z
sub<00:03:51.269> let<00:03:52.269> go<00:03:52.420> of<00:03:52.540> alt<00:03:52.689> and<00:03:52.930> it'll<00:03:53.170> start

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
sub let go of alt and it'll start

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.979 
sub let go of alt and it'll start
drawing<00:03:53.769> up<00:03:53.920> again<00:03:54.249> hold<00:03:55.150> down<00:03:55.299> alt<00:03:55.629> and<00:03:55.749> it'll

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
drawing up again hold down alt and it'll

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.709 
drawing up again hold down alt and it'll
start<00:03:56.170> taking<00:03:56.499> away<00:03:56.560> from<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:58.209> also<00:03:58.359> have<00:03:58.629> the

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719 
start taking away from you also have the

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.080 
start taking away from you also have the
ability<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.079> smooth<00:03:59.709> out<00:03:59.799> your<00:03:59.950> geometry<00:04:00.219> by

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
ability to smooth out your geometry by

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.149 
ability to smooth out your geometry by
holding<00:04:01.450> down<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.599> shift<00:04:01.719> key<00:04:02.049> this<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:02.799> your

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
holding down the shift key this is your

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.729 
holding down the shift key this is your
smooth<00:04:03.519> brush<00:04:03.849> so<00:04:04.689> if<00:04:04.810> anything<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:05.469> getting<00:04:05.680> a

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
smooth brush so if anything is getting a

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.769 
smooth brush so if anything is getting a
little<00:04:05.829> too<00:04:06.069> jagged<00:04:06.459> or<00:04:06.849> just<00:04:07.419> doesn't<00:04:07.719> look

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:07.779 
little too jagged or just doesn't look

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.319 
little too jagged or just doesn't look
very<00:04:08.109> very<00:04:08.620> fluid<00:04:09.519> with<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:09.849> rest<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.209> your

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
very very fluid with the rest of your

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.750 
very very fluid with the rest of your
sculpt<00:04:10.719> shift<00:04:11.620> will<00:04:11.859> smooth<00:04:12.099> it<00:04:12.189> out<00:04:12.310> for<00:04:12.579> you

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
sculpt shift will smooth it out for you

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.789 
sculpt shift will smooth it out for you
next<00:04:13.659> let's<00:04:13.930> look<00:04:14.079> at<00:04:14.169> your<00:04:14.290> stroke<00:04:14.590> types

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
next let's look at your stroke types

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.159 
next let's look at your stroke types
which<00:04:15.310> we<00:04:15.639> currently<00:04:15.790> have<00:04:16.090> dot<00:04:16.299> selected<00:04:16.840> so

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
which we currently have dot selected so

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.870 
which we currently have dot selected so
as<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.650> seen<00:04:17.829> with<00:04:17.950> our<00:04:17.980> last<00:04:18.220> stroke<00:04:18.609> it

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
as you seen with our last stroke it

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.190 
as you seen with our last stroke it
looks<00:04:19.120> like<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.269> bunch<00:04:19.480> of<00:04:19.570> circles<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:20.049> are

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
looks like a bunch of circles that are

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.990 
looks like a bunch of circles that are
just<00:04:20.410> drawn<00:04:20.650> really<00:04:21.070> really<00:04:21.459> close<00:04:21.730> to<00:04:21.880> each

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
just drawn really really close to each

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.360 
just drawn really really close to each
other<00:04:22.120> rather<00:04:22.750> than<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:23.020> stray

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
other rather than a stray

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.540 
other rather than a stray
line<00:04:23.669> so<00:04:24.600> we<00:04:24.930> also<00:04:25.080> have<00:04:25.410> drag<00:04:26.190> rectangle

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
line so we also have drag rectangle

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.590 
line so we also have drag rectangle
freehand<00:04:27.479> color<00:04:28.169> spray<00:04:28.530> spray<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.669> drag<00:04:30.330> dot

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
freehand color spray spray and drag dot

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.780 
freehand color spray spray and drag dot
though<00:04:31.229> all<00:04:31.860> of<00:04:31.979> these<00:04:32.130> actually<00:04:32.550> have<00:04:32.639> their

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
though all of these actually have their

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.250 
though all of these actually have their
own<00:04:32.820> settings<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.330> can<00:04:33.419> play<00:04:33.600> around<00:04:33.720> with<00:04:33.930> so

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
own settings you can play around with so

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.710 
own settings you can play around with so
if<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.440> said<00:04:34.680> spray<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.669> can<00:04:36.150> mess<00:04:36.360> with<00:04:36.389> the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
if I said spray I can mess with the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.460 
if I said spray I can mess with the
placement<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.290> scale<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.800> color<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.280> flow

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
placement the scale the color the flow

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.710 
placement the scale the color the flow
even<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.560> mouse<00:04:40.740> average<00:04:41.220> so<00:04:41.580> each<00:04:42.479> one<00:04:42.660> of

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
even the mouse average so each one of

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.930 
even the mouse average so each one of
these<00:04:42.810> are<00:04:43.080> kind<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.470> cool<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.949> how<00:04:44.760> they

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
these are kind of cool and how they

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.600 
these are kind of cool and how they
interact<00:04:45.540> with<00:04:45.930> your<00:04:46.350> sculpt<00:04:46.860> like<00:04:47.310> this<00:04:47.460> one

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
interact with your sculpt like this one

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.730 
interact with your sculpt like this one
can<00:04:47.729> create<00:04:47.910> some<00:04:48.150> blobs<00:04:48.389> actually<00:04:49.380> not<00:04:49.530> I'll

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
can create some blobs actually not I'll

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.530 
can create some blobs actually not I'll
show<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:49.949> the<00:04:50.040> blob<00:04:50.190> brush<00:04:50.340> real<00:04:50.610> quick

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.540 

I<00:04:53.690> think<00:04:54.200> it's<00:04:54.320> a<00:04:54.350> little<00:04:54.470> better<00:04:54.710> illustrated

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
I think it's a little better illustrated

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.930 
I think it's a little better illustrated
this<00:04:55.670> way<00:04:55.880> okay<00:04:56.660> so<00:04:56.860> blob<00:04:57.860> plus<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.820> spray

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
this way okay so blob plus the spray

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.200 
this way okay so blob plus the spray
equals<00:05:01.940> warts<00:05:03.250> it's<00:05:04.250> kind<00:05:04.460> of<00:05:04.520> cool<00:05:04.670> now<00:05:04.850> let's

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
equals warts it's kind of cool now let's

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.450 
equals warts it's kind of cool now let's
look<00:05:05.420> at<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.750> blob<00:05:06.260> without<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:07.070> actual

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
look at the blob without the actual

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.840 
look at the blob without the actual
spray<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:08.600> instead<00:05:08.930> we're<00:05:09.170> just<00:05:09.320> gonna<00:05:09.410> use

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
spray and instead we're just gonna use

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.330 
spray and instead we're just gonna use
the<00:05:10.850> drag<00:05:11.720> dot<00:05:11.990> okay<00:05:12.680> let's<00:05:12.860> go<00:05:12.980> and<00:05:13.130> clear

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
the drag dot okay let's go and clear

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.000 
the drag dot okay let's go and clear
that<00:05:13.490> off<00:05:13.670> there<00:05:13.910> there<00:05:14.690> we<00:05:14.780> go<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:15.560> drag<00:05:15.800> dot

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
that off there there we go the drag dot

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.040 
that off there there we go the drag dot
we'll<00:05:16.250> use<00:05:16.490> your<00:05:16.670> brush<00:05:16.940> technically<00:05:17.660> once

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
we'll use your brush technically once

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.530 
we'll use your brush technically once
and<00:05:18.500> allow<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.340> move<00:05:19.730> it<00:05:19.970> wherever<00:05:20.210> you

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
and allow you to move it wherever you

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.080 
and allow you to move it wherever you
want<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.160> as<00:05:22.160> you<00:05:22.250> can<00:05:22.340> see<00:05:22.400> it<00:05:22.760> looks<00:05:22.880> like

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
want so as you can see it looks like

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.730 
want so as you can see it looks like
we're<00:05:23.240> basically<00:05:23.540> just<00:05:23.690> moving<00:05:24.170> around<00:05:24.500> a

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
we're basically just moving around a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.460 
we're basically just moving around a
single<00:05:25.100> dot<00:05:25.340> which<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:25.970> what<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.360> blob<00:05:26.600> brush

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
single dot which is what the blob brush

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.730 
single dot which is what the blob brush
is<00:05:27.740> actually<00:05:27.920> made<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:29.080> however<00:05:30.080> if<00:05:30.500> we

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
is actually made of however if we

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.340 
is actually made of however if we
combine<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.400> brush<00:05:31.640> type<00:05:31.910> plus<00:05:32.360> a<00:05:32.390> stroke<00:05:32.840> and

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
combine the brush type plus a stroke and

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.220 
combine the brush type plus a stroke and
an<00:05:33.620> alpha<00:05:34.070> like<00:05:34.550> say<00:05:35.380> this<00:05:36.380> one<00:05:37.900> you<00:05:38.900> can<00:05:39.050> see

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
an alpha like say this one you can see

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.930 
an alpha like say this one you can see
what<00:05:39.350> it's<00:05:39.470> actually<00:05:39.620> doing<00:05:39.860> it's<00:05:40.490> allowing

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
what it's actually doing it's allowing

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.250 
what it's actually doing it's allowing
us<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.330> drag<00:05:41.630> on<00:05:41.930> extra<00:05:42.650> detail<00:05:43.990> so<00:05:44.990> we<00:05:45.110> can

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
us to drag on extra detail so we can

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.590 
us to drag on extra detail so we can
place<00:05:45.500> it<00:05:45.530> wherever<00:05:46.010> we<00:05:46.250> want<00:05:46.670> and<00:05:46.970> that's

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
place it wherever we want and that's

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.050 
place it wherever we want and that's
just<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:47.990> drag<00:05:48.200> dot<00:05:48.470> if<00:05:48.740> we<00:05:49.250> go<00:05:49.370> back<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.820> the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
just the drag dot if we go back to the

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.530 
just the drag dot if we go back to the
standard<00:05:50.510> brush<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:52.340> change<00:05:52.610> it<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:52.790> the<00:05:53.210> drag

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
standard brush and change it to the drag

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.700 
standard brush and change it to the drag
rectangle<00:05:54.010> and<00:05:55.010> grab<00:05:55.190> that<00:05:55.370> same<00:05:55.580> exact<00:05:55.970> alpha

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
rectangle and grab that same exact alpha

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.770 
rectangle and grab that same exact alpha
you<00:05:57.710> can<00:05:57.860> see<00:05:58.040> how<00:05:58.250> the<00:05:58.730> drag<00:05:59.000> rectangle<00:05:59.390> works

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
you can see how the drag rectangle works

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.640 
you can see how the drag rectangle works
and<00:06:00.370> that<00:06:01.370> it<00:06:01.460> allows<00:06:01.730> you<00:06:01.940> to<00:06:02.150> basically

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
and that it allows you to basically

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.050 
and that it allows you to basically
select<00:06:03.650> a<00:06:03.770> region<00:06:03.920> you<00:06:04.250> want<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.610> brush<00:06:04.820> to<00:06:04.970> be

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
select a region you want the brush to be

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.020 
select a region you want the brush to be
created<00:06:05.570> on<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:05.990> as<00:06:06.530> you<00:06:06.770> drag<00:06:07.100> the<00:06:07.850> brush

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
created on and as you drag the brush

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.480 
created on and as you drag the brush
gets<00:06:08.300> bigger<00:06:08.540> or<00:06:08.840> in<00:06:09.530> this<00:06:09.590> case<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:10.190> Alpha

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
gets bigger or in this case the Alpha

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.050 
gets bigger or in this case the Alpha
does<00:06:10.670> so<00:06:11.630> it's<00:06:11.990> pretty<00:06:12.200> cool<00:06:12.670> now<00:06:13.670> what<00:06:13.970> about

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
does so it's pretty cool now what about

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.970 
does so it's pretty cool now what about
the<00:06:14.270> rest<00:06:14.390> of<00:06:14.570> the<00:06:14.630> brushes<00:06:14.840> inside<00:06:15.440> of<00:06:15.560> ZBrush

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
the rest of the brushes inside of ZBrush

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.700 
the rest of the brushes inside of ZBrush
well<00:06:16.940> in<00:06:17.210> all<00:06:17.480> honesty<00:06:17.630> you're<00:06:18.230> not<00:06:18.500> going<00:06:18.650> to

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
well in all honesty you're not going to

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.340 
well in all honesty you're not going to
be<00:06:18.800> using<00:06:19.130> a<00:06:19.250> lot<00:06:19.520> of<00:06:19.550> these<00:06:19.730> most<00:06:20.480> people<00:06:21.140> that

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
be using a lot of these most people that

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.890 
be using a lot of these most people that
use<00:06:21.530> ZBrush<00:06:22.160> find<00:06:22.850> maybe<00:06:23.210> a<00:06:23.330> handful<00:06:23.810> of

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
use ZBrush find maybe a handful of

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.750 
use ZBrush find maybe a handful of
brushes<00:06:24.380> that<00:06:24.560> they<00:06:24.680> really<00:06:25.010> really<00:06:25.040> like<00:06:25.490> and

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
brushes that they really really like and

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.480 
brushes that they really really like and
they<00:06:26.240> just<00:06:26.420> focus<00:06:26.840> on<00:06:27.020> those<00:06:27.260> so<00:06:28.040> a<00:06:28.070> good

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
they just focus on those so a good

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.700 
they just focus on those so a good
example<00:06:28.760> of<00:06:28.940> this<00:06:29.090> is<00:06:29.330> the<00:06:29.690> move<00:06:29.960> brush<00:06:30.230> you've

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
example of this is the move brush you've

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.260 
example of this is the move brush you've
also<00:06:30.890> got<00:06:31.070> well<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.460> actually<00:06:31.820> have<00:06:31.940> a<00:06:32.090> couple

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
also got well you actually have a couple

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.110 
also got well you actually have a couple
move<00:06:32.630> brushes<00:06:33.050> you<00:06:33.260> have<00:06:33.490> move<00:06:34.490> move

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
move brushes you have move move

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.620 
move brushes you have move move
topological<00:06:35.930> move<00:06:36.470> elastic<00:06:37.010> move<00:06:37.580> is<00:06:37.910> pretty

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
topological move elastic move is pretty

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.930 
topological move elastic move is pretty
much<00:06:38.720> restricted<00:06:39.110> to<00:06:39.380> your<00:06:39.500> brush<00:06:39.770> size<00:06:40.100> where

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
much restricted to your brush size where

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.910 
much restricted to your brush size where
move<00:06:41.210> topological<00:06:41.960> let's<00:06:42.230> say<00:06:42.410> you<00:06:42.470> have<00:06:42.710> like

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920 
move topological let's say you have like

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.530 
move topological let's say you have like
a<00:06:43.100> mouth<00:06:43.370> or<00:06:43.670> something<00:06:44.060> or<00:06:44.240> like<00:06:44.360> this

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
a mouth or something or like this

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.400 
a mouth or something or like this
crevice<00:06:44.780> if<00:06:45.500> my<00:06:45.800> brush<00:06:46.070> exceeds<00:06:47.170> get<00:06:48.170> a<00:06:48.200> little

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
crevice if my brush exceeds get a little

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.840 
crevice if my brush exceeds get a little
bit<00:06:48.530> closer<00:06:48.740> here<00:06:49.100> I<00:06:49.480> sleep<00:06:50.480> back<00:06:50.840> up<00:06:51.850> and

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
bit closer here I sleep back up and

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.670 
bit closer here I sleep back up and
increase<00:06:53.330> the<00:06:53.480> brush<00:06:53.750> size

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
increase the brush size

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.950 
increase the brush size
so<00:06:55.490> as<00:06:56.240> you<00:06:56.360> can<00:06:56.449> see<00:06:56.509> it's<00:06:56.810> moving<00:06:57.020> everything

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
so as you can see it's moving everything

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.950 
so as you can see it's moving everything
but<00:06:59.960> if<00:07:00.139> I<00:07:00.290> select<00:07:00.590> move<00:07:01.550> topological<00:07:02.389> and

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
but if I select move topological and

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.430 
but if I select move topological and
grab<00:07:03.169> this<00:07:03.350> top<00:07:03.620> piece<00:07:03.889> and<00:07:04.330> tries<00:07:05.330> to

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
grab this top piece and tries to

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.020 
grab this top piece and tries to
understand<00:07:06.440> the<00:07:06.889> actual<00:07:07.310> geometry<00:07:07.520> I'm

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
understand the actual geometry I'm

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.029 
understand the actual geometry I'm
trying<00:07:08.360> to<00:07:08.570> move<00:07:08.780> rather<00:07:09.530> than<00:07:09.800> moving

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
trying to move rather than moving

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.860 
trying to move rather than moving
everything<00:07:10.430> so<00:07:11.240> if<00:07:11.300> you<00:07:11.389> want<00:07:11.539> to<00:07:11.600> close<00:07:11.840> your

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
everything so if you want to close your

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.749 
everything so if you want to close your
characters<00:07:12.560> mouth<00:07:12.830> you're<00:07:13.340> going<00:07:13.520> to<00:07:13.610> want<00:07:13.729> to

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 
characters mouth you're going to want to

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.570 
characters mouth you're going to want to
use<00:07:13.940> move<00:07:14.930> topological<00:07:15.770> instead<00:07:16.160> of<00:07:16.280> moved

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
use move topological instead of moved

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.360 
use move topological instead of moved
because<00:07:16.850> again<00:07:17.240> if<00:07:17.690> you<00:07:17.960> use<00:07:18.229> just<00:07:18.530> move<00:07:18.860> it's

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
because again if you use just move it's

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.670 
because again if you use just move it's
gonna<00:07:19.550> move<00:07:19.820> the<00:07:20.090> whole<00:07:20.270> thing<00:07:20.300> and<00:07:20.870> you<00:07:21.530> don't

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
gonna move the whole thing and you don't

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.689 
gonna move the whole thing and you don't
want<00:07:21.800> that<00:07:22.990> okay<00:07:23.990> and<00:07:24.289> then<00:07:25.130> there's<00:07:25.310> also<00:07:25.460> the

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:25.699 
want that okay and then there's also the

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.180 
want that okay and then there's also the
morphe<00:07:25.910> brush<00:07:26.210> which<00:07:26.479> is<00:07:26.630> used<00:07:26.840> with<00:07:27.080> you<00:07:28.070> are

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.190 
morphe brush which is used with you are

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.010 
morphe brush which is used with you are
morph<00:07:28.460> target<00:07:28.970> which<00:07:29.270> we'll<00:07:29.600> get<00:07:29.690> into<00:07:29.750> in

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020 
morph target which we'll get into in

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.320 
morph target which we'll get into in
another<00:07:30.110> another<00:07:31.039> lesson<00:07:31.340> you<00:07:31.970> have<00:07:32.150> the

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
another another lesson you have the

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.820 
another another lesson you have the
insert<00:07:32.720> brushes<00:07:32.900> which<00:07:33.440> is<00:07:33.560> used<00:07:33.770> with

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:33.830 
insert brushes which is used with

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.370 
insert brushes which is used with
dynamesh<00:07:34.370> you<00:07:34.820> have<00:07:35.000> the<00:07:35.180> groom<00:07:35.419> brush<00:07:35.720> well

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380 
dynamesh you have the groom brush well

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.110 
dynamesh you have the groom brush well
whole<00:07:36.680> collection<00:07:37.070> of<00:07:37.100> them<00:07:37.220> actually<00:07:37.580> which

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 
whole collection of them actually which

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.219 
whole collection of them actually which
is<00:07:38.150> used<00:07:38.449> for<00:07:38.690> hair<00:07:38.960> and<00:07:40.479> basically<00:07:41.479> poly

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:42.229 
is used for hair and basically poly

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:47.170 
is used for hair and basically poly
fiber<00:07:43.840> what<00:07:44.840> else<00:07:45.020> you<00:07:45.560> also<00:07:45.710> have<00:07:45.979> the<00:07:46.280> curve

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180 
fiber what else you also have the curve

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.810 
fiber what else you also have the curve
standard<00:07:47.690> type<00:07:47.870> brush<00:07:48.080> or<00:07:48.440> the<00:07:48.710> curve<00:07:49.010> brushes

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:51.820 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.120 

which<00:07:52.820> operate<00:07:53.270> off<00:07:53.479> of<00:07:53.509> a<00:07:53.750> curve<00:07:54.020> as<00:07:54.349> you<00:07:54.860> can

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.130 
which operate off of a curve as you can

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.900 
which operate off of a curve as you can
see<00:07:55.310> here<00:07:56.349> so<00:07:57.349> there<00:07:57.680> are<00:07:57.860> definitely<00:07:58.340> a<00:07:58.400> lot

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:58.910 
see here so there are definitely a lot

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.310 
see here so there are definitely a lot
of<00:07:58.940> brushes<00:07:59.570> you<00:07:59.660> can<00:07:59.780> play<00:07:59.960> around<00:08:00.080> with

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:00.320 
of brushes you can play around with

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.830 
of brushes you can play around with
inside<00:08:00.979> of<00:08:01.160> ZBrush<00:08:01.580> I<00:08:01.820> recommend<00:08:02.510> getting<00:08:02.630> in

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:02.840 
inside of ZBrush I recommend getting in

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.540 
inside of ZBrush I recommend getting in
here<00:08:03.020> and<00:08:03.229> just<00:08:03.470> experimenting<00:08:03.919> basically

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:04.550 
here and just experimenting basically
