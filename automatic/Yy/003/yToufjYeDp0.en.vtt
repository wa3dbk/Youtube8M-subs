00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
does have a holster but i think it's

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.520 
does have a holster but i think it's
just<00:04:28.580> kind<00:04:28.940> of<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.479> just<00:04:29.630> molded<00:04:30.169> like<00:04:30.290> that

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
just kind of it's just molded like that

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.320 
just kind of it's just molded like that
you<00:04:30.680> can't<00:04:30.889> put<00:04:31.009> his<00:04:31.160> gun<00:04:31.340> in<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.610> which<00:04:32.150> is

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
you can't put his gun in it which is

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.080 
you can't put his gun in it which is
unfortunate<00:04:33.190> as<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.220> pistol<00:04:34.520> he<00:04:34.789> should<00:04:34.970> be

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
unfortunate as a pistol he should be

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.770 
unfortunate as a pistol he should be
able<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.300> put<00:04:35.449> it<00:04:35.539> in<00:04:35.630> there<00:04:35.780> but<00:04:35.990> better<00:04:36.710> I

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
able to put it in there but better I

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.939 
able to put it in there but better I
think<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.930> looks<00:04:39.080> really<00:04:39.440> good<00:04:39.590> they<00:04:39.770> did<00:04:39.830> a

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
think that looks really good they did a

think that looks really good they did a
good<00:04:40.130> job<00:04:40.190> with<00:04:40.550> all<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.940> black<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:42.440> the

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
good probably could have used a bit of a

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.020 
good probably could have used a bit of a
