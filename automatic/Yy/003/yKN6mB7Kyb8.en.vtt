00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.630
 news and even when fifa comes out 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.780
 16 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.549
 wilders and others especially ultimate in and 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.460
 who knows in career mode now yes 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.240
 let's start with the video with the news of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.429
 today fifa 16 in the first person and I want 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.039
 start this video this news this 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.409
 rumor showing if commenting is a 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.500
 video from some time ago a 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.840
 youtuber who came to work or works 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.579
 I still do not know exactly but 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.619
 let's say you had access to several 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.319
 functions of the game and could create this 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.569
 sort of mod like I do not know if 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.299
 really played in the first person or 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.610
 he simply played and scored a goal or 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.509
 good a good goal with rooney as you can 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.670
 see and then we say what the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.380
 repetition in some way to see it 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.039
 as if he were playing at first 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.979
 person is cool a lot and with that you 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.140
 I want to introduce in this video because 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.810
 it can be foolish it can be 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.299
 just a detail but there is one thing 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.899
 what happens in the trailer I do not know if you 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.730
 you have fixed but it is very key and I 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.080
 I'm going to show it may seem silly 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.320
 but to me 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.540
 it seems an interesting nod, there's also 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.510
 also a tweet from a person who 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.270
 he works in esports that he has tweeted what 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.720
 next career mode is my 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.580
 preferred this year will be an experience 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.010
 much more dynamic than he needed to 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.220
 this game mode more than this I can not 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.550
 say nothing can not count more good 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.590
 as you can see it's pretty suspicious 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.690
 it induces a lot to what we are 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.850
 commenting on this video now yes I'm going 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.760
 to show the exact moment of the trailer 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.680
 of fifa 16 where they make this kind of 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.470
 wink literally because you're going to see that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.780
 it is a nod to this news this rumor 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.930
 towards what we are discussing in 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.000
 this video 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.390
 that is, the can not be lived from 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.390
 true 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.020
 fifa from 6 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.510
 play beautiful you have seen you have 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.880
 fixed that tells you but that is the 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.330
 beauty if you can not live it just right 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.070
 a wink with the eye and we appear behind 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.250
 of omen as if we were in 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.400
 first person to me is more than a 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.490
 wink can have a very meaning 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.280
 important and who knows we have there the 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.380
 first person camera in fifa 16 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.000
 saying this this is all there is nothing 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.250
 confirmed as I said is a rumor 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.660
 but I think it was worth attracting 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.210
 this video and I hope you liked it 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.950
