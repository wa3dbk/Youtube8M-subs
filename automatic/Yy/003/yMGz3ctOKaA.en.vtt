one<00:00:00.359> of<00:00:00.450> the<00:00:00.539> questions<00:00:01.079> that<00:00:01.560> we<00:00:01.949> get<00:00:02.129> from

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
one of the questions that we get from

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.910 
one of the questions that we get from
new<00:00:02.580> students<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.300> knowing<00:00:03.870> when<00:00:04.110> you<00:00:04.259> can<00:00:04.589> and

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
new students is knowing when you can and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:23.270 
new students is knowing when you can and
cannot<00:00:05.130> code<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:06.029> diagnosis

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.280 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.570 

I<00:00:26.780> think<00:00:27.780> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.110> of<00:00:28.290> students<00:00:28.770> as<00:00:29.070> soon<00:00:29.460> as

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
I think a lot of students as soon as

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.760 
I think a lot of students as soon as
they<00:00:29.700> learn<00:00:29.910> how<00:00:30.120> to<00:00:30.150> look<00:00:30.420> up<00:00:30.570> codes<00:00:30.930> they<00:00:31.590> are

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
they learn how to look up codes they are

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.440 
they learn how to look up codes they are
ready<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> code<00:00:32.460> everything<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.240> they<00:00:33.390> see

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
ready to code everything that they see

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.040 
ready to code everything that they see
and<00:00:34.730> every<00:00:35.730> every<00:00:36.180> new<00:00:36.330> student<00:00:36.540> does<00:00:36.810> it<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and every every new student does it I

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
and every every new student does it I
remember<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.500> did<00:00:37.830> it<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.160> was<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.640> want<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.300> call

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
remember I did it I was I want to call

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.530 
remember I did it I was I want to call
myself<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:40.020> super<00:00:40.380> coder<00:00:40.620> because<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.150> wanted

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
myself a super coder because I I wanted

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.650 
myself a super coder because I I wanted
to<00:00:42.600> code<00:00:42.750> everything<00:00:43.430> it's<00:00:44.430> fun<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> code<00:00:44.850> but

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to code everything it's fun to code but

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.950 
to code everything it's fun to code but
you<00:00:45.900> can't<00:00:46.290> do<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.970> need<00:00:48.150> to<00:00:48.390> code<00:00:48.660> only

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you can't do that you need to code only

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.549 
you can't do that you need to code only
definitive<00:00:49.910> diagnosis<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.320> they<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.470> be

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
definitive diagnosis and they can be

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.830 
definitive diagnosis and they can be
hard<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> identify<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.150> things<00:00:54.450> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
hard to identify one of the things that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
hard to identify one of the things that
you<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.260> stay<00:00:55.379> away<00:00:55.589> from<00:00:55.650> is<00:00:56.250> equivocal

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you have to stay away from is equivocal

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.479 
you have to stay away from is equivocal
language<00:00:57.170> when<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.199> say<00:00:58.830> equivocal<00:00:59.460> language

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
language when we say equivocal language

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.660 
language when we say equivocal language
that<00:01:00.330> means<00:01:00.540> it's<00:01:01.019> kind<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.280> fence

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that means it's kind of on the fence

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.420 
that means it's kind of on the fence
it's<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.720> a<00:01:03.750> definite<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> could<00:01:04.800> go<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.159> way

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it's not a definite it could go one way

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's not a definite it could go one way
or<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.790> other<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.420> stay<00:01:06.750> away<00:01:07.110> from

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
or the other you have to stay away from

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.790 
or the other you have to stay away from
that<00:01:07.530> type<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.150> verbage<00:01:09.590> impending<00:01:10.590> or

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
that type of verbage impending or

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.520 
that type of verbage impending or
threatened<00:01:11.490> conditions<00:01:12.330> you'll<00:01:12.870> see<00:01:13.230> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
threatened conditions you'll see that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.620 
threatened conditions you'll see that
but<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.090> tricky

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
but that can be tricky

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.920 
but that can be tricky
you<00:01:16.290> cannot<00:01:16.860> code<00:01:17.400> something<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.479> has<00:01:18.659> not

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
you cannot code something if it has not

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.310 
you cannot code something if it has not
happened<00:01:19.320> yet<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.920> most<00:01:20.729> cases<00:01:21.300> now<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.229> know

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
happened yet in most cases now I know

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.860 
happened yet in most cases now I know
that<00:01:22.620> sounds<00:01:23.220> again<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> little<00:01:23.880> ambiguous<00:01:24.240> but

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
that sounds again a little ambiguous but

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.990 
that sounds again a little ambiguous but
if<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.770> physician<00:01:26.630> documents<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.869> example

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
if your physician documents for example

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.870 
if your physician documents for example
will<00:01:30.000> scroll<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.380> bit

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.819 

impending<00:01:35.880> rupture<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.509> spleen<00:01:37.140> due<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
impending rupture of spleen due to

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.260 
impending rupture of spleen due to
enlarged<00:01:38.759> spleen<00:01:39.409> okay<00:01:40.439> impending<00:01:41.369> tells<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
enlarged spleen okay impending tells you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.600 
enlarged spleen okay impending tells you
it's<00:01:42.509> gonna<00:01:42.990> happen<00:01:43.289> they're<00:01:44.070> pretty<00:01:44.310> sure

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
it's gonna happen they're pretty sure

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.819 
it's gonna happen they're pretty sure
it's<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.329> happen<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> hasn't

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it's going to happen but it hasn't

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.730 
it's going to happen but it hasn't
happened<00:01:47.070> yet<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.600> cannot<00:01:49.049> code<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
happened yet so you cannot code a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.810 
happened yet so you cannot code a
ruptured<00:01:50.310> spleen

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
ruptured spleen

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.770 
ruptured spleen
you<00:01:51.539> can<00:01:51.719> only<00:01:51.930> code<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:53.159> splenomegaly<00:01:54.090> which

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
you can only code the splenomegaly which

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.260 
you can only code the splenomegaly which
is<00:01:54.960> an<00:01:55.140> enlarged<00:01:55.560> spleen<00:01:56.000> seven<00:01:57.000> eight<00:01:57.119> nine

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
is an enlarged spleen seven eight nine

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.959 
is an enlarged spleen seven eight nine
point<00:01:57.689> two<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.890> proper<00:01:59.280> code<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.729> use

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
point two that's the proper code to use

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.300 
point two that's the proper code to use
now<00:02:00.539> I've<00:02:00.659> got<00:02:00.899> some<00:02:01.109> more<00:02:01.229> examples<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.100> you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
now I've got some more examples for you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.550 
now I've got some more examples for you
so<00:02:02.939> we'll<00:02:03.090> scroll<00:02:03.479> down<00:02:03.539> and<00:02:04.079> look<00:02:04.170> at<00:02:04.320> some<00:02:04.530> of

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
so we'll scroll down and look at some of

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
so we'll scroll down and look at some of
these<00:02:04.740> others<00:02:05.159> okay<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.179> your<00:02:06.390> physician

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
these others okay if your physician

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.400 
these others okay if your physician
documents<00:02:07.679> something<00:02:08.460> like<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.970> mrs.<00:02:09.899> Jones

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
documents something like this mrs. Jones

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.460 
documents something like this mrs. Jones
is<00:02:10.770> seen<00:02:11.490> today<00:02:11.880> with<00:02:12.180> lower<00:02:12.480> abdominal<00:02:13.260> pain

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
is seen today with lower abdominal pain

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.680 
is seen today with lower abdominal pain
and<00:02:13.500> spotting<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.400> will<00:02:14.820> admit<00:02:15.210> her<00:02:15.420> for

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and spotting I will admit her for

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.040 
and spotting I will admit her for
threatening<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.740> threatens<00:02:17.430> miscarriage<00:02:18.270> okay

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
threatening a threatens miscarriage okay

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.320 
threatening a threatens miscarriage okay
so<00:02:19.530> you're<00:02:20.130> now<00:02:20.310> saying<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.790> yourself<00:02:21.150> well

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
so you're now saying to yourself well

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.940 
so you're now saying to yourself well
she<00:02:21.540> hasn't<00:02:21.690> had<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.960> miscarriage<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.710> hasn't

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
she hasn't had a miscarriage it hasn't

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.370 
she hasn't had a miscarriage it hasn't
happened<00:02:23.100> yet<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.030> actuality<00:02:24.570> there's<00:02:25.320> a

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
happened yet but in actuality there's a

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.460 
happened yet but in actuality there's a
code<00:02:25.770> for<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.400> because<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.630> such<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:27.990> common

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
code for this because it's such a common
