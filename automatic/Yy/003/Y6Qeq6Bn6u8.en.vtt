I<00:02:10.349> decided<00:02:11.349> that<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:12.250> was<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:12.939> get<00:02:13.090> back

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
I decided that I was going to get back

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.330 
I decided that I was going to get back
on<00:02:13.420> vitamins<00:02:13.959> now<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.200> did<00:02:14.409> some<00:02:14.620> research<00:02:15.099> and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
on vitamins now I did some research and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.830 
on vitamins now I did some research and
I<00:02:15.459> found<00:02:15.489> that<00:02:15.939> if<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.150> drink<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.689> certain

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
I found that if you drink a certain

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.960 
I found that if you drink a certain
amount<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.260> water<00:02:17.560> with<00:02:17.829> your<00:02:17.950> biotin<00:02:18.489> you

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
amount of water with your biotin you

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.690 
amount of water with your biotin you
take<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.209> lower<00:02:19.659> dosage<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.680> biotin<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
take a lower dosage of biotin and you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.600 
take a lower dosage of biotin and you
take<00:02:21.939> it<00:02:22.090> with<00:02:22.329> other<00:02:22.599> supplements<00:02:23.260> then<00:02:24.250> that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
take it with other supplements then that

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.649 
take it with other supplements then that
can<00:02:24.970> prevent<00:02:25.620> breakouts<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:28.000> my<00:02:28.150> skin<00:02:28.450> is

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
can prevent breakouts so my skin is

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.619 
can prevent breakouts so my skin is
clearing<00:02:29.140> up<00:02:29.260> nicely<00:02:29.319> now<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.519> start<00:02:31.359> a<00:02:31.480> new

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
clearing up nicely now I start a new

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.649 
clearing up nicely now I start a new
skincare<00:02:32.019> regimen<00:02:32.769> if<00:02:33.040> anyone<00:02:33.609> can't<00:02:34.390> even

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
the pills that I'm taking now is the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.119 
the pills that I'm taking now is the
biotin<00:03:04.989> by<00:03:05.200> Spring<00:03:05.799> Valley<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.299> in

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
biotin by Spring Valley and this is in

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.610 
biotin by Spring Valley and this is in
five<00:03:09.129> thousand<00:03:09.730> micrograms<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:11.189> also<00:03:12.189> have

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
five thousand micrograms I also have

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.250 
five thousand micrograms I also have
this<00:03:14.620> biotin<00:03:15.310> gold<00:03:15.669> by<00:03:16.090> neutral<00:03:16.510> gold<00:03:16.690> and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
this biotin gold by neutral gold and

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.589 
this biotin gold by neutral gold and
this<00:03:17.739> is<00:03:17.949> the<00:03:18.400> also<00:03:18.609> five<00:03:19.060> thousand

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
this is the also five thousand

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.080 
this is the also five thousand
micrograms<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.530> don't<00:03:21.430> know<00:03:21.609> the<00:03:21.940> difference

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
micrograms I don't know the difference

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.339 
micrograms I don't know the difference
between<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.870> two<00:03:23.079> but<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:25.319> had<00:03:26.319> a

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
between the two but I just I had a

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.930 
between the two but I just I had a
feeling<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:26.859> if<00:03:27.069> I<00:03:27.159> took<00:03:27.430> these<00:03:27.579> because

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
feeling that if I took these because

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.210 
feeling that if I took these because
these<00:03:28.120> are<00:03:28.329> like<00:03:28.449> big<00:03:28.709> capsules<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:29.919> I<00:03:30.010> had<00:03:30.190> a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
these are like big capsules and I had a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.059 
these are like big capsules and I had a
feeling<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.730> if<00:03:30.879> I<00:03:31.000> took<00:03:31.060> needs<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.810> was<00:03:32.739> more

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
feeling that if I took needs I was more

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.220 
feeling that if I took needs I was more
likely<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.489> break<00:03:33.970> out<00:03:34.389> because<00:03:34.989> they<00:03:35.169> were

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
likely to break out because they were

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.050 
likely to break out because they were
bigger<00:03:35.650> even<00:03:36.010> though<00:03:36.190> they're<00:03:36.370> both<00:03:36.400> five

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
bigger even though they're both five

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.819 
bigger even though they're both five
thousand<00:03:37.569> micrograms<00:03:37.810> which<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.680> it's

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
thousand micrograms which so it's

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.530 
thousand micrograms which so it's
probably<00:03:39.129> not<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.370> difference<00:03:39.909> but<00:03:40.090> these<00:03:40.329> are

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
probably not a difference but these are

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.319 
probably not a difference but these are
much<00:03:40.720> easier<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.859> swallow<00:03:42.129> if<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.639> can<00:03:42.849> see

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
much easier to swallow if you can see

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.000 
much easier to swallow if you can see
them<00:03:43.569> they<00:03:43.720> almost<00:03:43.840> gone<00:03:44.139> but<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.500> have<00:03:44.620> more

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
them they almost gone but I have more

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.610 
them they almost gone but I have more
upstairs<00:03:45.609> just<00:03:46.209> showing<00:03:46.449> you<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.659> bottle<00:03:46.989> so

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
upstairs just showing you the bottle so

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.589 
upstairs just showing you the bottle so
I<00:03:47.979> just<00:03:48.310> started<00:03:48.669> taking<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:49.030> again<00:03:49.150> yesterday

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
I just started taking it again yesterday

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.680 
I just started taking it again yesterday
so<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.859> course<00:03:51.099> I'm<00:03:51.220> not<00:03:51.340> seeing<00:03:51.639> results<00:03:51.909> just

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
so of course I'm not seeing results just

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.069 
so of course I'm not seeing results just
yet<00:03:53.109> but<00:03:53.949> I<00:03:54.159> will<00:03:54.459> be<00:03:54.729> doing<00:03:54.970> an<00:03:55.239> update<00:03:55.419> after

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
yet but I will be doing an update after

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.860

I um start taking more them and I

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.360 
I um start taking more them and I
probably<00:03:59.109> will<00:03:59.319> try<00:03:59.560> these<00:03:59.620> out<00:03:59.919> and<00:04:00.099> let<00:04:00.250> you

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
probably will try these out and let you

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.939 
probably will try these out and let you
guys<00:04:00.489> know<00:04:00.549> what<00:04:00.909> I<00:04:00.940> think<00:04:01.239> about<00:04:01.449> them<00:04:02.049> also
