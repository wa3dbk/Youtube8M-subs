00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
out but what stood out to me is the fact

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.799 
out but what stood out to me is the fact
that<00:00:40.930> they<00:00:41.110> said<00:00:41.320> your<00:00:41.469> journey<00:00:41.860> begins<00:00:42.370> in

that they said your journey begins in
2014<00:00:43.809> now<00:00:44.440> I<00:00:44.469> take<00:00:44.860> this<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.280> mean<00:00:45.489> that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
2014 now I take this to mean that

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.260 
2014 now I take this to mean that
there's<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.090> very<00:00:46.480> good<00:00:46.660> possibility

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
there's a very good possibility

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.029 
there's a very good possibility
obviously<00:00:49.270> that<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.020> TV<00:00:50.230> show<00:00:50.680> will<00:00:50.920> be

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
obviously that the TV show will be

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.290 
obviously that the TV show will be
releasing<00:00:51.809> shortly<00:00:52.809> after<00:00:53.379> e3<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.910> I<00:00:54.940> could

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
releasing shortly after e3 now I could

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.389 
releasing shortly after e3 now I could
be<00:00:55.449> wrong<00:00:55.629> about<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:55.960> they<00:00:56.440> could<00:00:56.770> also<00:00:57.039> be

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
be wrong about that they could also be

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.420
