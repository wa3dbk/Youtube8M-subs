00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 and then to the personal beauty and well gc 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.840
 welcome to another video tutorial today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.059
 is teaching you to increase and there is 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.559
 performance of your processor then 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.660
 increasing processor performance 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.020
 your computer will be more optimized 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.970
 It will be faster then remembering it. 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.990
 that this method we will use to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.310
 reduce by 11% of life around your 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.529
 your computer's processor from your 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.960
 notebook here in my case here that I am 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.820
 recording with notebook then lifetime 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.920
 of his past is already reduced 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.510
 I 've been using this for a long time. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.629
 It's been a long time since I 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.360
 I bought it I use this method that does not 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.620
 I was using it here now so you did not 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.850
 I came here in the start menu 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.640
 settings is here and you 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.469
 confirm you will click on 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.420
 start this configuration window from the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.500
 system the case if you have windows 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.719
 xp 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.629
 You will see here in the run that they 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.400
 ip executes in case executed in xp already 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.170
 Appears there when you say 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.689
 click the home menu and it appears here 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.820
 on the side then you will see executed and 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.909
 windows can dictate ms with the child goes 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.930
 click ok here and it will start this 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.580
 window 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.170
 here returning to the tutorial that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.200
 system setup 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 you will now see that in the second option 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.479
 system startup 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.400
 then advanced options and here the number 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.740
 processors'm already using the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.220
 you will be like turn off will be 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.009
 so it's a disabled one 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.170
 you will activate and compared the number of 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.970
 maximum of processors that your pc is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.740
 contains mine has two 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.369
 I leave at the most 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.860
 2 if you have a pc with four cores and 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.450
 then there will be four processors if 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.930
 puts three never talked to the maximum and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.170
 my cause is little I use the maximum 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.119
 so that's basically what you achieve. 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.640
 maximum number of processors in the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:13.620
 If you have two sets of the same 2 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:16.110
 ok ok let's apply and exit without rebooting 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.489
 Then there is another stop here for you. 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.819
 you do not even trade manager of 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.280
 tasks you will get it here this 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.110
 processes running with the manager 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.360
 task 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.850
 you will see who displays the third 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.040
 options to be an option 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.250
 speed you will put high of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.569
 You're going to be normal, you get high and 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.150
 That's it 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.459
 are some methods there to increase the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.370
 performance of the PC that ends up 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.590
 pc performance you putting the maximum 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.540
 of processors and here the manager 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.380
 of tasks you leave high 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.390
 velocity 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.680
 interesting the guys until the next 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.570
 tutorial video 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.730
