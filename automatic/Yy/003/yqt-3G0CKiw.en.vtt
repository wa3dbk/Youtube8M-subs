00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.220
 so hello everyone and I am often asked 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.870
 how do i record the tap of my ios devices 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.820
 today decided to talk about it because 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.530
 that I'm sick of answering everyone for one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.080
 the same question go to the site 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.570
 apb.com reflector and download either 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.789
 trial version or pay full 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.949
 version which costs $ 15 after 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.689
 how you installed the program you can 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.939
 Immediately get to work let's 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.980
 continue then go to my group 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.949
 VKontakte and download the template 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.109
 go to the device you need 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.600
 photoshop choose a background which 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.100
 want this choose some sort of top 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 put the wound you need 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.280
 devices basically everything is easy and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.739
 it is clear then we should run 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.079
 the program is also worth replacing that 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.480
 function supports ipad 2 3 4 mini 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.110
 iphone 4s iphone 5 and ipod touch fifth 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.840
 generations 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 next you need to go multitasking and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.199
 perform all the same actions that I do 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.180
 I am now after this image 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.879
 will automatically appear on your screen 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.770
 computer after turning on you can 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.780
 turn on or off the frame device 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.280
 also make her white or black but us 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.420
 it is not needed because we act 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.420
 more professional 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.270
 after we hit the start button 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:25.950
 recording starts recording well 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:27.990
 let's see after the end of the recording 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.790
 we can save anywhere our 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:37.800
 computer and so gentlemen 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.770
 now we take our and footage 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.040
 video material harvested photo object 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.590
 and go video editors in this case 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.480
 This is a cad pro x file but you can use it. 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.550
 also something like sony vegas pro and 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.980
 just push them all up 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.960
 size but the main thing that everything was clear 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.000
 now I just sped it all up 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.730
 look but there again, everything is very 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 it's easy even any person who can 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.200
 use video editor will understand 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.460
 and if you do not know how to use 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.270
 don't even plan a video editor 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.270
 shoot video 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:25.349
 and so here at the end you have an example of what 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.310
 should in theory you get black 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.349
 stripes on the sides 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.650
 because I chose the picture is not in 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.629
 train so look for 1920 to 1080 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.670
