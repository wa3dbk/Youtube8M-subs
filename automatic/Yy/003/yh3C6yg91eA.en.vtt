00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 the psn digital games digital games a 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.010
 from 30 reais 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.020
 links in the description speaks galera brazuca 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.160
 bruno goes today bringing here another 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.000
 video of gta for ps4 I'm already here 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.929
 with franklin to do the test of the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 submarine in first person I bought 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.430
 this franklin type property and has the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.170
 submarine here because here the hunting is 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.260
 waste 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.079
 I do not know if something from now is on the 9th 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.350
 so and so they have this submarine here 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.840
 and I'm going to show you today how 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.719
 He is the first person to put it here. 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:02.719
 in first person and there it is free 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.390
 there and we will never cancel this 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.939
 business here have to wait 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.710
 Because when you 're out there, we're 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.930
 here in first person 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.000
 when the submarine is out a part 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.189
 he stays in the third person 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.080
 So we kind of get completely 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.290

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.450
