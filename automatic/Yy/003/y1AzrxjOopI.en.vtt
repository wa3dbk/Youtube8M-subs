00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
how it sounds and obviously it's not you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.550 
how it sounds and obviously it's not you
know<00:01:11.720> completely<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> mark<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.350> wouldn't

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
know completely on the mark I wouldn't

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
know completely on the mark I wouldn't
even<00:01:13.740> begin<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> say<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.640> near<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> model

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
even begin to say it was near the model

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.560 
even begin to say it was near the model
but<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> good<00:01:16.409> compromise<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.570> it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
but it is a good compromise and it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
but it is a good compromise and it
sounds<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> little<00:01:19.680> bit<00:01:19.950> more<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.460> Chad<00:01:20.850> Vader

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
sounds a little bit more like Chad Vader

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.179 
sounds a little bit more like Chad Vader
than<00:01:21.810> Darth<00:01:22.080> Vader<00:01:22.380> which<00:01:22.530> isn't<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.979> bad<00:01:23.130> thing

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
than Darth Vader which isn't a bad thing

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.070 
than Darth Vader which isn't a bad thing
so<00:01:23.640> essentially<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:24.960> this

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
so essentially what you can do with this

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
so essentially what you can do with this
voice<00:01:25.259> unit<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.770> bother<00:01:26.009> making<00:01:26.189> or<00:01:26.460> doing

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
voice unit if you bother making or doing

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340 
voice unit if you bother making or doing

show<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.810> voice<00:01:39.930> unit<00:01:40.640> yes<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.909> before

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
show you the voice unit yes and before

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480 
show you the voice unit yes and before
you<00:01:42.329> say<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.200> Darth<00:01:43.590> Vader<00:01:43.740> helmet<00:01:44.250> in

you say that is a Darth Vader helmet in

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.920 
you say that is a Darth Vader helmet in
the<00:01:44.579> background<00:01:45.060> I'm<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.420> use<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.750> for

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the background I'm going to use that for

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
the background I'm going to use that for
purposes<00:01:46.110> when<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> use<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> voice<00:01:47.130> unit<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
purposes when I use the voice unit to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.520 
purposes when I use the voice unit to
give<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> some<00:01:48.360> idea<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.140> work<00:01:49.320> with

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
give you some idea what it can work with

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.800 
give you some idea what it can work with
conjunction<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> helmet<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.810> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
conjunction with the helmet right you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.840 
conjunction with the helmet right you
understand<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.500> okay<00:01:53.189> now<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.549> didn't

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
understand that okay now if you didn't

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.600 
understand that okay now if you didn't
let's<00:01:54.000> carry<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.500> now<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> speaker<00:01:56.189> I've

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
let's carry on now for the speaker I've

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.580 
let's carry on now for the speaker I've
used<00:01:57.329> this

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
used this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.260 
used this
okay<00:01:59.190> so<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> nice

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
okay so you can see that that's a nice

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.840 
okay so you can see that that's a nice
station<00:02:00.710> 11<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.830> double<00:02:02.220> one<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> docking

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
station 11 or double one it's a docking

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.789 
station 11 or double one it's a docking
station<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.240> an<00:02:03.450> iPod<00:02:03.720> but<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.960> takes<00:02:04.140> mp3

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
station for an iPod but it takes mp3

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.649 
station for an iPod but it takes mp3
players<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.060> see<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.390> particular

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
players so if you see this particular

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.359 
players so if you see this particular
unit<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.190> I've<00:02:08.340> used

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
unit this is the one that I've used

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.669 
unit this is the one that I've used
purely<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> basis<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> has<00:02:10.110> six<00:02:10.470> for

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
purely on the basis it has six for

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.550 
purely on the basis it has six for
output<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.819> extremely<00:02:12.330> flat<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.440> it's

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
output and it's extremely flat so it's

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.380 
output and it's extremely flat so it's
going<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.770> sit<00:02:14.069> underneath<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.000> chest<00:02:15.239> plate

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
going to sit underneath the chest plate

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.840 
going to sit underneath the chest plate
and<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.140> fits<00:02:16.410> perfectly<00:02:16.920> because<00:02:17.160> I've<00:02:17.610> tried

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
and it fits perfectly because I've tried

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.670 
and it fits perfectly because I've tried
it<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.900> was<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.020> bit<00:02:19.200> one<00:02:19.319> kids<00:02:19.530> nice

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
it and that was a bit one kids nice

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.640 
it and that was a bit one kids nice
bring<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.100> up<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> one

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
bring it up like that so this is the one

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.530 
bring it up like that so this is the one
to<00:02:22.800> go<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.130> or<00:02:23.310> anything<00:02:23.610> else<00:02:23.940> along<00:02:24.239> similar

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
to go for or anything else along similar

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.870 
to go for or anything else along similar
lines<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.200> as<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.770> said<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.190> has<00:02:26.370> six<00:02:26.700> watt

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
lines and as I said this has six watt

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.660 
lines and as I said this has six watt
output<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.020> stereo<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:28.950> perfect

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
output and it's stereo so it's perfect

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.610 
output and it's stereo so it's perfect
because<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:30.060> flat<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> one

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
because it's flat so this is the one

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.080 
because it's flat so this is the one
that<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.769> choose<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.400> use<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.610> mean<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:32.970> can

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
that I choose to use I mean if you can

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.090 
that I choose to use I mean if you can
get<00:02:33.209> one<00:02:33.360> more<00:02:33.390> power<00:02:33.720> fine<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:34.290> six<00:02:34.860> what<00:02:35.070> I

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
get one more power fine but six what I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.500 
get one more power fine but six what I
would<00:02:35.340> say<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> bare<00:02:35.880> minimum<00:02:35.910> because

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
would say is the bare minimum because

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.750 
would say is the bare minimum because
you<00:02:36.630> want<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.140> boys<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.410> stand<00:02:37.980> out<00:02:38.220> prominent

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
you want the boys to stand out prominent

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.400 
you want the boys to stand out prominent
I've<00:02:39.180> always<00:02:39.480> what<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> do<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.230> get<00:02:40.350> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I've always what you do is you get a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.220 
I've always what you do is you get a
problem<00:02:40.650> where<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.130> either<00:02:41.280> echoes<00:02:42.120> or<00:02:42.660> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
problem where it either echoes or the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.020 
problem where it either echoes or the
voice<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.160> louder<00:02:44.489> than<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.790> actual

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
voice of you is louder than the actual

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.780 
voice of you is louder than the actual
amplified<00:02:45.630> version<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.530> doesn't<00:02:46.860> work<00:02:47.010> so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
amplified version so it doesn't work so

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.280 
amplified version so it doesn't work so
people<00:02:47.940> can<00:02:48.150> hear<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.480> talking<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.080> little

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
people can hear you talking it is little

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.630 
people can hear you talking it is little
timing<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.709> we<00:02:49.739> squeak<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.250> background

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
timing that we squeak in the background

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.670 
timing that we squeak in the background
which<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> amplified<00:02:51.510> version<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:52.380> need

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
which is the amplified version you need

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.770 
which is the amplified version you need
at<00:02:52.920> least<00:02:52.950> six<00:02:53.489> watts<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.060> that's<00:02:54.600> what<00:02:54.750> I

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
at least six watts so that's what I

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.900 
at least six watts so that's what I
recommend<00:02:55.260> using<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.550> other<00:02:56.670> bizarre

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
recommend using and the other bizarre

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.290 
recommend using and the other bizarre
thing<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.840> what<00:02:57.989> I've<00:02:58.140> made<00:02:58.350> myself<00:02:58.590> is

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
thing this is what I've made myself is

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.190 
thing this is what I've made myself is
the<00:03:00.300> voice<00:03:00.450> unit<00:03:00.810> itself<00:03:01.670> which<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.329> now

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the voice unit itself which is that now

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.069 
the voice unit itself which is that now
is<00:03:04.560> thinking<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.040> yourself<00:03:05.400> what<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.269> hell<00:03:06.840> is

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
is thinking to yourself what the hell is

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.180 
is thinking to yourself what the hell is
that<00:03:07.140> thing

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
cylinder here and it's perfect so you

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.220 
cylinder here and it's perfect so you
can<00:03:41.340> see<00:03:41.519> this<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.760> all<00:03:41.910> Shawn<00:03:42.269> off<00:03:42.600> because

you need this for it to work but because

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.280 
you need this for it to work but because
I've<00:03:46.820> detached<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.120> speaker<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:49.019> I've<00:03:49.140> got

the<00:03:49.380> cables<00:03:49.739> running<00:03:50.040> outside<00:03:50.190> now<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.700> can't

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
the cables running outside now I can't

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.840 
the cables running outside now I can't
keep<00:03:51.420> this<00:03:51.720> piece<00:03:52.049> on<00:03:52.290> top<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.220> had<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.670> take

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
keep this piece on top so I had to take

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.420 
keep this piece on top so I had to take
it<00:03:53.880> off<00:03:54.120> cut<00:03:55.019> around<00:03:55.170> here<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.340> can

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
it off cut around here so that I can

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.310 
it off cut around here so that I can
screw<00:03:56.820> this<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.390> there's<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.660> screw<00:03:57.989> that

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
screw this back in there's a screw that

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.380 
screw this back in there's a screw that
comes<00:03:58.530> through<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.799> center<00:03:59.160> here<00:03:59.400> this<00:04:00.150> bit

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
comes through the center here this bit

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.720 
comes through the center here this bit
pulls<00:04:00.660> off<00:04:00.989> enabling<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.160> unscrew<00:04:02.670> it

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
pulls off enabling you to unscrew it

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.910 
pulls off enabling you to unscrew it
from<00:04:02.820> here<00:04:03.269> because<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.109> sits<00:04:04.350> round<00:04:04.709> there

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
from here because it sits round there

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.759 
from here because it sits round there
like<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.840> snap<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.989> all<00:04:07.110> off<00:04:07.290> like<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.590> do<00:04:07.650> with

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
like that snap it all off like I do with

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.009 
like that snap it all off like I do with
a<00:04:07.860> pair<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.099> pliers<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.610> reattach<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:09.930> you

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
a pair of pliers and reattach it so you

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.720 
a pair of pliers and reattach it so you
have<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.260> whole<00:04:10.379> thing<00:04:10.440> open

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
have the whole thing open

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.260 
have the whole thing open
the<00:04:11.910> mic<00:04:12.120> itself<00:04:12.840> works<00:04:13.650> relatively<00:04:14.310> well<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
the mic itself works relatively well the

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.520 
the mic itself works relatively well the
only<00:04:15.450> thing<00:04:15.569> I<00:04:15.660> did<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:15.900> put<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.109> little<00:04:16.320> bit<00:04:16.440> of

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
only thing I did is put a little bit of

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.840 
only thing I did is put a little bit of
foam<00:04:16.709> on<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.950> because<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.280> tends<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.579> get<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.790> bit

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
foam on it because it tends to get a bit

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.580 
foam on it because it tends to get a bit
of<00:04:17.970> feedback<00:04:18.269> on<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.750> other<00:04:19.139> than<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.500> it's

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
of feedback on it other than that it's

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.960 
of feedback on it other than that it's
fine<00:04:19.769> don't<00:04:20.100> get<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.370> too<00:04:20.489> close<00:04:20.730> to<00:04:20.880> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
fine don't get it too close to the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.030 
fine don't get it too close to the
speaker<00:04:21.060> as<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.109> said<00:04:22.290> all<00:04:22.380> your<00:04:22.530> we'll<00:04:22.770> get
