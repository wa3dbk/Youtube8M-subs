00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:08.220

 you there mumbai that has few videos on 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.630
 Internet 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.859
 is a fugue said that the model 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.720
 tahoe 1.0 from my tahoe the top of the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.990
 category 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.880
 it comes with 30 speeds that said 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:32.480
 integer of hori xt of the exchangers asks 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.480
 can check there 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:47.550
 she also told you that brown 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:50.460
 acid Orion Model aspect oil has 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 this piece that wants carbon and the rest 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.420
 of the material also aluminum it comes here 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.969
 with this regulation also right and he 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:09.479
 It has a difference here that is the question 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:12.360
 of the discs are two radial pistons and the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:19.650
 The front disc is 180 mm 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:27.330
 the rear 160 mm 160 mm 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:32.130
 the suspension is a shox rock budget is one 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.950
 re with the world bike very interesting 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 because she has suspension here 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.820
 suspension it actually has a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.369
 adjustment here that the return load 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.119
 you can slow down the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.420
 return of the suspension slower than in the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.930
 so has this drawing that a turtle 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:01.690
 or faster return you have another and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:06.510
 This is what you regulate here. 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:09.490
 a detail here so you can put the 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:14.410
 right and it has already been found already in 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.210
 guidom which is this system called here 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:28.110
 pop rock 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:31.800
 here you hang here you were right 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.800
 to 26 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.550
 All aluminum components are 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.280
 oval 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.380
 so I've been researching this company 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.140
 oval it produces is also material 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.330
 aerodynamics for Formula 1 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:56.770
 she is coming back now 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:03:01.560
