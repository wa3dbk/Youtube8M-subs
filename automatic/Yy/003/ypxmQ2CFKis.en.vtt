 which I will show you how

 create a shelf using belts 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.460
 so she's here right now that's me 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.260
 actually re-use them 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.699
 belts that are not often used in 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.930
 Anyway I hope you'll like it 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.939
 me it allowed me to rid 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.320
 completely my office that was in 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.060
 a brothel not possible 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.289
 here's go I'll let you look and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.289
 I hope that pleases you 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.140
 we start right away this new 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 tutorial with the list of material you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.290
 will need wooden planks 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.489
 identical according to the number of states 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.140
 manages that you want me so 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.789
 personally I have two of a pot of 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.350
 painting for wooden roulotte and a 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.579
 Brush sheets of newspaper 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 of several belts so me 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.149
 personally I have cloud cap or 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.100
 well screw of a hammer and a 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.140
 glass sheet we start with 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.870
 protect our work plan with our 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 sheets of newspaper 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.809
 then we get our leaf of 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.280
 glass we see coming rub the wood for 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.869
 remove the particles or the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.760
 splinters that may be present 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.570
 it will also allow painting 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.570
 to better hang 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.380
 then we go to painting and think 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.760
 stir them well before 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.760
 paint so that it is homogeneous 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.620
 so I take my roll and like you 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.090
 can see I used a 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.370
 grid to remove the excess of 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.630
 painting except for no big pie then 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.830
 I painted simply but 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.360
 planks of wood so I tried to 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.580
 do a little valerie method 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.050
 damidot for having made it to 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.460
 to say we made believe in first pass 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.590
 in one direction then in the other 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.510
 I also took my brush tips 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.920
 sharp because there are some scratches on one of 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.300
 sides of my board and so that's me 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.660
 allowed to paint indoors while 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.660
 simply 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.930
 when the painting state is over 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.460
 you celebrate at your boards laid on 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.590
 the slice that will be against the wall wants 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.610
 we do not need the end ah yes if 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.870
 you do not want to have hands 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.180
 Artists such as those to me that 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.800
 protect your hands with gloves and we 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.979
 will come in the wake clean our 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.979
 paint brushes 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.640
 then you have to prepare the wall that will 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.750
 welcome our trainee so we 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.750
 get rid of everything they have 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.140
 we take our wooden planks and we 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.860
 comes placed them against their eyes for 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.330
 see to the eye 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.980
 where would you like 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.440
 how far do we know them 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.180
 when we define all that we take our 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.980
 shouting and tracing control landmarks 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.930
 well with others and cair have made 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.490
 well lines perpendicular to the wall is 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.560
 make sure the shelves are diop 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.700
 parallel by measuring the gap that 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.700
 splits at multiple locations 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.950
 after all that we attack our 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.750
 belts so we made two duets in 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.520
 assembling two belts trains with 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.520
 the means of closure already present 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 and 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.090
 so we form a loop by closing 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.830
 each duo always using the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.720
 clasps that were already present and 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.250
 once flattened and closed it must 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.760
 try that our two duos be from the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.760
 same length 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.090
 then you take a first board 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.770
 and you go to slide a belt duo 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.210
 at each end so that the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.980
 board can be raised by the 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.510
 belts that serve as a link to this 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.130
 moment you are already thinking 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.140
 the final appearance you want your 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.370
 votes shelves and so you place them 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.260
 belts that you prefer that one 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.730
 sees ahead you have to position yourself 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.020
 please take your time and you 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.020
 nail the belts on the board 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.750
 but 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.459
 for the second boards you do the 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.170
 same step simply it just takes that 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.520
 you measured on your wall the distance 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.680
 that you had planned between each 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.060
 shelves and you report it on your 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.740
 belt so using a pen you 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.050
 make landmarks and you key the 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.370
 board in the right place and you will 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.300
 always make sure that is worth two and 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.300
 elsewhere are well parallel 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.830
 when everything is nailed your shelves are 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.750
 Completed it remains only in the 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.310
 hang against the wall I will not you 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.960
 lying is really the step with 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.700
 which I struggled because I was everything 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.960
 only to install them so go 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.880
 ask someone for help 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.230
 moment there personally to help me 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.250
 a little bit I had supported different genres 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.260
 10 and on which I could do 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:50.950
 rest the weight of the shelf during 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.450
 that aclu to the wall nadal your shelves 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.130
 are installed it's very convenient in 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.960
 anyway and apart from the final break it's 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.550
 not complicated to do and so I hope 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.080
 the results please do not forget 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.370
 not to leave a little comment for 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.590

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.910

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.500
 remake frankly that would make me too 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.480

 info bar in all cases here 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.510
 for this tutorial do not forget that the most 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.919
 important is not what we have but 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.240
 what we do with what we have 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.860
 I kiss you very hard and I have 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.860
 sometimes fog date to lease
