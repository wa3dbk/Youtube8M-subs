00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
people we see here and we look at

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.470 
people we see here and we look at
through<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> crowd<00:00:23.210> 200<00:00:24.210> people<00:00:24.449> standing

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
through the crowd 200 people standing

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.640 
through the crowd 200 people standing
there<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:26.430> people<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.150> more<00:00:27.510> lean<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.320> not

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
there the people are more lean and not

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.749 
there the people are more lean and not
that<00:00:28.830> huge<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.699> before<00:00:30.470> we<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> big<00:00:32.489> hole

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that huge as before we have a big hole

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.600 
that huge as before we have a big hole
with<00:00:33.090> Jim<00:00:33.600> aesthetics<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.980> bar<00:00:35.190> stars

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
with Jim aesthetics and the bar stars

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.240 
with Jim aesthetics and the bar stars
and<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.170> think<00:00:37.440> are<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:38.010> two

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and so what do you think are there two

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
and so what do you think are there two
different<00:00:38.790> directions<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.719> bodybuilding<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
different directions in bodybuilding and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.819 
different directions in bodybuilding and
fitness<00:00:40.530> now<00:00:40.890> or<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:41.969> fit<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.739> think<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
fitness now or do they fit I think that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.119 
fitness now or do they fit I think that
it's<00:00:44.190> always<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.590> muscle<00:00:46.590> contest

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it's always going to be a muscle contest

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.090 
it's always going to be a muscle contest
and<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:48.030> think<00:00:48.450> history<00:00:49.079> has<00:00:49.110> proven<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.649> body

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and I think history has proven that body

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.970 
and I think history has proven that body
Berlin<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.520> evolved<00:00:51.000> over<00:00:51.059> time<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:52.110> yes<00:00:52.680> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
Berlin is evolved over time that yes I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.100 
Berlin is evolved over time that yes I
mean<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.969> people<00:00:54.270> speak<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> aesthetics

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
mean when people speak of aesthetics

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.660 
mean when people speak of aesthetics
they<00:00:55.260> usually<00:00:55.559> attributed<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.370> someone

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
they usually attributed to be someone

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.880 
they usually attributed to be someone
being<00:00:56.820> very<00:00:57.030> very<00:00:57.360> small<00:00:57.629> well<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.500> why<00:00:58.680> we

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
being very very small well that's why we

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.979 
being very very small well that's why we
have<00:00:59.129> different<00:00:59.520> categories<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.690> know<00:01:00.809> we

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
have different categories you know we

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.380 
have different categories you know we
also<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.949> category<00:01:02.910> called<00:01:03.059> men's

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
also have a category called men's

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.850 
also have a category called men's
physique<00:01:03.539> where<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
physique where you know you have a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
physique where you know you have a
little<00:01:05.220> bit<00:01:05.369> different<00:01:05.700> types<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.939> aesthetics

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
little bit different types of aesthetics

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.760 
little bit different types of aesthetics
as<00:01:06.570> opposed<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> bodybuilding<00:01:07.470> where<00:01:07.590> it's

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
as opposed to bodybuilding where it's

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.910 
as opposed to bodybuilding where it's
more<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.880> aesthetics<00:01:09.689> plus<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.770> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
more you know aesthetics plus a lot of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.510 
more you know aesthetics plus a lot of
muscle<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:14.340> know

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
muscle so you know I think you know

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.460 
muscle so you know I think you know
bodybuilding<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.390> still<00:01:15.659> strong<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.229> think

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
bodybuilding is still strong I think

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
bodybuilding is still strong I think
what<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.310> seeing<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
what we're seeing now is we get to see a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.090 
what we're seeing now is we get to see a
lot<00:01:18.750> more<00:01:18.810> muscle<00:01:19.380> than<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.619> did<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.830> years

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
lot more muscle than we did in years

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.950 
lot more muscle than we did in years
past<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.640> that's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.119> good<00:01:21.270> thing<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.750> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
past but that's a good thing this I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.770 
past but that's a good thing this I
don't<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.500> bad<00:01:22.650> thing<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.780> when

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
don't think it's a bad thing at all when

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.030 
don't think it's a bad thing at all when
you<00:01:24.869> hear<00:01:25.200> arnold<00:01:25.830> say<00:01:26.070> let's<00:01:27.680> take<00:01:28.680> more

bodybuilders that people want to look

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.969 
bodybuilders that people want to look
like<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.720> say<00:01:40.020> you're<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> kind<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
like what do you say you're a kind of

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
like what do you say you're a kind of
huge<00:01:41.189> guy<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:42.240> do<00:01:42.750> they<00:01:42.899> did<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.350> not

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
huge guy I think do they did they not

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.370 
huge guy I think do they did they not
like<00:01:43.829> dexter<00:01:44.310> jackson<00:01:44.840> do<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.079> dexter

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
like dexter jackson do you like dexter

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.770 
like dexter jackson do you like dexter
jackson<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.890> sure<00:01:47.189> ok<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:47.880> he<00:01:48.210> won<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> show

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
jackson right sure ok so he won the show

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.289 
jackson right sure ok so he won the show
so<00:01:49.439> i<00:01:49.470> think<00:01:49.619> what<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> fans<00:01:50.759> are<00:01:51.000> not

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so i think what the fans are not

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
so i think what the fans are not
realizing<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.229> i<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:52.799> believe<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
realizing is that i don't believe that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.670 
realizing is that i don't believe that
Arnold<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.229> talking<00:01:55.229> about<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> winner

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
Arnold was talking about the winner

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.560 
Arnold was talking about the winner
I<00:01:56.710> think<00:01:57.070> he<00:01:57.160> was<00:01:57.280> speaking<00:01:57.580> about<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.940> couple

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
I think he was speaking about a couple

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.470 
I think he was speaking about a couple
individuals<00:01:59.230> who<00:01:59.620> he<00:01:59.830> felt<00:02:00.160> should<00:02:00.880> have<00:02:01.000> been

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
individuals who he felt should have been

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.930 
individuals who he felt should have been

not a good champion that he had all

not a good champion that he had all
these<00:02:33.220> problems<00:02:33.700> then<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.330> understand

these problems then I can understand

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.449

where<00:02:34.840> he's<00:02:35.020> coming<00:02:35.050> from<00:02:35.320> but<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.040> think<00:02:36.370> he

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
where he's coming from but I think he

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.100 
where he's coming from but I think he
was<00:02:36.550> talking<00:02:36.880> about<00:02:36.970> people<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.900> weren't

even<00:02:38.320> in<00:02:38.410> top<00:02:38.620> five<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.970> think<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.600> fans

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
even in top five so I think the fans

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.290 
even in top five so I think the fans
have<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.170> keep<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.650> mind<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.300> it's

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:57.969 
reason for it every year someone says

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.240

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
something like that I think it's silly

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.360 
something like that I think it's silly
to<00:04:01.780> even<00:04:01.900> say<00:04:02.319> that<00:04:02.530> because<00:04:02.709> I've<00:04:03.040> heard<00:04:03.219> that

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
year and you know I do think there's a

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.819 
year and you know I do think there's a
limit<00:04:09.760> for<00:04:10.000> myself<00:04:10.989> now<00:04:11.349> was<00:04:11.379> more<00:04:11.739> of

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
limit for myself now was more of

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.300 
limit for myself now was more of
refinement<00:04:12.519> I<00:04:12.700> met<00:04:13.689> I'm<00:04:14.439> approaching<00:04:15.159> the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
refinement I met I'm approaching the

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.479 
refinement I met I'm approaching the
prime<00:04:15.609> of<00:04:15.640> my<00:04:15.849> career<00:04:16.000> I'm<00:04:16.930> in<00:04:17.169> my<00:04:17.440> mid-30s<00:04:18.070> I'm

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
prime of my career I'm in my mid-30s I'm

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.650 
prime of my career I'm in my mid-30s I'm
35<00:04:18.940> years<00:04:18.970> old<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:20.280> ronnie<00:04:21.280> coleman<00:04:21.609> was<00:04:21.880> 33

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
35 years old and ronnie coleman was 33

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.290 
35 years old and ronnie coleman was 33
when<00:04:22.870> he<00:04:23.259> won<00:04:23.470> his<00:04:23.620> first<00:04:23.949> mr.<00:04:24.280> Olympia<00:04:24.580> I'm<00:04:24.970> 30

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
when he won his first mr. Olympia I'm 30

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.230 
when he won his first mr. Olympia I'm 30
I<00:04:25.570> was<00:04:25.900> 34<00:04:26.440> winning<00:04:27.160> my<00:04:27.280> fourth<00:04:27.610> mr.<00:04:27.910> Olympia

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
I was 34 winning my fourth mr. Olympia

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.800 
I was 34 winning my fourth mr. Olympia
and<00:04:28.449> so<00:04:29.259> I<00:04:29.289> think<00:04:29.530> as<00:04:29.979> long<00:04:30.310> as<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.610> am<00:04:30.639> smart<00:04:31.210> I'm

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
and so I think as long as I am smart I'm

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.990 
and so I think as long as I am smart I'm
not<00:04:32.050> trying<00:04:32.289> to<00:04:32.500> gain<00:04:32.919> 20<00:04:33.340> pounds<00:04:33.370> or<00:04:33.820> 30

olympia at 2 235 okay so I wasn't a mass
guy<00:05:17.380> but<00:05:17.949> you<00:05:18.220> see<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.520> evolution<00:05:18.849> of<00:05:19.300> small

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
guy but you see the evolution of small

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.219 
guy but you see the evolution of small
gains<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:21.580> stay<00:05:21.940> condition<00:05:22.539> as<00:05:22.960> long<00:05:23.110> as

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
gains so you stay condition as long as

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.810 
gains so you stay condition as long as
we<00:05:23.349> see<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.620> conditioning<00:05:24.159> of<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.340> muscle<00:05:24.699> in

we see the conditioning of the muscle in

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.790 
we see the conditioning of the muscle in
the<00:05:24.880> separation<00:05:25.479> I<00:05:25.659> think<00:05:26.139> we'll<00:05:26.530> always<00:05:26.650> have

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
the separation I think we'll always have

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.860 
the separation I think we'll always have
good<00:05:27.070> bodybuilding<00:05:27.669> when<00:05:28.240> we<00:05:28.389> start<00:05:28.630> seeing

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
good bodybuilding when we start seeing

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.070 
good bodybuilding when we start seeing
bad<00:05:29.560> separation<00:05:30.310> no<00:05:30.580> no<00:05:30.880> cuts<00:05:31.240> at<00:05:31.479> all<00:05:31.630> that's

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
bad separation no no cuts at all that's

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.790
