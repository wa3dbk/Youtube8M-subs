last 11 years my job basically is to
take<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> guitar<00:00:11.040> from<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> assembler<00:00:13.400> just

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
take the guitar from the assembler just

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.890 
take the guitar from the assembler just
basically<00:00:14.730> double-check<00:00:15.330> everything<00:00:15.630> that

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
basically double-check everything that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
basically double-check everything that
the<00:00:15.990> assembler<00:00:16.440> did<00:00:16.680> make<00:00:17.340> sure<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.640> it's

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
the assembler did make sure that it's

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.340 
the assembler did make sure that it's
all<00:00:17.940> good<00:00:18.180> all<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.449> specs<00:00:18.779> are<00:00:18.990> correct

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
all good all the specs are correct

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.230 
all good all the specs are correct
because<00:00:20.010> I'm<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> last<00:00:20.460> stop<00:00:20.789> before<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.210> gets

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
because I'm the last stop before it gets

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.810 
because I'm the last stop before it gets
into<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> case<00:00:21.920> so<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.100> first<00:00:23.310> thing<00:00:23.490> I'll<00:00:23.640> do

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
into a case so the first thing I'll do

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.620 
into a case so the first thing I'll do
is<00:00:24.029> grab<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> guitar<00:00:24.510> out<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> rack<00:00:26.630> we're

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
is grab a guitar out of the rack we're

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.830

I'll do is check the mock cat sticker

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
I'll do is check the mock cat sticker
make<00:00:44.100> sure<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.460> everything<00:00:44.879> matches<00:00:45.030> up

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
make sure that everything matches up

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.889 
make sure that everything matches up

just<00:00:58.609> looking<00:00:59.609> over<00:00:59.850> everything

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
just looking over everything

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.740 
just looking over everything
make<00:01:00.629> sure<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> wiring<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.469> done<00:01:01.649> correctly

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
make sure the wiring is done correctly

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
make sure the wiring is done correctly
they<00:01:03.750> leave<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> backplate<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
they leave the backplate off so that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830 
they leave the backplate off so that
case<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.030> problem<00:01:06.240> needs<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> be

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
case there is a problem needs to be

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.510 
case there is a problem needs to be
fixed<00:01:07.200> either<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.890> fix<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.490> can

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
fixed either I can fix it or they can

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.270 
fixed either I can fix it or they can
fix<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.380> put<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> backplate<00:01:11.250> on

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
fix it and then I put the backplate on

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.960 
fix it and then I put the backplate on
before<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> send<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> case<00:01:13.790> after<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
before I send it to case after that

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.660 
before I send it to case after that
bring<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:16.850> take<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> look<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> nut

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
bring it in here take a look at the nut

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.740 
bring it in here take a look at the nut
make<00:01:20.670> sure<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.210> put<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.450> there

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
make sure that it's put on there

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.780 
make sure that it's put on there
correctly<00:01:21.930> there's<00:01:22.650> no<00:01:22.860> sloppy<00:01:23.400> glue<00:01:23.640> around

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
correctly there's no sloppy glue around

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.320

it or anything like that and the gaps I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.700 
it or anything like that and the gaps I
take<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> guitar<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> pulled<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
take the guitar and pulled it up to the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.010 
take the guitar and pulled it up to the
light<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> make<00:01:29.579> sure

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020

light just to make sure
no<00:01:30.259> gaps<00:01:31.869> good

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.310 

while<00:01:38.060> I'm<00:01:38.180> most<00:01:38.330> looking<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.780> bit<00:01:38.930> over<00:01:39.110> I<00:01:39.140> also

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
while I'm most looking a bit over I also

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.470 
while I'm most looking a bit over I also
look<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:39.680> see<00:01:39.830> make<00:01:40.280> sure<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.760> string

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
look to see make sure the string

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.690 
look to see make sure the string
orientation<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.290> correct

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
orientation is correct

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.410 
orientation is correct
pickup<00:01:44.300> rings<00:01:44.540> are<00:01:44.720> straight

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.399 

I'll<00:01:49.780> take<00:01:49.990> out<00:01:50.200> ruler

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I'll take out ruler

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.499 
I'll take out ruler
just<00:01:52.920> go<00:01:53.070> across<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> first<00:01:53.820> fret<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.210> make

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
just go across the first fret and make

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:03.490 
just go across the first fret and make
sure<00:01:54.749> that<00:01:56.479> instead<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> spoke

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.670 

it's<00:02:03.920> all<00:02:04.100> good<00:02:04.400> if<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.540> was<00:02:05.570> off<00:02:05.900> a<00:02:05.930> little<00:02:06.230> bit

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
it's all good if it was off a little bit

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.720 
it's all good if it was off a little bit
I<00:02:06.710> could<00:02:06.890> either<00:02:07.010> give<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.280> back<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.640> the

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
I could either give it back to the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.910 
I could either give it back to the
assembler<00:02:08.240> or<00:02:08.540> I<00:02:08.600> have<00:02:08.900> my<00:02:09.080> own<00:02:09.200> files<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.890> I

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
assembler or I have my own files and I

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.210 
assembler or I have my own files and I
can<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.220> fix<00:02:10.430> it<00:02:10.610> here<00:02:10.910> you've<00:02:11.270> done<00:02:11.450> with<00:02:11.660> it

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
can just fix it here you've done with it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.200 
can just fix it here you've done with it
after<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.250> look<00:02:13.490> at<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.670> nut<00:02:13.850> make<00:02:14.030> sure

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
after I look at the nut make sure

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.040 
after I look at the nut make sure
everything<00:02:14.600> is<00:02:14.630> good<00:02:15.020> there<00:02:16.330> down<00:02:17.330> here<00:02:17.360> make

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
everything is good there down here make

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.140 
everything is good there down here make
sure<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.620> knobs<00:02:18.860> turned<00:02:19.430> correctly<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.060> then

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
sure the knobs turned correctly and then

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.030 
sure the knobs turned correctly and then
on<00:02:20.270> scratching<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.900> top<00:02:22.210> loose<00:02:24.040> here

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
on scratching the top loose here

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.930 
on scratching the top loose here
properly<00:02:26.710> flip<00:02:27.710> it<00:02:27.830> over<00:02:27.920> look<00:02:28.340> at<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.580> input

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
properly flip it over look at the input

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.060 
properly flip it over look at the input
jack<00:02:28.970> make<00:02:29.540> sure<00:02:29.720> they<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.470> right<00:02:30.650> jack

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
jack make sure they have the right jack

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.740 
jack make sure they have the right jack
and<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:31.910> centered<00:02:32.240> properly

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.610 

after<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:38.870> while<00:02:39.870> I'm<00:02:39.990> looking<00:02:40.110> at<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> nut

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
after that while I'm looking at the nut

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.430 
after that while I'm looking at the nut
I'm<00:02:40.770> also<00:02:40.980> making<00:02:41.850> lifting<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.810> each<00:02:42.960> strength

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
I'm also making lifting of each strength

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.460 
I'm also making lifting of each strength
to<00:02:44.280> make<00:02:44.460> sure<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.450> doesn't<00:02:45.990> stick<00:02:46.440> in

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
to make sure that it doesn't stick in

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.190 
to make sure that it doesn't stick in
there<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.760> sticks<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> tremolo

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
there so if it sticks you have a tremolo

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.610 
there so if it sticks you have a tremolo
on<00:02:49.500> here<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.490> sticks<00:02:51.020> positive<00:02:52.020> not<00:02:52.320> staying

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
on here that sticks positive not staying

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.550 
on here that sticks positive not staying
tuned<00:02:52.890> properly<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.050> make<00:02:55.200> sure<00:02:55.380> those

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
tuned properly so just make sure those

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:04.429 
tuned properly so just make sure those
stick

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:19.830 

it's<00:03:05.439> our

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:40.440 

first<00:03:20.840> thing<00:03:21.019> I<00:03:21.139> do<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.469> tune<00:03:21.680> in<00:03:21.829> to<00:03:21.920> pinch

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.559 

at<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.080> point<00:03:41.349> I<00:03:41.470> make<00:03:41.650> sure<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:42.420> all<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
at this point I make sure that all the

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.630 
at this point I make sure that all the
electronics<00:03:43.659> work<00:03:44.319> properly<00:03:44.650> blind<00:03:45.459> not

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
electronics work properly blind not

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:59.559 
electronics work properly blind not
works<00:03:45.970> right

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:10.399 

to<00:04:00.569> make<00:04:00.720> sure<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.019> tap<00:04:01.290> works<00:04:09.409> another

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
to make sure the tap works another

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:11.869 
to make sure the tap works another
important<00:04:10.890> thing<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.220> make<00:04:11.489> sure<00:04:11.700> that

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
important thing is to make sure that

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:18.080 
important thing is to make sure that
each<00:04:12.150> string<00:04:12.540> rings<00:04:12.840> out<00:04:13.080> clear<00:04:16.729> sometimes<00:04:17.729> if

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
each string rings out clear sometimes if

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.629 
each string rings out clear sometimes if
there's<00:04:18.440> stickiness<00:04:19.440> on<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> nut<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.190> play<00:04:20.609> a

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
there's stickiness on the nut you play a

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.240 
there's stickiness on the nut you play a
note<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.150> sounds<00:04:21.449> really<00:04:21.720> dead<00:04:21.989> just<00:04:22.889> go<00:04:23.040> back

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
note it sounds really dead just go back

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.560 
note it sounds really dead just go back
with<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.520> file<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.000> open<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.330> up<00:04:24.449> a<00:04:24.540> little

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
with the file and open it up a little

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.159 
with the file and open it up a little
bit

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
bit

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:31.909 
bit
usually<00:04:25.830> rings<00:04:26.040> out<00:04:26.250> pretty<00:04:26.490> clear<00:04:30.740> make<00:04:31.740> sure

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
usually rings out pretty clear make sure

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:41.980 
usually rings out pretty clear make sure
that<00:04:32.070> both<00:04:32.250> pickups<00:04:32.639> are<00:04:32.850> working<00:04:33.180> properly

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.070 

this<00:04:42.990> one<00:04:43.199> is<00:04:43.760> next<00:04:44.760> thing<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.120> would<00:04:45.270> do<00:04:45.479> is<00:04:45.900> to

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
this one is next thing I would do is to

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.520 
this one is next thing I would do is to
make<00:04:46.229> sure<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:47.900> there's<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.960> relief<00:04:49.229> in<00:04:49.440> the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
make sure that there's a relief in the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.750 
make sure that there's a relief in the
neck

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.240 

Paul<00:04:53.240> prefers<00:04:53.630> these<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:54.050> be<00:04:54.170> pretty<00:04:54.950> close<00:04:55.190> to

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
Paul prefers these to be pretty close to

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.540 
Paul prefers these to be pretty close to
flat<00:04:55.900> just<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:57.020> little<00:04:57.230> movement<00:04:57.410> here<00:05:00.550> you

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
flat just a little movement here you

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.950 
flat just a little movement here you
don't<00:05:01.640> want<00:05:01.850> to<00:05:01.940> totally<00:05:02.390> flat<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.720> little

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
don't want to totally flat a little

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.430 
don't want to totally flat a little
threat<00:05:03.380> out<00:05:03.640> or<00:05:04.640> if<00:05:04.730> it's<00:05:04.850> too<00:05:05.090> bowed<00:05:06.220> episode

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
threat out or if it's too bowed episode

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.420 
threat out or if it's too bowed episode
so<00:05:09.440> do<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.830> check<00:05:10.730> the<00:05:10.910> 12th<00:05:11.330> fret<00:05:11.480> height

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
so do that check the 12th fret height

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.810 
so do that check the 12th fret height
sure<00:05:13.430> these<00:05:13.730> are<00:05:13.910> all<00:05:14.060> correct

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.550 

if<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.300> was<00:05:19.450> higher<00:05:19.690> low<00:05:20.080> than<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.410> would<00:05:20.530> have

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
if it was higher low than I would have

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.340 
if it was higher low than I would have
to<00:05:20.770> adjust<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.220> bridge<00:05:21.520> or<00:05:21.790> the<00:05:21.820> saddles<00:05:22.360> to

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
to adjust the bridge or the saddles to

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.090 
to adjust the bridge or the saddles to
make<00:05:24.120> correct<00:05:25.120> height<00:05:25.360> there<00:05:26.280> after<00:05:27.280> that

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
make correct height there after that

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.490 
make correct height there after that
check<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.220> pickup<00:05:30.580> height<00:05:31.410> which<00:05:32.410> is

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
check the pickup height which is

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:44.460 
check the pickup height which is
important<00:05:33.070> to<00:05:33.190> get<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.430> right<00:05:33.460> sound<00:05:43.470> and

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
important to get the right sound and

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.620 
important to get the right sound and
after<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:44.830> I<00:05:44.890> just<00:05:45.040> basically<00:05:45.910> checked<00:05:46.480> the

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
after that I just basically checked the

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:58.010 
after that I just basically checked the
playability<00:05:47.080> of<00:05:47.470> it<00:05:47.620> should<00:05:48.240> no<00:05:49.240> dead<00:05:49.510> friends

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.510 

so<00:05:59.020> my<00:05:59.140> job<00:05:59.350> is<00:05:59.530> fun<00:05:59.710> I<00:05:59.770> get<00:06:00.010> to<00:06:00.100> sit<00:06:00.280> and<00:06:00.400> play
