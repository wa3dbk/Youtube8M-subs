00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
teeth and but one thing about it is

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.830 
teeth and but one thing about it is
usually<00:05:14.889> with<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.430> dark<00:05:15.819> lip<00:05:16.150> it'll<00:05:16.449> make<00:05:16.690> your

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
usually with a dark lip it'll make your

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.689 
usually with a dark lip it'll make your
teeth<00:05:17.139> um<00:05:17.349> they'll<00:05:17.949> make<00:05:18.129> them<00:05:18.250> look<00:05:18.340> wider

teeth um they'll make them look wider

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.330 
teeth um they'll make them look wider
