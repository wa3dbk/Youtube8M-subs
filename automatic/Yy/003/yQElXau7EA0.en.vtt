gonna start looking at some of the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.100 
gonna start looking at some of the
different<00:00:46.120> tools<00:00:46.300> that<00:00:46.480> we<00:00:46.600> can<00:00:46.870> use<00:00:47.079> to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
different tools that we can use to

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.069 
different tools that we can use to
highlight<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.040> draw<00:00:48.280> on<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.730> screen<00:00:49.030> so<00:00:49.960> our

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
highlight and draw on the screen so our

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.050 
highlight and draw on the screen so our
first<00:00:50.350> tool<00:00:50.590> here<00:00:50.920> is<00:00:51.010> a<00:00:51.040> pen<00:00:51.399> tool<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.940> we<00:00:52.030> can

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
first tool here is a pen tool and we can

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.660 
first tool here is a pen tool and we can
change<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:52.690> size<00:00:52.899> and<00:00:52.930> color<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.590> this<00:00:53.950> so

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
change the size and color of this so

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.100 
change the size and color of this so
maybe<00:00:54.910> we<00:00:55.030> want<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.360> highlight<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.899> different

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
maybe we want to highlight a different

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.830 
maybe we want to highlight a different
City<00:00:56.710> here<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:57.370> then<00:00:57.850> maybe<00:00:58.059> we<00:00:58.239> can<00:00:58.420> draw

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
City here and then maybe we can draw

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.569 
City here and then maybe we can draw
that<00:00:59.140> we're<00:00:59.260> going<00:00:59.410> over<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.920> this<00:01:00.010> other<00:01:00.250> town

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
that we're going over to this other town

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.250 
that we're going over to this other town
we<00:01:00.850> can<00:01:00.970> do<00:01:01.180> different<00:01:01.600> things<00:01:01.630> like<00:01:01.899> that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
we can do different things like that

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.799 
we can do different things like that
easily<00:01:02.860> we<00:01:03.489> also<00:01:03.670> have<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.119> option<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.659> use

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
easily we also have the option to use

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.380 
easily we also have the option to use
this<00:01:05.110> circle<00:01:05.560> tool<00:01:05.770> so<00:01:06.159> we<00:01:07.000> can<00:01:07.149> maybe

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
this circle tool so we can maybe

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.480 
this circle tool so we can maybe
highlight<00:01:07.750> Philadelphia<00:01:08.710> here<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.250> we<00:01:09.310> can

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
highlight Philadelphia here and we can

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.399 
highlight Philadelphia here and we can
change<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:10.000> size<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.600> thickness<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:11.260> the

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
change the size and thickness of the

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.990 
change the size and thickness of the
circle<00:01:11.830> so<00:01:11.860> maybe<00:01:12.220> we<00:01:12.400> want<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.640> make<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:12.940> a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
circle so maybe we want to make it a

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.880 
circle so maybe we want to make it a
little<00:01:13.180> bit<00:01:13.390> thinner<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:14.110> we<00:01:14.350> can<00:01:14.500> highlight

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
little bit thinner and we can highlight

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.969 
little bit thinner and we can highlight
a<00:01:14.950> different<00:01:15.150> City<00:01:16.150> there<00:01:16.479> we<00:01:17.290> can<00:01:17.470> clear<00:01:17.799> out

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
a different City there we can clear out

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.710 
a different City there we can clear out

clear drawings button our next option is
our<00:01:23.380> spotlight<00:01:23.890> tool<00:01:24.369> where<00:01:25.060> we<00:01:25.090> can

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
our spotlight tool where we can

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.260

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
spotlight anything on our screen you'll

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.460 
spotlight anything on our screen you'll
notice<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.810> it's<00:01:29.049> set<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.440> a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
notice that it's set to a

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.590 
notice that it's set to a
semi-transparent<00:01:30.130> color<00:01:30.670> which<00:01:31.270> is<00:01:31.420> really

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
semi-transparent color which is really

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.390 
semi-transparent color which is really
nice<00:01:31.930> because<00:01:32.170> we<00:01:32.470> can<00:01:32.500> still<00:01:32.890> see<00:01:33.159> what's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
nice because we can still see what's

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.460 
nice because we can still see what's
behind<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:34.510> if<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:34.750> want<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:34.990> change<00:01:35.260> that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
behind it and if we want to change that

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.289 
behind it and if we want to change that
color<00:01:35.740> we<00:01:35.950> can<00:01:36.100> just<00:01:36.280> go<00:01:36.430> over<00:01:36.580> here<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.240> we

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
color we can just go over here and we

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.820 
color we can just go over here and we
can<00:01:37.450> grab<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.689> different<00:01:37.960> color<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.500> maybe<00:01:38.619> we

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
can grab a different color so maybe we

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.410 
can grab a different color so maybe we
want<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.040> use<00:01:39.100> orange<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:39.970> we<00:01:40.030> want<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.299> make

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
want to use orange and we want to make

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.109 
want to use orange and we want to make
it<00:01:40.540> even<00:01:40.900> less<00:01:41.170> opaque<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.430> so<00:01:42.670> now<00:01:42.880> when<00:01:43.090> we

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
it even less opaque and so now when we

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.060 
it even less opaque and so now when we
do<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.510> we<00:01:43.630> can<00:01:43.810> see<00:01:44.049> even<00:01:44.260> more<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.860> map

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
do it we can see even more of the map

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.120 
do it we can see even more of the map
and<00:01:45.310> have<00:01:45.490> just<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:46.000> subtle<00:01:46.330> highlight<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.260> our

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
and have just a subtle highlight and our

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.580 
and have just a subtle highlight and our
last<00:01:48.369> tool<00:01:48.700> is<00:01:48.909> our<00:01:49.119> laser<00:01:49.479> tool<00:01:49.930> where<00:01:50.229> we<00:01:50.380> can

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
last tool is our laser tool where we can

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.130 
last tool is our laser tool where we can
use<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.950> laser<00:01:51.369> on<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.909> screen<00:01:52.240> now<00:01:52.840> this<00:01:52.960> is<00:01:53.110> a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
use a laser on the screen now this is a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.690 
use a laser on the screen now this is a
little<00:01:53.320> hard<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.799> see<00:01:53.950> with<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.130> green<00:01:54.490> color

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
little hard to see with the green color

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.399 
little hard to see with the green color
on<00:01:55.030> this<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.420> I'm<00:01:55.540> just<00:01:55.659> gonna<00:01:55.810> change<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:56.350> to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
on this so I'm just gonna change this to

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.770 
on this so I'm just gonna change this to
red<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.130> leave<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.820> opacity<00:01:58.150> up<00:01:58.570> at<00:01:58.750> a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
red and leave the opacity up at a

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.899 
red and leave the opacity up at a
hundred<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.530> so<00:01:59.799> now<00:01:59.950> we<00:02:00.009> can<00:02:00.250> see<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.670> laser

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
hundred and so now we can see that laser

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.690 
hundred and so now we can see that laser
pointer<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.659> we<00:02:01.750> can<00:02:02.049> change<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:03.070> size<00:02:03.250> if<00:02:03.549> we

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
pointer and we can change the size if we

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.730 
pointer and we can change the size if we
want<00:02:03.939> and<00:02:04.119> make<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.360> really<00:02:04.720> large<00:02:05.140> as<00:02:05.439> we're

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
want and make it really large as we're

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.499 
want and make it really large as we're
going<00:02:06.040> through<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.400> now<00:02:06.820> there's<00:02:07.030> an<00:02:07.119> option

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
going through it now there's an option

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.899 
going through it now there's an option
down<00:02:07.780> here<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.379> we<00:02:08.560> can<00:02:08.769> set<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.129> to<00:02:09.159> clear<00:02:09.700> on

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
down here that we can set it to clear on

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.149 
down here that we can set it to clear on
slide<00:02:10.360> change<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:11.049> let's<00:02:11.260> say<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:11.680> had<00:02:11.829> drawn

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
slide change so let's say we had drawn

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.589 
slide change so let's say we had drawn
on<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.489> map<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:12.790> I'm<00:02:13.060> going<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.239> draw<00:02:13.569> a

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
on this map so I'm going to draw a

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.650 
on this map so I'm going to draw a
couple<00:02:13.810> things<00:02:14.260> throw<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> circle<00:02:15.370> here<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.150> a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
couple things throw a circle here and a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.390 
couple things throw a circle here and a
circle<00:02:17.050> over<00:02:17.200> here

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
circle over here

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.920 
circle over here
then<00:02:18.549> we're<00:02:18.670> gonna<00:02:18.790> switch<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.540> seven

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
then we're gonna switch to this seven

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.899 
then we're gonna switch to this seven
letters<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> text<00:02:20.980> slide<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.549> when<00:02:21.640> we<00:02:21.730> switch

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
letters a text slide and when we switch

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.640 
letters a text slide and when we switch
to<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.329> it's<00:02:22.480> going<00:02:22.659> to<00:02:22.720> clear<00:02:23.110> out<00:02:23.290> our<00:02:23.319> tell

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
to it it's going to clear out our tell

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.330 
to it it's going to clear out our tell
astray<00:02:23.980> shion's

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
astray shion's

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.190 
astray shion's
and<00:02:24.459> now<00:02:24.879> we're<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.390> slide<00:02:25.659> that<00:02:25.689> we<00:02:26.019> can

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
and now we're on this slide that we can

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.869 
and now we're on this slide that we can
go<00:02:26.409> through<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.920> again<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.579> can<00:02:27.730> start

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
go through and again we can start

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.940 
go through and again we can start
highlighting<00:02:28.360> different<00:02:29.170> things<00:02:29.409> on<00:02:29.680> this

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
highlighting different things on this

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.949 
highlighting different things on this
slide<00:02:30.189> because<00:02:30.849> we<00:02:31.150> can<00:02:31.299> highlight<00:02:31.750> on

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
slide because we can highlight on

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.170 
slide because we can highlight on
anything<00:02:32.709> inside<00:02:33.099> propresenter<00:02:33.610> that's<00:02:34.030> on

anything inside propresenter that's on

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.330 
anything inside propresenter that's on
the<00:02:34.329> screen<00:02:34.510> not<00:02:34.870> just<00:02:34.930> graphics<00:02:35.920> we<00:02:36.099> can<00:02:36.250> do

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the screen not just graphics we can do

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.520 
the screen not just graphics we can do
it<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:36.549> top<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:36.970> text<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:37.510> we<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:38.019> even<00:02:38.260> do<00:02:38.500> it

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530
