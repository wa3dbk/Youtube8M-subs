storytelling device which is

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.550 
storytelling device which is
theoretically<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.750> awesome<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:43.290> support

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
theoretically is awesome I would support

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.200 
theoretically is awesome I would support
3d<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.159> used<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
3d if it was used as more of like a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.240 
3d if it was used as more of like a
movie<00:01:45.630> enhancing<00:01:46.290> experience<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.040> instead

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
movie enhancing experience but instead

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.280 
movie enhancing experience but instead
usually<00:01:47.729> all<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.630> being<00:01:48.869> used<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.170> a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
usually all I see is it being used as a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.109 
usually all I see is it being used as a
crutch<00:01:49.530> by<00:01:49.710> Hollywood<00:01:50.159> turn<00:01:50.579> out<00:01:50.729> really

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
crutch by Hollywood turn out really

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.210 
crutch by Hollywood turn out really
crappy<00:01:51.390> movies<00:01:51.840> yeah<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.409> 3d<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> fun

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
crappy movies yeah and I think 3d is fun

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.859 
crappy movies yeah and I think 3d is fun
in<00:01:53.369> certain<00:01:53.610> circumstances<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.659> I'm<00:01:54.750> at

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
in certain circumstances like if I'm at

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.330 
in certain circumstances like if I'm at
Disneyland<00:01:55.290> I'm<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> theme<00:01:56.070> park

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
Disneyland I'm going on a theme park

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.609 
Disneyland I'm going on a theme park
right<00:01:56.579> 3d<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> ton<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.479> fun<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.079> maybe<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.530> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
right 3d is a ton of fun and maybe if I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.080 
right 3d is a ton of fun and maybe if I
was<00:01:58.740> playing<00:01:58.890> video<00:01:59.250> games<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.670> would<00:01:59.790> be<00:01:59.909> more

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
was playing video games it would be more

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.450 
was playing video games it would be more
fun<00:02:00.119> too<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:00.840> when<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.229> comes<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.649> movies<00:02:02.070> not

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460
