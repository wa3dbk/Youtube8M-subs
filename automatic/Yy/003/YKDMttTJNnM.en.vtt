00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello short here before me put service 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.440
 rt and I have the trouble again 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.080
 made that try and have a look 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.089
 At Amazon there is a stylus 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.920
 and of course no pixel sensitive 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.340
 but only the steep in the stylus 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.650
 Also suitable for serviced is that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.029
 this thick style 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.730
 amazon is around 17 euros after 15 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.470
 This would have the pen of the three 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 you can have different tips there 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.750
 use different settings 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.829
 and I want a bit 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 Try around like the input 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.530
 specially prefetched works 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.930
 is working 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.280
 the stylus emulates your finger so 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.399
 make a finger and that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.600
 works pretty well that you can see 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:54.149
 that's pretty accurate and just like that 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.289
 it is natural with fingers 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.219
 the pen input then always 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.530
 function 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.010
 try it more and write 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.070
 For example, a test and man 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.299
 Looks like that is very choppy 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.210
 or some things are even 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:15.810
 not recognized where always other top 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.049
 Still, for example, this okay 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.259
 special service he will get better 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.380
 function 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.150
 there is still the third tower 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.159
 Let's do that too 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.009
 approach and pen that appears 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.810
 seems to work best 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.590
 but the writing is of course one 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.130
 perfect and I would say it suffices 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.909
 for reasonably readable entries 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.619
 you can not really be precise with that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.479
 So special things work in the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.369
 mathematics would need like 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.570
 some diagrams like though 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.130
 succeed as a sketch precise things 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.719
 challenging is another thing now 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.130
 the pen mode is set that's the way it is 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.890
 because now with the finger back on the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.950
 service at click on behave in the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.520
 pen mode has to change again 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.540
 move to the mode and then I can 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.890
 pen again 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.700
 that started to turn and then it is 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.650
 again this pinch to zoom gesture 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.069
 possible second donate always too 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.530
 It was murder euro 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.220
 cheaper and made the same again 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:34.859
 test what that looks like 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.540
 sorry, that should be a bit better 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.780
 work from typing is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.209
 of course a lot going on that a lot too 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.280
 wish to leave special then write 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.760
 a little bit weird today like me then 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.760
 it gets difficult it is common 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.250
 no comparison to this at all 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.409
 pen input which I am used to and which one 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.470
 I'm used to yes that's the pen 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.409
 from acom to my samsung tablet 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.750
 of samsung actively fits there is of course 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:08.189
 the pen input excellent even if 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.280
 You may not play so well 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:14.189
 but there you can see how beautiful 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.099
 exactly this pen works pixel 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:22.109
 sensitive it is not a problem at all 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:23.639
 to make exact and exact sketches here 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.940
 exactly to write exactly 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:30.120
 also to draw markets with the a 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.340
 Bisserl nimble on the way and 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.620
 could really exactly exactly things 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.419
 use the life which I actually at 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.729
 it's the song on this pen the most 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:41.010
 love is that is even a right 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:43.530
 has come that means she can immediately 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.269
 in the context menu enter this 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.949
 right-click is activated very quickly 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.629
 you always need more on the 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.439
 screen on it stay like that 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.729
 windows 8 is the case and what I am looking for 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.069
 the pen especially love him in the 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:01.949
 contrary to the built-in donor he 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:06.659
 that is included in the tablet 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:10.109
 this part is that of the accessory pen 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.519
 here also a radio function an end 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.430
 has and it is very very handy if 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.669
 You can get my things back immediately 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.560
 Clear 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.669
 the difference is that one now 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.880
 could of course try that is 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.510
 this pin this off at the pin to office 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.630
 bring but that is of course not 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.860
 when the digitizer a unit 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.820
 represents the pen and surface 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.610
 would have to fit together 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.190
 ok otherwise think is is quite 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.560
 This knobbly donor made this possible 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.400
 fingers emulate pens in class 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.470
 to use 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.390
 I think it's more in there 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.630
 direction marking things will go 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.190
 and that you are rather poor 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.450
 now really complete headlines 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.750
 i can write my very good good 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.480
 alternative 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.010
 of course cheaper too 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.770
 Of course you also have a huge problem 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.550
 the service rt can on no 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.350
 fire the handballs so support 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.960
 at the handball cumshot support becomes 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.870
 it is of the touch-surface is the 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.790
 input recognized but siekmann h that 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.290
 I actually wanted that is not it 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.270
 possible to write at the same time and 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.140
 to support the finger the palm 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.850
 support 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:27.460
 whereas this up here with my samsung 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.370
 No problem is what they do 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.560
 could reject the hand without problems 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.530
 he is now completely up and can 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.110
 then there at the same time write that 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.480
 makes sense the increased writing experience the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.560
 Write speed and is natural 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.190
 like on a paper we come 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.480
 crashed broke is always in the air 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.590
 then write 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:57.280
 well maybe we just look at those 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.630
 The world app to the wall app is the same 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.370
 of course possible that he has the pen 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:05.650
 It may be the case here 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.050
 cannabis you try that of course 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.380
 again the pen mode only with this 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.230
 radial menu must select so that then 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.580
 Of course it can be used as a pen again 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:20.650
 use 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:23.100
 and then that was the way again 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.510
 you have to give the menu again 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.070
 Only then I can choose again 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.720
 example different colors and so on 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.960
 continue to use that at all 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.139
 problem that also with color you write 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:40.599
 It looks like it's a bit 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:44.080
 shaky to write the whole thing well 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:47.469
 so far the pen input on microsoft 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.710
 surface rt with the knobbly pins 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:53.379
 it is, as I said, an interim solution 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.919
 but not really the perfect solution 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:07:02.139
 the perfect solution is just that 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:05.169
 Pens with extremely precise tip where I am 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.430
 then really exactly and exactly 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.240
 Maybe one last time 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.159
 to forget 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.659
 You can see it is very easy to have 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:13.240
 of course also with these digitizer 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:15.789
 a mouseover because it is very very 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.379
 is valuable if you see where you then 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:23.020
 to suspend before it touches down here 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:26.129
 the point with the off or even days 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:29.469
 put that there is just the tip 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:32.620
 the stylus good 

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:36.310
 Thank you very much for your audience 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:39.490
 Just ask me in the comment below 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.710
 and she will be glad if one 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:45.099
 a bit more in the direction of the 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:47.409
 school comes up with pen input 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:49.800
 tablets and pen input on microsoft 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:49.800
 immigrated
