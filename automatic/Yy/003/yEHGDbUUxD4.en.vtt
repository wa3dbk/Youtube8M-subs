00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.430
 part of our tradition was that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 processes were not very well controlled 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.930
 because the technology that is required is 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.240
 complex that's something we're going 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.520
 learning and that we are perfecting 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.090
 with the years in the project we were more 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.650
 there because we also did some 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.170
 optical tests at the institute of 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.190
 optical communication research that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.160
 It is normally the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.840
 semiconductors and chocolate although it's 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.480
 much more complex in its structure 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.510
 It also has periodic structures and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.880
 Crystalline bill us instead of 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.850
 have to do organoleptic tests or 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.440
 be a panel of experts that test 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.050
 these parameters and I put a 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.430
 qualification by means of a method 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.680
 optical we can know the proportion of 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.480
 crystals that there are of one over another and 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.210
 make estimates and that would be very 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.400
 interesting for any industry 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.640
 chocolate in the world can not by 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.140
 means of a device that is expensive 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.970
 they cost around 300 thousand pesos 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.490
 and be able to know the structure of the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.960
 chocolate 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.690
 in an instant to be able to know with much 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 certainty 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.140
 how many values of chocolates we made 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.010
 we did a lot of characterization of our 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.180
 product and viscosity fat profile 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.630
 improved the crystallization of 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.670
 chocolates we analyze processes 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.730
 we improve the shelf life of the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.410
 chocolates without filling the tablets 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:12.610
 solid at around 25% which is a 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.360
 very important impact and in the fillings 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.400
 around 15 and we settled 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.530
 some statistical procedures for 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.110
 this life estimate 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.180
 the project was all that we had 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.850
 quite successful we have a lot of work 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.790
 also to do as it is not easy 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.670
 but you learn to be very good at 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.370
 planning because the con a 7 asks for 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.980
 technical feasibility studies 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.560
 financial a business plan asks you 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.170
 that you know very well the state of the art 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.690
 that you do technological surveillance and you 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.670
 also asks for the project planning 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.960
 It also asks for efficiency because 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.330
 you have to do in a while 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.460
 if it is not for a project of this nature 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.780
 we had not contacted any certain 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.910
 research groups that already 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.880
 we are working for example here in 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.480
 san luis is the most important people in 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.760
 the study of liquid thanks of mexico 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.900
 globally they are very competitive what 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.120
 which makes us too 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.640
 competitive we do not maybe not 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.910
 we need to train those resources so 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.440
 important there could have been a transfer 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.620
 interesting of these of these resources 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.500
 humans of this knowledge 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.989
 we have the disks 100 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.030
 meters of the equipment that has the 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.840
 autonomous university and I think we join 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.030
 a very important group as they can 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.360
 make marks and you can do some 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.209
 brands like a split or more that have 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.739
 some impressive resources and it 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.450
 they acquired some technologies like them 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.810
 I'm talking, we developed some 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.940
 others the biggest impact 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.569
 'follow converts and immediately into the 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.819
 market and with measures to expand 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.819
 this type of projects open us the 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.209
 doors to what is a competitiveness 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.120
 but based on an added value or 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.220
 in really improving the profile of 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.560
 our products the life of nakl what 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.260
 that we offer our customers by 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.260
 medium of technological elements 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.730
