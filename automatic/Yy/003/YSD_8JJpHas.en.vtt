herping video yeah because like I said

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.919 
herping video yeah because like I said
last<00:00:08.490> night<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.000> work<00:00:09.990> all<00:00:10.460> freakin<00:00:11.460> day<00:00:11.929> but

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
last night I work all freakin day but

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.780 
last night I work all freakin day but
it's<00:00:13.290> supposed<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.620> rain<00:00:13.799> all<00:00:13.860> day<00:00:14.040> which<00:00:14.639> is

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
it's supposed to rain all day which is

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.930 
it's supposed to rain all day which is
good<00:00:14.940> for<00:00:14.969> two<00:00:15.269> reasons<00:00:15.619> one<00:00:16.619> because<00:00:17.400> it

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
good for two reasons one because it

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.970 
good for two reasons one because it
increases<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.779> chance<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.170> us<00:00:19.320> getting<00:00:19.350> busy

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
increases the chance of us getting busy

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.570 
increases the chance of us getting busy
and<00:00:20.189> too<00:00:21.090> it'll<00:00:21.750> raise<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.949> water<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.430> that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
and too it'll raise the water in that

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.340 
and too it'll raise the water in that
River<00:00:23.880> because<00:00:24.420> that's<00:00:24.600> probably<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:25.140> going

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
River because that's probably not going

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.779 
River because that's probably not going
tomorrow<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.099> if<00:00:26.160> you're<00:00:26.220> looking<00:00:26.310> forward<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
tomorrow so if you're looking forward to

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.720 
tomorrow so if you're looking forward to
that<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.960> water<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.500> then<00:00:28.920> they

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
that and the water is up then they

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.799 
that and the water is up then they
should<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:29.910> biting<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:30.929> good<00:00:31.160> so
