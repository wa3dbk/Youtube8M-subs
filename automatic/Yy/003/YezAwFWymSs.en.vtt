00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
named Nico 44 next tip did you know as

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.529 
named Nico 44 next tip did you know as
Karthus<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.700> you're<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.000> your<00:01:51.090> passive

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
Karthus when you're in your passive

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.600 
Karthus when you're in your passive
state<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.929> cannot<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:52.500> wards<00:01:52.860> down<00:01:53.069> but

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
state you cannot put wards down but

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.399 
state you cannot put wards down but
surprisingly<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.810> actually<00:01:55.170> put<00:01:55.289> your

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
surprisingly you can actually put your

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.169 
surprisingly you can actually put your
trinket<00:01:55.830> down<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:56.789> you're<00:01:56.970> in<00:01:57.149> your

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
trinket down so if you're in your

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.370 
trinket down so if you're in your
passive<00:01:57.569> state<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.229> that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
passive state and you do have that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.200 
passive state and you do have that
trinket<00:01:58.679> ward<00:01:59.009> might<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.310> well<00:01:59.369> use<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.700> since

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
trinket ward might as well use it since

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.180 
trinket ward might as well use it since
you<00:02:00.509> might<00:02:00.690> be<00:02:00.810> running<00:02:00.960> teleport<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.830> I

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
you might be running teleport and I

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.770 
you might be running teleport and I
guess<00:02:02.550> maybe<00:02:02.789> revive<00:02:03.239> and<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.479> want<00:02:03.629> to<00:02:03.690> get

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
guess maybe revive and you want to get

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.719 
guess maybe revive and you want to get
back<00:02:03.929> into<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.410> fight<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:05.129> of<00:02:05.310> course<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
back into that fight then of course you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.279 
back into that fight then of course you
can<00:02:05.879> do<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.300> or<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.690> course<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:06.989> you<00:02:07.080> have<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
can do so or of course if you have the

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.440 
can do so or of course if you have the
Farsight<00:02:07.800> orb<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.789> try<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.239> scout

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
Farsight orb then you can try and scout

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.699 
Farsight orb then you can try and scout
someone<00:02:09.750> who<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.929> low<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> set<00:02:10.590> up<00:02:10.679> for

in<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.810> ram<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.410> next<00:03:17.620> trick<00:03:17.739> is<00:03:17.860> going<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.099> be

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
in a ram the next trick is going to be

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.280 
in a ram the next trick is going to be
extending<00:03:18.849> cassadines<00:03:19.330> are<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.750> basically

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
extending cassadines are and basically

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.350 
extending cassadines are and basically
what<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.860> want<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.069> do<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.459> get<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.849> are<00:03:22.000> range

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
what you want to do is get the are range

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.750 
what you want to do is get the are range
over<00:03:22.840> half<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.410> wall<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:24.129> that<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.400> appear<00:03:24.730> on

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
over half the wall so that you appear on

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.460 
over half the wall so that you appear on
the<00:03:24.970> other<00:03:25.000> side<00:03:25.390> it's<00:03:25.900> kind<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.290> same

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
the other side it's kind of the same

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.830 
the other side it's kind of the same
mechanic<00:03:26.920> as<00:03:27.069> fatal<00:03:27.340> sixes<00:03:27.760> are<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.569> it's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
mechanic as fatal sixes are so it's

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.330 
mechanic as fatal sixes are so it's
pretty<00:03:29.019> similar<00:03:29.319> and<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.680> can<00:03:29.830> do<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.160> with

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
pretty similar and you can do this with

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.920 
pretty similar and you can do this with
multiple<00:03:30.489> walls<00:03:30.940> they<00:03:31.480> are<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.870> course

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
multiple walls they are of course

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.990 
multiple walls they are of course
decreasing<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.950> range<00:03:33.190> with<00:03:33.459> Cass<00:03:33.670> students

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
decreasing the range with Cass students

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.910 
decreasing the range with Cass students
are<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.629> next<00:03:34.810> patch<00:03:35.049> so<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.470> might<00:03:35.739> have<00:03:35.769> to

put out a ward you want to shunpo to it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.140 
put out a ward you want to shunpo to it
and<00:03:47.290> immediately<00:03:47.799> Auto<00:03:48.280> Attack<00:03:48.610> it<00:03:48.790> because

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
and immediately Auto Attack it because

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.789 
and immediately Auto Attack it because
if<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.390> don't<00:03:49.510> immediately<00:03:49.810> Auto<00:03:50.290> Attack<00:03:50.590> it

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
kills ultimate when people are low and

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.190 
kills ultimate when people are low and
are<00:04:06.579> about<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.940> die<00:04:07.150> that's<00:04:07.629> all<00:04:07.750> good<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.079> have

the<00:04:08.290> mindset<00:04:08.590> for<00:04:08.709> if<00:04:08.950> you're<00:04:09.099> zilean<00:04:09.549> or

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
the mindset for if you're zilean or

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.119 
the mindset for if you're zilean or
maybe<00:04:09.970> say<00:04:10.299> Yorick<00:04:10.750> but<00:04:11.170> in<00:04:11.379> this<00:04:11.530> case<00:04:11.769> you

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
maybe say Yorick but in this case you

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.860 
maybe say Yorick but in this case you
want<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.340> use<00:04:12.400> your<00:04:12.610> ultimate<00:04:12.879> to<00:04:13.090> nullify<00:04:13.420> all

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
want to use your ultimate to nullify all

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.750 
want to use your ultimate to nullify all
the<00:04:14.019> damage<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.410> can<00:04:14.650> so<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.190> enemies<00:04:15.519> burst

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
the damage you can so that enemies burst

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.729 
the damage you can so that enemies burst
is<00:04:15.970> wasted<00:04:16.359> on<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.570> that<00:04:16.720> target<00:04:17.139> and<00:04:17.320> now<00:04:17.560> they

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
is wasted on to that target and now they

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.680 
is wasted on to that target and now they
have<00:04:17.829> no<00:04:17.889> more<00:04:18.100> purse<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.789> so<00:04:19.030> that<00:04:19.299> ultimate

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
have no more purse and so that ultimate

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.180 
have no more purse and so that ultimate
could<00:04:19.900> be<00:04:20.049> game-changing<00:04:20.650> if<00:04:20.859> there<00:04:21.070> was<00:04:21.160> a

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
could be game-changing if there was a

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.010 
could be game-changing if there was a
teamfight<00:04:21.459> back<00:04:22.090> in<00:04:22.240> season<00:04:22.389> one<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:22.720> two<00:04:22.900> I

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
teamfight back in season one and two I

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.779 
teamfight back in season one and two I
always<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.680> same<00:04:23.889> thing<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.370> use<00:04:24.639> my

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
always it the same thing I use my

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.310 
always it the same thing I use my
ultimate<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.360> when<00:04:25.450> people<00:04:25.630> who<00:04:25.840> are<00:04:25.900> low<00:04:26.080> and

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
ultimate and when people who are low and

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.990 
ultimate and when people who are low and
I<00:04:26.710> needed<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.039> save<00:04:27.280> them<00:04:27.490> but<00:04:27.729> once<00:04:27.880> I

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
I needed to save them but once I

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000 
I needed to save them but once I
understood<00:04:28.360> what<00:04:28.780> spells<00:04:29.110> were<00:04:29.289> incoming<00:04:29.830> and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
understood what spells were incoming and

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.129 
understood what spells were incoming and
teamfights<00:04:30.400> from<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.060> enemy<00:04:31.270> team<00:04:31.300> that's

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
teamfights from the enemy team that's

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.960 
teamfights from the enemy team that's
when<00:04:32.320> I<00:04:32.410> realized<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:32.919> can<00:04:33.070> use<00:04:33.190> my<00:04:33.310> ultimate<00:04:33.610> to

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
when I realized I can use my ultimate to

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.790 
when I realized I can use my ultimate to
nullify<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.690> lot<00:04:34.870> it<00:04:34.990> first<00:04:35.289> coming<00:04:35.620> from<00:04:35.710> the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800

sure<00:05:05.349> if<00:05:05.710> this<00:05:05.860> is<00:05:05.919> efficient<00:05:06.580> or<00:05:06.789> maybe<00:05:07.150> you

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
sure if this is efficient or maybe you

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.879 
sure if this is efficient or maybe you
should<00:05:07.419> activate<00:05:07.870> your<00:05:08.020> W<00:05:08.320> just<00:05:08.560> for<00:05:08.710> some

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
should activate your W just for some

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.860 
should activate your W just for some
horizontal<00:05:09.160> enemy<00:05:09.820> but<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.450> is<00:05:10.570> still

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
horizontal enemy but it is still

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.839 
horizontal enemy but it is still
interesting<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.410> know<00:05:11.680> alright<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.820> next

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
interesting to know alright so the next

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.580 
interesting to know alright so the next
trick<00:05:13.150> is<00:05:13.389> going<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:13.630> be<00:05:13.690> with<00:05:13.960> Kazakhs<00:05:14.380> and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
trick is going to be with Kazakhs and

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.589 
trick is going to be with Kazakhs and
it's<00:05:15.130> going<00:05:15.220> to<00:05:15.280> be<00:05:15.400> similar<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.880> karmas<00:05:16.300> Q

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
it's going to be similar to a karmas Q

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.600 
it's going to be similar to a karmas Q
flash<00:05:16.750> drink<00:05:17.200> so<00:05:17.740> what<00:05:17.889> you're<00:05:18.010> gonna<00:05:18.070> do<00:05:18.370> is

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
flash drink so what you're gonna do is

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.790 
flash drink so what you're gonna do is
use<00:05:18.820> your<00:05:18.849> W<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.479> then<00:05:19.690> flash<00:05:19.960> towards<00:05:20.440> enemy

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
use your W and then flash towards enemy

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.920 
use your W and then flash towards enemy
as<00:05:21.159> you<00:05:21.340> can<00:05:21.460> see<00:05:21.640> I<00:05:21.669> start<00:05:22.060> casting<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.570> before

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
as you can see I start casting it before

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.879 
as you can see I start casting it before
I<00:05:22.960> flush<00:05:23.320> and<00:05:23.530> then

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
I flush and then

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.469 
I flush and then
the<00:05:23.949> void<00:05:24.129> spikes<00:05:24.430> was<00:05:24.639> repositioned<00:05:25.270> in

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
the void spikes was repositioned in

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.360 
the void spikes was repositioned in
where<00:05:25.599> I<00:05:25.629> flashed<00:05:26.020> that<00:05:26.229> so<00:05:26.830> if<00:05:26.919> you<00:05:27.009> do<00:05:27.159> need

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
where I flashed that so if you do need

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.459 
where I flashed that so if you do need
to<00:05:27.490> secure<00:05:27.729> to<00:05:27.879> slow<00:05:28.090> onto<00:05:28.360> somebody<00:05:28.780> then<00:05:29.229> you

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
to secure to slow onto somebody then you

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.499 
to secure to slow onto somebody then you
can<00:05:29.590> use<00:05:29.710> this<00:05:29.830> trick<00:05:30.069> next<00:05:30.939> trick<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.270> same

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
can use this trick next trick the same

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.809 
can use this trick next trick the same
concept<00:05:32.020> as<00:05:32.139> applied<00:05:32.469> to<00:05:32.499> kog'maw<00:05:33.129> skew<00:05:33.490> this

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
concept as applied to kog'maw skew this

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.909 
concept as applied to kog'maw skew this
however<00:05:34.060> does<00:05:34.449> not<00:05:34.509> work<00:05:34.840> with<00:05:34.990> his<00:05:35.139> II<00:05:35.319> so

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
however does not work with his II so

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.619 
however does not work with his II so
again<00:05:36.189> cast<00:05:36.580> your<00:05:36.759> queue<00:05:36.999> right<00:05:37.210> before<00:05:37.539> you

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
again cast your queue right before you

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.239 
again cast your queue right before you
flash<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.259> then<00:05:38.469> if<00:05:38.620> she<00:05:38.650> go<00:05:38.800> towards<00:05:39.159> the

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:39.249 
flash and then if she go towards the

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:41.010 
flash and then if she go towards the
enemy<00:05:39.550> it's<00:05:39.939> actually<00:05:40.180> pretty<00:05:40.300> funny<00:05:40.569> because

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
enemy it's actually pretty funny because

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.230 
enemy it's actually pretty funny because
it<00:05:41.229> works<00:05:41.439> with<00:05:41.499> Kasich's<00:05:41.979> is<00:05:42.129> w<00:05:42.669> and<00:05:42.879> kog'maw

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
it works with Kasich's is w and kog'maw

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.300 
it works with Kasich's is w and kog'maw
skew<00:05:43.509> but<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.900> doesn't<00:05:44.199> work<00:05:44.349> with<00:05:44.529> cannons<00:05:45.009> q

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
skew but it doesn't work with cannons q

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.550 
skew but it doesn't work with cannons q
for<00:05:45.550> some<00:05:45.699> reason<00:05:46.120> but<00:05:46.719> anyways<00:05:47.050> I<00:05:47.229> guess<00:05:47.289> this

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
for some reason but anyways I guess this

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.769 
for some reason but anyways I guess this
would<00:05:47.710> be<00:05:47.740> useful<00:05:48.249> if<00:05:48.610> say<00:05:48.879> your<00:05:49.029> AP<00:05:49.330> kog'maw

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
would be useful if say your AP kog'maw

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.540 
would be useful if say your AP kog'maw
and<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:49.990> got<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.199> finish<00:05:50.349> off<00:05:50.620> someone<00:05:51.009> next

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
and you got to finish off someone next

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.059 
and you got to finish off someone next
step<00:05:51.789> and<00:05:51.969> honestly<00:05:52.419> a<00:05:52.539> pretty<00:05:52.930> useful<00:05:53.139> one<00:05:53.499> so

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
step and honestly a pretty useful one so

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.279 
step and honestly a pretty useful one so
I'm<00:05:54.370> not<00:05:54.520> sure<00:05:54.580> about<00:05:54.879> you<00:05:55.240> guys<00:05:55.270> but<00:05:55.840> what<00:05:56.229> I

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
I'm not sure about you guys but what I

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.070 
I'm not sure about you guys but what I
did<00:05:56.650> when<00:05:56.889> I<00:05:56.919> was<00:05:57.159> in<00:05:57.189> kog'maw<00:05:57.789> passive<00:05:58.659> was

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
did when I was in kog'maw passive was

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.629 
did when I was in kog'maw passive was
I'd<00:05:59.349> always<00:05:59.590> try<00:05:59.860> and<00:05:59.949> right<00:06:00.159> click<00:06:00.310> around

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
I'd always try and right click around

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.550 
I'd always try and right click around
the<00:06:00.819> enemy<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.300> try<00:06:01.689> and<00:06:01.810> follow<00:06:01.960> him<00:06:02.259> that

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
the enemy and try and follow him that

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.619 
the enemy and try and follow him that
way<00:06:02.710> what<00:06:03.310> I<00:06:03.340> didn't<00:06:03.639> realize<00:06:03.669> was<00:06:04.300> I<00:06:04.479> could

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
way what I didn't realize was I could

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.510 
way what I didn't realize was I could
just<00:06:04.779> right-click<00:06:05.080> him<00:06:05.229> once<00:06:05.469> or<00:06:05.740> he's<00:06:06.219> attack

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
just right-click him once or he's attack

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.939 
just right-click him once or he's attack
move<00:06:06.789> on<00:06:07.000> to<00:06:07.120> him<00:06:07.240> and<00:06:07.389> I<00:06:07.870> would<00:06:08.050> follow<00:06:08.229> him<00:06:08.379> it

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
move on to him and I would follow him it

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.769 
move on to him and I would follow him it
also<00:06:09.129> follows<00:06:09.430> people<00:06:09.849> into<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.150> bush<00:06:10.389> and<00:06:10.629> it

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
also follows people into the bush and it

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:12.540 
also follows people into the bush and it
keeps<00:06:10.990> following<00:06:11.199> them<00:06:11.650> so<00:06:12.099> it's<00:06:12.400> pretty

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
keeps following them so it's pretty

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.519 
keeps following them so it's pretty
useful<00:06:12.819> when<00:06:13.330> you<00:06:13.539> don't<00:06:13.569> want<00:06:13.870> to<00:06:13.930> get<00:06:14.050> juked

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
useful when you don't want to get juked

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:16.529 
useful when you don't want to get juked
as<00:06:14.620> you<00:06:15.039> can<00:06:15.159> see<00:06:15.339> the<00:06:15.520> only<00:06:15.669> command<00:06:16.000> is<00:06:16.180> you'd

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
as you can see the only command is you'd

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.140 
as you can see the only command is you'd
was<00:06:16.839> attack<00:06:17.259> move<00:06:17.500> onto<00:06:17.740> gangplank<00:06:18.460> and<00:06:18.550> then

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
was attack move onto gangplank and then

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.490 
was attack move onto gangplank and then
I<00:06:19.180> let<00:06:19.419> go<00:06:19.629> of<00:06:19.659> the<00:06:19.839> mouse<00:06:19.870> to<00:06:20.379> control

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
I let go of the mouse to control

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.529 
I let go of the mouse to control
gangplank<00:06:21.189> on<00:06:21.339> another<00:06:21.580> computer<00:06:21.849> now<00:06:22.509> I

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
gangplank on another computer now I

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.269 
gangplank on another computer now I
wouldn't<00:06:22.960> rely<00:06:23.080> on<00:06:23.199> this<00:06:23.469> trick<00:06:23.800> a<00:06:23.949> hundred

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
wouldn't rely on this trick a hundred

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.769 
wouldn't rely on this trick a hundred
percent<00:06:24.400> because<00:06:24.939> sometimes<00:06:25.389> it<00:06:25.569> kind<00:06:25.719> of

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
percent because sometimes it kind of

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.719 
percent because sometimes it kind of
bugs<00:06:26.050> out<00:06:26.289> and<00:06:26.409> stops<00:06:27.009> following<00:06:27.219> the<00:06:27.460> enemy

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
bugs out and stops following the enemy

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.640 
bugs out and stops following the enemy
so<00:06:27.969> what<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.240> recommend<00:06:28.810> is<00:06:29.080> keep<00:06:29.409> swimming

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
so what I recommend is keep swimming

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.920 
so what I recommend is keep swimming
attack<00:06:30.039> move<00:06:30.279> on<00:06:30.490> to<00:06:30.699> the<00:06:30.789> enemy<00:06:31.120> when<00:06:31.569> you<00:06:31.599> see

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
attack move on to the enemy when you see

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.019 
attack move on to the enemy when you see
him<00:06:32.169> or<00:06:32.349> her<00:06:32.710> hey<00:06:33.310> guys<00:06:33.490> so<00:06:33.759> thank<00:06:33.939> you<00:06:34.000> guys
