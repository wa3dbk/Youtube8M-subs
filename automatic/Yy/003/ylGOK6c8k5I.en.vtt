shoes because they look like clogs and I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.680 
shoes because they look like clogs and I

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
guess they look ugly on people but in my

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.330 
guess they look ugly on people but in my
opinion<00:01:49.080> they're<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.500> comfortable<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
opinion they're really comfortable and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.649 
opinion they're really comfortable and
they're<00:01:50.940> really<00:01:51.830> utilitarian<00:01:52.830> because<00:01:53.759> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
they're really utilitarian because you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.080 
they're really utilitarian because you
can<00:01:54.840> use<00:01:55.050> them<00:01:55.259> for<00:01:55.369> gardening<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.550> going

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
outside and what I like to use the most

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.249 
outside and what I like to use the most
of<00:02:00.330> all<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.690> for<00:02:00.720> barbecuing<00:02:02.569> so<00:02:03.569> it<00:02:03.929> doesn't

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
of all is for barbecuing so it doesn't

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.289 
of all is for barbecuing so it doesn't
really<00:02:04.380> matter<00:02:04.679> what<00:02:05.399> anyone<00:02:05.850> thinks<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.270> long

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
