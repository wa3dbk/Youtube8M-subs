horsepower and basically what they did

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.619 
horsepower and basically what they did
is<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> higher<00:00:44.399> compression<00:00:44.850> piston<00:00:45.390> hotter

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

definitely<00:00:58.079> has<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.410> hotter<00:00:58.680> cam<00:00:59.010> higher

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730

different switch let's take a look at

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.609 
different switch let's take a look at
the<00:02:04.200> instrumentation<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:05.009> here<00:02:05.479> got<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:07.049> nice

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the instrumentation in here got a nice

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.029 
the instrumentation in here got a nice
big<00:02:08.270> gauge<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.080> an<00:02:10.259> analog<00:02:10.649> read<00:02:10.890> out

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
big gauge there with an analog read out

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.800 
big gauge there with an analog read out

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
down turn this on I've got a fuel gauge

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.540 
down turn this on I've got a fuel gauge
across<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.050> bottom<00:02:15.260> tells<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.099> what<00:02:16.250> gear

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
across the bottom tells you what gear

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.309 
across the bottom tells you what gear
you're<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.420> right<00:02:17.569> there<00:02:17.599> it<00:02:17.840> says<00:02:17.870> are

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
you're in so right there it says are

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.729 
you're in so right there it says are
theirs<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.920> for<00:02:19.760> neutral<00:02:20.150> h4<00:02:20.750> high<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.319> go<00:02:21.590> all

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
theirs in for neutral h4 high and go all

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.410 
theirs in for neutral h4 high and go all
the<00:02:21.830> way<00:02:21.860> back<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.130> park<00:02:22.700> has<00:02:22.910> parking<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
the way back to park has parking the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.040 
the way back to park has parking the
transmission<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.300> make<00:02:26.480> these<00:02:26.690> show

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
transmission you can make these show

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.100 
transmission you can make these show
speed<00:02:27.680> here<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.640> tack<00:02:28.970> here<00:02:29.330> or<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.840> can<00:02:29.989> make

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
speed here and tack here or you can make

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.780 
speed here and tack here or you can make
them<00:02:30.230> show<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.530> tachometer<00:02:30.920> on<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.459> analog

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
them show the tachometer on the analog

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.009 
them show the tachometer on the analog
part<00:02:32.060> in<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.450> speed<00:02:32.720> here<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.870> can

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
part in the speed here and so so you can

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.150 
part in the speed here and so so you can
see<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.800> that's<00:02:36.980> got<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
see that this one that's got the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.309 
see that this one that's got the
tachometer

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.559 

I<00:02:40.640> don't<00:02:41.640> know<00:02:41.730> if<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.879> can<00:02:42.030> hear<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.329> or<00:02:42.420> not

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
I don't know if you can hear it or not

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.289 
I don't know if you can hear it or not
but<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.200> hear<00:02:43.469> the<00:02:43.680> cam<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.939> that<00:02:45.030> motor

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
but you can hear the cam and that motor

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.809 
but you can hear the cam and that motor
definitely<00:02:45.930> has<00:02:46.049> a<00:02:46.079> little<00:02:46.469> oak<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.069> then

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
definitely has a little oak to it then

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.830 
definitely has a little oak to it then
the<00:02:47.939> regular<00:02:48.299> bobcats<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:50.299> so<00:02:51.299> definitely
