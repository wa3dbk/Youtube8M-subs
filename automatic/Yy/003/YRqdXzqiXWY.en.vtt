the third time
did<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:26.970> immediately<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.720> serious

did you know immediately it was serious

did you know immediately it was serious
yeah<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> had<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> fair<00:00:29.939> idea<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.960> think<00:00:31.260> having

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
yeah I had a fair idea I think having

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.340 
yeah I had a fair idea I think having
done<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.949> twice<00:00:32.130> before<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.780> I<00:00:33.780> knew<00:00:34.200> exactly

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
done it twice before I I knew exactly

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.430 
done it twice before I I knew exactly
what<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.860> pain<00:00:35.270> felt<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> spot

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
what that pain felt like I know the spot

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.240 
what that pain felt like I know the spot
exactly<00:00:37.950> where<00:00:38.540> where<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> happens<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.379> as

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
exactly where where it happens so as

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.479 
exactly where where it happens so as
soon<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> felt<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.379> I<00:00:43.379> did<00:00:43.920> know<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.129> think

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
soon as I felt that I I did know I think

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
soon as I felt that I I did know I think
I<00:00:44.730> probably<00:00:45.300> stay<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.140> bit

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
I probably stay on there a little bit

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.680 
I probably stay on there a little bit
for<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> little<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.399> longer<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.390> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
for a little bit longer in that in that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.439 
for a little bit longer in that in that
passage<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.410> ply<00:00:49.590> which<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.070> guess<00:00:50.940> enhance<00:00:51.270> up

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
passage of ply which I guess enhance up

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.110 
passage of ply which I guess enhance up
maybe<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.809> shouldn't<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:53.000> think<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
maybe I shouldn't have but I think I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060 
maybe I shouldn't have but I think I
just<00:00:54.300> didn't<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.050> submit<00:00:55.920> to

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
just didn't really want to submit to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.319 
just didn't really want to submit to
knowing<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.760> probably<00:00:56.910> gonna<00:00:57.180> be

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
knowing that that was probably gonna be

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.110 
knowing that that was probably gonna be
the<00:00:57.390> last<00:00:57.539> time<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.809> walked<00:00:58.170> off<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.850> as<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.030> was

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the last time I walked off and as I was

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.310 
the last time I walked off and as I was
sort<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.570> sitting<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> bench

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
sort of sitting there on the bench

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200 
sort of sitting there on the bench
watching<00:01:01.559> was<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.980> pretty<00:01:02.399> dark<00:01:02.640> time<00:01:02.850> knowing

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
watching was a pretty dark time knowing

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.789 
watching was a pretty dark time knowing
that<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:03.960> saying<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> hospital<00:01:04.710> again

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that I was saying to the hospital again

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.219 
that I was saying to the hospital again
to<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.220> scans<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.869> there<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> decent

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to have scans and there was a decent

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.450 
to have scans and there was a decent
chance<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:07.830> weren't<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.340> too

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
chance that they weren't going to be too

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.490 
chance that they weren't going to be too
good<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.299> had<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.600> first<00:01:09.750> serious<00:01:10.260> neck

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
good you had your first serious neck

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
2012 what were you thinking during the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.580 
2012 what were you thinking during the
recovery<00:01:15.630> did<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> ever<00:01:16.320> consider

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
recovery did you ever consider

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.440 
recovery did you ever consider
retirement<00:01:17.130> then<00:01:18.229> no<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.770> didn't<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.450> add

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
retirement then no I didn't actually add

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.260 
retirement then no I didn't actually add
some<00:01:21.869> differing<00:01:22.500> advice<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> most

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
some differing advice and for the most

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.670 
some differing advice and for the most
part<00:01:24.570> everyone<00:01:24.780> was<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.140> positive<00:01:25.350> about

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
part everyone was really positive about

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
part everyone was really positive about
the<00:01:25.920> fact<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.880> would<00:01:27.030> fully<00:01:27.240> heal<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the fact that it would fully heal and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.039 
the fact that it would fully heal and
that<00:01:27.869> I'd<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.140> able<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.710> make<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> full<00:01:29.159> recovery

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
that I'd be able to make a full recovery

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.140 
that I'd be able to make a full recovery
along<00:01:31.049> each<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.250> times<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
along each of the times now this is the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.740 
along each of the times now this is the
third<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.570> anyone<00:01:34.170> had<00:01:34.290> said<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> was

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
third if anyone had said that I was

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.890 
third if anyone had said that I was
taking<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> ridiculous<00:01:37.350> risk<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.829> terms<00:01:38.009> of

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
taking a ridiculous risk in terms of

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.539 
taking a ridiculous risk in terms of
potential<00:01:39.900> paralysis<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.220> anything<00:01:41.400> like

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
potential paralysis or anything like

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.550 
potential paralysis or anything like
that<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.390> wouldn't<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.140> come<00:01:43.350> back

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that then I I wouldn't have come back

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.149 
that then I I wouldn't have come back
but<00:01:43.939> I<00:01:44.939> still<00:01:45.540> had<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:46.439> strong<00:01:46.860> bone

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
but I still had a really strong bone

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.160 
but I still had a really strong bone
desire<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:48.030> come<00:01:48.210> back<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.600> felt<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.990> hadn't

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
desire to come back I felt like I hadn't

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.120 
desire to come back I felt like I hadn't
achieved<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.619> things<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> wanted<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
achieved the things that I wanted to and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.950 
achieved the things that I wanted to and
I'm<00:01:53.130> still<00:01:53.430> while<00:01:54.180> I'm<00:01:54.240> sitting<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.750> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
I'm still while I'm sitting here in this

I'm still very glad that I did come back
into<00:01:56.790> those<00:01:57.000> times<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:58.200> less<00:01:58.320> than<00:01:58.469> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
into those times that it's less than a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.630 
into those times that it's less than a
month<00:01:58.770> since<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.159> announced<00:01:59.369> your

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
month since you announced your

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.730 
month since you announced your
retirement<00:01:59.700> from<00:02:00.329> rugby<00:02:00.600> has<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> sunk<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.710> yet

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
retirement from rugby has a sunk in yet

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.800 
retirement from rugby has a sunk in yet
or<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.640> still<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.060> urge<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.659> play

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
or do you still have that urge to play

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.850 
or do you still have that urge to play
again

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
again

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.590 
again
not<00:02:05.980> sure<00:02:06.160> Italy<00:02:06.520> has<00:02:06.700> some<00:02:07.000> key<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.330> think

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
not sure Italy has some key and I think

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.340 
not sure Italy has some key and I think
that'll<00:02:08.560> come<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:08.920> time<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.850> urge<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.060> play

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
that'll come in time the urge to play

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.520 
that'll come in time the urge to play
I<00:02:11.380> think<00:02:11.980> it'll<00:02:12.100> always<00:02:12.280> be<00:02:12.460> there<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:12.910> think

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I think it'll always be there I think

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.850 
I think it'll always be there I think
I've<00:02:14.530> watched<00:02:14.770> plenty<00:02:15.100> again<00:02:15.460> since<00:02:15.790> then<00:02:16.060> so

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
I've watched plenty again since then so

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.080 
I've watched plenty again since then so
obviously<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.580> little<00:02:18.760> bit<00:02:18.850> tough<00:02:19.060> to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
obviously it's a little bit tough to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.080 
obviously it's a little bit tough to
watch<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:21.070> was<00:02:21.220> made<00:02:21.400> easier<00:02:21.700> in<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.850> fact

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
watch but it was made easier in the fact

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.490 
watch but it was made easier in the fact
that<00:02:22.300> there<00:02:22.510> wasn't<00:02:22.750> really<00:02:22.900> another<00:02:23.230> choice

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
that there wasn't really another choice

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.920 
that there wasn't really another choice
or<00:02:23.890> knew<00:02:24.100> if<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.940> ever<00:02:25.090> happened<00:02:25.420> again<00:02:25.510> that

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
or knew if it ever happened again that

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.470 
or knew if it ever happened again that
that<00:02:26.320> was<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.650> end<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.120> there's<00:02:28.120> gonna<00:02:28.270> be<00:02:28.360> no

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
that was the end so there's gonna be no

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.380 
that was the end so there's gonna be no
sort<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.140> ongoing<00:02:29.520> being<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.670> shoot<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.060> tried

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
sort of ongoing being of shoot I tried

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.940 
sort of ongoing being of shoot I tried
to<00:02:31.510> come<00:02:31.690> back<00:02:31.900> shouldn't<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.440> have<00:02:32.590> there's

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
to come back shouldn't I have there's

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.910 
to come back shouldn't I have there's
there's<00:02:33.640> really<00:02:33.790> no<00:02:33.970> option<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
there's really no option for that so I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.490 
there's really no option for that so I
can<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.700> guess<00:02:37.300> walk<00:02:37.690> away<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.959> bit<00:02:38.140> easier

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
can I guess walk away a bit easier

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.760 
can I guess walk away a bit easier
knowing<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.840> that's<00:02:40.840> ended<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.530> now<00:02:41.650> it's

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
knowing that that's ended and now it's
