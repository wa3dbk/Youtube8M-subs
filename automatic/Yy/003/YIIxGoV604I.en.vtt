00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello friends how are you gonna kill the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.740
 form to nothing in the forms 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.710
 geometrically today let's see 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.830
 circles or circles also called 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.610
 davis 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.750
 because to start let's see how 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.869
 to draw we would not have to 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.690
 a grid rock pop up 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.739
 you can take a plate a flight or 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.920
 a drink if you do not have the group a is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.920
 obviously web propofol 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.770
 as in a grid place a point 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.780
 in the center and you take your fight with 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.150
 a width of 2 cm that misses the radius 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.159
 and trace the outline of the circle here 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.509
 very very good 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.740
 hop a man woman woman woman let's see 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:17.850
 what are the main properties 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.569
 to recognize in circles or circles 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.630
 or a record 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:29.990
 it is necessary that the distance between the point 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.259
 central and the port is constant 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.790
 that is to say those called here to 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.050
 constant radius 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.070
 as the radius must be constant in 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.960
 this circle 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.960
 as this animation shows 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.630
 hop hop hop hop hop now that you 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 know recognize the rounds certainly 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.470
 the disks with the properties that we 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.460
 have just seen I suggest you watch 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.620
 around you and see in pictures the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:14.490
 different forms of circles that one 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:17.400
 can experience wow pow pow pow wow wow 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.569
 can find the shape of a round in a 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:26.370
 car wheel panel 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.930
 buttons 1 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.970
 d 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.620
 a watch 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.370
 or a plate and still well 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.370
 other objects 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.050
 fama of course on round circles 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.640
 the disk ends i wish you 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.080
 Good evening 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.830
 goodbye and see you soon after pop 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.830
