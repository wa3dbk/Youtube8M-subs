standard wolf pack you can proceed to
the<00:02:27.720> hardcore<00:02:28.349> this<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> hardcore<00:02:29.459> but

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the hardcore this is the hardcore but

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.619 
the hardcore this is the hardcore but
it's<00:02:29.819> pretty<00:02:30.060> much<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.780> same<00:02:30.989> just<00:02:31.700> here<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
it's pretty much the same just here the

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.559 
it's pretty much the same just here the
disguise<00:02:34.200> will<00:02:35.129> be<00:02:35.459> much<00:02:36.120> more<00:02:36.510> useful

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
disguise will be much more useful

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.229 
disguise will be much more useful
because<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.829> target<00:02:38.220> detection<00:02:38.370> time<00:02:39.000> is

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
because the target detection time is

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.289 
because the target detection time is

for<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.170> previous<00:02:52.410> one<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:55.019> targets<00:02:55.440> a

captain<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.829> record<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.579> kind<00:02:59.910> of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
captain and the record is a kind of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.819 
captain and the record is a kind of
silly<00:03:00.540> target<00:03:01.019> but<00:03:01.730> he<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:03.139> he<00:03:04.139> can<00:03:04.319> smell

better for these two guys record and the
captain<00:04:12.379> it<00:04:12.829> doesn't<00:04:13.370> matter<00:04:13.519> which<00:04:14.299> one<00:04:14.360> to

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
captain it doesn't matter which one to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.979 
captain it doesn't matter which one to
poison<00:04:15.200> first<00:04:15.500> but<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.880> matter<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.660> you

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
poison first but it matter that you

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.300 
poison first but it matter that you
should<00:04:18.199> poison<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:19.639> one<00:04:20.470> which<00:04:21.470> is<00:04:21.500> walking

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
should poison the one which is walking

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.189 
should poison the one which is walking
behind<00:04:23.889> it's<00:04:24.889> also<00:04:25.220> important<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.330> time<00:04:26.930> the

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
behind it's also important to time the

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.040 
behind it's also important to time the
second<00:04:27.650> kill<00:04:27.949> well<00:04:28.510> because<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.660> second

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
second kill well because the second

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.230 
second kill well because the second
target<00:04:30.260> should<00:04:30.680> die<00:04:30.889> simultaneously<00:04:31.280> with

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
target should die simultaneously with

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.260 
target should die simultaneously with
the<00:04:32.270> first<00:04:32.660> target<00:04:33.110> why<00:04:34.100> because<00:04:34.669> if<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.180> are

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
the first target why because if you are

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.920 
the first target why because if you are
in<00:04:35.479> this<00:04:35.630> trick<00:04:36.020> count<00:04:36.919> minus<00:04:37.639> one<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.720> will

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
in this trick count minus one you will

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.670 
in this trick count minus one you will
get<00:04:39.169> double<00:04:39.860> kill<00:04:40.520> streak<00:04:40.940> with<00:04:41.180> this<00:04:41.410> so<00:04:42.410> this

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
get double kill streak with this so this

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.680 
get double kill streak with this so this
one<00:04:42.919> was<00:04:43.130> a<00:04:43.190> bad<00:04:43.460> example<00:04:43.669> when<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.330> second

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
one was a bad example when the second

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.710 
one was a bad example when the second
kill<00:04:44.930> was<00:04:45.110> late<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.560> key<00:04:46.030> if<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.240> still<00:04:47.510> don't

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
kill was late the key if you still don't

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.379 
kill was late the key if you still don't
know<00:04:47.990> how<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.710> identify<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.490> right<00:04:49.820> captain

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389
