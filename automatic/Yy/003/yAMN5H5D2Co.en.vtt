00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
ID on your iPhone 5s I'm using my right

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.339 
ID on your iPhone 5s I'm using my right
thumb<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.059> demonstrate<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> very<00:00:13.139> cool

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
thumb to demonstrate this in a very cool

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.530 
thumb to demonstrate this in a very cool
feature<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.009> go<00:00:14.519> under<00:00:14.700> your<00:00:14.880> general<00:00:15.150> setting

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
feature so go under your general setting

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.410 
feature so go under your general setting
and<00:00:15.750> into<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.500> Pascoe<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.580> finger<00:00:18.090> print<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and into the Pascoe and finger print and

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.660 
and into the Pascoe and finger print and
this<00:00:18.810> requires<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.410> four<00:00:19.680> digit<00:00:19.859> PIN<00:00:20.279> code<00:00:20.520> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
this requires a four digit PIN code to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.200 
this requires a four digit PIN code to
get<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.330> you're<00:00:21.539> set<00:00:21.900> up<00:00:21.930> initially<00:00:22.920> and

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
get in which you're set up initially and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.700 
get in which you're set up initially and
so<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.539> turn<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.869> passcode<00:00:25.500> or

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
so you have to turn on the passcode or

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.470 
so you have to turn on the passcode or
wipe<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.490> fingerprint<00:00:27.029> feature<00:00:27.240> will<00:00:27.449> not

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
wipe the fingerprint feature will not

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.769 
wipe the fingerprint feature will not
work<00:00:27.840> because<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.140> plays<00:00:28.439> out<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.779> backup

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
work because it plays out the backup

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.830 
work because it plays out the backup
password<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.640> if<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.910> cannot<00:00:33.300> scan<00:00:33.630> it

password for you if you cannot scan it

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.470 
password for you if you cannot scan it
so<00:00:34.260> once<00:00:35.040> you're<00:00:35.190> ready<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.850> press<00:00:36.270> your

so once you're ready just press your
right<00:00:36.840> thumb<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.920> home<00:00:38.070> button<00:00:38.100> until<00:00:38.670> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
right thumb on the home button until you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.780 
right thumb on the home button until you
can<00:00:39.120> feel<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.620> very<00:00:40.620> small<00:00:40.890> vibration<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
can feel a very small vibration that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.360 
can feel a very small vibration that
means<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.270> reading<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:43.250> epidermal<00:00:44.250> ridges

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
means just reading your epidermal ridges

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
means just reading your epidermal ridges
also<00:00:45.120> known<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.870> fingerprint<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.390> just

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
also known as your fingerprint and just

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.959 
also known as your fingerprint and just
keep<00:00:48.930> doing<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.260> until<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.190> ask<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
keep doing that until you ask you to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.110 
keep doing that until you ask you to
turn<00:00:51.239> your<00:00:51.480> finger<00:00:52.520> side-by-side<00:00:53.520> around<00:00:53.910> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
turn your finger side-by-side around so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.529 
turn your finger side-by-side around so
the<00:00:55.039> skin<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.780> angles<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.649> your

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
the skin can we are the angles of your

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.910 
the skin can we are the angles of your
your<00:01:00.539> fingers<00:01:00.899> until<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
your fingers until you can see it's a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.290 
your fingers until you can see it's a
set<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> means<00:01:02.399> I'll<00:01:02.609> set<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.149> add

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
set that means I'll set up you can add

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.679 
set that means I'll set up you can add
more<00:01:03.660> fingerprint<00:01:04.700> to<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.030> system<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
more fingerprint to this system if you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.500 
more fingerprint to this system if you
want<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.350> will<00:01:08.310> recommend<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.060> let<00:01:09.299> other

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
want I will recommend not to let other

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.570 
want I will recommend not to let other
people<00:01:09.990> fingerprint<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.860> way<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.369> just

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
people fingerprint so that way it's just

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.789 
people fingerprint so that way it's just
a<00:01:11.670> privacy<00:01:12.150> security<00:01:12.270> issue<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> first

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
a privacy security issue so the first

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.620 
a privacy security issue so the first
time<00:01:14.040> when<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.760> try<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> log<00:01:15.210> back<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.509> your

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
time when you try to log back in your

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
time when you try to log back in your
phone<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.049> fingerprint<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.979> ask<00:01:17.189> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
phone with your fingerprint you ask you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.570 
phone with your fingerprint you ask you
for<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.060> four<00:01:18.810> digit<00:01:18.990> PIN<00:01:19.259> code<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.770> verify<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
for a four digit PIN code to verify and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.789 
for a four digit PIN code to verify and
so<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> second<00:01:21.960> time<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.530> try<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
so the second time when you try to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
so the second time when you try to
unlock<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> screen<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:24.180> your<00:01:24.390> fingerprint

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
unlock the screen with your fingerprint

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.560 
unlock the screen with your fingerprint
and<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> should<00:01:25.500> work<00:01:25.740> very<00:01:26.090> quick<00:01:27.090> less<00:01:27.390> than

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and it should work very quick less than

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.870 
and it should work very quick less than
a<00:01:27.630> second<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.220> also<00:01:29.369> use<00:01:29.700> your

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
a second and you can also use your

name in case the touch ID scanner cannot
read<00:02:27.400> your<00:02:27.430> fingerprint<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:28.810> happens

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
because sometimes the fingertips get

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.740 
because sometimes the fingertips get

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
moist and wet for me fluid or water then

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.480 
moist and wet for me fluid or water then
the<00:02:35.350> scanner<00:02:35.590> would<00:02:35.800> have<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.980> hard<00:02:36.250> time

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
the scanner would have a hard time

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.460 
the scanner would have a hard time
reading<00:02:36.880> your<00:02:37.209> fingerprints<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.260> do<00:02:38.350> the
