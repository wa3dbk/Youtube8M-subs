pretty much my favorite side of you know
two<00:03:18.910> sides<00:03:19.120> pretty<00:03:19.930> much<00:03:20.109> because<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.410> think<00:03:20.500> it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
two sides pretty much because I think it

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.569 
two sides pretty much because I think it
looks<00:03:20.889> the<00:03:21.010> best<00:03:21.340> now<00:03:22.889> on<00:03:23.889> the<00:03:23.950> other<00:03:24.069> side<00:03:24.370> you

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
looks the best now on the other side you

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.720 
looks the best now on the other side you
had<00:03:24.730> like<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.590> thing<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.620> goes<00:03:27.130> up<00:03:27.400> like

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
had like the thing that goes up like

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.710 
had like the thing that goes up like
right<00:03:28.030> here<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:29.109> I<00:03:29.169> had<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.410> have<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.250> line

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
right here and I had to have that line

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.960 
right here and I had to have that line
and<00:03:31.720> where<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.019> yellow<00:03:32.200> comes<00:03:32.560> in<00:03:32.829> and<00:03:33.130> to

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
and where the yellow comes in and to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.259 
and where the yellow comes in and to
figure<00:03:34.090> out<00:03:34.329> how<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.569> do<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.169> my<00:03:36.269> worked

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
figure out how to do that and my worked

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.819 
figure out how to do that and my worked
as<00:03:37.389> hard<00:03:37.510> as<00:03:37.630> I<00:03:37.750> can<00:03:37.930> on<00:03:37.989> that<00:03:38.139> and<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.560> think<00:03:38.739> it

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
as hard as I can on that and I think it

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.530 
as hard as I can on that and I think it
turned<00:03:39.099> out<00:03:39.190> pretty<00:03:39.250> good<00:03:39.669> all<00:03:40.239> right<00:03:40.389> I<00:03:40.480> said

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
like hoses and iron grab on it's like

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.279 
like hoses and iron grab on it's like
everywhere<00:04:51.220> but<00:04:52.220> that<00:04:52.490> would<00:04:52.610> be<00:04:52.870> if<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:54.080> did

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
everywhere but that would be if I did

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.520 
everywhere but that would be if I did
that<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:54.470> Lego<00:04:55.039> it<00:04:55.370> would<00:04:55.490> look<00:04:55.639> very<00:04:55.940> bad<00:04:56.530> so

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
that and Lego it would look very bad so

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.960

don't<00:05:18.979> like<00:05:19.159> about<00:05:19.280> this<00:05:19.780> is<00:05:20.780> that<00:05:20.960> there's<00:05:21.199> a

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
don't like about this is that there's a

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.379 
don't like about this is that there's a
gap<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:23.300> stud<00:05:23.659> gap<00:05:24.620> in<00:05:24.949> between<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.729> gas<00:05:25.940> tank

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
gap to stud gap in between the gas tank

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.589 
gap to stud gap in between the gas tank
and<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:27.470> trucks<00:05:27.820> so<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:28.849> don't<00:05:29.030> really<00:05:29.120> like

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
and the trucks so I don't really like

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.750 
and the trucks so I don't really like
that<00:05:29.650> it's<00:05:30.650> either<00:05:30.770> too<00:05:31.159> stud<00:05:31.430> no<00:05:31.580> it's<00:05:31.699> a

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
that it's either too stud no it's a

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.850 
that it's either too stud no it's a
three<00:05:32.000> stud<00:05:32.270> up<00:05:32.419> pretty<00:05:32.659> sure<00:05:32.780> but<00:05:33.650> there's<00:05:33.800> a

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
three stud up pretty sure but there's a

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.230 
three stud up pretty sure but there's a
gap<00:05:34.070> in<00:05:34.310> between<00:05:34.340> you<00:05:34.669> here<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.849> don't<00:05:35.030> really

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
gap in between you here I don't really

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.230 
gap in between you here I don't really
like<00:05:35.449> it<00:05:35.659> so<00:05:35.840> I'm<00:05:36.530> putting<00:05:36.830> I'm<00:05:37.130> gonna<00:05:37.820> try<00:05:38.060> and

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
made which I think turned out pretty

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:54.620 
made which I think turned out pretty
good<00:06:50.000> I<00:06:51.229> might<00:06:52.229> make<00:06:52.410> another<00:06:53.060> one<00:06:54.060> I'm<00:06:54.360> like
