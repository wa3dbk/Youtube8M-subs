00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
you stun it you could stun it a couple

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.440 
you stun it you could stun it a couple
times<00:01:13.890> per<00:01:14.280> life<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.729> pops<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.060> randomly

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
times per life and it pops up randomly

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.289 
times per life and it pops up randomly
like<00:01:15.659> every<00:01:15.869> few<00:01:16.049> minutes<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:17.460> one
