00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.809
 good how are they happy 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.730
 happy because we have taken a step 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.369
 important we inaugurate the room 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.970
 exhibition with a sample that adorns 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.669
 this room of the faculty of arts is 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.920
 students of professor jose nuno so 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.529
 we are celebrating with the students are 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.540
 40 students of the art faculty with 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.790
 which we are celebrating today the 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.890
 opening of the room and this beautiful 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.579
 I hope we visit shows that 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.340
 will be from July 24 to 20 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.340
 August the sample can be seen in the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.920
 tomorrow from 9 to 12 30 every day of 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.100
 Monday to Friday and also to the afternoon of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.719
 18 to 21 hours teacher tell us what 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.489
 we will meet because it is called 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.129
 identity is a parallel world because 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.019
 this good name that would be a matter of 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.469
 ask any of the guys always 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.309
 let's say the name of the sample left you 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.990
 freed 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.009
 liking them and what 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.380
 prefer a little more about what 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.229
 is 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.439
 what to do and what it has cost them 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.659
 them the photographic work of that year 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.229
 this corresponds precisely to all 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.000
 year 2011 we have been a little 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.480
 delayed 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.820
 when talking 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.850
 and make it the sample because 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.040
 it usually makes year - end 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.610
 identities is the reflection in certain 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.080
 aspect of what they have achieved 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.450
 grow learn thanks to your effort 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.990
 during a whole year of hard work 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.260
 tasks and reflects in many cases a 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.990
 parallelism also in what happens in the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.420
 world and what happens more precisely 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.910
 between buenos aires and tucumÃ¡n you 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.940
 You can see through the images that 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.770
 we have images of buenos aires- a 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.210
 trip that is made every year that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.759
 is within the curriculum of the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.280
 chair 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.129
 and those who can not travel for a reason 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.680
 or another are working here then the 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.450
 parallelism that is given is also a 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.409
 synonymous with the name of the sample and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.360
 well we can also see in the 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.769
 diversity in photoshop photoshop 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.579
 how the guys are inspiring 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.610
 teacher that 's how you start at the most 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:38.140
 basic by the angles part of everything 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.909
 more composition going and going through 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.609
 different roads through the 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.670
 use of different types of 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.650
 Photoshop technical filters even 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.959
 until we get to the photojournalism that is 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.480
 one of the balls that has the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.900
 program then through all 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.310
 they 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.849
 everyone goes in some way looking for their 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.950
 north because in third year since that is the 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.409
 last year of the race they have to 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.409
 make one more choice 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.300
 permanent with regard to what is going to 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.700
 be your professional life from here on 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.790
 so I think the second year serves 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.030
 much guidance to achieve what 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.810
 them from the end of the race 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.950
 go to do through their jobs 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.470
 approximately and four students are 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.870
 participating in this photographic exhibition 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.760
 in this sample approximately 45 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.780
 students of which not all 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.600
 present but the group of students in 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.450
 second- year reality round today by 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.420
 today the 80 students have to do 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.250
 emphasis on a very ambitious situation 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.160
 but very compromising for the 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.920
 authorities of the university that this 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.480
 year the art faculty with the career 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.410
 with the university technic in 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.080
 photography is going to have a rector 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.960
 awesome unthinkable in more than 420 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.550
 students enrolled for the first year of 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.150
 the race then we'll see you in a 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.640
 need to increase many parts 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.550
 of technical classrooms and it's a challenge 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.910
 for teachers to be able to teach that 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.890
 number of students and also obviously 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.130
 for the authorities that can 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.500
 some way to shelter them in the house of 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.870
 high studies and all the soccer chaco 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.150
 and the teachers regarding the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.820
 machines in technology has varied 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.530
 a lot of teaching here can you give us your 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.740
 point of view and that of the cameras 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.260
 digital have killed the cameras 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.360
 analog to the roll cameras that 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.150
 it is the same as what was said with respect to 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.340
 the cameras to the color film with 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.740
 regarding black and white and yet 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.690
 we can see here that there 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.100
 a very good number of photographs 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.490
 black and white 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.100
 photography innocence is power 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.790
 handle the lights that works best 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:14.270
 the lights will get a lot product 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:17.120
 better and that can be achieved from a 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.460
 pinhole camera which lacks 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.440
 a lens and it has a small hole 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.889
 nothing more to do the capture of the 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.919
 image up 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.479
 high- tech cameras at 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.819
 about what is the cameras 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.460
 digital where we can reach 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:36.279
 have cameras that cost the body floor 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.069
 without any lens about 40 thousand or 50 thousand 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:41.979
 dollars then with a shoe box 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.039
 or a matchbox can be made 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.469
 photographs as interesting as with 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.210
 those of a very high cost what 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:52.529
 important is to find the vocation 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.759
 know how to use it and apart from that 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:59.740
 use what we always say 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:02.860
 in our country not the part of the wit 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.870
 the brain is fundamental the brain that 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.069
 it is not used is like a curtain that 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.069
 never had
