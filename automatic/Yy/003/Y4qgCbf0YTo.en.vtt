 very good way it works in the box 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.450

 the liter walks strong 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.300
 out there in the middle of the race, adjust a 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.060
 bit because the car started to 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.990
 move but the desire to win so no 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.299
 do not let go 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.040
