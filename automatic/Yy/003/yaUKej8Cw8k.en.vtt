the<00:01:01.559> wiggle<00:01:01.890> wiggle<00:01:02.129> recoil<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the wiggle wiggle recoil I'm going to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.299 
the wiggle wiggle recoil I'm going to
use<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> AK<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:05.010> kind<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
use it AK for this and it's just kind of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.940 
use it AK for this and it's just kind of
the<00:01:05.909> bullets<00:01:06.330> turn<00:01:06.689> into<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> blob<00:01:07.590> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the bullets turn into like a blob so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.700 
the bullets turn into like a blob so
there's<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> AK<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> mp5<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
there's the AK for that now the mp5 is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.230 
there's the AK for that now the mp5 is
another<00:01:10.950> great<00:01:11.159> example<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.939> wiggle

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
another great example for the wiggle

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
wiggle recoil and it just kind of goes

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
wiggle recoil and it just kind of goes
everywhere<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.320> can't<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.710> tame<00:01:17.159> the
