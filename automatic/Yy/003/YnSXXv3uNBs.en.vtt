00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.510
 Hello 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.200
 weak project regions these forces from the magazine 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.079
 mobility 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:10.799
 Today we will share with you gold 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.159
 one small of our experiment 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.279
 we all heard pops 0 7 you all heard that 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.019
 this system is good interesting 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.179
 but cheerfully heard that god 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.079
 it is planned for installation on bread 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.079
 we decided to test how to think together 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.390
 So the crossbar Bukovsky five 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.440
 half of which we installed the release 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.920
 candidate windows 7 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.190
 system starts not prohibited state 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.810
 long enough the truth wakes up 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.840
 these birds are much faster 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.760
 and here on the stone boulders beauties son 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.380
 newspaper system to colonel 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.450
 does more than one gigabyte which is quite 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.260
 comparable to the volume required 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.310
 signature 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.820
 for this hard drive 160 GB who does not 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.880
 quite a penny but quite acceptable 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.680
 the population of our model has a capacity of what 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.260
 four gigabytes will be canceled 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.660
 perhaps too cramped we, too, nothing terrible 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.840
 it is clear that here they will arrive in advance 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.180
 total 4 8 gigabytes of storage as a result 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.700
 configurations of this post apparently 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.940
 nobody else 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.450
 visually speed 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.360
 corsa systems are very high this is a big 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.700
 Seven immediately surprises and conquers 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300
 in a few years since identifying the premises 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.090
 brings windows vista on this platform 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.370
 just share how fast 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.650
 the windows are opening a complicated bathroom method 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.520
 jump list 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160
 load applications 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.210
 if we compare windows 7 old 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.830
 light then there is no time around on one 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.860
 level in reality can be faster but not 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.860
 less and that's good 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.500
 there are a number of things in windows 7 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.530
 which will be useful when working with Nabucco 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.490
 so son center 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.930
 rite which can be useful when 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.020
 work with archives files we border it 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.610
 center prize number 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.690
 This is important given that he is often 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.810
 so intense 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.420
 takeaway mobility itself is so interesting total damage 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.970
 years which allows you to conveniently manage 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.320
 a number of system parameters 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.500
 related to 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.310
 work with projectors is simplified as much as possible 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.150
 which is useful if used for 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.860
 of life 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.890
 now when the leftovers figures 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.780
 Tatyana making a snbo who was 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.440
 shot to 7 shows 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.699
 unexpected result 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.569
 seven most cases behind and 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.989
 Strongly some test packs of letters 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.659
 count even two marks 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.119
 but such a failure 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.049
 on the one hand, yes, the program has become something 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.729
 backup think platform but there is also 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.749
 another explanation of the river basin but 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.299
 exactly heavy system but it is very flexible 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.669
 manage computer resources 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.039
 multitasking 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.019
 if in front of us are 300 all running 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.179
 applications native senator gives 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.709
 maximum priority and almost all 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.219
 system resources of the program with which 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.409
 currently working 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.129
 user 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.980
 while taking away from those who work in 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.089
 background 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:44.869
 about purely beautiful slightly deceiving 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:46.809
 bias in favor of the user in favor of 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:48.309
 man is very good 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:49.809
 notice that working with one priority 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.499
 the challenge is just that mode which 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.939
 read 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.150
 heavy operating system must grandfather 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.119
 manifest it will end and judging by 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:01.119
 he goes to all this 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:03.199
 and tracks and our free to work on 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.239
 Bug shows that the seven work time 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.009
 battery life not only reduces parts 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.049
 not critical 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.109
 so case with 101 office work 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.359
 there are only four hours left instead 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.599
 five dead is not scary 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.579
 abilities up to 7 competently work out 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.189
 six particulars instantly turn on and 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.099
 power off flash drives responding 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.889
 winchester 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.569
 according to Putin's raise this we with 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.909
 this type of drives but in practice 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.159
 tips 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.159
 t 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.539
 and so popular at fault 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:34.289
 despite the fact that today the courts are all 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.019
 overflowed not the final version 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.399
 operating system 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.129
 can be quite confident to say 2 approach 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.919
 if vista up to 1 2 courses is the most suitable 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.809
 seven certainly help you 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.849
 It should be noted that we experimented with 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.159
 Altynbayev version here then as for any 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.089
 intended other 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:55.019
 simpler version of starter edition 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.379
 will it be easier and faster than baltimore 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.179
 it's hard to say 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.519
 so far microsoft has stood os policy 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.209
 let's say the installation of the same 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.309
 engines for everything that moves a cube 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.260
 we ash 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.479
 to home 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.749
 in order to cut their 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.259
 costs and make only one product 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:12.699
 they are several times 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.509
 how will the question be whether such 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.949
 activation of the kernel and set of services 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.609
 and applications herd leading as they say 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.159
 wait and see 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.830
 but for now, as shown by our s 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.279
 space with the version of alkyne ethnomusic all 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:27.349
 good enough 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.379
 so if you are tired of all disputes with 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.400
 him but yours for purchase 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.210
 please print release candidate 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.210
 experiment rates
