00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.330
 that my pseudonym willi safari 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:18.199
 have a valuable information for 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:21.689
 she's the audi a 12 here's harry willi 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.050
 it's about the audi a 12 that's the one 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.390
 audi if so this big space model 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.660
 namely, the car is in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.900
 at the moment they do not want my property 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.900
 or what 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.989
 I expected that and shortly to 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.370
 prehistory I have the model in a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.829
 certain paul foster taken off in miami 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.620
 table car mobile corporation miami is 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.660
 in my possession is the last 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.600
 Thursdays on the ship like you 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.640
 disguised in a coffee crate 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.090
 big yes but i want to be honest with you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090
 say 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.030
 in that case in the case probably 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.250
 not what a bit 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.670
 funny is the model of what I have 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.490
 is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.340
 he had such a black cement weight on 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.080
 underbody is a bit light 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.119
 but since doing nothing for the thing 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.829
 could make an arrangement for the photo i have 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.939
 actually , there's a little bit of bumping up there 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.619
 More interest because you have to 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.509
 I understand so far always in 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.600
 treats weapons and not with 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.939
 mobile and therefore you can mine 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:58.110
 identity is not so easy 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:02:00.299
 divulge it has no idea of the post 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.710
 something tells of a prototype and 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.710
 it taped and everything 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.680
 we sat there as we sat by chance 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.019
 together with the restaurant 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.940
 once it was the mister foster who was 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:27.630
 then quickly drunk and thought 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:29.190
 The chance I can say so much 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.470
 that the media volunteered 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:54.660
 has again the sales team to throw 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:56.040
 sheet in germany want to have the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.079
 still no photo I have the on it 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.019
 ship and then off so first that 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.340
 the way is not yet known 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.569
 because I have a bit so as to 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.640
 Freighter they want somewhere 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:13.470
 collect there but I guess even the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:21.350
 week basically interest 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.350
 really good, of course 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.410
