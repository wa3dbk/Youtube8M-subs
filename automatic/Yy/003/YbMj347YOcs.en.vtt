00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.430
 Today I want the function of bmw 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.980
 connected drive app in interaction with 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:18.140
 the bmw professional of the npd generation 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.270
 in a bmbf 32 at year 2014 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.980
 demonstrate 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.210
 using a tablet from 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.310
 Samsung 7.0 as it is at the moment 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.720
 not yet connected i would 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.550
 then again with what you show 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.790
 for that too is still needed 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.860
 equipment usb connection which is at 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.570
 Use me here in the center console 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.610
 I do that for normal samsung 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.970
 cable so nothing special but 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.790
 whatever comes with the device 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.950
 now connect directly to us 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:01:01.430
 here in the center console the usb socket 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:01:02.480
 Do you look at it and have it 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.649
 device already reported 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.299
 connected as media device and now does 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:15.579
 already something and we see we 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.579
 now that the connect app is loading 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.119
 connecting 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.900
 unfortunately that does not support that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.160
 landscape mode 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.500
 that means I should have now 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.150
 actually turn but I renounce 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.330
 now on the device to tears 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.800
 and up here we can see already 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.580
 that the device itself is connected like 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.580
 let's go over menu connected 3 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.520
 and here we have the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.870
 apps if the device with 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.610
 you can find it more automatically 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.180
 about the connection wizard yet 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.100
 connect 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.390
 this has worked automatically 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.490
 I 've connected the device before 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.240
 So no problem at all 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.190
 requirement is android 4.2 below 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.790
 the app does not work that way then 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.890
 Here we go 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.350
 the apps I am now on the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.600
 device turned it on that it 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.070
 Standard apps can also be added 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.090
 facebook and twitter at the moment 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.430
 install that makes but in mine 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.050
 eyes little sense facebook is little 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.610
 functional there it is still over 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.680
 smartphone or the web is getting better 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.550
 personally, I do not use twitter 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.560
 So it makes little sense so here 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.330
 we can see the eco pro analysis you can 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.390
 understand the consumption over 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.310
 the consumption history look at us 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.040
 Personally, I do not use it because of me 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.120
 was just as see fit 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.270
 that does not make me such an app 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.400
 influence 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.470
 then we have the wiki local find that 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.620
 I actually quite interesting there 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.610
 Become information about different 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.460
 Points of view on facilities in the 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.290
 against where you are right now 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.750
 there if we fade in now we look 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.790
 let's see what he's showing me here okay 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.880
 we already have a youth meeting seven times 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.960
 tell michael that you can 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.960
 can be made 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.640
 and that should be enough for now 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.160
 you can then navigate behind it 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.650
 you can put that up witty next 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.060
 so this article is actually right 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.410
 funny if you ever jam any sample 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.610
 then you can talk a bit about it 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.750
 read where you are right now 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.290
 Personally, I do not have calendars now 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.010
 furnished there you can also his 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.720
 google things with you 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.950
 I myself do not use the dates 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.930
 that you have seen now are the ones 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.959
 from the phone but as far as I know 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.739
 you also have Google calendar data with 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.739
 synchronize 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.959
 news, I have nothing underlined that now 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.140
 you would also have to on the device 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.760
 configure 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.379
 as I said, I did not do that 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.540
 I do not use that either, I am waiting here 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.920
 is announced on the bmw app store 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.920
 and then hope 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.030
 so I have the bmw here again 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.410
 app started directly on the device with it 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.820
 you can also see it again 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.680
 Here we see the individual 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.199
 programs that are already preconfigured 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.090
 on the device and here you can then 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.650
 pull up more apps 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.199
 here you can see, for example, facebook and 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.889
 twitter then you just keep pulling that 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.410
 in the upper area and then it would have to 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.330
 Now yes I would have to configure 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:53.750
 That's not what you want to do now 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.750
 make then appears 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.810
 Now it's down again 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.520
 usually when you are configured 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.580
 turns up here and then becomes 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.300
 also in the actual nwt navi with 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.300
 appropriate
