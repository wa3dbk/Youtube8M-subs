00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.750 

I've<00:00:07.379> always<00:00:07.649> been<00:00:07.889> inquisitive<00:00:08.490> about

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
I've always been inquisitive about

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.730 
I've always been inquisitive about
things<00:00:09.539> how<00:00:09.840> things<00:00:10.110> work<00:00:10.639> and<00:00:12.049> I<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.590> always

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
things how things work and I have always

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.099 
things how things work and I have always
had<00:00:13.859> a<00:00:14.010> sort<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.279> discovery<00:00:14.879> bug<00:00:15.119> like<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
had a sort of discovery bug like the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.929 
had a sort of discovery bug like the
idea<00:00:16.439> of<00:00:16.529> trying<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.890> figure<00:00:17.160> things<00:00:17.340> out<00:00:17.609> and

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
idea of trying to figure things out and

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.810 
idea of trying to figure things out and
how<00:00:18.330> things<00:00:18.570> work<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.310> research<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.340> seeing

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
how things work and research to seeing

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.179 
how things work and research to seeing
the<00:00:20.999> obvious<00:00:21.660> thing<00:00:21.839> to<00:00:21.869> apply<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.859> focus

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the obvious thing to apply to the focus

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.700 
the obvious thing to apply to the focus
of<00:00:23.279> my<00:00:23.400> research<00:00:23.579> is<00:00:24.179> on<00:00:24.480> wind<00:00:25.079> heeling<00:00:25.349> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
of my research is on wind heeling and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.439 
of my research is on wind heeling and
the<00:00:25.829> mouth<00:00:26.009> iron<00:00:26.429> dance<00:00:26.699> again<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.300> we've

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the mouth iron dance again so we've

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.429 
the mouth iron dance again so we've
designed<00:00:29.449> biomaterials<00:00:30.449> made<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.169> collagen

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
designed biomaterials made of collagen

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.950 
designed biomaterials made of collagen
and<00:00:31.919> some<00:00:32.279> proteins<00:00:33.090> called<00:00:33.270> Mitra<00:00:33.600> cellular

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
and some proteins called Mitra cellular

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.750 
and some proteins called Mitra cellular
proteins<00:00:34.380> which<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.710> normally<00:00:34.890> expressed

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
proteins which are normally expressed

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.750 
proteins which are normally expressed
during<00:00:35.940> wind<00:00:36.239> heeling<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.250> we've<00:00:38.250> had<00:00:38.460> great

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
during wind heeling and we've had great

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
during wind heeling and we've had great
success<00:00:38.880> and<00:00:39.330> diabetic<00:00:40.050> models<00:00:40.470> of<00:00:40.650> seeing

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
success and diabetic models of seeing

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.460 
success and diabetic models of seeing
these<00:00:41.190> winds<00:00:41.520> close<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.420> five<00:00:43.140> or<00:00:43.290> ten

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
these winds close up to five or ten

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.500 
these winds close up to five or ten
times<00:00:43.740> faster<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.610> second<00:00:45.030> area<00:00:45.150> that<00:00:45.390> we're

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
times faster the second area that we're

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.990 
times faster the second area that we're
working<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:45.990> is<00:00:46.610> regeneration<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
working on is regeneration of the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.730 
working on is regeneration of the
periodontal<00:00:48.990> structures<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.560> two

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
periodontal structures the two

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.950 
periodontal structures the two
supporting<00:00:50.310> structures<00:00:50.760> after<00:00:51.150> periodontal

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
supporting structures after periodontal

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
supporting structures after periodontal
disease<00:00:52.290> so<00:00:53.100> again<00:00:53.370> we've<00:00:53.550> designed<00:00:53.730> another

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
disease so again we've designed another

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.540 
disease so again we've designed another
couple<00:00:54.540> of<00:00:54.600> membranes<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.280> really<00:00:56.280> screw

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
couple of membranes that really screw

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.110 
couple of membranes that really screw
factors<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.420> mimic<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.560> structure<00:00:58.830> of<00:00:59.220> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
factors or mimic the structure of the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.270 
factors or mimic the structure of the
periodontal<00:01:00.660> ligament<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.560> try<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.860> get<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
periodontal ligament to try to get the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.249 
periodontal ligament to try to get the
sales<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.880> stem<00:01:03.120> cells<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.540> exist<00:01:03.900> in<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
sales the stem cells they exist in the

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.140 
sales the stem cells they exist in the

periodontal ligament to migrate often be
generated<00:01:06.659> tissues<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.259> our<00:01:07.890> focus<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
generated tissues so our focus is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.860 
generated tissues so our focus is
related<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.120> change<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> microenvironment

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
related to change the microenvironment

related to change the microenvironment
of<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.909> wouldn't<00:01:11.909> areas<00:01:12.480> and<00:01:12.750> recruit<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
of these wouldn't areas and recruit the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.500 
of these wouldn't areas and recruit the
necessary<00:01:14.400> cells<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.300> using

necessary cells and there by using
biomaterials<00:01:16.290> one<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> things<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.520> we

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
biomaterials one of the things that we

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.310 
biomaterials one of the things that we
found<00:01:17.909> although<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.300> don't<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.600> why<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.260> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
found although we don't know why is that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.490 
found although we don't know why is that
the<00:01:20.010> scaffold<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.550> we<00:01:20.760> were<00:01:21.060> placing<00:01:21.630> causes

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the scaffold that we were placing causes

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.850 
the scaffold that we were placing causes
vascularization<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.640> wound<00:01:23.820> bed<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.860> we

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
vascularization of the wound bed and we

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.440 
vascularization of the wound bed and we
were<00:01:25.950> very<00:01:26.100> excited<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.030> we're<00:01:27.300> not

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
were very excited about that we're not

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.050 
were very excited about that we're not
sure<00:01:27.630> exactly<00:01:27.990> why<00:01:28.440> it's<00:01:28.620> happening<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.460> I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
sure exactly why it's happening but I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.250 
sure exactly why it's happening but I
think<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:31.020> terms<00:01:31.260> of<00:01:31.440> potential<00:01:32.159> impact<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
think in terms of potential impact and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.219 
think in terms of potential impact and
something<00:01:34.260> i<00:01:34.409> saw<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.860> make<00:01:35.040> me<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.340> i<00:01:35.370> go<00:01:35.520> wow

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
something i saw that make me so i go wow

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.500 
something i saw that make me so i go wow
that's<00:01:37.229> probably<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.610> drive<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.090> really<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
that's probably the drive is really to

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.140 
that's probably the drive is really to
try<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.400> rid<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> these<00:01:41.850> things

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
try to to get rid of these things

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.820 
try to to get rid of these things
because<00:01:42.330> people<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.840> dying<00:01:43.110> when<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.590> don't

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
because people are dying when they don't

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.560 
because people are dying when they don't
need<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.250> die<00:01:44.400> through<00:01:44.820> things<00:01:45.479> like

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
need to die through things like

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.359 
need to die through things like
septicemia<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> winds<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.220> not

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
septicemia because the winds are not

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.120 
septicemia because the winds are not
causing<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:49.080> reality<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.740> there<00:01:49.950> is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
causing and the reality is that there is

causing and the reality is that there is
no<00:01:50.340> reproducible<00:01:50.970> treatment<00:01:51.470> periodontal

no reproducible treatment periodontal

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.649 
no reproducible treatment periodontal
disease<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.190> something<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.970> people<00:01:54.030> suffer

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
disease is something that people suffer

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.539 
disease is something that people suffer
from<00:01:54.690> again<00:01:55.260> we<00:01:55.890> don't<00:01:56.010> believe<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.430> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
from again we don't believe that this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.590 
from again we don't believe that this

we can regenerate the stuff eighty

this<00:02:19.150> year<00:02:19.209> from<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.900> chronic<00:02:20.110> wound<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.819> I

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
this year from a chronic wound and so I

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180 
this year from a chronic wound and so I
think<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:22.750> genuinely<00:02:23.050> can<00:02:23.709> come<00:02:23.950> up<00:02:24.040> with

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
think we genuinely can come up with

think we genuinely can come up with
things<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.550> heal<00:02:24.700> these<00:02:24.850> things<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.410> we've

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
things to heal these things and so we've

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.590 
things to heal these things and so we've
been<00:02:26.770> very<00:02:26.830> aggressive<00:02:27.160> with<00:02:27.760> filing<00:02:28.120> patents

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
been very aggressive with filing patents

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.900 
been very aggressive with filing patents
and<00:02:28.750> things<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.110> make<00:02:29.200> sure<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.590> our

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
and things to make sure that our

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.520 
and things to make sure that our
materials<00:02:30.910> are<00:02:31.090> protected<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:32.050> i<00:02:32.260> think

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
materials are protected because i think

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.440 
materials are protected because i think
the<00:02:33.010> stuff<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.489> translate<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.239> clinic

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
the stuff can translate to the clinic

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.110 
the stuff can translate to the clinic
very<00:02:34.720> rapidly
