00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
the pot can't be jagged it's got to be

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.880 
the pot can't be jagged it's got to be
when<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:10.159> say<00:01:10.400> deep<00:01:10.730> and<00:01:11.150> over<00:01:11.659> I<00:01:12.050> mean<00:01:12.440> clean

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
when I say deep and over I mean clean

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.360 
when I say deep and over I mean clean
deep<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.000> over<00:01:14.300> when<00:01:15.290> I<00:01:15.320> say<00:01:15.440> make<00:01:15.980> the<00:01:16.100> part

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
deep and over when I say make the part

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.700 
deep and over when I say make the part
middle<00:01:16.760> of<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.970> ear<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:17.480> mean<00:01:17.720> not<00:01:18.110> at<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.530> back

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
middle of the ear I mean not at the back

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.050 
middle of the ear I mean not at the back
part<00:01:18.979> of<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.130> year<00:01:19.310> not<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.580> front<00:01:19.760> part<00:01:20.000> of

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
part of the year not the front part of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.880 
part of the year not the front part of
the<00:01:20.120> I<00:01:20.150> mean<00:01:20.270> in<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.570> middle<00:01:20.810> of<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.020> year<00:01:21.200> of

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
the I mean in the middle of the year of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.100 
the I mean in the middle of the year of
course<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.310> has<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.670> be<00:01:22.909> very<00:01:23.210> exactly<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:23.990> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
course it has to be very exactly of the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.140 
course it has to be very exactly of the
duties<00:01:24.409> look<00:01:24.729> there's<00:01:25.729> some<00:01:25.880> things<00:01:26.060> you

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
duties look there's some things you

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.460 
duties look there's some things you
could<00:01:26.270> be<00:01:26.360> looser<00:01:26.690> on<00:01:26.900> there's<00:01:27.140> some<00:01:27.290> things

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
could be looser on there's some things

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.950 
could be looser on there's some things
yet<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.620> be<00:01:27.770> very<00:01:27.950> exact<00:01:28.310> about<00:01:28.600> but<00:01:29.600> more<00:01:29.840> or

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
yet to be very exact about but more or

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.440 
yet to be very exact about but more or
less<00:01:30.070> when<00:01:31.070> you're<00:01:31.460> teasing<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:32.030> look<00:01:32.270> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
less when you're teasing this look and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.820 
less when you're teasing this look and
you're<00:01:32.540> rolling<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.140> as<00:01:33.530> you're<00:01:33.680> rolling

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
you're rolling it in as you're rolling

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.350 
you're rolling it in as you're rolling
it<00:01:34.040> high<00:01:34.310> you're<00:01:34.580> not<00:01:34.700> rolling<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.270> has

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
it high you're not rolling it so it has

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.570 
it high you're not rolling it so it has
a<00:01:35.390> big<00:01:35.630> donut<00:01:35.990> color<00:01:36.260> here<00:01:36.530> get<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.220> roll<00:01:37.370> so<00:01:37.549> you

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
a big donut color here get a roll so you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.640 
a big donut color here get a roll so you
flatten<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.270> piece<00:01:38.510> out<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:38.960> roll<00:01:39.170> into<00:01:39.440> it

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
flatten that piece out and roll into it

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.950 
flatten that piece out and roll into it
that's<00:01:40.340> what<00:01:40.490> gives<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.790> more<00:01:41.000> modern<00:01:41.210> life

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
that's what gives it a more modern life

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.230 
that's what gives it a more modern life
if<00:01:42.470> I<00:01:42.650> did<00:01:42.799> it<00:01:42.860> with<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.010> big<00:01:43.220> donut<00:01:43.729> hole<00:01:43.940> in<00:01:44.150> it

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
if I did it with a big donut hole in it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.450 
if I did it with a big donut hole in it
it<00:01:44.360> looks<00:01:44.510> like<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.750> nineteen<00:01:45.080> forties<00:01:45.460> too

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
it looks like the nineteen forties too

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.969 
it looks like the nineteen forties too
much<00:01:46.700> we're<00:01:47.659> not<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.290> good<00:01:48.530> we<00:01:48.619> want<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:48.860> to

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
much we're not it's good we want it to

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.380 
much we're not it's good we want it to
roll<00:01:49.159> but<00:01:49.369> that's<00:01:49.490> too<00:01:49.580> flat<00:01:49.850> either<00:01:50.060> but

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
roll but that's too flat either but

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.480 
roll but that's too flat either but
enough<00:01:50.600> would<00:01:50.930> have<00:01:51.049> enough<00:01:51.229> volume<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:52.340> yet

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
enough would have enough volume but yet

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.160 
enough would have enough volume but yet
still<00:01:52.670> more<00:01:53.060> modern<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.690> pull<00:01:53.930> back<00:01:54.110> a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
still more modern so you pull back a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.620 
still more modern so you pull back a
little<00:01:54.320> bit<00:01:54.560> as<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.799> roll<00:01:55.010> it<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:56.270> rolls<00:01:56.540> have

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
little bit as you roll it the rolls have

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.289 
little bit as you roll it the rolls have
to<00:01:56.810> be<00:01:56.900> clean<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.440> neat<00:01:57.790> can't<00:01:58.790> over<00:01:58.970> spray

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
to be clean and neat can't over spray

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.750 
to be clean and neat can't over spray
them<00:01:59.540> and<00:01:59.840> you<00:02:00.350> spray<00:02:00.650> gonna<00:02:00.860> spray<00:02:01.130> far<00:02:01.460> back

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
them and you spray gonna spray far back

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.330 
them and you spray gonna spray far back
a<00:02:02.150> little<00:02:02.450> bit<00:02:02.630> just<00:02:02.689> enough<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.470> help<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.159> out

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
a little bit just enough to help you out

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.190 
a little bit just enough to help you out
a<00:02:04.369> little<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.909> roll<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.840> spray<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.049> little

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
a little you roll and you spray a little

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.450 
a little you roll and you spray a little
bit<00:02:06.350> more<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.740> that's<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.100> don't<00:02:07.189> want<00:02:07.369> it

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
bit more and that's it you don't want it

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.880 
bit more and that's it you don't want it
you<00:02:07.700> don't<00:02:08.000> want<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.299> see<00:02:08.450> caked<00:02:08.899> hairspray<00:02:09.769> on

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
you don't want to see caked hairspray on

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.779 
you don't want to see caked hairspray on
the<00:02:10.009> runway
