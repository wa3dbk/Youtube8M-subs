provided with a certain amount of energy

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.670 
provided with a certain amount of energy
and<00:00:50.610> let's<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:50.850> go<00:00:51.090> ahead<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.270> play<00:00:51.680> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and let's just go ahead and play and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.310 
and let's just go ahead and play and
I'll<00:00:52.800> show<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.100> each<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.120> these<00:00:54.420> blocks

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
I'll show you each one of these blocks

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.840 
I'll show you each one of these blocks
with<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> number<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.219> represents<00:00:56.730> an

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
with a number and it represents an

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.479 
with a number and it represents an
amount<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.180> energy<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
amount of energy and you see here that I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.209 
amount of energy and you see here that I
have<00:00:59.670> an<00:01:00.030> energy<00:01:00.300> cash<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> bottom<00:01:01.530> left

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
have an energy cash at the bottom left

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.490 
have an energy cash at the bottom left
and<00:01:02.460> currently<00:01:03.059> 750<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.080> gonna<00:01:04.229> go<00:01:04.320> ahead<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and currently 750 I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.890 
and currently 750 I'm gonna go ahead and
go<00:01:04.619> back<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.129> got<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.000> level<00:01:06.299> 5<00:01:06.540> because<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
go back I got it on level 5 because I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
go back I got it on level 5 because I
want<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> challenge<00:01:07.409> myself<00:01:07.770> let<00:01:08.189> me<00:01:08.250> go<00:01:08.400> level

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
want to challenge myself let me go level

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.030 
want to challenge myself let me go level
2<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.360> try<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.770> i<00:01:13.799> have

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
2 and and try that as you can see i have

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830 
2 and and try that as you can see i have
a<00:01:14.220> thousand<00:01:14.790> energy<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.299> there's<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> time

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
a thousand energy and there's a time

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.140 
a thousand energy and there's a time
limit<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.470> score<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.250> level<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.000> it's

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
limit and a score and a level so it's

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.090 
limit and a score and a level so it's
pretty<00:01:18.299> basic<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.110> drag<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.740> finger

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
pretty basic you just drag your finger

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.999 
pretty basic you just drag your finger
across<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:21.180> move<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> ball<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.830> go

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
across to move the ball and as you go

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.460 
across to move the ball and as you go
across<00:01:23.130> each<00:01:23.670> block<00:01:24.150> with<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.720> certain<00:01:25.320> amount

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
across each block with a certain amount

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.740 
across each block with a certain amount
of<00:01:25.590> energy<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> subtracts<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.390> from

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
of energy in it it subtracts that from

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.780 
of energy in it it subtracts that from
your<00:01:28.229> energy<00:01:28.650> cash<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.369> pretty<00:01:29.640> much

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
your energy cash and that's pretty much

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.770 
your energy cash and that's pretty much
the<00:01:29.970> object<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> game<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
the object of the game now the the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.590 
the object of the game now the the
premise<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:35.939> less<00:01:36.150> energy<00:01:36.479> as

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
premise is to use as less energy as

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.960 
premise is to use as less energy as
possible<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.140> he<00:01:37.170> sees<00:01:37.409> 50<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.070> 100<00:01:38.460> balls<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
possible so he sees 50 and 100 balls and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.020 
possible so he sees 50 and 100 balls and
all<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.290> probably<00:01:40.590> want<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
all these you you probably want to and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.649 
all these you you probably want to and
i'm<00:01:42.150> having<00:01:42.420> trouble<00:01:42.450> here<00:01:43.070> there<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.399> i

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
i'm having trouble here there we go i

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.940 
i'm having trouble here there we go i
believe<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.780> my<00:01:45.960> screen<00:01:46.200> protector<00:01:46.770> that's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
believe is my screen protector that's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
believe is my screen protector that's
causing<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> little<00:01:48.899> less

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
causing it to to be a little less

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.170 
causing it to to be a little less
sensitive<00:01:49.590> than<00:01:49.649> i<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:50.070> wanted<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.610> but

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
sensitive than i would wanted to be but

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.389 
sensitive than i would wanted to be but
you<00:01:51.750> would<00:01:51.899> want<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> follow<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.740> route<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
you would want to follow the route that

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.999 
you would want to follow the route that
has<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.000> least<00:01:54.180> amount<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.600> energy<00:01:54.750> now<00:01:55.710> may

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
has the least amount of energy now may

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.399 
has the least amount of energy now may
look<00:01:56.189> easy<00:01:56.490> i'm<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.930> i<00:01:58.020> said<00:01:58.200> i'm<00:01:58.290> on

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
look easy i'm on the like i said i'm on

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.310 
look easy i'm on the like i said i'm on
level<00:01:58.820> level<00:01:59.820> two<00:02:00.119> right<00:02:00.420> now<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.630> real<00:02:01.110> easy

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
level level two right now it's real easy

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.130 
level level two right now it's real easy
to<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.829> go<00:02:01.979> across<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.700> bang<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
to just go across and bang it out and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
to just go across and bang it out and
again<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.619> screen<00:02:05.219> protector<00:02:05.640> may<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.000> causing

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
again my screen protector may be causing

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.839 
again my screen protector may be causing
this<00:02:06.659> I'm<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:06.869> sure<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.670> sometimes<00:02:08.670> it's

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
this I'm not sure but sometimes it's

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.290 
this I'm not sure but sometimes it's
just<00:02:08.879> there<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.420> go

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.700 

you<00:02:16.300> can<00:02:16.450> see<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.660> pretty<00:02:16.930> simple<00:02:17.140> right<00:02:17.410> just

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
you can see is pretty simple right just

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.100 
you can see is pretty simple right just
ding<00:02:17.950> ding<00:02:18.310> ding<00:02:18.550> ding<00:02:21.180> all<00:02:22.180> right<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.810> you

see that's easy right I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.060 
see that's easy right I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:24.460> kick<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.120> up<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.450> level<00:02:25.720> 5<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.710> can<00:02:26.860> see

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
and kick it up to level 5 you can see

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.940 
and kick it up to level 5 you can see
where<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.460> challenge<00:02:28.210> will<00:02:28.510> come<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:28.870> now<00:02:29.770> see

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
where the challenge will come in now see

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.800 
where the challenge will come in now see
the<00:02:30.070> time<00:02:30.280> limits<00:02:30.670> 10<00:02:30.880> seconds<00:02:31.360> now<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.750> you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the time limits 10 seconds now and you

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
the time limits 10 seconds now and you
only<00:02:31.990> have<00:02:32.250> 750<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:33.630> 750<00:02:34.630> energy<00:02:35.440> and

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
only have 750 and it's 750 energy and

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.920 
only have 750 and it's 750 energy and
there's<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.190> pretty<00:02:36.460> good<00:02:36.580> chance<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.330> you're

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
there's a pretty good chance that you're

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.120 
there's a pretty good chance that you're
going<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.110> run<00:02:38.260> out<00:02:38.320> of<00:02:38.440> energy<00:02:38.590> if<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:38.980> take

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
going to run out of energy if you take

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.440 
going to run out of energy if you take
the<00:02:39.250> wrong<00:02:39.460> route<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.910> they'll<00:02:40.000> let<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.300> know

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the wrong route and they'll let you know

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.750 
the wrong route and they'll let you know
pretty<00:02:40.690> quickly<00:02:41.020> see<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.280> ran<00:02:42.610> out

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
pretty quickly see that that I ran out

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.210 
pretty quickly see that that I ran out
of<00:02:42.790> time<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.030> think<00:02:43.360> on<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.540> one<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.110> used<00:02:45.100> too

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
of time I think on that one I used too

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.700 
of time I think on that one I used too
much<00:02:45.340> energy<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:46.290> got<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.380> follow<00:02:47.530> these

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
much energy I got to follow these

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.160 
much energy I got to follow these
fifties<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.250> hundreds<00:02:48.670> there<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.150> go<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.630> got

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
fifties and hundreds there we go I got

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
here to I'm not too crazy about it let

first<00:03:12.580> but<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.210> started<00:03:13.480> getting<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.930> much<00:03:14.820> I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
first but it started getting that much I

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.390 
first but it started getting that much I
like<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.510> though<00:03:16.690> it's<00:03:17.440> good<00:03:17.680> for<00:03:17.710> show<00:03:18.100> but

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
like it though it's good for show but

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.640 
like it though it's good for show but
after<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.850> while<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.030> was<00:03:19.240> like<00:03:19.360> I<00:03:19.570> turn<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.470> off

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
after a while I was like I turn it off

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.070 
after a while I was like I turn it off
plus<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.760> can<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.240> guys<00:03:22.480> probably<00:03:22.690> could<00:03:22.930> hear

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
plus I can you guys probably could hear

level 5 I get a lot more buzzes than I

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.260 
level 5 I get a lot more buzzes than I
do<00:03:38.340> for<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.900> instead<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:42.280> magical
