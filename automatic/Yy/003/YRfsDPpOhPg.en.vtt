00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
which sailrite does not offer because we

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.319 
which sailrite does not offer because we
prefer<00:00:30.929> slow<00:00:31.439> speed<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.070> power<00:00:32.279> as<00:00:32.610> opposed

power with the clutch motor it's not

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.910 
power with the clutch motor it's not
quite<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:12.030> good<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.660> mc-scr<00:02:12.989> system

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
quite as good as the mc-scr system

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.740 
quite as good as the mc-scr system
they're<00:02:14.040> supposed<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.580> be<00:02:14.730> where'd<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.629> get

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
they're supposed to be where'd you get

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.540 
they're supposed to be where'd you get
the<00:02:15.930> hang<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.260> operating<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> foot<00:02:17.220> pedal

the hang of operating the foot pedal

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.699 
the hang of operating the foot pedal
it's<00:02:17.670> really<00:02:17.940> very<00:02:18.060> reasonable<00:02:18.720> here's<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
it's really very reasonable here's the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's really very reasonable here's the
reverse<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:20.550> were<00:02:20.640> talking<00:02:20.849> about<00:02:21.090> of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
reverse that we were talking about of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.240 
reverse that we were talking about of
course<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.959> buggy<00:02:22.170> motor<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:23.099> also

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
course with the buggy motor you also

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.869 
course with the buggy motor you also
have<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.879> fairly<00:02:24.629> good<00:02:24.780> quick<00:02:25.560> speed<00:02:26.370> range<00:02:26.670> as

have a fairly good quick speed range as

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:35.390 
have a fairly good quick speed range as
well<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:32.190> by<00:02:32.340> heeling<00:02:32.790> back<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:35.220> will

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
well just by heeling back and that will

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.460 
well just by heeling back and that will
break<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.670> machines<00:02:36.209> up<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.629> if<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.260> watch

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
break the machines up you if you watch

my I'm going to bury my needle let me

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.320 
my I'm going to bury my needle let me
turn<00:02:40.170> now<00:02:42.260> if<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.410> watch<00:02:43.620> my<00:02:43.980> my<00:02:44.730> foot

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
turn now if you watch my my foot

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.660 
turn now if you watch my my foot
I<00:02:45.360> feel<00:02:46.019> back<00:02:46.310> you'll<00:02:47.310> see<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.640> machine<00:02:47.910> stop

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670

so you have that brake function with

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.040 
so you have that brake function with
this<00:02:55.319> clutch<00:02:55.620> motor<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.879> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.540> see<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:57.900> can

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
this clutch motor but you can see we can

eight layers of material and beading is

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.940 
eight layers of material and beading is
not<00:03:03.090> an<00:03:03.269> issue<00:03:03.390> even<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.230> get<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.440> bolt<00:03:04.709> like

not an issue even if I get a bolt like

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.920 
not an issue even if I get a bolt like

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
mechanism on the machine as possible so

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.930 
mechanism on the machine as possible so
while<00:04:22.350> we're<00:04:22.530> carrying<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:23.160> foot<00:04:23.460> out<00:04:23.490> to

while we're carrying that foot out to
that<00:04:24.120> width<00:04:24.420> you<00:04:24.720> might<00:04:24.930> as<00:04:24.990> well<00:04:25.140> create<00:04:25.500> a

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
that width you might as well create a

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.770 
that width you might as well create a
slot<00:04:25.890> wide<00:04:26.250> enough<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.610> allow<00:04:26.970> for<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.240> extra

zigzag with the wider the foot is the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.660 
zigzag with the wider the foot is the
more<00:04:30.810> purchase<00:04:31.260> power<00:04:31.530> we<00:04:32.100> get<00:04:32.280> on<00:04:32.490> the

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
more purchase power we get on the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.800 
more purchase power we get on the
surface<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.270> material

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
surface of the material

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.720 
surface of the material
and<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.140> course<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.650> means<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.100> we<00:04:35.370> end<00:04:35.520> up

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
and of course that means that we end up

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.020 
and of course that means that we end up
with<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.360> much<00:04:37.110> larger<00:04:37.380> bead<00:04:38.040> dog<00:04:38.340> service<00:04:38.880> as

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
with a much larger bead dog service as

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.090 
with a much larger bead dog service as
well<00:04:39.210> on<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.570> underside<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.320> we<00:04:40.410> get<00:04:40.590> more

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
well on the underside so we get more

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.560 
well on the underside so we get more
gripping<00:04:41.430> power<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:42.090> pull<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.450> material

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
gripping power to pull the material

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.780 
gripping power to pull the material
through<00:04:43.170> and<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.980> course<00:04:44.010> as<00:04:44.370> you've<00:04:44.550> seen

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
through and of course as you've seen

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.540 
through and of course as you've seen
watching<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.450> machine<00:04:45.600> sew<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:47.010> upper<00:04:47.340> foot

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
watching the machine sew the upper foot

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.130 
watching the machine sew the upper foot
is<00:04:47.670> a<00:04:47.700> two<00:04:47.940> part<00:04:48.120> assembly<00:04:48.600> so<00:04:48.810> we're<00:04:48.990> getting

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
is a two part assembly so we're getting

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.030 
is a two part assembly so we're getting
a<00:04:49.380> walking<00:04:49.980> foot<00:04:50.280> motion<00:04:51.440> become<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.470> part<00:04:52.770> come

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
a walking foot motion become a part come

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.890 
a walking foot motion become a part come
together<00:04:53.190> clamp<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.970> pull<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.330> material<00:04:54.450> back

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
together clamp to pull the material back

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.930 
together clamp to pull the material back
so<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.170> get<00:04:55.320> extremely<00:04:55.500> positive<00:04:56.370> pull<00:04:56.670> and

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
so you get extremely positive pull and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.790 
so you get extremely positive pull and
beating<00:04:57.300> power<00:04:57.510> out<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.020> machine<00:04:58.320> which

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
beating power out of the machine which

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.040 
beating power out of the machine which
is<00:04:58.980> in<00:04:59.160> part<00:04:59.340> what<00:04:59.640> helps<00:04:59.910> you<00:05:00.060> jump<00:05:00.660> bumps

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
is in part what helps you jump bumps

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
then a linkage that comes up to the

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.720 
then a linkage that comes up to the
other<00:05:48.840> side<00:05:49.140> of<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:49.530> machine<00:05:49.920> and<00:05:50.430> when<00:05:50.610> you

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
other side of the machine and when you

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.980 
other side of the machine and when you
press<00:05:50.970> down<00:05:51.000> on<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.540> path

press down on the path

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.680 
press down on the path
it<00:05:52.800> will<00:05:53.070> lift<00:05:53.700> and<00:05:53.880> lower<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.330> presser<00:05:54.510> foot

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
it will lift and lower the presser foot

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.840 
it will lift and lower the presser foot
and<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.140> get<00:05:55.320> more<00:05:55.500> height<00:05:55.800> using<00:05:56.310> this<00:05:56.490> pedal

point out three things about the clutch

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.590 
point out three things about the clutch
motor<00:06:37.500> that<00:06:37.890> makes<00:06:38.100> it<00:06:38.340> inferior<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.300> the<00:06:39.420> more

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
motor that makes it inferior to the more

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.170 
motor that makes it inferior to the more
expensive<00:06:40.940> mc-scr<00:06:41.940> power<00:06:42.090> system<00:06:44.180> first

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
expensive mc-scr power system first

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.050 
expensive mc-scr power system first
let's<00:06:45.510> shut<00:06:46.080> the<00:06:46.260> Machine<00:06:46.350> off<00:06:46.590> and<00:06:47.100> that<00:06:47.880> will

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
let's shut the Machine off and that will

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.670 
let's shut the Machine off and that will
give<00:06:48.240> us<00:06:48.270> an<00:06:48.570> opportunity<00:06:48.630> to<00:06:49.140> talk<00:06:49.290> about<00:06:49.440> the

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
give us an opportunity to talk about the

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.710 
give us an opportunity to talk about the
first<00:06:49.890> issue<00:06:50.130> and<00:06:50.400> that<00:06:50.490> is<00:06:50.700> noise<00:06:50.940> you<00:06:51.540> get

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
first issue and that is noise you get

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.180 
first issue and that is noise you get
more<00:06:51.960> noise<00:06:52.230> with<00:06:52.590> the<00:06:52.710> clutch<00:06:52.920> system

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
more noise with the clutch system

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.220 
more noise with the clutch system
because<00:06:53.640> the<00:06:53.790> motor<00:06:54.000> is<00:06:54.120> always<00:06:54.600> running<00:06:54.990> then

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
because the motor is always running then

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.110 
because the motor is always running then
you<00:06:55.320> will<00:06:55.500> with<00:06:55.710> the<00:06:56.310> alternative<00:06:56.910> motor

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
you will with the alternative motor

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.050 
you will with the alternative motor
system<00:06:57.510> that<00:06:57.690> we<00:06:57.780> offer<00:06:57.960> which<00:06:58.260> is<00:06:58.410> the<00:06:58.560> mc-scr

system that we offer which is the mc-scr

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.670 
system that we offer which is the mc-scr
the<00:07:00.060> second<00:07:00.480> thing<00:07:00.690> is<00:07:00.900> is<00:07:01.080> that<00:07:01.230> the<00:07:01.350> motor<00:07:01.560> is

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
the second thing is is that the motor is

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.400 
the second thing is is that the motor is
large<00:07:02.190> it's<00:07:02.550> very<00:07:02.820> large<00:07:03.120> and<00:07:03.480> very<00:07:03.750> bulky<00:07:04.050> and

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
large it's very large and very bulky and

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.940 
large it's very large and very bulky and
as<00:07:04.830> a<00:07:04.860> result<00:07:05.310> it's<00:07:05.490> heavy<00:07:05.760> and<00:07:06.530> the<00:07:07.530> motor<00:07:07.740> we

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:07.950 
as a result it's heavy and the motor we

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.580 
as a result it's heavy and the motor we
use<00:07:08.130> for<00:07:08.430> the<00:07:08.520> mc-scr<00:07:09.080> system<00:07:10.080> is<00:07:10.230> a<00:07:10.260> hundred

and twenty volt DC motor which gives you

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.140 
and twenty volt DC motor which gives you
an<00:07:12.960> enormous<00:07:13.200> amount<00:07:13.680> of<00:07:13.770> torque<00:07:14.160> at<00:07:14.790> slow

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
an enormous amount of torque at slow

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.990 
an enormous amount of torque at slow
speed<00:07:15.480> power<00:07:15.780> and<00:07:15.960> can<00:07:16.740> be<00:07:16.920> mated<00:07:17.160> to<00:07:17.970> the

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
speed power and can be mated to the

speed power and can be mated to the
larger<00:07:18.600> diameter<00:07:18.780> not<00:07:19.500> this<00:07:19.680> one<00:07:19.890> but<00:07:20.070> the

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
larger diameter not this one but the

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.030 
larger diameter not this one but the
larger<00:07:20.520> diameter<00:07:20.750> plastic<00:07:21.750> power<00:07:22.470> plus<00:07:22.800> wheel

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.040 
larger diameter plastic power plus wheel

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.710 
larger diameter plastic power plus wheel
that<00:07:23.280> we<00:07:23.430> offer<00:07:23.610> which<00:07:23.940> can<00:07:24.120> even<00:07:24.270> give<00:07:24.540> you

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 
that we offer which can even give you

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.190 
that we offer which can even give you
more<00:07:25.080> slow<00:07:25.770> speed<00:07:26.070> power<00:07:26.370> and<00:07:26.700> torque<00:07:26.910> so<00:07:27.570> we

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.200 
more slow speed power and torque so we

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.410 
more slow speed power and torque so we
get<00:07:28.380> a<00:07:28.410> little<00:07:28.710> bit<00:07:28.920> less<00:07:29.160> power<00:07:29.520> out<00:07:29.910> of<00:07:30.240> the

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.420 
get a little bit less power out of the

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.110 
get a little bit less power out of the
clutch<00:07:30.660> motor<00:07:31.020> and<00:07:31.320> we<00:07:31.950> get<00:07:32.160> certainly<00:07:32.790> less

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 
clutch motor and we get certainly less

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.840 
clutch motor and we get certainly less
control<00:07:33.870> at<00:07:34.200> slow<00:07:34.590> speed<00:07:34.890> operation<00:07:35.340> out<00:07:35.700> of

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:35.850 
control at slow speed operation out of

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.180 
control at slow speed operation out of
this<00:07:36.150> motor<00:07:36.420> system<00:07:36.870> than<00:07:37.260> we<00:07:37.440> do<00:07:37.650> are<00:07:37.980> more

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:38.190 
this motor system than we do are more

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.380 
this motor system than we do are more
expensive<00:07:38.580> mc-scr<00:07:39.300> system<00:07:40.200> and<00:07:40.860> that's<00:07:41.820> it<00:07:42.090> so

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.390 
expensive mc-scr system and that's it so

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.430 
expensive mc-scr system and that's it so
basically<00:07:42.900> one<00:07:43.440> noise<00:07:44.340> to<00:07:45.180> weight<00:07:46.170> of<00:07:46.200> the

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 
basically one noise to weight of the

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.090 
basically one noise to weight of the
