00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.940
 video we're going to talk about 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.150
 ten most interesting records in the world 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.150
 of video games 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.300
 that is, I will tell you about the titanic exploits 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.340
 of the bizarre primates of the follies from 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.770
 guinness related to the videogame world 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.570
 for fairness and in any case for 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.600
 make sure the information is 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.520
 I say to you that the source is Guinness 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.290
 world records gamer's edition 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.910
 the book containing all the English of 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.440
 primates obviously in this case 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.440
 inherent in the world of video games 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.690
 but let's start immediately with the ten most things 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.240
 bizarre videogames 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.730
 the longest game session you know 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.830
 boys when you spend hours attacked 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.350
 your favorite video game at 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.210
 maximum will pass three hours I do not know and for 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.079
 we still have a very game session 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.540
 long already here is forgotten veil 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.090
 in fact the longest game session 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.180
 in the world it was carried out by 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:20.090
 Australian or cankaya who came to 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:23.720
 play for more than 135 hours and repeat 135 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.780
 hours boys but of course consecutive 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.880
 a call of duty black ops two 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.360
 he has practically lost almost six days 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.400
 of his life attacked a screen 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.900
 it would be nice to know how he did it 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.220
 to go to the bathroom without stopping 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.500
 to play 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.840
 however this Australian kid has it 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.150
 christopher lloyd e stole the record 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.190
 beautiful timothy who had had one 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.890
 120 hour session on resistance 3 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.770
 the longest title ever used for a 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.960
 video game is the following breath 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:05.530
 deep affairs, tones, the theme on 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:08.440
 a cute mo hoc but www.food gaucan renai 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.010
 adventure or simply in English 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.500
 white princes of the centuries read it only 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.900
 in English no and in any case it is a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.860
 appointment simulator for 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.410
 playstation 2 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.810
 yes an appointment simulator is 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.000
 released on 25 August 2005 e 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.980
 I would rightly say he never left the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.590
 Japan 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.520
 the most expensive video game in the history of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.490
 videogame world was destiny that 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.910
 with its 500 million dollars spent 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.000
 for production and marketing has 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.860
 surpassed even the most expensive film 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.140
 of the history that is pirates of the Caribbean to the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.900
 the boundaries of the world however not boys 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.180
 worry that activision is back 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.350
 of expenses in a single day of sales 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.959
 wow 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:02.010
 if the largest explorable scenario 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.959
 among video games is that of minecraft 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.540
 in fact among the numerous records held 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.050
 from this game also a game map 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.350
 theoretically infinite but everything has a 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:19.120
 limit and its is over 4 billion 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.850
 of square kilometers 4 billion e 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.250
 so this is a limit to be 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.860
 obviously from guinness 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.550
 the videogame series with the active brand 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.920
 has long been that of space invaders 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.860
 and let us say that he is the true proper dean 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.510
 the arcade shooter series indeed 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.340
 was born in 1978 and still today with many 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.580
 readjustments continues to churn out 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.400
 chapters for example the last title of 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.160
 this space invaders brand was released in 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.920
 2010 for playstation 3 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.170
 the record for the longest period of 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.920
 development dedicated to a game 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.110
 it is up to duke nukem forever that pur 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.180
 being the most tamarro hero in the world 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:10.569
 videogame was announced in 1997 and 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.930
 but only in 2011 so well after 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.690
 14 years of waiting managed to get out 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.940
 even if the title despite everything 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.350
 this development time made water from 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.389
 all parts with huge problems 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:29.260
 technicians the best-selling console of the 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:34.120
 history is the mythical playstation 2 that with 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.000
 its 150 7.68 million units yes 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.770
 finds the command of this ranking 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.350
 followed we say a short distance from 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.220
 internal of ii ii with 154 88 million 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.680
 units sold 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.960
 moreover in order not to miss anything 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.910
 sony home console also owns the 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.470
 record for the largest number of 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.350
 video games sold over 1.66 thousand 195 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.630
 billions of units 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.340
 however for xbox fans microsoft has 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.280
 however, the computers that sell so much 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.580
 by we are almost equal to the edition 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.220
 special most expensive ever to be 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.060
 was however actually sold is the 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:20.530
 mono edition of grid 2 whose price is 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.289
 well over 125 thousand pounds just under 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.870
 160 thousand euros and the guy you are 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.880
 you bought this special edition 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.880
 brought home a real one 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.580
 bachmann is ready to be guided with 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.540
 obviously the game however without dlc se 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.790
 it wouldn't cost too much 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.790
 and you would all be spending these money for 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.460
 a special edition the modern brand 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.400
 best selling is the assassin's creed 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.270
 and with a chapter a year starting from 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.210
 2007 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.170
 except for 2008 however it has reached the 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.090
 73 million copies sold 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:59.450
 without yet counting the various fires 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.310
 in united having recently left and if i 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.200
 Assassin's creed fans are more 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.660
 for example those decoded 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.210
 gta or fifa 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.760
 last but not least the most 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.720
 large video game collection 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.450
 counts more than 11 thousand titles and indeed 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.970
 it was from michael thomas that though 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.470
 despite holding this record has 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:26.870
 decided to sell his collection for 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.720
 750 thousand to 250 dollars 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.600
 but the real question is would you be there 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.030
 regret having sold it even if he has a 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.010
 this price 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.080
