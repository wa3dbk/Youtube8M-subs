00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.020
 needing what yes 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.510
 good load I spent in a center 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.869
 commercial and I made the decision to buy 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.900
 a team like this to gamen all 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:18.320
 it caught my attention especially by 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.009
 this part that says monster battery is 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.390
 say 30 long strength battery 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.390
 days in standby mode 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.829
 is a phone that has a 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:45.219
 lithium battery of thousand 900 milliamps 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:49.929
 and not only that but also too 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:53.690
 has bluetooth version 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:56.170
 3.0 and not only that but it also comes 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.190
 installed what is an antenna 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.379
 internally to listen to the radio fm 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.080
 bring your respective camera is a camera 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.570
 simple 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.370
 is a vga camera of 640 x 480 pixels 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.410
 especially for this kind of thing not 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.480
 It would be ideal 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.750
 in my case a part of having my 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.900
 phone my other computer I like this 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.690
 because it's a team combat team 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.940
 that I can simply take it with me 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.340
 for a good travel trip farm and 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.860
 not having the charger and saying how it's going 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.770
 to last a lot the load other than that what 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.100
 that brings a flash and also the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.960
 technical specifications brings what is 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.170
 the team brings what internal or better 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.740
 said the same flash becomes 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.740
 internal 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.720
 let's look at the battery earlier 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.290
 came the blood and 1 also average better 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.890
 before 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.340
 jones but the battery was not so was very 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.950
 large this is the telephone 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.880
 it's a bit thinner the design more 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.720
 Ergonomic more interesting call me 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.360
 a lot of really attention and talking 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.830
 of the ports we look here we see that 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.970
 has 1 and 2 that is to enter the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.050
 two numbers and here I can introduce you in 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.770
 a memory worthy of 8 gigs that 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.890
 it would be ideal 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.050
 many people that 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.090
 have seen this video or the one of the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.210
 previous have told me 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.620
 omar but this Chinese phone the 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.210
 I've really researched very thoroughly and I 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.440
 it really impacted knowing that it is a 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.680
 phone that as well says it here is 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:02.180
 assembled in china but it is not Chinese 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:06.500
 the company is located in miami and the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.740
 true, it is a telephone that 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.510
 the technical specifications 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.250
 the data seems very, very, very 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.530
 very comfortable is between 25-30 dollars 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.879
 it seems very very favorable and the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.939
 functionality especially this mode 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:29.190
 stand-by 30 days durability of the 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.769
 battery I hope you have served 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.599
 friends and tomorrow they want 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.629

 that not only has that but many things 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.370
 additional, I recommend that you do not 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:50.120
 think twice about choosing a 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.090
 famous blue tax in this case the version 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.400
