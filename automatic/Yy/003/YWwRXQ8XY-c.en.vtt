00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
England little random comparison we

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.350 
England little random comparison we
started<00:05:55.820> the<00:05:55.910> two<00:05:56.030> cars<00:05:57.280> at<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.760> same<00:05:58.850> time

five liters 67 liters so I thought the
r8<00:06:08.199> would<00:06:08.349> be<00:06:08.499> less<00:06:12.659> filthy<00:06:13.799> filthy<00:06:14.799> so<00:06:15.489> gonna

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
r8 would be less filthy filthy so gonna

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:16.979 
r8 would be less filthy filthy so gonna
