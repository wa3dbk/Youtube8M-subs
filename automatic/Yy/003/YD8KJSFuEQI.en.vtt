sort<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.660> archiving<00:03:25.110> programs<00:03:25.200> which<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.680> when

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
sort of archiving programs which is when

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.860 
sort of archiving programs which is when
our<00:03:25.950> 70<00:03:26.520> winds<00:03:26.670> up<00:03:26.820> all<00:03:27.150> these<00:03:27.420> archiving

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
our 70 winds up all these archiving

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.210 
our 70 winds up all these archiving
programs<00:03:27.959> will<00:03:28.380> work<00:03:28.410> relatively<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.100> same

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
programs will work relatively the same

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.560 
programs will work relatively the same
way<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.940> can<00:03:30.060> use<00:03:30.150> whatever<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.420> prefer
