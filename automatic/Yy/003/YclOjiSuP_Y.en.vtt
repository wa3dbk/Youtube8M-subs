further ado let's get started here so in

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.540 
further ado let's get started here so in
the<00:00:27.240> box<00:00:27.480> you're<00:00:27.840> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.230> get<00:00:28.550> your

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the box you're going to get your

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.470 
the box you're going to get your
instructions<00:00:30.119> which<00:00:30.900> are<00:00:31.790> very<00:00:32.790> poorly

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
instructions which are very poorly

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720 
instructions which are very poorly
written<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.050> did<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.500> did<00:00:35.010> open<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.489> already

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
written I did I did open this already

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.959 
written I did I did open this already
just<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.800> see<00:00:37.800> these<00:00:38.040> instructions<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:38.820> I

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
just to see these instructions because I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.080 
just to see these instructions because I
was<00:00:39.090> wondering<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.480> what<00:00:40.550> power<00:00:41.550> supply

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
was wondering about what power supply

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.660 
was wondering about what power supply
this<00:00:42.390> would<00:00:42.719> need<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.379> because<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
this would need and because this is a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
this would need and because this is a
condenser<00:00:45.239> microphone<00:00:45.450> an<00:00:46.379> actual<00:00:46.770> condenser

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
condenser microphone an actual condenser

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.760 
condenser microphone an actual condenser
microphone<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:48.420> need<00:00:48.539> phantom<00:00:49.050> power<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.590> run

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
microphone you need phantom power to run

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
microphone you need phantom power to run
this<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> can't<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.670> plug<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> into<00:00:51.360> your

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
this so you can't just plug it into your

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.500 
this so you can't just plug it into your
computer<00:00:51.690> even<00:00:52.230> though<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.649> comes<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
computer even though it comes with the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.170 
computer even though it comes with the
cord<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:56.160> still<00:00:56.399> need<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
cord to do so you still need to have a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.510 
cord to do so you still need to have a
power<00:00:57.449> supply<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.399> do

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
power supply for it so what you can do

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.240 
power supply for it so what you can do
is<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.820> get<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> power<00:01:00.329> supply<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
is you can get a power supply and you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.080 
is you can get a power supply and you
need<00:01:02.460> another<00:01:03.120> XLR<00:01:03.930> cable<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.460> got<00:01:05.850> one

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
need another XLR cable which I got one

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.340 
need another XLR cable which I got one
for<00:01:06.450> five<00:01:07.049> dollars<00:01:07.290> off<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> Amazon<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.760> well

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
but you can take the XLR cable out of

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
but you can take the XLR cable out of
the<00:01:12.659> back<00:01:12.840> end<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> microphone<00:01:13.830> hook<00:01:14.580> it

into<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> power<00:01:15.659> supply<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.590> use<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
into the power supply and then use this

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.149 
into the power supply and then use this
out<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> power<00:01:18.689> supply<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.350> hook<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.650> into

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
out of the power supply to hook it into

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.890 
out of the power supply to hook it into
your<00:01:20.280> computer<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.479> case<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.810> were

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
microphone I chose blue and silver it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.350 
microphone I chose blue and silver it
was<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.190> cheapest<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
was the cheapest on there and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.890 
was the cheapest on there and
was<00:02:10.050> prime<00:02:10.530> eligible<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:11.490> that's<00:02:12.360> why<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.570> got

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
was prime eligible so that's why I got

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.050 
was prime eligible so that's why I got
it<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:16.130> looks<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> bit<00:02:17.940> of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
it and that looks like there is a bit of

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.620 
it and that looks like there is a bit of
a<00:02:19.190> little<00:02:20.190> bit<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.430> gunk<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:21.120> glue<00:02:21.420> or
