to<00:00:10.830> go<00:00:11.099> there's<00:00:11.519> my<00:00:11.759> rods<00:00:12.030> over<00:00:12.480> there<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.809> can

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
to go there's my rods over there you can

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.430 
to go there's my rods over there you can
probably<00:00:13.290> see<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:14.360> top<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.780> what<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.260> that

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
probably see the top of what is that

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.490 
probably see the top of what is that
that<00:00:16.619> might<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.300> quantum<00:00:18.300> Q<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.630> X<00:00:18.840> there<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
that might be a quantum Q of X there and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.810 
that might be a quantum Q of X there and
some<00:00:19.650> other<00:00:19.770> things<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.430> then<00:00:20.550> there's<00:00:20.730> a

guess you could call it I'm with some
new<00:00:50.670> tackle<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.510> first<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.500> I'll

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
new tackle that I got first of all I'll

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.850 
new tackle that I got first of all I'll
start<00:00:52.949> off<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.430> unexcited<00:00:54.149> things

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
start off with the unexcited things

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.720 
start off with the unexcited things
where<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.340> hang<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:58.219> underneath<00:00:59.219> here

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
where is it here hang on underneath here

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.810 
where is it here hang on underneath here
somewheres<00:01:01.100> probably<00:01:02.100> recognize<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> few

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
somewheres probably recognize a few

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.240 
somewheres probably recognize a few
packages<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:06.770> here<00:01:07.770> they<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.189> here

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
packages there here they are right here

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.880 
packages there here they are right here
these<00:01:09.240> are<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:09.930> Jake<00:01:10.380> heads<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.770> he

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
these are just some Jake heads that he

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.320 
these are just some Jake heads that he
wanted<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.400> rid<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.640> these<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.880> didn't<00:01:12.180> pay

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
wanted to get rid of these I didn't pay

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.960 
wanted to get rid of these I didn't pay
anything<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:13.130> just<00:01:14.130> different<00:01:14.460> sized<00:01:14.640> Jake

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
anything for just different sized Jake

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.550 
anything for just different sized Jake
heads<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.390> stuff<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.750> figure<00:01:16.049> out<00:01:16.140> use<00:01:16.439> them

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
heads and stuff I figure out use them

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.070 
heads and stuff I figure out use them
for<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.390> don't<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.689> different<00:01:18.869> things

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
for I don't know just different things

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
for I don't know just different things
some<00:01:19.680> small<00:01:19.920> G<00:01:20.100> cakes<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.670> bigger<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:21.090> so

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
some small G cakes and bigger one so

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
i'll put them in the terminal tackle box

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.999 
i'll put them in the terminal tackle box
i<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.460> some<00:01:23.700> more<00:01:23.880> terminal<00:01:24.299> tackle<00:01:25.009> but

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
i do need some more terminal tackle but

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.170 
i do need some more terminal tackle but
them<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.340> someone's<00:01:26.759> or<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.000> the

them are just someone's or not the
actual<00:01:27.270> South<00:01:27.750> Bend<00:01:28.049> brand<00:01:28.380> they're<00:01:28.590> just

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
actual South Bend brand they're just

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.760 
actual South Bend brand they're just
some<00:01:28.950> random<00:01:29.159> ones<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> got<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.530> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
some random ones that I got so now that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
some random ones that I got so now that
the<00:01:31.890> unexcited<00:01:32.340> thing<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.850> over<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the unexcited thing is over that was the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.850 
the unexcited thing is over that was the
first<00:01:33.900> thing<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.810> also<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.290> got<00:01:37.619> some

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
