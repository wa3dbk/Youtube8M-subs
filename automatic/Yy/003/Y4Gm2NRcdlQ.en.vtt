00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
to go ahead and go in and put a little

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.910 
to go ahead and go in and put a little
bit<00:02:01.940> more<00:02:02.180> especially<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:02.930> on<00:02:03.350> my<00:02:03.590> cheeks

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
bit more especially like on my cheeks

bit more especially like on my cheeks
and<00:02:04.310> all<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.550> that<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.690> areas<00:02:06.170> where<00:02:06.440> I

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
and all of that and the areas where I

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:19.090 
and all of that and the areas where I
need<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.190> right<00:02:07.490> here<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
need it so right here so that is the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.810 
need it so right here so that is the
second<00:02:19.610> application<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.950> very<00:02:22.310> sharing

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
second application on it is very sharing

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.020 
second application on it is very sharing
coverage<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.750> do<00:02:23.810> realize<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.489> is<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
coverage and I do realize that it is a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.360 
coverage and I do realize that it is a
little<00:02:26.330> oily<00:02:26.840> well<00:02:27.260> maybe<00:02:27.560> not<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:27.830> little<00:02:28.190> a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
little oily well maybe not a little a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.940 
little oily well maybe not a little a
lot<00:02:28.400> oily<00:02:29.120> especially<00:02:30.050> around<00:02:30.200> like<00:02:30.560> my<00:02:30.680> poor

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
lot oily especially around like my poor

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.370 
lot oily especially around like my poor
areas<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.730> it's<00:02:32.090> kind<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.570> making<00:02:32.750> my<00:02:33.050> pores

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
areas and it's kind of making my pores

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.880 
areas and it's kind of making my pores
kind<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.010> look<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.370> little<00:02:34.400> bit<00:02:35.170> bigger<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.650> am

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
kind of look a little bit bigger I am

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.890 
kind of look a little bit bigger I am
not<00:02:37.100> wearing<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.489> primer<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:37.940> maybe<00:02:38.420> that's<00:02:38.690> why

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
not wearing a primer so maybe that's why

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.590 
not wearing a primer so maybe that's why
I<00:02:38.930> go<00:02:39.290> ahead<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.920> set<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.819> with<00:02:41.060> my<00:02:41.300> powder

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
I go ahead and set it with my powder

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.380 
I go ahead and set it with my powder
because<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.709> super<00:02:43.160> oily<00:02:43.790> like<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.209> looks

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
because it is super oily like it looks

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.210 
because it is super oily like it looks
like<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.720> have<00:02:44.989> grease<00:02:45.290> face<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.769> don't<00:02:45.950> know<00:02:46.040> if

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
you can tell from the camera but to me

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.810 
you can tell from the camera but to me
it<00:02:48.410> feels<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.829> have<00:02:48.980> grease<00:02:49.190> face<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:49.730> I'm

like the oil just I don't know maybe

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.539 
like the oil just I don't know maybe
it's<00:03:23.989> because<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.290> have<00:03:24.560> combination<00:03:24.799> to<00:03:25.400> oily

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
it's because I have combination to oily

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.150 
it's because I have combination to oily
skin<00:03:25.850> maybe<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.780> doesn't<00:03:26.989> help<00:03:27.260> but<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.130> a

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
skin maybe that doesn't help but it is a

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.520 
skin maybe that doesn't help but it is a
little<00:03:28.549> oily<00:03:29.000> even<00:03:29.359> on<00:03:29.510> my<00:03:29.660> hand<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:30.470> feels
