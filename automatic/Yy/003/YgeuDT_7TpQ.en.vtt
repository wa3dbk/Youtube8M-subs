it has given quite a bit of reliable
prints<00:00:47.650> as<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.370> can<00:00:48.460> see<00:00:48.640> when<00:00:48.820> we<00:00:48.910> look<00:00:48.940> at

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
prints as you can see when we look at

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.430 
prints as you can see when we look at
the<00:00:49.270> other<00:00:49.450> printers<00:00:49.840> it's<00:00:50.020> not<00:00:50.170> as<00:00:50.290> we're

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
the other printers it's not as we're

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.680 
the other printers it's not as we're
fine<00:00:50.650> but<00:00:51.220> still<00:00:51.430> did<00:00:51.610> a<00:00:51.670> good<00:00:51.790> job<00:00:51.850> for<00:00:52.270> the

fine but still did a good job for the
price<00:00:52.840> point<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.320> then<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:54.340> have<00:00:54.460> this<00:00:54.700> one

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
price point and then we have this one

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.850 
price point and then we have this one
this<00:00:55.210> one<00:00:55.420> looks<00:00:55.630> like<00:00:55.720> it's<00:00:56.020> probably<00:00:56.440> more

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
MakerBot replicator 2x MakerBot is

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.590 
MakerBot replicator 2x MakerBot is
pretty<00:01:03.100> popular<00:01:03.280> in<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.730> 3d<00:01:04.030> printing<00:01:04.420> world

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
pretty popular in the 3d printing world

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.899 
pretty popular in the 3d printing world
and<00:01:04.989> what's<00:01:05.590> nice<00:01:05.710> about<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.189> it<00:01:06.520> has<00:01:06.579> to

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
and what's nice about this is it has to

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.580 
and what's nice about this is it has to
print<00:01:07.149> heads<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.659> can<00:01:07.840> print<00:01:08.079> two

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
print heads and you can print two

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.260 
print heads and you can print two
different<00:01:08.950> colors<00:01:09.219> at<00:01:09.399> one<00:01:09.549> time<00:01:09.729> which<00:01:10.060> makes

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
different colors at one time which makes

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.569 
different colors at one time which makes
you<00:01:10.450> have<00:01:11.109> some<00:01:11.319> creativity<00:01:11.770> in<00:01:12.100> your<00:01:12.249> prints

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
you have some creativity in your prints

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.120 
you have some creativity in your prints
and<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:13.270> third<00:01:13.450> printer<00:01:13.840> is<00:01:13.960> from<00:01:14.229> 3d<00:01:14.679> systems

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
and the third printer is from 3d systems

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.819 
and the third printer is from 3d systems
it's<00:01:15.340> called<00:01:15.579> cube<00:01:15.909> X<00:01:16.090> this<00:01:16.659> is<00:01:16.719> around<00:01:17.409> twenty

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
it's called cube X this is around twenty
