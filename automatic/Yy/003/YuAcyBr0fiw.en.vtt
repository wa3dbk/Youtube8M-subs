this<00:02:14.989> mic<00:02:15.200> certainly<00:02:15.799> does<00:02:16.010> not<00:02:16.159> have<00:02:16.519> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
this mic certainly does not have the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.180 
this mic certainly does not have the
highs<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:16.970> lows<00:02:17.209> you'd<00:02:17.540> expect<00:02:18.080> from<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.379> $300

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
camera but it does the job well as a

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.380 
camera but it does the job well as a
boomed<00:02:21.650> mic<00:02:22.040> when<00:02:22.370> you're<00:02:22.520> actors<00:02:22.880> far<00:02:23.180> away
