00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.309
 So in a rubbing and friends with you Alex 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.129
 win32 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.960
 Now I will show you a plugin called 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.930
 the location he's teleporting is very awesome 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.830
 plugin useful on any server i think 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.390
 it does not load the server for example and well 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.010
 similar or 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:33.040
 Well, in general, it is very simple and so well 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.050
 let's get started what we need is y 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.040
 we have a team list that is, we have 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.129
 It goes lt that is, a simple command goes lt 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.000
 sheet ie teleport teleport sheets 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.660
 how much do we have 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.210
 lt create is creating teleport tickets 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.980
 but this is removing the portal blade 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.550
 update and in general then these two teams 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.410
 names need information about these commands 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 but you can translate yourself start 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:05.350
 I will tell everything in detail so you can 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:09.490
 create rental teleportation either x or 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:13.000
 y and z that is, by coordinates or just 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.860
 write create log one varnish 2 and all 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.649
 and you will have teleportation that is 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.179
 look let's all bend over 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.700
 let me show you these now 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.310
 moved by the way yes moved here 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.420
 it seems no then I like the primary not this 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.130
 just create teleportation and all 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.110
 but let's create teleportation 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.119
 for example, I already have a look here 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.250
 coming here 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.740
 I appear here here I go here right now 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.440
 appeared there watch hop appeared here 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.910
 everything is very simple there you are 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.350
 and writes this one you can translate into 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.440
 plug-in in this way 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.870
 let's show him open with 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 winrar a 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:04.670
 click to find 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.180
 search line and write just for example 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.960
 the words 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:14.990
 you are you 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.900
 u-in one ok and find 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.470
 here 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.090
 close here here here this class you 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.180
 there will be this translation you can 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.060
 translate it well let's do so 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.099
 and you and show now so open 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.709
 then we will create teleportation and all 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.500
 on this in general, such an awesome plugin 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.390
 I just recently saw him on 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.330
 open spaces of the Internet here they are all commands 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:49.230
 and so let's say the translation so 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:52.920
 looking for this line and sure looking for it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.920
 should be here somewhere 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.580
 unit 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.069
 like cabbage 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.079
 pancake 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:08.980
 and its residents port u and viet teleport 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.639
 here you are translating for example c copy 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.639
 here for example 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.690
 you 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.650
 those 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.650
 SP ported and I for example 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.580
 with 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.000
 such for example 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.000
 from the point 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.390
 So 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.540
 save from point to 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.540
 at 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.490
 at 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.970
 Well, here it is on these coordinates in 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.990
 i.e 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.750
 so but everything seems to save you now 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.330
 there and everything back 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.880
 we throw damn my server now let's 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.170
 then stop the server 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.600
 Stop 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.230
 try to move back 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.470
 ok all 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.470
 close we run our server og 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.490
 and voila and we will soon have teleport 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.970
 let's do 1 and 2 I even made one showed 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.980
 you like 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.980
 How is it arranged 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.419
 if I had a server I would put 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.419
 of course his 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.680
 as it is very useful on the server 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.630
 we go 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.860
 well now we will try now 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:47.910
 will move here you teleported with 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.970
 one teleport point in x there such such 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.880
 so and so look 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.740
 for example let's create everything now 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.450
 no such ingredients will take 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.610
 for example glass and here it is for example here 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.000
 see you for example here put 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:10.160
 any glass there 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.680
 will be . for example, well, let's do 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.490
 like this 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.840
 how will we have such a teleport 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.840
 will be a small give and 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.820
 such here it will be. one 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.140
 eg 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.140
 here we are making point 2 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.349
 how do we put blue 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.010
 bidding for the second doing blue then we 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:43.770
 we go on 1 for example let's block 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:45.400
 take a sign so aged with 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.419
 a sign 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.419
 we all forgot 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:56.819
 Well, here it seems year on 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.949
 for example here we put one pen of it i 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.349
 in general just how can you do it 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:04.199
 generally do just stupid tilt blocks 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.090
 make a commander on the second block here 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.370
 but I'm so for clarity, let's first 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:13.229
 let's write here in this here we go 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:18.479
 write lp 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:23.840
 create a location first like so 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.840
 so let's see the command block 1 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.120
 he's so 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.930
 on 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:35.030
 from position 1 thing 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.030
 I think the name is one two three three 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.060
 Yes, and now we write on 2, that is, locations 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.420
 2 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.190
 and he ate created log no longer on 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.760
 2 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.620
 all but 123 you can not write here 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.170
 will be just teleport 2 let's say 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.710
 1 euro teleport created well, that is 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.320
 him 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.750
 and whether it will be the 2nd see that is 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.980
 From the first example, we want to go out 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.890
 went there sometime 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.690
 I go there let's say on spawn up to you 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.960
 switched to spawn all of us swimming 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.160
 such that I want everything there is on the horse 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.040
 arena on some here will 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.650
 written arena go chic i'm in the arena all 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.100
 and here you will have already written 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:21.060
 teleported from the point there teleport 2 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:24.120
 in xy there is this position here in general 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.100
 pride cool plugin so strong 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.470
 nothing is required nor permission of 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.000
 it seems like the players should have nothing 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.980
 he just comes in player simply and 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.240
 teleport nothing more 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.020
 need to 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.840
 in general, everything seems to be on this so here I 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.860
 all told teams are all mixed here 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.889
 by the way they have this one for admins 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.780
 create create and the like tapir 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:50.729
 Misha does not need anyone to write just at all 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.259
 do not write anything to simple players 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:56.690
 they will pass without 

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:58.800
 displaced so well and everything seems to be with 

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.990
 you were alexey 3 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.190
 subscribe put likes to all good luck 

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.190
 and all bye
