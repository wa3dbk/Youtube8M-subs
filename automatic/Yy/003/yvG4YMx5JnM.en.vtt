just a little part of the tip these

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.060 
just a little part of the tip these
would<00:01:54.340> be<00:01:54.490> way<00:01:55.270> too<00:01:55.300> much<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.050> this<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.890> way

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.180 
pick this is also a good way of getting
the<00:02:10.000> right<00:02:10.149> motion<00:02:10.420> for<00:02:10.810> peeking<00:02:11.140> see<00:02:12.040> how

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
the right motion for peeking see how

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.630 
the right motion for peeking see how
easy<00:02:12.490> it<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.700> big<00:02:13.030> quickly<00:02:13.360> our<00:02:14.460> goal<00:02:15.460> is<00:02:15.610> to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
easy it is to big quickly our goal is to

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.610 
easy it is to big quickly our goal is to
use<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.120> same<00:02:16.330> motion<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.930> strings<00:02:17.350> like

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
use the same motion on the strings like

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.170 
use the same motion on the strings like
this<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.470> let's<00:02:20.650> do<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.890> support<00:02:21.760> your<00:02:21.850> wrist

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
this so let's do it support your wrist

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.360 
this so let's do it support your wrist
on<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.510> breach<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.080> your<00:02:23.110> guitar<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.740> let's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
on the breach of your guitar and let's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.730 
on the breach of your guitar and let's
do<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.580> same<00:02:24.820> thing<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.390> surface<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
do the same thing on the surface of the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:36.420 
do the same thing on the surface of the
string<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:35.230> might<00:02:35.410> require<00:02:35.590> some<00:02:35.800> practice

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
string this might require some practice

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:48.270 
string this might require some practice
to<00:02:36.550> make<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.820> sound<00:02:37.060> even<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.600> control

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.740 

okay<00:02:49.280> here's<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.640> good<00:02:49.849> way<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.120> practice<00:02:50.390> this

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
okay here's a good way to practice this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.839 
okay here's a good way to practice this

single notes we are going to play only
open<00:02:58.430> strings<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:58.970> we<00:02:59.120> can<00:02:59.300> focus<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.780> the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
open strings so we can focus on the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.040 
open strings so we can focus on the
position<00:03:00.050> of<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.560> peak<00:03:00.739> in<00:03:00.860> hand<00:03:01.069> here<00:03:01.730> we<00:03:01.849> go

position of the peak in hand here we go

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.110 
position of the peak in hand here we go
so<00:03:03.050> remember<00:03:03.769> we<00:03:04.430> are<00:03:04.519> just<00:03:04.700> going<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.879> keep

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:23.520 

hey

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.170 

if<00:05:24.530> this<00:05:24.830> is<00:05:24.980> too<00:05:25.130> hard<00:05:25.280> for<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:26.030> do

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
if this is too hard for you to do

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.850 
if this is too hard for you to do
because<00:05:26.360> you<00:05:26.660> are<00:05:26.750> just<00:05:26.990> starting<00:05:27.230> on<00:05:27.560> guitar

because you are just starting on guitar

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.040 
because you are just starting on guitar
remember<00:05:28.700> that<00:05:28.820> you<00:05:29.000> can<00:05:29.210> use<00:05:29.420> the<00:05:29.570> slow<00:05:29.750> down

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
remember that you can use the slow down

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.980 
remember that you can use the slow down
and<00:05:30.290> loop<00:05:30.620> features<00:05:31.100> as<00:05:31.340> we<00:05:32.060> always<00:05:32.210> say<00:05:32.360> if

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
and loop features as we always say if

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.900 
and loop features as we always say if
you<00:05:33.080> want<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.410> perform<00:05:33.770> perfectly<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.730> must

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
you want to perform perfectly you must

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.700 
you want to perform perfectly you must
practice<00:05:35.090> perfectly<00:05:35.570> and<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.080> way<00:05:36.650> to

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
practice perfectly and the way to

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.160 
practice perfectly and the way to
practice<00:05:37.040> perfectly<00:05:37.460> is<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.150> go<00:05:38.300> only<00:05:38.540> as<00:05:38.840> fast

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
practice perfectly is to go only as fast

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.770 
practice perfectly is to go only as fast
as<00:05:39.380> you<00:05:39.770> can<00:05:39.920> go<00:05:39.980> with<00:05:40.310> ease<00:05:40.520> once<00:05:41.480> you<00:05:41.630> get
