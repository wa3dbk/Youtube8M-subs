00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
think the only way to defeat bills is to

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.330 
think the only way to defeat bills is to
have<00:04:11.999> either<00:04:12.569> Goku<00:04:13.379> fuse<00:04:13.620> with<00:04:13.769> Vegeta<00:04:14.069> and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
have either Goku fuse with Vegeta and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.779 
have either Goku fuse with Vegeta and
create<00:04:14.670> Gogeta<00:04:15.180> or<00:04:15.569> just<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.919> do<00:04:17.280> step<00:04:17.639> in

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
create Gogeta or just have a do step in

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.420 
create Gogeta or just have a do step in
because<00:04:18.560> honestly<00:04:19.560> if<00:04:19.859> they're<00:04:20.009> gonna<00:04:20.130> battle

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.279 
because honestly if they're gonna battle
somebody<00:04:20.849> like<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.180> there's<00:04:21.479> absolutely<00:04:22.049> no

I'm guessing once he wakes up he wants
Total<00:05:29.310> Annihilation<00:05:29.550> so<00:05:30.509> they're<00:05:30.659> gonna<00:05:30.780> have
