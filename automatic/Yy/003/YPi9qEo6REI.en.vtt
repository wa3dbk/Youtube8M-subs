well<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.890> cardboard<00:02:05.820> will<00:02:06.090> keep<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.450> light

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
well the cardboard will keep the light

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.330 
well the cardboard will keep the light
out<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:08.160> holes<00:02:08.369> are<00:02:08.580> there<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:11.130> root

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
out the holes are there so that the root

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
out the holes are there so that the root
of<00:02:11.820> what<00:02:12.030> you're<00:02:12.180> planting<00:02:12.390> above<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.959> can

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
of what you're planting above it can

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.500 
of what you're planting above it can
find<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.530> way<00:02:13.680> down<00:02:13.860> around<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:18.180> roots<00:02:18.360> can

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
find a way down around the roots can

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.410 
find a way down around the roots can
find<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> holes<00:02:19.550> let<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.670> grass<00:02:20.880> won't<00:02:21.150> live

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
find the holes let the grass won't live

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.449 
find the holes let the grass won't live
without<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:22.080> light<00:02:25.850> before<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.910> started<00:02:27.480> I

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
without the light before I started I

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.819 
without the light before I started I
spent<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.120> couple<00:02:30.329> of<00:02:30.450> hours<00:02:30.599> wetting<00:02:31.260> down<00:02:31.439> all

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
spent a couple of hours wetting down all

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.089 
spent a couple of hours wetting down all
the<00:02:32.010> grass<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.930> I'll<00:02:34.079> add<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.469> least<00:02:34.680> my<00:02:35.069> own

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
the grass and I'll add the least my own

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:43.280 
the grass and I'll add the least my own
yard<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.920> picked<00:02:37.920> up<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:41.750> load<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.959> leaves

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
yard that I picked up a load of leaves

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.610 
yard that I picked up a load of leaves
and<00:02:43.530> grass<00:02:43.769> fresh<00:02:44.370> grass

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.300 

so<00:02:51.129> we're<00:02:51.310> going<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.489> put<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.640> foot<00:02:51.879> of<00:02:52.000> that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
so we're going to put a foot of that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.530 
so we're going to put a foot of that
not<00:02:53.820> going<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.030> be<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.270> main<00:02:55.010> layer<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:57.150> mulch

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
not going to be the main layer of mulch

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.440 
not going to be the main layer of mulch
I<00:02:58.820> need<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.910> hand

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
I need a hand

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:11.899 
I need a hand
oh<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:02.220> think<00:03:02.400> I'll<00:03:02.730> always<00:03:02.940> be<00:03:03.360> adding<00:03:03.630> compost

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:21.500 

so<00:03:12.909> actually<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.629> is<00:03:20.099> partly<00:03:21.099> it<00:03:21.310> was

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
so actually it is partly it was

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.569 
so actually it is partly it was
inspiration<00:03:22.510> that's<00:03:22.870> what<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.109> use<00:03:23.439> to<00:03:23.950> kind<00:03:24.549> of

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
inspiration that's what I use to kind of

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.479 
inspiration that's what I use to kind of
get<00:03:24.760> me<00:03:24.879> feel<00:03:25.090> started<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:25.780> raked<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.950> knocked

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
get me feel started I raked I knocked
