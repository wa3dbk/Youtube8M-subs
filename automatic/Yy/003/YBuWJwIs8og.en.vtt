00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.320
 television 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.199
 this evening will be the most beautiful area was a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.930
 my normal flat screen 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.689
 room where the play usually does 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.400
 disgust and of the 15 18 and when I register to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.579
 a line if you have seen some videos of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.880
 black ops to a line below and I can't 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.730
 record well though 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.210
 in this video I wanted to do a tutorial 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:48.110
 on how to find excuse the armor 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.110
 bad test well on how to find the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.090
 in short, all in barrels owe their hearts 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.620
 from hydra that you will need to be able to do 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.270
 a matured and erica our vi 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.980
 will also serve accent ever forging 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.439
 now let's start immediately to see again 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.020
 like how to have centola forging 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.360
 all to enter any home 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.159
 home network you have now I enter 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.159
 this one that operates to that of wight run 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.970
 anything where there is an 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.920
 shelf because to do this kick 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.200
 which is sweet of the GM children as if 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.240
 someone knows him and I do it 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.180
 see the same you will need the shelf 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 here it is this fine rodman you owe 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.329
 put it on the shelf then you have to 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:42.479
 click on the lectern ba infinium then not 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:46.439
 then read take active shelf then 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.210
 go here on selected books north but 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:55.140
 infinium from here put on the x3 destinations 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.049
 hicks and puts choose one of these 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.350
 three paths and will protect them by 5 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.850
 level all the various things depending 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.030
 of the center you will choose instead 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.039
 will enhance things and me 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.970
 thanks to this trick as you have seen 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.610
 not 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.200
 do not put leaves and always requires 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.570
 this procedure 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.720
 cia this trick I achieved this 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.750
 result of all abilities and 100 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.790
 level 81 anyway with this easy 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.530
 trick so you see how to have future 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.180
 at 100 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.130
 now I'll show you but it's the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.340
 according to fiscal the first the first era 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.320
 the basic one of wight because this 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.320
 here, however, now I'll show you 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.690
 here I will show you where to find the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.660
 dance first first then for 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.930
 find the fano where to go 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:03.100
 here in this mine here 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.860
 call may the butter and here and there will be 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.180
 an orc mine and now there 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.150
 it will be nobody because or there are gods 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.650
 orcs because they attacked me they attack me 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.390
 because there are none of them on 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.300
 mission of the film standards take the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.890
 ogre blood anyway if there are any 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.540
 the orcs if you are not an orc 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.200
 you will have to do a mission for them and then 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.650
 they'll let you in now anyway 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.140
 you have to go to this mine and now you 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.440
 I will see what to do just delusions 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.440
 loading 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:53.460
 here is revenue this is everyone's home 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.540
 york here there is only one ogre this is here 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.540
 a right 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.660
 yes ok then they sand in front of p here for 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.520
 this road 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.930
 no no for this strange excuse i have 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.920
 mistaken 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.130
 you will have to cross this bridge this 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.130
 here 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:22.620
 here and here he sees us even if he has to 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:27.980
 do the fab this already a piss reads 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:32.190
 first there is a lingotto des bains che 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.480
 you can steal and even raw Lebanon 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.250
 that you can simply always 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.050
 steal and you will need 33 anyway 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.790
 these attempted you will find again in that in 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.190
 that mine that I told you yes 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:49.650
 find it up here, here you come in 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.320
 manner of globus which is this to enter 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.230
 and you will find to make the deposits have to but 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.160
 there will be cases of iron deposits and 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.840
 however I don't know if this video will be enough 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.700
 for all the tutorial for this much 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.830
 two minutes of recording again 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.490
 so I could also see it in 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.030
 different in two parts so you will have to 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.890
 go here and around you will find this 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.120
 for example it was a vein should not be here 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.640
 I have more because I dug it 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.090
 all I got it all must anyway 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.190
 to pass 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.700
 enough that it involves a hollowed pick of the 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:28.730
 your lebanon and in the end you will have 33 of of 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.730
 raw ebony then get out of the mine 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:46.810
 as can be seen so well I hope so 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.910
 I hope you see well with me for sure 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.790
 better than it would have come 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.150
 normally anyway after when they were 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:59.770
 go after taking levano crude but 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.920
 go here there went the crucible 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.170
 used 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.740
 take everything see the phone shops 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:11.020

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.370
 raw bano click here until you 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.730
 finished all four areas yes 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:21.000
 should come like 33 23 ingots 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:23.530
 should and I end up here anyway 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.440
 I'll show you which three why 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.570
 unfortunately the time is running out in the 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.880
