 make our gold skin smoothie 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.840
 medical because the golden skin 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.150

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.610

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.890

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.140

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.810

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.750
 Said he said I have to put something old and 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.320
 it is seen because I survived 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.950
 or better I'm going to see 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.950
 the carrot juice 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.030

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.400

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.489
 the winter never 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.560
 and before you start recording Ramis and Tuni 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.560

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.090
 I can not 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.090

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.320
 let's take two whole pitayas two yes 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.420
 and also has 55 hours of vitamin c 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.420
 it's the pitaya because of the flu 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:34.290
 when it's 3 and 3 and we're also going 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.740
 to take a whole mango for you to read and 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.740
 flavor 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.110
 I want people to know that we are not 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.000
 experts to find the recipe in 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.570
 I did not do it or anyone because 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.830
 they're going to start popping and peeling 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.440
 carrot for breakfast and the truth 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.470
 super good kevin willis that carrot 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.320
 mango the guest ingredient of today that 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.970
 it's the pita fruit the capital 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.370
 we are going to take sugar for you 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.610
 well I can put your face on 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.590

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.389
 I have thrown two tablespoons because 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.300
 here rudy who does not like to walk the diet 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.400
 they join 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.870
 / we are going to take normal sugar but 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.870
 you can put splenda or 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:27.150
 I would recommend that if we are going to 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.920
 toss half a spoonful of ginger 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.700
 They know that ginger is very good 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.700
 because the fruit 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.550
 what we put this reputed because it is 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.270
 much easier and as you 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.620
 we need to put lemon and cucumber for 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.620

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:56.950

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:01.270
