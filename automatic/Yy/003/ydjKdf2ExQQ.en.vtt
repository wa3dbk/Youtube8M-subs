00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
made me like this guy who's because he's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
made me like this guy who's because he's
finishing<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.939> good<00:01:12.180> even<00:01:12.780> with

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
finishing was just so so good even with

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.420 
finishing was just so so good even with
his<00:01:13.080> right<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.500> didn't<00:01:13.740> find<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.010> too<00:01:14.189> bad

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
his right if I didn't find it too bad

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.460 
his right if I didn't find it too bad
but<00:01:14.909> his<00:01:15.030> left<00:01:15.270> foot<00:01:15.420> was<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.750> ridiculous<00:01:16.320> at

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
but his left foot was just ridiculous at

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.980 
but his left foot was just ridiculous at
finishing<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:17.820> was<00:01:18.000> under<00:01:18.869> him

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
finishing it really really was under him

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.270 
finishing it really really was under him
it's<00:01:19.140> probably<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> best<00:01:19.860> finishing

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it's probably one of the best finishing

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
it's probably one of the best finishing
cards<00:01:20.580> I've<00:01:20.729> used<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.210> I'm<00:01:21.960> appear<00:01:22.350> tall<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
cards I've used and I'm appear tall and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
cards I've used and I'm appear tall and
he's<00:01:23.400> 66<00:01:23.790> peers<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.049> speaks

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
he's 66 peers so I think that speaks

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.800 
he's 66 peers so I think that speaks
volumes<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:25.979> yeah<00:01:26.880> I'm<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> piercer<00:01:27.689> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
volumes because yeah I'm a piercer I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.480 
volumes because yeah I'm a piercer I
don't<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.439> slow<00:01:28.920> players<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:29.400> his

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
don't really like slow players but his

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.219 
don't really like slow players but his

feel a bit quicker than that and it just
make<00:01:40.590> good<00:01:40.740> break<00:01:40.950> away<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.310> serve<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.759> just

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.870 
actually feel pretty quick especially is
breaking<00:01:46.500> away<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> think<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.579> down<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
breaking away but I think that's down to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760 
breaking away but I think that's down to
his<00:01:48.030> strengths<00:01:48.540> focus<00:01:48.840> when<00:01:49.229> players<00:01:49.470> capture

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
his strengths focus when players capture

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
his strengths focus when players capture
to<00:01:49.920> him<00:01:50.009> he<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.610> hands<00:01:50.880> them<00:01:51.090> off<00:01:51.210> shows

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
to him he just like hands them off shows

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.850 
to him he just like hands them off shows
him<00:01:51.659> away<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.290> he's<00:01:52.470> got<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> strength

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
him away because he's got the strength

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.380 
him away because he's got the strength
to<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> keep<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.670> running<00:01:53.939> forward<00:01:54.240> she's
