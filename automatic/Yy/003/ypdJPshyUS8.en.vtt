party and put on a low temperature and I

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.610 
party and put on a low temperature and I
think<00:04:14.579> that's<00:04:14.849> about<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.209> time<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.750> toast<00:04:16.380> my

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
think that's about the time to toast my

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.810 
think that's about the time to toast my
bread<00:04:17.930> toasting<00:04:18.930> my<00:04:19.049> bread<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:20.280> could<00:04:20.699> do

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370
