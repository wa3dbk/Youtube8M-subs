00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hi there this is Sam petrm in this video

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi there this is Sam petrm in this video
I'm<00:00:04.319> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.650> show<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.220> can

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
I'm going to show you how you can

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.789 
I'm going to show you how you can
improve<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.240> resolution<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.049> 3gpp<00:00:07.529> video

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
improve the resolution of a 3gpp video

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.160 
improve the resolution of a 3gpp video
to<00:00:07.859> high-definition<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.719> really<00:00:10.050> very

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
to high-definition it is really very

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.190 
to high-definition it is really very
easy<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:11.210> change<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.420> resolution<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.990> any

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
easy to change the resolution of any

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.700 
easy to change the resolution of any
video<00:00:14.210> so<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.170> video<00:00:16.320> will<00:00:16.590> be

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
video so that the video will be

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.019 
video so that the video will be
displayed<00:00:17.210> in<00:00:18.210> much<00:00:18.869> higher<00:00:19.080> resolution<00:00:20.029> so

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
displayed in much higher resolution so

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.779 
displayed in much higher resolution so
the<00:00:21.150> least<00:00:21.330> example<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.080> taken<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.789> tgp

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the least example I have taken this tgp

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.150 
the least example I have taken this tgp
video<00:00:24.060> which<00:00:24.210> will<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.570> having<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.109> least<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
video which will be having the least the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.880 
video which will be having the least the
solution<00:00:27.140> so<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.039> my<00:00:29.250> 3gp<00:00:29.939> video<00:00:30.740> on<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
solution so here is my 3gp video on the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.180 
solution so here is my 3gp video on the
desktop<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:34.520> open<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> desktop<00:00:36.530> location<00:00:37.530> in

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
desktop and open the desktop location in

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.940 
desktop and open the desktop location in
my<00:00:38.430> computer<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
my computer so here you can see the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.520 
my computer so here you can see the
frame<00:00:41.160> width<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:42.030> 3/2<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.110> E<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.820> video

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
frame width is 3/2 for E and video

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.610 
frame width is 3/2 for E and video
durations<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.739> him<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.010> size.we<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.350> 1.4<00:00:49.350> MB

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
durations for him and size.we is 1.4 MB

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.150 
durations for him and size.we is 1.4 MB
now<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.809> can<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.199> open<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> video

now what you can do is open up the video

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.680 
now what you can do is open up the video

resolution so here you have got and the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
resolution so here you have got and the
best<00:01:20.939> feature<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.840> also<00:01:22.259> rotate

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
best feature is that you can also rotate

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.870 
best feature is that you can also rotate
the<00:01:22.770> video<00:01:23.330> sorry<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> left<00:01:25.619> or<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.729> the

and next thing is saves movie so the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.280 
and next thing is saves movie so the
Hydra<00:01:34.590> screen<00:01:34.829> high-definition<00:01:35.369> display

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
Hydra screen high-definition display

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.090 
Hydra screen high-definition display
that<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> resolution<00:01:38.100> would<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:39.439> 1<00:01:40.439> 9<00:01:40.619> 4<00:01:40.829> 0

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that is the resolution would be 1 9 4 0

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.469 
that is the resolution would be 1 9 4 0
into<00:01:42.060> 1<00:01:42.390> Phi<00:01:42.659> double<00:01:42.930> 0<00:01:43.729> Yuda<00:01:44.729> name<00:01:44.880> choose<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.760 

now<00:01:51.100> all<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:52.000> changes<00:01:52.330> will<00:01:52.510> be<00:01:52.540> saved<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
now all the changes will be saved and

once let me pay you me let me play you
win<00:02:02.260> while<00:02:02.640> 3gp<00:02:03.640> fail<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:06.250> will<00:02:06.400> be

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
win while 3gp fail so it you will be

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:20.370 
win while 3gp fail so it you will be
knowing<00:02:06.910> how<00:02:07.720> small<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:19.170> switch<00:02:20.170> is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
knowing how small that is a switch is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.090 
knowing how small that is a switch is
come<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:22.959> see<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.260> resolution<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.890> very

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
come you can see the resolution is very

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.070 
come you can see the resolution is very
small

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
small

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.120 
small
now<00:02:26.760> once<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.060> video<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.360> done<00:02:28.770> he'll<00:02:29.770> open<00:02:29.950> up

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
now once the video is done he'll open up

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.810 
now once the video is done he'll open up
 -<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.570> will<00:02:31.750> be<00:02:31.900> right<00:02:35.520> yep

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
 - so it will be right yep

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:51.110 
 - so it will be right yep
here<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:37.810> go
