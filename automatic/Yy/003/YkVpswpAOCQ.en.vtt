underneath the wrapping and it will

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.050 
underneath the wrapping and it will

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
still work for them you can also use

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.449 
still work for them you can also use
scraps<00:02:23.060> like<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:23.840> one<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.799> is<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:24.980> weighted

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
scraps like this one this is a weighted

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.390 
scraps like this one this is a weighted
strap<00:02:25.790> actually<00:02:26.660> got<00:02:26.810> upside<00:02:27.230> down<00:02:27.440> but<00:02:27.739> you

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
strap actually got upside down but you

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.850 
strap actually got upside down but you
could<00:02:28.580> maybe<00:02:28.760> tuck<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.299> in<00:02:29.860> they're

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.160 
could maybe tuck it in they're
definitely<00:02:31.269> going<00:02:32.269> different<00:02:32.540> ways<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.840> can

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
definitely going different ways you can

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.740 
definitely going different ways you can
use<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:34.000> basically<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> best<00:02:35.239> thing<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.630> know

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
use it basically the best thing to know

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.870 
use it basically the best thing to know
is<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.220> dish<00:02:37.220> sponge<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:38.260> amazingly

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
is that dish sponge is amazingly

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.190 
is that dish sponge is amazingly
conductive<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.730> think<00:02:44.630> that's<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.959> way<00:02:45.140> to

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
conductive and I think that's the way to

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.380 
conductive and I think that's the way to
go
