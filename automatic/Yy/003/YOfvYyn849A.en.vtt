00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.000 
you grow up that is evident in this book
and<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.519> definitely<00:03:56.079> related<00:03:57.079> to<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:57.470> the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
and I definitely related to that the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.220 
and I definitely related to that the
progression<00:03:58.699> of<00:03:58.819> her<00:03:58.970> personality<00:03:59.449> from<00:03:59.930> this

one day up until you know the end of the
book<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:03.019> thought<00:04:03.169> was<00:04:03.379> very<00:04:03.489> reasonable<00:04:04.489> often

realize<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:07.669> at<00:04:07.760> first<00:04:07.790> didn't<00:04:08.299> realize<00:04:08.660> how

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
realize it at first didn't realize how

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.930 
realize it at first didn't realize how
much<00:04:09.290> of<00:04:09.440> an<00:04:09.530> effect<00:04:09.829> this<00:04:09.980> one<00:04:10.370> day<00:04:10.579> was<00:04:10.790> going

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940

to<00:04:11.060> have<00:04:11.269> on<00:04:11.480> her<00:04:11.690> but<00:04:12.169> it<00:04:12.290> does<00:04:12.530> really<00:04:12.949> change

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
to have on her but it does really change

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.360 
to have on her but it does really change
how<00:04:14.540> she<00:04:14.569> decides<00:04:15.139> to<00:04:15.319> live<00:04:15.590> her<00:04:15.739> life<00:04:15.949> I<00:04:16.160> liked

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
I thought I was going to go one way and

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.860 
I thought I was going to go one way and
then

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870
