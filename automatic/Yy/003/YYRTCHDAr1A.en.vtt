00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that I turn it and the same way so I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.370 
that I turn it and the same way so I
kind<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.320> made<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> V<00:01:38.340> grind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> V

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
kind of like made a V grind of the V

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.469 
kind of like made a V grind of the V
corner<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.890> grind<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.180> much<00:01:42.329> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
corner into it and grind it so much it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.969 
corner into it and grind it so much it
was<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.630> sure<00:01:42.810> shot<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.259> could<00:01:43.470> break<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> off

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
was a sure shot and I could break it off

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.749 
was a sure shot and I could break it off
I<00:01:44.220> had<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> grind<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.899> steel<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.890> half<00:01:47.130> instead

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
I had to grind the steel in half instead

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.510 
I had to grind the steel in half instead
of<00:01:47.909> cutting<00:01:48.119> because<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.720> didn't<00:01:48.930> cut

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
of cutting because if you didn't cut

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.609 
of cutting because if you didn't cut

crazy insane laughed and told tough
times<00:01:52.860> talking<00:01:53.189> about<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.549> when<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:53.729> worked

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
times talking about it when he worked

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.370 
times talking about it when he worked
with<00:01:54.210> his<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.780> 125<00:01:55.380> e<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.299> didn't<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.139 
believe him at first but man was he
right<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.350> impossible<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.979> grind<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.880> here's

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
right it's impossible to grind so here's
