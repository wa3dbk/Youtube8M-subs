00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
field with me I usually use a file at

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.380 
field with me I usually use a file at
home<00:00:27.680> in<00:00:27.829> the<00:00:27.919> workbench<00:00:28.250> for<00:00:29.029> thinning<00:00:29.239> out

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
home in the workbench for thinning out

this is the way to do it drop your axe
up<00:00:37.160> against<00:00:37.400> the<00:00:37.490> log<00:00:37.700> like<00:00:37.940> this

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
up against the log like this

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.050 
up against the log like this
hang<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:38.990> cutting<00:00:39.230> edge<00:00:39.380> over<00:00:39.740> and<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.790> take

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
hang the cutting edge over and I take

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.270 
hang the cutting edge over and I take
the<00:00:41.180> file<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.690> I<00:00:41.900> follow<00:00:42.650> right<00:00:42.950> along<00:00:42.980> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
the file and I follow right along the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.610 
the file and I follow right along the
cutting<00:00:43.520> edge<00:00:43.640> here<00:00:43.850> what<00:00:44.060> I<00:00:44.090> do<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.630> don't

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
cutting edge here what I do I don't

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.920 
cutting edge here what I do I don't
actually<00:00:46.250> hit<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:47.000> exact<00:00:47.330> cutting<00:00:47.720> edge<00:00:47.810> I

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
actually hit the exact cutting edge I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.260 
actually hit the exact cutting edge I
leave<00:00:48.080> about<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.320> sixteenth<00:00:48.890> of<00:00:49.040> an<00:00:49.190> inch<00:00:49.280> that

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
leave about a sixteenth of an inch that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.450 
leave about a sixteenth of an inch that
I'm<00:00:50.420> not<00:00:50.630> touching<00:00:51.050> with<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:51.230> file<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:51.920> I

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
I'm not touching with the file and I

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.810 
I'm not touching with the file and I
file<00:00:52.730> right<00:00:53.120> behind<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:54.160> in<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.310> pattern<00:00:55.700> like

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
file right behind that in a pattern like

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.110 
file right behind that in a pattern like
this<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.920> then<00:00:58.220> I'll<00:00:58.370> actually<00:00:58.640> hit<00:00:58.970> the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
this and then I'll actually hit the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.470 
this and then I'll actually hit the
cutting<00:00:59.329> edge<00:00:59.570> with<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.850> sharpening<00:01:01.850> stone<00:01:02.090> you

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
cutting edge with a sharpening stone you

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.729 
cutting edge with a sharpening stone you
know<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.690> course<00:01:02.900> if<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.079> got<00:01:03.200> a<00:01:03.230> big<00:01:03.440> nick<00:01:03.590> and

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
know of course if you got a big nick and

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.020 
know of course if you got a big nick and
your<00:01:03.829> X<00:01:03.980> you<00:01:04.129> got<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.369> work<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.610> out<00:01:04.699> you<00:01:04.909> might

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
your X you got to work it out you might

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.780 
your X you got to work it out you might
have<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:05.269> work<00:01:05.390> on<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.630> cutting<00:01:05.869> edge<00:01:05.960> but

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
have to work on the cutting edge but

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.489 
have to work on the cutting edge but
basically<00:01:07.790> this<00:01:07.939> is<00:01:08.420> how<00:01:08.509> it's<00:01:08.929> how<00:01:09.049> you<00:01:09.109> do<00:01:09.350> it

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:09.499 
basically this is how it's how you do it

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.410 
basically this is how it's how you do it
right<00:01:09.679> this<00:01:10.249> is<00:01:10.429> something<00:01:10.670> I<00:01:10.759> usually<00:01:11.149> would

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
right this is something I usually would

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.889 
right this is something I usually would
do<00:01:11.509> at<00:01:11.659> home<00:01:11.869> in<00:01:12.499> a<00:01:12.710> shop<00:01:13.479> just<00:01:14.479> because<00:01:14.719> it's<00:01:14.840> a

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
do at home in a shop just because it's a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.599 
do at home in a shop just because it's a
lot<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:15.319> a<00:01:15.380> lot<00:01:15.409> easier<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:15.859> lot<00:01:15.950> safer<00:01:16.219> and

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
lot it's a lot easier a lot safer and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.399 
lot it's a lot easier a lot safer and
once<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:17.509> have<00:01:17.659> your<00:01:17.749> cutting<00:01:18.020> edge<00:01:18.109> thinned

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
once you have your cutting edge thinned

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.690 
once you have your cutting edge thinned
out<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.740> where<00:01:18.859> you<00:01:18.979> want<00:01:19.159> it<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.340> probably

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
out to where you want it you probably

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.819 
out to where you want it you probably
won't<00:01:20.030> need<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.479> file<00:01:20.780> unless<00:01:21.469> you<00:01:21.619> get<00:01:21.799> a

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
won't need a file unless you get a

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.800 
won't need a file unless you get a
really<00:01:22.130> big<00:01:22.460> chip<00:01:22.850> or<00:01:23.060> Nick<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.509> really

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
really big chip or Nick that you really

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.719 
really big chip or Nick that you really
have<00:01:23.929> to<00:01:24.079> work<00:01:24.229> out<00:01:24.439> when<00:01:25.219> you<00:01:25.280> have<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.460> file

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
have to work out when you have a file

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.529 
have to work out when you have a file
it's<00:01:26.119> nice<00:01:26.359> to<00:01:26.600> use<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:26.810> wire<00:01:27.079> brush<00:01:27.109> too<00:01:28.539> to

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
it's nice to use a wire brush too to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.779 
it's nice to use a wire brush too to
clean<00:01:29.719> out<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.710> filings<00:01:31.159> on<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.579> file

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
clean out the the filings on the file

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.639 
clean out the the filings on the file
this<00:01:31.999> will<00:01:32.179> give<00:01:32.329> to<00:01:32.509> longer<00:01:33.200> life<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.530> your

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
this will give to longer life in your

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.289 
this will give to longer life in your
file<00:01:33.859> it<00:01:34.429> just<00:01:34.490> makes<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:34.909> file<00:01:35.060> more

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
file it just makes the file more

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.849 
file it just makes the file more
aggressively<00:01:35.810> more<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.409> just<00:01:36.590> work<00:01:36.740> that

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
aggressively more and just work that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.469 
aggressively more and just work that
much<00:01:37.039> better<00:01:37.249> but<00:01:37.670> once<00:01:37.999> again<00:01:38.209> these<00:01:38.329> are

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
much better but once again these are

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.029 
much better but once again these are
things<00:01:38.509> I<00:01:38.719> usually<00:01:38.840> keep<00:01:39.109> at<00:01:39.289> home<00:01:39.499> and<00:01:39.950> a

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
things I usually keep at home and a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.959 
things I usually keep at home and a
workbench<00:01:40.369> out<00:01:41.209> in<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.509> field<00:01:42.819> sharpen<00:01:43.819> in<00:01:43.880> an

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
workbench out in the field sharpen in an

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.809 
workbench out in the field sharpen in an
axe<00:01:44.829> you<00:01:45.829> usually<00:01:45.950> have<00:01:46.219> it<00:01:46.310> thinned<00:01:46.490> down<00:01:46.639> the

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
axe you usually have it thinned down the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.510 
axe you usually have it thinned down the
way<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:46.969> want<00:01:47.209> to

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.989 
same-same sharper so use on the knives I
really<00:01:51.380> like<00:01:51.529> these<00:01:51.679> uh<00:01:51.740> these<00:01:52.399> diamond<00:01:52.759> files

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
really like these uh these diamond files

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.349 
really like these uh these diamond files
and<00:01:53.719> what<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.049> do<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.499> I<00:01:54.789> hold<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:55.969> axe<00:01:56.119> just

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
and what I do is I hold the axe just

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.279 
and what I do is I hold the axe just
like<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.719> I<00:01:58.060> put<00:01:59.060> my<00:01:59.420> finger<00:01:59.689> down<00:01:59.840> here<00:02:00.109> my

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
like this I put my finger down here my

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.440 
like this I put my finger down here my
thumb<00:02:00.499> up<00:02:00.619> here<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:01.579> actually<00:02:01.999> acts<00:02:02.119> as

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
thumb up here and this actually acts as

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.230 
thumb up here and this actually acts as
kind<00:02:02.659> of<00:02:02.779> a<00:02:03.069> stopper<00:02:04.069> for<00:02:04.459> my<00:02:04.579> violin<00:02:04.969> action

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
kind of a stopper for my violin action

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.469 
kind of a stopper for my violin action
what<00:02:05.389> I<00:02:05.420> do<00:02:05.539> I<00:02:05.959> hold<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.920> file<00:02:07.159> in<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.399> way<00:02:07.670> so

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
what I do I hold the file in this way so

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.589 
what I do I hold the file in this way so
my<00:02:08.780> not<00:02:09.170> my<00:02:09.319> pointer<00:02:09.649> finger<00:02:09.679> my

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
my not my pointer finger my

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.750 
my not my pointer finger my
middle<00:02:11.019> finger<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.499> right<00:02:11.799> on<00:02:12.189> the<00:02:12.249> file<00:02:12.459> here

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
middle finger is right on the file here

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.869 
middle finger is right on the file here
and<00:02:13.109> this<00:02:14.109> fingernail<00:02:14.739> is<00:02:15.010> gonna<00:02:15.519> come<00:02:15.760> in

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
and this fingernail is gonna come in

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.360 
and this fingernail is gonna come in
contact<00:02:16.120> with<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.200> cheek<00:02:17.439> of<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.829> X<00:02:18.069> right

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
contact with the cheek of that X right

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.879 
contact with the cheek of that X right
there<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:20.049> finger<00:02:20.409> thickness<00:02:20.739> is

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:20.889 
there that that that finger thickness is

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.619 
there that that that finger thickness is
going<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.159> gauge<00:02:21.340> my<00:02:21.370> spacing<00:02:21.969> this<00:02:22.269> is<00:02:22.329> how<00:02:22.569> I

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
going to gauge my spacing this is how I

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.199 
going to gauge my spacing this is how I
adjust<00:02:23.139> the<00:02:23.290> angle<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:23.889> is<00:02:24.010> by<00:02:24.519> where<00:02:25.030> this

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
adjust the angle here is by where this

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.209 
adjust the angle here is by where this
finger<00:02:25.510> slides<00:02:25.780> up<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:26.109> what<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.499> do<00:02:26.650> that

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
finger slides up so what I can do that

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.830 
finger slides up so what I can do that
fingernail<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.909> gonna<00:02:28.090> I'm<00:02:28.299> gonna<00:02:28.359> get<00:02:28.569> my

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
fingernail is gonna I'm gonna get my

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.160 
fingernail is gonna I'm gonna get my
angle<00:02:29.260> adjustment<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.849> uh<00:02:30.879> so<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.629> the<00:02:31.750> file<00:02:31.989> is

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
angle adjustment so uh so so the file is

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.740 
angle adjustment so uh so so the file is
hitting<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.620> cutting<00:02:32.980> edge<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.879> my

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
hitting that cutting edge and my

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.030 
hitting that cutting edge and my
fingernail<00:02:35.139> is<00:02:35.230> just<00:02:35.349> going<00:02:35.439> to<00:02:35.500> slide<00:02:35.769> right

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
fingernail is just going to slide right

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.670 
fingernail is just going to slide right
along<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:37.150> cheek<00:02:37.359> of<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.540> X<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.469> my

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
along that the cheek of the X and my

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.170 
along that the cheek of the X and my
other<00:02:38.829> fingers<00:02:39.159> are<00:02:39.280> stopping<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.790> there<00:02:39.909> from

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
other fingers are stopping it there from

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.270 
other fingers are stopping it there from
going<00:02:40.419> too<00:02:40.689> far<00:02:40.870> off<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.409> you're<00:02:42.069> just<00:02:42.189> gonna

going too far off and you're just gonna

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.159 
going too far off and you're just gonna
work<00:02:42.519> in<00:02:42.669> a<00:02:42.760> quick<00:02:43.269> easy<00:02:43.450> motion<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:44.019> this

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:44.169 
work in a quick easy motion like this

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.899 
work in a quick easy motion like this
this<00:02:44.349> is<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.530> super<00:02:44.919> fine<00:02:45.359> diamond<00:02:46.359> file<00:02:46.659> and

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
this is a super fine diamond file and

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.159 
this is a super fine diamond file and
you<00:02:48.909> just<00:02:49.060> want<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.269> keep<00:02:49.389> it<00:02:49.510> look<00:02:49.689> a<00:02:49.719> look<00:02:49.989> at

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.169 
you just want to keep it look a look at

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.330 
you just want to keep it look a look at
make<00:02:50.349> sure<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:50.650> getting<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.010> cutting<00:02:51.250> edge

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
make sure it's getting the cutting edge

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.159 
make sure it's getting the cutting edge
of<00:02:51.370> where<00:02:51.609> you<00:02:51.730> want<00:02:51.909> it<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.900> flip<00:02:53.079> it

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
of where you want it and you flip it

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.030 
of where you want it and you flip it
around<00:02:55.169> holding<00:02:56.169> the<00:02:56.230> file<00:02:56.379> in<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.590> same<00:02:56.709> spot

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
around holding the file in the same spot

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.199 
around holding the file in the same spot
you<00:02:57.219> should<00:02:57.430> be<00:02:57.519> able<00:02:57.609> to<00:02:57.699> get<00:02:57.849> about<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.150> same

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
you should be able to get about the same

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.750 
you should be able to get about the same
angle<00:02:58.719> this<00:02:59.139> is<00:02:59.199> uh<00:02:59.409> you<00:03:00.370> know<00:03:00.489> it's<00:03:00.669> not

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
angle this is uh you know it's not

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.240 
angle this is uh you know it's not
perfect<00:03:01.000> but<00:03:01.359> it's<00:03:01.510> it's<00:03:01.780> it's<00:03:02.650> good<00:03:03.069> enough

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
perfect but it's it's it's good enough

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.199 
perfect but it's it's it's good enough
for<00:03:03.310> out<00:03:03.609> in<00:03:03.699> the<00:03:03.760> field<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:05.879> nice<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.090> quick

and easy like that I can see exactly the
cutting<00:03:09.489> edge<00:03:09.609> that<00:03:09.909> where<00:03:10.120> I'm<00:03:10.209> hitting<00:03:11.099> what

cutting edge that where I'm hitting what
you're<00:03:12.250> doing<00:03:12.459> by<00:03:12.639> sharpen<00:03:13.239> like<00:03:13.359> this<00:03:13.540> is

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
you're doing by sharpen like this is

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.909 
you're doing by sharpen like this is
you're<00:03:13.840> putting<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:15.959> flat<00:03:16.959> grind<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:17.650> X

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
you're putting a flat grind on this X

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.249 
you're putting a flat grind on this X
these<00:03:18.549> grants<00:03:19.030> where's<00:03:19.180> access<00:03:19.509> come<00:03:19.720> with<00:03:19.900> a

these grants where's access come with a

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.129 
these grants where's access come with a
convex<00:03:20.799> edge<00:03:21.239> which<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.389> lot<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.599> lot<00:03:22.989> of

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
convex edge which a lot a lot of

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.689 
convex edge which a lot a lot of
companies<00:03:23.470> use<00:03:23.500> because<00:03:23.949> they<00:03:24.280> can<00:03:24.430> put<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.609> on

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
companies use because they can put it on

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:25.710 
companies use because they can put it on
with<00:03:24.729> a<00:03:24.849> belt<00:03:25.060> sander<00:03:25.239> right<00:03:25.540> from<00:03:25.659> the

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
with a belt sander right from the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.869 
with a belt sander right from the
factory<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.680> personally<00:03:27.129> think<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.609> flat

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
factory but I personally think the flat

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.949 
factory but I personally think the flat
a<00:03:28.180> flat<00:03:28.269> bevel<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.229> flat<00:03:29.709> grind<00:03:30.810> works<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.900> little

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
a flat bevel a flat grind works a little

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.210 
a flat bevel a flat grind works a little
better<00:03:32.139> than<00:03:32.319> hardwood<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.739> think<00:03:32.889> it<00:03:32.949> releases

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
better than hardwood I think it releases

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.580 
better than hardwood I think it releases
from<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.519> cut<00:03:33.790> better<00:03:34.049> it's<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.199> lot<00:03:35.349> easier<00:03:35.470> to

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
from the cut better it's a lot easier to

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.530 
from the cut better it's a lot easier to
sharpen<00:03:35.859> in<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.099> field<00:03:36.340> sounds<00:03:37.180> like<00:03:37.299> it<00:03:37.419> got

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
sharpen in the field sounds like it got

sharpen in the field sounds like it got
a<00:03:37.569> lot<00:03:37.750> of<00:03:37.810> guys<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.199> run<00:03:38.409> racing<00:03:39.129> axes<00:03:39.489> use

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
a lot of guys that run racing axes use

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.589 
a lot of guys that run racing axes use
flat<00:03:40.629> bevels<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.620> put<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.579> put<00:03:42.729> flat<00:03:43.239> bevels

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
flat bevels so I put I put flat bevels

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.659 
flat bevels so I put I put flat bevels
on<00:03:43.689> all<00:03:43.810> my<00:03:43.930> axis<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.439> all<00:03:45.040> you're<00:03:45.250> doing<00:03:45.280> here

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
on all my axis and all you're doing here

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.379 
on all my axis and all you're doing here
is<00:03:45.729> you're<00:03:45.790> putting<00:03:46.060> about<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.329> sixteenth<00:03:46.870> inch

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
is you're putting about a sixteenth inch

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.089 
is you're putting about a sixteenth inch
secondary<00:03:49.389> bevel<00:03:49.569> on<00:03:49.750> this<00:03:49.930> honest<00:03:50.409> grants

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
secondary bevel on this honest grants

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.569 
secondary bevel on this honest grants
first<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.939> I<00:03:52.859> like<00:03:53.859> it<00:03:54.009> like<00:03:54.069> that<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.280> find

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
first and I like it like that I find

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.759 
first and I like it like that I find
that<00:03:54.699> it<00:03:54.819> performs<00:03:55.120> very<00:03:55.329> well<00:03:55.689> like<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:56.079> so

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
that it performs very well like that so

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.740 
that it performs very well like that so
you<00:03:57.579> know<00:03:57.669> you<00:03:57.759> just<00:03:57.790> do<00:03:58.000> about<00:03:58.209> even<00:03:58.509> amount

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
you know you just do about even amount

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.599 
you know you just do about even amount
on<00:03:58.870> either<00:03:58.959> side<00:04:00.719> nice<00:04:01.719> and<00:04:01.900> quick<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:02.169> easy

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
on either side nice and quick and easy

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:09.399 
on either side nice and quick and easy
switch<00:04:03.609> over<00:04:03.909> to<00:04:03.939> your<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:05.290> your<00:04:05.379> ceramic<00:04:05.590> rod

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.780 

and<00:04:10.409> you<00:04:10.709> can<00:04:10.830> see<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.069> ceramic<00:04:11.430> rod<00:04:11.550> you<00:04:11.760> can

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
and you can see that ceramic rod you can

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.789 
and you can see that ceramic rod you can
nice<00:04:12.420> thing<00:04:12.599> about<00:04:12.629> a<00:04:12.780> position<00:04:13.110> sharpen<00:04:13.620> like

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
nice thing about a position sharpen like

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.020 
nice thing about a position sharpen like
this<00:04:13.920> as<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:14.190> can<00:04:14.250> see<00:04:14.610> what<00:04:14.879> you're

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
this as you can see what you're

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.030 
this as you can see what you're
sharpening<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.750> can<00:04:16.290> see<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.620> cutting<00:04:16.919> edge

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
sharpening I can see that cutting edge

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.310 
sharpening I can see that cutting edge
and<00:04:17.790> that's<00:04:18.479> really<00:04:18.660> important<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.109> see

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
and that's really important to see

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.689 
and that's really important to see
exactly<00:04:19.650> what<00:04:19.889> you're<00:04:20.040> doing<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:23.340> then<00:04:23.490> maybe

exactly what you're doing and then maybe
at<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.090> maybe<00:04:24.389> at<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.720> end<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.050> I'm

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
at the maybe at the end of that I'm

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.060 
at the maybe at the end of that I'm
going<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.710> hold<00:04:26.340> my<00:04:27.380> rod<00:04:28.380> out<00:04:28.560> like<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:28.860> and

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
going to hold my rod out like this and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.760 
going to hold my rod out like this and
just<00:04:29.310> take<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.639> couple<00:04:30.290> couple<00:04:31.290> strokes<00:04:31.530> like

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
this just even it out if there was

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.140 
this just even it out if there was
something<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.520> missed<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:37.940> that's<00:04:38.940> pretty

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
something I missed and that's pretty

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.590

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
close to the same all the time which is

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.050 
close to the same all the time which is
really<00:05:12.840> nice

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.629 

flip<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.210> over<00:05:19.330> do<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.660> same<00:05:19.870> thing<00:05:20.050> with<00:05:20.169> the

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
flip it over do the same thing with the

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:33.960 
flip it over do the same thing with the
ceramic<00:05:21.639> side

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.250 

that's<00:05:34.570> nice<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:34.990> easy<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:37.060> that's<00:05:37.260> that's

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.690 
that's nice and easy and that's that's
plenty<00:05:38.590> sharp<00:05:38.710> from<00:05:39.100> being<00:05:39.280> out<00:05:39.400> in<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.520> field

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
plenty sharp from being out in the field

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.820 
plenty sharp from being out in the field
and<00:05:40.000> that's<00:05:40.120> that's<00:05:41.110> really<00:05:41.320> safe<00:05:41.590> and<00:05:41.710> easy
