okay<00:00:00.450> this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:01.020> brainstem<00:00:01.469> from<00:00:01.860> here

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
okay this is the brainstem from here

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.800 
okay this is the brainstem from here
down<00:00:03.200> the<00:00:04.200> pawns<00:00:04.529> are<00:00:04.920> these<00:00:05.190> big<00:00:05.520> bumps<00:00:05.970> on

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
down the pawns are these big bumps on

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.320 
down the pawns are these big bumps on
the<00:00:07.049> brain<00:00:07.230> stem<00:00:07.639> the<00:00:08.639> cerebellum

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the brain stem the cerebellum

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.780 
the brain stem the cerebellum
is<00:00:09.950> this<00:00:10.950> portion<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:13.440> piece<00:00:13.679> called<00:00:14.400> little

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
is this portion the piece called little

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.160 
is this portion the piece called little
brain<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.719> smaller<00:00:15.990> part<00:00:16.970> arbor<00:00:17.970> vitae

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
brain so it's a smaller part arbor vitae

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.060 
brain so it's a smaller part arbor vitae
are<00:00:20.029> these<00:00:21.029> white<00:00:21.689> matter<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.320> looks<00:00:22.920> like

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
are these white matter that looks like

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.370 
are these white matter that looks like
the<00:00:23.189> tree<00:00:23.670> tree<00:00:24.150> branches<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the tree tree branches so that's the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.759 
the tree tree branches so that's the
arbor<00:00:25.619> vitae<00:00:25.710> Tree<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.160> Life<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:27.769> ventricles

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
arbor vitae Tree of Life the ventricles

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.919 
arbor vitae Tree of Life the ventricles
the<00:00:29.099> lateral<00:00:29.820> ventricles<00:00:30.300> there's<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.840> on

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the lateral ventricles there's one on

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.630 
the lateral ventricles there's one on
the<00:00:31.019> left<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> right<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:34.370> here's<00:00:35.370> one

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the left one on the right and here's one

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.900 
the left one on the right and here's one
of<00:00:35.760> them<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.780> space<00:00:37.170> right<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:37.910> there's

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
of them this space right here there's

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.630 
of them this space right here there's
one<00:00:39.090> left<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> right<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
one left one on the right and so this is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.310 
one left one on the right and so this is
a<00:00:41.670> space<00:00:41.969> that's<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> Venge<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.840> space<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.290> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
a space that's the Venge this space is a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.420 
a space that's the Venge this space is a
ventricle<00:00:43.710> event<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.100> think<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
ventricle event you can think of the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.240 
ventricle event you can think of the
ventricle<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.450> holding<00:00:45.899> tank<00:00:46.250> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
ventricle as like a holding tank the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.760 
ventricle as like a holding tank the
third<00:00:47.489> ventricle<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
third ventricle is right here this is

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.090 
third ventricle is right here this is
the<00:00:49.890> muster<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.670> right<00:00:51.180> below<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:52.100> if

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the muster it's a right below it if

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.000 
the muster it's a right below it if
there's<00:00:53.370> another<00:00:53.670> space<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.860> two

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
there's another space and the two

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.130 
there's another space and the two
lateral<00:00:56.340> ventricles<00:00:56.820> empty<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.840> third

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
lateral ventricles empty into the third

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.310 
lateral ventricles empty into the third
ventricle<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.910> one<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.750> one

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
ventricle so one here one one here one

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.260 
ventricle so one here one one here one
here<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:01.980> into<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> third<00:01:02.489> into<00:01:03.059> one

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
here and they go into the third into one

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
here and they go into the third into one
third<00:01:03.510> ventricle<00:01:03.949> it<00:01:04.949> goes<00:01:05.129> down<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
third ventricle it goes down the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.240 
third ventricle it goes down the
cerebral<00:01:06.000> aqueduct<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.930> track<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:08.010> here

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
cerebral aqueduct this track right here

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
cerebral aqueduct this track right here
and<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.939> fourth<00:01:09.150> ventricle<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and this is the fourth ventricle and the

fourth ventricle sits right under the
cerebellum<00:01:16.009> pituitary<00:01:17.009> gland<00:01:17.420> whoa<00:01:20.900> are<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
cerebellum pituitary gland whoa are you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.780 
cerebellum pituitary gland whoa are you
no<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.799> joking

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.990 

okay

okay

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.289 
okay
pituitary<00:01:27.780> glad<00:01:28.490> no<00:01:29.490> wonder<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.820> doesn't<00:01:30.090> fit

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
pituitary glad no wonder it doesn't fit

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.550 
pituitary glad no wonder it doesn't fit
never<00:01:30.570> mind<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:33.240> gets<00:01:33.630> cut<00:01:33.869> off<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
never mind is it gets cut off this is

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.460 
never mind is it gets cut off this is
the<00:01:34.650> dura<00:01:34.829> mater<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.420> this<00:01:36.420> bump<00:01:37.259> right<00:01:37.409> here

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the dura mater it's this bump right here

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.590 
the dura mater it's this bump right here
this<00:01:38.100> big<00:01:39.290> pituitary<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> pituitary

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
this big pituitary that's a pituitary

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the septum pellucidum

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.460 
the septum pellucidum
is<00:01:44.240> this<00:01:46.369> this<00:01:47.369> membrane<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.630> separates<00:01:49.140> it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is this this membrane the separates it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.249 
is this this membrane the separates it
separates<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> lateral<00:01:50.670> ventricles<00:01:51.259> into

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
separates the lateral ventricles into

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.289 
separates the lateral ventricles into
the<00:01:52.380> left<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.710> right<00:01:52.950> lateral<00:01:53.850> ventricles

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
the left and right lateral ventricles

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:03.030 
the left and right lateral ventricles
the<00:01:56.170> optic<00:01:56.530> chiasm<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:58.470> where<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:02.040> optic

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
the optic chiasm is where the optic

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.219 
the optic chiasm is where the optic
nerves<00:02:03.299> cross<00:02:04.299> together<00:02:04.689> because<00:02:05.080> there's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
nerves cross together because there's

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.130 
nerves cross together because there's
one<00:02:05.530> here<00:02:06.100> one<00:02:06.310> here<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.330> when<00:02:07.600> they<00:02:07.720> cross<00:02:07.869> is

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
one here one here and when they cross is

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.190 
one here one here and when they cross is
the<00:02:08.259> optic<00:02:08.560> chiasm<00:02:09.119> after<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.690> optic

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
the optic chiasm after that is the optic

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.589 
the optic chiasm after that is the optic
tract<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:12.069> these<00:02:12.430> are<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.910> optic<00:02:13.150> tracts

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.809 

olfactory<00:02:16.599> bulb<00:02:17.110> are<00:02:17.530> these<00:02:17.800> huge<00:02:18.340> things

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
olfactory bulb are these huge things

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.759 
olfactory bulb are these huge things
these<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.450> also<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.110> olfactory<00:02:20.530> nerve

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
these this is also the olfactory nerve

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.530 
these this is also the olfactory nerve
it's<00:02:21.220> continuous<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.940> can't<00:02:22.150> really<00:02:22.300> tell

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
it's continuous you can't really tell

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.400 
it's continuous you can't really tell
them<00:02:22.690> apart

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
them apart

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.380 
them apart
so<00:02:24.190> that's<00:02:24.340> CN<00:02:24.640> 1<00:02:25.200> CN<00:02:26.200> 2<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.299> the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
so that's CN 1 CN 2 and this is the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.300 
so that's CN 1 CN 2 and this is the
oculomotor<00:02:28.750> nerve<00:02:29.170> it's<00:02:29.860> huge

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
oculomotor nerve it's huge

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.390 
oculomotor nerve it's huge
it's<00:02:30.549> cm3<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.970> two<00:02:34.180> Burson<00:02:34.600> areum<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.400> so

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
it's cm3 the two Burson areum is so

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.789 
it's cm3 the two Burson areum is so

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
trapezoid body is right below it there

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.809 
trapezoid body is right below it there
should<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> distinction<00:02:56.200> there<00:02:56.950> if<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.610> move

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
should be a distinction there if I move

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.090 
should be a distinction there if I move
it<00:02:57.940> move<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.569> this<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:58.959> also<00:02:59.200> dura<00:02:59.350> mater<00:02:59.530> if

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
it move this this is also dura mater if

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.630 
it move this this is also dura mater if
you<00:03:00.760> move<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.180> see<00:03:01.390> there's<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.079> little

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
you move it you see there's a little

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.880 
you move it you see there's a little
line<00:03:03.640> between<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.390> pons<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.049> next<00:03:05.620> part

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
line between the pons and the next part

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.440 
line between the pons and the next part
which<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.310> medulla<00:03:06.700> oblongata

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
which is the medulla oblongata

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.979 
which is the medulla oblongata
so<00:03:08.170> pons<00:03:08.820> trapezoid<00:03:09.820> body<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.510> do<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> Labuan

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
so pons trapezoid body and do a Labuan

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.750 
so pons trapezoid body and do a Labuan
