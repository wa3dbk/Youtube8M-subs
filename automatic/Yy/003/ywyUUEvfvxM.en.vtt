00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
oh no we lost the goal right there after

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.760 
oh no we lost the goal right there after
saying<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> improved<00:01:41.909> my<00:01:41.970> defense<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:43.560> we

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
saying that I improved my defense but we

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.290 
saying that I improved my defense but we
gotta<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.130> back<00:01:44.310> another<00:01:44.579> goal

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.240 

there<00:01:54.300> we<00:01:54.600> go<00:01:54.870> we<00:01:55.140> got<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> goal<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.800> maroon

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
there we go we got a goal with maroon

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.510 
there we go we got a goal with maroon
and<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:57.650> think<00:01:58.650> that's<00:01:58.770> her<00:01:58.860> first<00:01:59.070> line<00:01:59.340> out

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and I think that's her first line out

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.310 
and I think that's her first line out
there<00:01:59.730> so<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.090> did<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.570> crosspiece<00:02:01.170> her

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
there so we did get a crosspiece her

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.710 
there so we did get a crosspiece her
goal<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.610> got<00:02:02.730> it<00:02:02.820> from<00:02:02.940> Karen<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.570> Paul

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
goal and we got it from Karen and Paul

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.390 
goal and we got it from Karen and Paul
