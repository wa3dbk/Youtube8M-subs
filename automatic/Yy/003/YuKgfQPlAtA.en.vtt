00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.359
 software website linked is natural 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.240
 in the description and we start with 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.140
 the weapon from the leon on so first 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.650
 I'm smi 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.609

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.230
 me yes and we will this channel here 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.610
 to lead 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.500
 we have the watch from that and then 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.030
 let's start with but be 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.760
 investors arrived today is still 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.850
 I mean a review on unboxing 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.010
 to make an application would be on 8 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.420
 yes and then after that will also be 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 the boxi formayer we come yours 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.460
 next video but first make 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.620
 the unboxing of his weapon in general 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.149
 she runs as you see here 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.730
 electronics she has all the essays 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.090
 also in it and she has just 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.420
 a magazine that can actually see 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.299
 that one so two double capacity 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.990
 I think 40 balls if I'm not 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.700
 crazy 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:23.970
 yes so electric has 40 ball and 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:27.450
 direct battery 0 5 joule wants to know 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.250
 So yes, yes, yes, yes, we just want to 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.680
 We start with the first sport we do 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.680
 Also a movie and everything comes 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.390
 So the weapon is the right time 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:45.220
 he can not say that is one 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:48.080
 unpack your packaging yourself 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:55.009
 So here's the info here again 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.050
 has the either wm 83 us command and 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.950
 So I have the video then becomes too 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.090
 my get and the g36 c of 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.640
 heckler &amp; cook and also to another 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:10.280
 brand force no idea and now 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:15.700
 open as that may be the fuck 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:20.690
 the grossman is so we have game 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.910
 then the charging cable for the battery here 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:31.580
 few balls 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:33.769
 I think 0.2 mufflers ever 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.660
 really big now so compared to 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.580
 my hand so I let myself in 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.320
 little chip here I have something over 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.120
 the cap belongs to the genfer up here 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.989
 and that it goes off easily but that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.579
 yes you can stick battery for that is 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:53.480
 a pressure battery I think yes do 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:57.579
 which then have the more things to do later 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.579
 we have friendship here at the moment 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:08.560
 what lies underneath is the reason 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.840
 loading status of the situation saw that died there 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.700
 if you make the ball in then you can 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.600
 just pure flow so this thing there 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.110
 you can push in 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.060
 oh well so you survive 2 are so here 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.980
 we have the pointer of the laser pointer 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.599
 up here is adjustable on the wheel 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.680
 May I explain briefly by 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.540
 you can screw it up on it yourself 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.850
 that's why it comes in the battery 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.400
 who can be here still on on the sides 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.790
 Adjust the wheels of the pointer 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.170
 So that is usually not exactly in the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.150
 center 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:54.850
 That's why, in any case, a lot 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:58.000
 cool part I would say here is 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.269
 the vdk down to screw as far as I can 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.340
 white down there draufstecken so sharply 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.489
 we can get on the rail immediately 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.299
 and then turn down so that is solid 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.420
 here is a normal one 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:16.750
 estuary delta horny estuary stampa 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.150
 Here we would have the shoulder support 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.530
 the shoulder support the course so the 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.289
 Revenge is really quite long 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:34.979
 rarely with the attached it will he good 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:34.979
 he looks quite stable. tauss is just okay 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.300
 I want the battery , frankly 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.900
 probably that is also charged 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.900
 but we do not know 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.880
 then i meant the lake up 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.389
 Counter here is the situation died as one 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.280
 sees it then applies to the magazine 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.180
 and an idea that is down there 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.980
 magazin at 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.110
 Here you do it up here 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.500
 and then you with this rod 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.500
 shove 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.250
 you can do that or not 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.320
 that is both possible 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.220
 Shit and looks a horny yes 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.220
 this shit does not matter 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.390
 you can put it off 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.430
 So then everyone sees that 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.280
 after how it pleases you it is 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.169
 yes, so that's it , if that's what it is 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.490
 even so well suspects that make no 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.490
 to mention brittle impression 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:56.050
 I would keep or I'll do okay 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.240
 an example looks like this with things 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.940
 solo switzerland she is heavy 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.410
 So looks with addition, more so and there 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.100
 So it's a bit of a carla house 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:10.750
 someone who keeps it then cumbersome 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:13.150
 So we have here we do indeed 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.280
 okay so that was the unboxing to 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.860
 receiver like still want a baby 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.970
 to the m4 comes and a shot me 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.620
 hope you liked it 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.510
 or we hope you have it 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.510
 fallen and show
