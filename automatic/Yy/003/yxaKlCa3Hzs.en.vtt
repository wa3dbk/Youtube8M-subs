00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.259
 you oh i am i again 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.900
 but if you have that I already have one later 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.059
 what job I could do 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.400
 and if I would like that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.200
 so i actually say yes i have this 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 never had it and then I thought so 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.890
 that I might make a video about this 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.599
 I can already help more people here and we 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.029
 We also see an idea 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.480
 you never know so let's go 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.900
 to start 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.630
 if first what so would you or what would i do 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.859
 could be for a vacation job 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 I am someone who is not that far from it 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.900
 not so many trips means something in the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.850
 tour 10 amp you coffee that way 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.860
 close to Amsterdam what I like 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.300
 especially hand and go faster and from time to time 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.210
 faster at 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.310
 just want to go to work and something yes 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.960
 it would just well deserve what you what 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.910
 course have money I think 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.220
 just important and that I have looked at 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.010
 and what I do like is 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.200
 for example, apply to what she can 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.310
 never was mad at was just super fun 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.990
 and just can 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.760
 so that I also just need in the 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.189
 evening or in the afternoon or week a lot 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.380
 way to wash or go home 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.399
 on the kids you god get you in bed and go 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.490
 watch TV 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.990
 that's super nice really than well that is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 just a team you guys i do n't like 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 so much of chrome also runs of course 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.200
 it's just super smart that's just 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.609
 in the evening in the morning you have to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 I think 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.030
 throw drinks in the mailbox in one 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.170
 certain street or something that nothing for it 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.729
 me but there are people that already 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.590
 in no way have any problem with it 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.150
 then I thought of course I can too 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.400
 just go to the supermarket 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.780
 works that the ash is usually above 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.229
 the 16 or 16 years that it is so funny 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.030
 but I don't have that much with it either 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.700
 it is already doing a little vesicle 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.200
 I thought the IJssel because in my village they 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.479
 to travel around recently and that is 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.970
 super nice because in the long time we still have ours 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.369
 place i think i'll first 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.799
 watch the local broadcaster 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.820
 you have on the radio and on the tv and then 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.200
 I naturally want to watch TV 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.729
 because i can just do things a lot 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.350
 easy myself I still not edited that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.289
 i can come up with ideas people 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.149
 interviewing so super nice and that we want 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.489
 like to try 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.410
 Well then of course you need to know what 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.019
 Your rights and duties are what you see 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.230

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.810

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.239

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.760
 I am sixteen or seventeen and therefore have 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.250
 already have tickets that you click on 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.049
 for example, may do work where we are not 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.930
 Then you must work again 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.870

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.900
 always remember that you focus on paulus 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.030
 because paulus is something you just do 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.530
 must take you must occasionally i think 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.180
 you have to take a rest 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.250
 you have to be responsible what are they 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.560
 just need what i just said care 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.250
 that your work is fun then it is faster 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.140
 ready rather than pleasure and then 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.239
 it's not so bad to be older because you 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.760
 likes it and keeps it that way 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.920
 you make the right when imagine you walk 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.079
 criminal record not then you have what it still 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.359
 proof that you have worked longer and 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.549
 so that you go again even if you have to 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.139
 is going to apply or I know a lot I am going 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.850
