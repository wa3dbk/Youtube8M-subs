00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
them how cold liquid nitrogen is what is

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:09.500 
them how cold liquid nitrogen is what is
it<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.920> why<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.760> hold<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> cup<00:01:09.270> because

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
remember we were talking it's an

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070 
remember we were talking it's an
insulator<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.700> an<00:01:18.090> insulator<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
insulator right an insulator and so it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.450 
insulator right an insulator and so it
kind<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> protects<00:01:19.680> us<00:01:19.830> from<00:01:19.890> there<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.340> it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
kind of protects us from there so it's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
kind of protects us from there so it's
perfectly<00:01:20.820> fine<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.869> wanted<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> freeze

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
perfectly fine if you wanted to freeze

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.890 
perfectly fine if you wanted to freeze
dry<00:01:23.040> something<00:01:23.369> mr.<00:01:24.090> Kovarik<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> way<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
dry something mr. Kovarik the way you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.120 
dry something mr. Kovarik the way you
would<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.740> let's<00:01:25.920> say<00:01:26.009> see

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
would do it is this is let's say see

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.070 
would do it is this is let's say see
those<00:01:26.430> marshmallows<00:01:26.970> try<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.330> would<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.689> all

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
don't put it in liquid nitrogen

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.859 
don't put it in liquid nitrogen
yeah<00:01:32.490> eggs<00:01:35.060> well<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> bad

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
yeah eggs well you know it's not a bad

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.539 
yeah eggs well you know it's not a bad
idea<00:01:37.079> here<00:01:37.560> hold<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> second<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.340> but

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
idea here hold on a second here but

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.100 
idea here hold on a second here but
those<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> liquid<00:01:39.299> nitrogen<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.810> that's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
those are the liquid nitrogen so that's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
those are the liquid nitrogen so that's
a<00:01:40.229> good<00:01:40.350> idea<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.159> here's<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:41.850> happens

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
a good idea so now here's what happens

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
a good idea so now here's what happens
is<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.689> literally<00:01:42.990> are<00:01:43.259> freeze<00:01:43.560> drying<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
is we literally are freeze drying it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.980 
is we literally are freeze drying it
when<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.189> talk<00:01:44.610> about<00:01:44.640> flash<00:01:45.149> freezing<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
when they talk about flash freezing and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.630 
when they talk about flash freezing and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
we're gonna do inside the Spangler's a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.880 
we're gonna do inside the Spangler's a
little<00:02:18.390> mixture<00:02:18.750> here<00:02:18.990> isn't<00:02:19.500> funny<00:02:19.680> how<00:02:19.830> she

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
little mixture here isn't funny how she

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
little mixture here isn't funny how she
has<00:02:20.100> no<00:02:20.340> idea<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.880> we<00:02:20.970> kind<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.300> take<00:02:21.420> things

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
has no idea that we kind of take things

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.060 
has no idea that we kind of take things
online<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:25.230> need<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.470> start<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.830> base

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
online so we need to start with a base

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.040 
online so we need to start with a base
and<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.490> leave<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.000> or<00:02:27.120> not<00:02:27.209> all<00:02:27.390> I'll<00:02:27.630> just<00:02:27.870> use

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
and so leave it or not all I'll just use

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.500 
and so leave it or not all I'll just use
like<00:02:28.200> some<00:02:28.440> french<00:02:28.770> vanilla<00:02:29.090> maybe<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.209> little

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
like some french vanilla maybe a little

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.790 
like some french vanilla maybe a little
half-and-half<00:02:31.050> because<00:02:31.410> that's<00:02:31.560> kind<00:02:31.770> of

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
half-and-half because that's kind of

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.930 
half-and-half because that's kind of
good<00:02:31.980> too<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.490> little<00:02:32.760> bit<00:02:32.850> of

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
good too so a little bit of

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.270 
good too so a little bit of
half-and-half<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.630> then<00:02:34.140> we<00:02:34.290> stir<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.100> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
half-and-half and then we stir it up and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.610 
half-and-half and then we stir it up and
the<00:02:35.370> secret<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.850> ever<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.690> slowly<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.380> we<00:02:37.500> kind

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the secret is ever so slowly do we kind

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.960 
the secret is ever so slowly do we kind
of<00:02:37.740> stir<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.250> see<00:02:38.430> if<00:02:38.490> we<00:02:38.580> can<00:02:38.670> start<00:02:38.850> to

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
of stir it up and see if we can start to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.430 
of stir it up and see if we can start to
get<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.270> freeze<00:02:39.510> fair<00:02:39.810> enough<00:02:40.020> okay<00:02:40.140> so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
get it to freeze fair enough okay so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.960 
get it to freeze fair enough okay so
here's<00:02:40.890> our<00:02:40.980> liquid<00:02:41.280> nitrogen<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.820> goes

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
here's our liquid nitrogen that goes

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
inside just a little tiny bit and we

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.100 
inside just a little tiny bit and we
kind<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.709> let<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.860> go<00:02:44.300> see<00:02:45.300> how<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.510> goes

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
kind of let it go see how it goes

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.160 
kind of let it go see how it goes
