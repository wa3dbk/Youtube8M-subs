00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.360 

okay<00:00:00.989> so<00:00:01.319> if<00:00:01.560> you've<00:00:01.740> overhauled<00:00:02.220> the

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
okay so if you've overhauled the

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.800 
okay so if you've overhauled the
seven-to-three<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.389> you're<00:00:03.510> finding<00:00:03.689> the

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
seven-to-three and you're finding the

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.960 
seven-to-three and you're finding the
temperature<00:00:04.259> needs<00:00:04.470> reset<00:00:04.950> resetting<00:00:05.819> itself

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
temperature needs reset resetting itself

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.000 
temperature needs reset resetting itself
is<00:00:06.330> fairly<00:00:06.600> straightforward<00:00:07.500> other<00:00:07.799> than

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
is fairly straightforward other than

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.180 
is fairly straightforward other than
doing<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.340> circle<00:00:08.550> clubs<00:00:08.820> so<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:10.010> indices<00:00:11.010> on

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
doing the circle clubs so the indices on

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.879 
doing the circle clubs so the indices on
here<00:00:11.400> goes<00:00:11.639> from<00:00:11.880> zero<00:00:12.179> tonight<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.530> reset

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
here goes from zero tonight and to reset

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.079 
here goes from zero tonight and to reset
the<00:00:14.070> temperature<00:00:14.460> if<00:00:14.610> you're<00:00:14.730> finding<00:00:14.940> that

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
the temperature if you're finding that

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.060 
the temperature if you're finding that
names<00:00:15.450> not<00:00:15.750> just<00:00:16.020> quite<00:00:16.260> hot<00:00:16.500> enough<00:00:16.529> what<00:00:16.949> you

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
names not just quite hot enough what you

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.490 
names not just quite hot enough what you
need<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:18.029> go<00:00:18.660> back<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.080> set<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.439> other

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
need to do is go back and set the other

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.170 
need to do is go back and set the other
sister<00:00:19.920> five<00:00:20.220> that's<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.760> middle<00:00:21.060> position

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
sister five that's the middle position

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:34.710 
sister five that's the middle position
and<00:00:21.750> then<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.920> need<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.160> do

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.660 

from<00:00:35.720> here's<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.320> dreaded<00:00:36.560> circlet<00:00:37.160> which

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
from here's the dreaded circlet which

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.400 
from here's the dreaded circlet which
comes<00:00:38.000> off<00:00:38.180> easy

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.740 

and<00:00:45.410> then<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.070> would<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:46.970> is<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.240> empty<00:00:47.540> place

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
and then so would you is the empty place

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.470 
and then so would you is the empty place
off<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.260> what<00:00:48.920> was<00:00:49.130> the<00:00:49.340> 5<00:00:49.550> position<00:00:49.820> tell<00:00:50.300> not

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
off and what was the 5 position tell not

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.540 
off and what was the 5 position tell not
to<00:00:50.660> see<00:00:50.900> it<00:00:51.020> approximately<00:00:51.650> the<00:00:51.830> 3<00:00:52.040> position

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
to see it approximately the 3 position

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.240 
to see it approximately the 3 position
so<00:00:53.300> what<00:00:53.450> was<00:00:53.720> temperature<00:00:54.380> 5<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:55.040> low

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
so what was temperature 5 is low

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.940 
so what was temperature 5 is low
temperature<00:00:55.850> 3<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:57.290> really<00:00:57.739> means

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
temperature 3 and so that really means

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.170 
temperature 3 and so that really means
that<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:58.190> can<00:00:58.340> turn<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.700> whole<00:00:58.850> thing<00:00:59.060> up

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
that you can turn the whole thing up

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.590 
that you can turn the whole thing up
just<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.540> little<00:00:59.570> further<00:01:01.030> as<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.210> said<00:01:02.390> before

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
just a little further as I said before

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.570 
just a little further as I said before
you<00:01:02.900> don't<00:01:03.050> necessarily<00:01:03.530> need<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.100> do<00:01:04.400> this

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
you don't necessarily need to do this

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.810 
you don't necessarily need to do this
but<00:01:05.320> if<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.830> said<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.160> thing<00:01:07.340> I<00:01:07.430> properly

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
but if you said the thing I properly

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.640 
but if you said the thing I properly
when<00:01:08.150> then<00:01:08.450> when<00:01:08.720> you're<00:01:08.869> rebuilding<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.440> but

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
when then when you're rebuilding it but

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.109 
when then when you're rebuilding it but
if<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:09.950> need<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.160> do<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.369> that's<00:01:10.520> what<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.790> do

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
if you need to do it that's what to do

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.560 
if you need to do it that's what to do
so<00:01:11.479> what<00:01:11.780> happens<00:01:12.170> here<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.570> spring

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
so what happens here is that the spring

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.109 
so what happens here is that the spring
self<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.410> string<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.160> goes<00:01:16.220> on<00:01:16.580> then<00:01:16.940> the

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
self is the string that goes on then the

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:30.400 
self is the string that goes on then the
washer<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.840> they<00:01:18.759> this<00:01:19.759> is<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:29.290> what<00:01:30.290> you've

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
washer and they this is the what you've

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.600 
washer and they this is the what you've
just<00:01:30.440> seen<00:01:30.770> there's<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.160> once-in-a-lifetime

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
just seen there's a once-in-a-lifetime

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.660 
just seen there's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience<00:01:32.119> in<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:33.110> first<00:01:33.259> thing<00:01:33.670> normally

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
experience in the first thing normally

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.330 
experience in the first thing normally
it's<00:01:34.790> not<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.090> easy<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:37.280> need<00:01:39.100> floor<00:01:40.100> not

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
it's not that easy you need floor not

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.090 
it's not that easy you need floor not
one<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:40.880> make<00:01:41.659> sure<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.050> screws<00:01:42.380> take<00:01:42.680> really

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
one I make sure the screws take really

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.010 
one I make sure the screws take really
all<00:01:43.340> before<00:01:43.550> you<00:01:43.790> test<00:01:44.120> it<00:01:44.330> because<00:01:44.720> unless

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
all before you test it because unless

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.200 
all before you test it because unless
you<00:01:45.230> have<00:01:45.260> this<00:01:45.620> floor<00:01:46.520> knob<00:01:46.730> when<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.000> screw

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
you have this floor knob when the screw

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.930 
you have this floor knob when the screw
through<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:47.720> then<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.740> won't<00:01:48.890> properly<00:01:49.400> and

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
through on then it won't properly and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.399 
through on then it won't properly and
that's<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.540> just<00:01:50.659> need<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.020> then<00:01:51.200> from

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
that's it you just need to then from

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.350 
that's it you just need to then from
then<00:01:51.590> turn<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.550> water<00:01:52.670> on<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.150> see<00:01:53.300> if

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
then turn the water on it and see if

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.420 
then turn the water on it and see if
you've<00:01:53.479> got<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.690> correct<00:01:53.840> temperature<00:01:54.430> if

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
you've got the correct temperature if

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.250 
you've got the correct temperature if
it's<00:01:55.640> not<00:01:55.820> then<00:01:56.030> using<00:01:56.510> the<00:01:56.570> same<00:01:56.780> method<00:01:57.140> you

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
it's not then using the same method you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.719 
it's not then using the same method you
can<00:01:57.409> either<00:01:57.740> increase<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.190> temperature<00:01:58.580> a

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
can either increase the temperature a

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.390 
can either increase the temperature a
little<00:01:58.850> more<00:01:59.300> again<00:01:59.600> by<00:02:00.010> with<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.190> five

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
little more again by with the five

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.310 
little more again by with the five
position<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.510> they're<00:02:02.840> telling<00:02:03.200> the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
position and they're telling the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.440 
position and they're telling the
temperature<00:02:03.770> not<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.190> see<00:02:04.430> all<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.729> us<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.240> what

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
temperature not to see all of us to what

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.940 
temperature not to see all of us to what
did<00:02:05.900> you<00:02:05.960> just<00:02:06.020> do<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.470> other<00:02:06.500> relayed

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
did you just do that the other relayed

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.440 
did you just do that the other relayed
and<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:07.850> that's<00:02:08.030> how<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.179> set<00:02:08.420> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
and so that's how you set the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.870 
and so that's how you set the
temperature<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:09.110> these

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.940 

you
