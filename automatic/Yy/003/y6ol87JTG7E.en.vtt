00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.190
 Neumarkt in the Upper Palatinate in this Bavarian province city, there is one 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:18.300
 Man who lived his dreams it is a resinous or Helmut Hofmann 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.560
 he is the man estimated by car and is considered the largest private collector of 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.949
 legendary Meike Bartz 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.779
 As so often in life, the beer car now has ten stamps of model cars 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.649
 if you have stones he has the minister for the second and third 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.780
 and fourth place 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.870
 meanwhile, Hofmann has 15 May expected 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.600
 The architect Johannes Berschneider now has the museum a museum for his 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.680
 Conjured treasures and converted for a former bicycle factory and 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.570
 expanded 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.870
 It is the world's first roof museum 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.010
 the company logo the double mm arc triangle 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 stands for Maybach engine construction since 100 years 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.180
 Synonymous with German high technology and absolute luxury in the twenties and 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.620
 thirties of the last century 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.660
 Automobile dreams for the super rich powerful and famous for example 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.660
 Enrico Caruso or Marc Springer 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.250
 The fascination certainly goes firstly from Wilhelm simply out of it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.750
 Forms prove we have at the age of ten 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.030
 and with Leos he made the king of the designers he was 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.750
 also dominated the Mercedes built from 19 1 clock after the death of 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.020
 Art in a small place 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.430
 and with the second this 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.540
 for high-performance engines and luxury vehicles 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.170
 and perfect companies that have been fair by Wilhelm and Karl Maybach 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.619
 Helmut Hofmann and his wife have had everything the museum over the years 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.980
 self-financed 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.990
 Storm 2 you can calm this elegant car 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.280
 relatively easy to guess that he is not 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.220
 For 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.320
 Tenzin Meiler has been built but that I'm fourth swiss general 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.770
 Importer has got this wagon Exter for having contractions and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.810
 the payment 19 38 them Geneva 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.179
 below has thought about what you can do to have an eye-catcher 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.849
 under 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.799
 it was because of this 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.299
 No a chassis with the long wheelbase selected and on this long 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.299
 Wheelbase you have put on a two-door Cavaliere 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.970
 Of course, to the father then if only two doors has since, of course 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.389
 also correspondingly long doors 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:27.499
 and 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.839
 One now once considered the interior once considered 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.259
 that only the finest materials have been used here 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:39.159
 From the connolly leather this high quality impression of the door will be 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.489
 then also in the interior away so they already see the 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.019
 Sill guards percent that worked wonderfully 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.269
 then the daily that accumulated the seats the fine processing of the seats 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:56.679
 if you look further forward then you will do the sammer 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.429
 that of course his 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.079
 diversity 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.239
 Dashboard to other vehicles Cesar time clearly different 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.609
 There was no limit to the equipment requirements in the rich clientele 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.370
 only the bank account had to be full 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.510
 so the vehicles were always unique of the highest exclusivity 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.399
 if they do not connect this door Spahn he joins them too 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.509
 with this plan 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.509
 the little one it is today 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.159
 a symphony for their ears 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.969
 also the engine of the Maibach cares for attention 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.969
 this was the park open 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.879
 Simply create Kisslegg online 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.479
 see you too 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.519
 these two carburetors from Sonax 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.559
 2 double carburetors 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:55.739
 and that ultimately give the vehicle as much fuel as a percent that it 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.849
 Can develop 140 hp 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.879
 here the container for the central cut it was not matter either 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.809
 This is no longer the case for the environment 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.919
 Lubrication points Bridges can be made from them by the push of a button 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.339
 the smudges of this car Donets 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.289
 and that are supplied 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:18.909
 Because the vehicle was in Switzerland during the war, it did too 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.749
 otherwise you would have to expect that is just in the 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.749
 Trouble of the war fourth car would have been scrapped 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:30.429
 individual Maibach collectors will be up to three million euros 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:35.679
 incredible treasures like here in the brand new maybach museum in Neumarkt in 

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:37.369
 the Upper Palatinate are gathered
