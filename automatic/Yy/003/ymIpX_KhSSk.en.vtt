walking make sure you're staying in the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.499 
walking make sure you're staying in the
boundaries<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.320> actual<00:01:22.680> map<00:01:22.890> itself<00:01:23.509> as

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
boundaries of the actual map itself as

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.690 
boundaries of the actual map itself as
much<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.520> this

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
shoot the players on top of the map can

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
shoot the players on top of the map can
shoot<00:01:33.210> down<00:01:33.240> underneath<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> map<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.560> kill

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
shoot down underneath the map and kill
