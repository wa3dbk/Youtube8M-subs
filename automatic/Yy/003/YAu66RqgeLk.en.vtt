00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.640
 think about it

 I did not expect iphone 5 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.270
 the result of this desire to amaze 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.910
 kick it was completely changed for the first time 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.300
 for all the time we increased the size of the display 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.010
 and chaff making the screen higher but not wider you 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.930

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.960

 scrolls became part of the history of iphone 5 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.440

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.079
 tedious scrolling while reading 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.300

 iphone 5 display thinnest iphone 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.660
 what we did to achieve design 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.390
 this height we had to completely 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.910
 revise the internal architecture 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.130
 device he is 18 percent bigger and 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.660
 seven hundred and ninety five percent higher 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.090

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.560
 iphone 5 to stabilize a little 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.780
 images from iphone 5 to that height 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.700
 signal reception has never been stupid 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.530

 wide hd display 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.250

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.920
 iphone used to put friends for 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.990
 our faces so we represent the body 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.689

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.170
 defects in like never before 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.420
 we looked far beyond what 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 we were expected to take all of our 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.800
 knowledge is all one to understand something 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.770

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.780
