 conventional otto engines are being used 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.300
 so-called b cycle engine that open

 and closing the inlet valve in time 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.960
 this translates into consumption values 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.100
 as you would otherwise only get from 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.290
