00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.579 
looking at right now I mean I i think
that<00:05:56.899> they<00:05:57.019> they<00:05:57.529> did<00:05:57.769> a<00:05:57.800> good<00:05:58.550> job<00:05:59.589> probably

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:00.589 
that they they did a good job probably

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:01.989 
that they they did a good job probably
left<00:06:00.800> them<00:06:00.889> right<00:06:01.039> here<00:06:01.099> like<00:06:01.459> the<00:06:01.580> stitching

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:01.999 
left them right here like the stitching

I don't know me to see that like you
still<00:06:03.559> see<00:06:03.679> like<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:03.919> glue<00:06:04.159> right<00:06:04.369> there<00:06:04.899> that

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:05.899 
still see like the glue right there that

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:09.999 
still see like the glue right there that
was<00:06:06.019> like<00:06:06.139> kind<00:06:06.439> of<00:06:06.939> you<00:06:07.939> know<00:06:08.559> kind<00:06:09.559> of<00:06:09.709> sloppy

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
was like kind of you know kind of sloppy
