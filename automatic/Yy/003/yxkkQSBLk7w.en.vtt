00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:49.310
 as we see divid works just 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:51.440
 the way the batteries are built it so 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:59.510
 batteries we have a check point 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:11.860
 does the console work or not, for example, stop 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:11.860
 we press and the remote works for you headlines 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:26.480
 so she will reproduce weird and so 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.690
 I want to say about this find was found 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.480

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.650
 interesting and quite workable here 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.469
