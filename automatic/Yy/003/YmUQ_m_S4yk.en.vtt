00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
snapshot that was full of bug fixes a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.709 
snapshot that was full of bug fixes a
lot<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.899> small<00:00:34.260> things<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.710> lot<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
lot of small things a lot of a

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.600 
lot of small things a lot of a
performance<00:00:36.719> improvement<00:00:36.840> again<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.160> also<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
performance improvement again but also a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.630 
performance improvement again but also a
few<00:00:39.030> interesting<00:00:39.719> features<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:41.190> affect

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
few interesting features that affect

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.910 
few interesting features that affect
gameplay<00:00:41.850> gameplay<00:00:42.660> directly<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.770> should

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
gameplay gameplay directly so we should

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.910 
gameplay gameplay directly so we should
look<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.309> them<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.180> sure<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.469> yeah<00:00:46.680> we

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
look at them for sure and but yeah we

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.779 
look at them for sure and but yeah we
can<00:00:47.160> say<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.969> got<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.690> information

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
can say I got this information

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.779 
can say I got this information
definitely<00:00:50.789> say<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:52.100> 1.8<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.370> feature

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
definitely say that 1.8 is feature

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.130 
definitely say that 1.8 is feature
complete<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:55.010> don't<00:00:56.010> think<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:57.140> major

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
complete I don't think we will see major

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.819 
complete I don't think we will see major
changes<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.949> major<00:00:59.219> new<00:00:59.629> yeah<00:01:00.649> features<00:01:01.649> now

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
changes are major new yeah features now

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.910 
changes are major new yeah features now
until<00:01:02.190> 1.8<00:01:02.820> comes<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.080> maybe<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
until 1.8 comes out so maybe that is a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.760 
until 1.8 comes out so maybe that is a
hint<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> could<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.000> close<00:01:06.479> who<00:01:06.780> knows<00:01:07.049> so

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
hint that it could be close who knows so

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.940 
hint that it could be close who knows so
yeah<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.850> shall<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.600> let's<00:01:10.290> look<00:01:10.530> into<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
yeah we shall see so let's look into the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.920 
yeah we shall see so let's look into the
first<00:01:11.220> things<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:11.700> daylight<00:01:12.180> sensors<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
first things here daylight sensors we

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.320 
first things here daylight sensors we
have<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.200> set<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.460> i<00:01:14.610> set<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
have it set up here then i set up and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.560 
have it set up here then i set up and
daylight<00:01:16.080> sensors<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.100> two<00:01:17.490> states<00:01:17.850> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
daylight sensors now have two states you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
daylight sensors now have two states you
can<00:01:18.780> switch<00:01:19.110> between<00:01:19.740> yeah<00:01:20.430> how<00:01:20.549> could<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
can switch between yeah how could you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.270 
can switch between yeah how could you
call<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.509> day<00:01:21.869> mode<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> night<00:01:22.950> mode

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
call it in a day mode in a night mode

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.510 
call it in a day mode in a night mode
and<00:01:23.580> when<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:24.990> click<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.560> add<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.340> light

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and when you right click on add a light

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.039 
and when you right click on add a light
sensor<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.060> switch<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.479> out<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> it's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
sensor you can switch it out and it's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.580 
sensor you can switch it out and it's
basically<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.659> converted<00:01:30.659> signal<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
basically just the converted signal and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.210 
basically just the converted signal and
as<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:34.680> let<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.860> time

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
as you can see here you let the time

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.940 
as you can see here you let the time
pass<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.939> bit<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.350> see<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.710> just

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
pass a little bit you can see it's just

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.270 
pass a little bit you can see it's just
yeah<00:01:38.310> invert<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.170> now<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.229> basically<00:01:40.920> switch

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
yeah invert it now we basically switch

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.719 
yeah invert it now we basically switch
over<00:01:42.619> remains<00:01:43.619> dark<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> certain<00:01:44.670> amount

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
over remains dark for a certain amount

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.920 
over remains dark for a certain amount
of<00:01:45.030> time<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:46.070> slowly<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.340> surely<00:01:47.930> we

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
of time and then slowly but surely we

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.260 
of time and then slowly but surely we
will<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:50.040> backwards<00:01:50.460> again<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.909> yeah<00:01:51.090> that's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
will go backwards again so yeah that's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
will go backwards again so yeah that's
the<00:01:51.450> thing<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:52.409> invert<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.720> mean<00:01:54.720> okay

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the thing just invert it I mean okay

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.280 
the thing just invert it I mean okay
pretty<00:01:56.219> useful<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.210> super<00:01:57.540> useful<00:01:57.719> okay

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
pretty useful but not super useful okay

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.730 
pretty useful but not super useful okay
so<00:01:58.350> let's<00:01:58.680> make<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.890> day<00:01:59.159> again<00:02:00.380> we<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.530> some

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
so let's make it day again we have some

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
so let's make it day again we have some
setups<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.700> know<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.969> not<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.180> you

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
setups here you know it's not like you

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.510 
setups here you know it's not like you
can<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:04.170> put<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.619> daylight<00:02:04.979> sensor<00:02:05.399> on

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
can just now put this daylight sensor on

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.219 
can just now put this daylight sensor on
a<00:02:05.549> lamp<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.390> turns<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> night

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
a lamp and it just turns on in the night

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.130 
a lamp and it just turns on in the night
there's<00:02:07.680> only<00:02:07.890> two<00:02:08.879> thousand<00:02:09.330> tix<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.810> time

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
there's only two thousand tix of time

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.809 
there's only two thousand tix of time
but<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.440> actually<00:02:10.590> completely<00:02:11.220> shuts<00:02:11.580> off

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
but it actually completely shuts off

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.890 
but it actually completely shuts off
like<00:02:12.090> this

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
like this

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
down let's do this with this guy here

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.760 
down let's do this with this guy here
might<00:06:47.500> take<00:06:47.740> a<00:06:47.770> while<00:06:48.039> come<00:06:48.909> on<00:06:49.090> come<00:06:49.389> on<00:06:49.770> break

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
might take a while come on come on break

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.129 
might take a while come on come on break
you<00:06:50.889> down<00:06:51.099> you<00:06:51.400> can<00:06:51.580> see<00:06:51.610> split<00:06:52.419> up<00:06:52.599> and<00:06:52.870> all

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139 
you down you can see split up and all

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.670 
you down you can see split up and all
the<00:06:53.490> offspring<00:06:54.490> keep<00:06:55.300> stir<00:06:55.599> the<00:06:56.050> name<00:06:56.229> tech<00:06:56.500> as

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
the offspring keep stir the name tech as

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.029 
the offspring keep stir the name tech as
well<00:06:56.919> yeah<00:06:57.639> have<00:06:58.060> more<00:06:58.389> sadly<00:06:59.169> they<00:06:59.830> don't

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
well yeah have more sadly they don't

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:01.800 
well yeah have more sadly they don't
drop<00:07:00.340> name<00:07:00.580> tags<00:07:00.939> if<00:07:01.150> you<00:07:01.270> kill<00:07:01.449> them<00:07:01.599> that

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
drop name tags if you kill them that

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.050 
drop name tags if you kill them that
would<00:07:01.960> be<00:07:02.080> a<00:07:02.110> nice<00:07:02.319> way<00:07:02.349> to<00:07:02.590> clone<00:07:03.099> name<00:07:03.759> tags

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
would be a nice way to clone name tags

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.209 
would be a nice way to clone name tags
and<00:07:04.300> of<00:07:04.360> course<00:07:04.599> the<00:07:04.780> same<00:07:04.930> thing<00:07:05.229> happens<00:07:05.979> for

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:06.219 
and of course the same thing happens for

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:10.200 
and of course the same thing happens for
the<00:07:06.430> regular<00:07:07.060> slime<00:07:07.300> AKA<00:07:07.750> magma<00:07:08.229> cube<00:07:08.439> too<00:07:09.370> so

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
the regular slime AKA magma cube too so

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.499 
the regular slime AKA magma cube too so
those<00:07:11.139> are<00:07:11.439> i<00:07:11.860> would<00:07:12.310> say<00:07:12.460> the<00:07:12.639> most<00:07:12.849> important

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:13.509 
those are i would say the most important

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.420 
those are i would say the most important
fixes<00:07:13.930> um<00:07:14.110> another<00:07:14.949> thing<00:07:15.069> that<00:07:15.400> is

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
fixes um another thing that is

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.300 
fixes um another thing that is
interesting<00:07:16.150> to<00:07:16.569> measure<00:07:16.779> on<00:07:17.020> the<00:07:17.050> side<00:07:17.469> the

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310 
interesting to measure on the side the

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.740 
interesting to measure on the side the
AI<00:07:18.669> now<00:07:19.529> is<00:07:20.529> it<00:07:20.919> it's<00:07:21.310> a<00:07:21.460> test<00:07:21.759> it's<00:07:22.029> threaded

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
AI now is it it's a test it's threaded

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.189 
AI now is it it's a test it's threaded
too<00:07:23.020> so<00:07:23.979> that<00:07:24.819> should<00:07:25.060> maybe<00:07:25.479> improve<00:07:25.960> some

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
too so that should maybe improve some

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:29.399 
too so that should maybe improve some
performance<00:07:26.830> for<00:07:27.490> example<00:07:27.939> if<00:07:28.419> a<00:07:28.539> lot<00:07:28.719> of<00:07:28.870> mops

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:29.409 
performance for example if a lot of mops

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:31.529 
performance for example if a lot of mops
are<00:07:29.680> around<00:07:30.129> and<00:07:30.430> tracking<00:07:30.849> certain<00:07:31.270> things

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
are around and tracking certain things

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:35.339 
are around and tracking certain things
and<00:07:31.840> hopefully<00:07:32.830> should<00:07:33.669> Yemm<00:07:34.389> yeah<00:07:34.900> improve

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:35.349 
and hopefully should Yemm yeah improve

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:37.679 
and hopefully should Yemm yeah improve
performance<00:07:35.680> do<00:07:35.979> it<00:07:36.129> it<00:07:36.909> will<00:07:37.029> mostly<00:07:37.449> help

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:37.689 
performance do it it will mostly help

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:41.550 
performance do it it will mostly help
service<00:07:38.110> i<00:07:38.259> would<00:07:38.439> say<00:07:38.650> after<00:07:39.659> after<00:07:40.659> I'm<00:07:41.110> yeah

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 
service i would say after after I'm yeah

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.249 
service i would say after after I'm yeah
so<00:07:42.310> I've<00:07:42.400> load<00:07:42.699> their<00:07:43.029> of<00:07:43.180> the<00:07:43.449> processor<00:07:43.960> load

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:44.259 
so I've load their of the processor load

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:48.540 
so I've load their of the processor load
and<00:07:44.830> yeah<00:07:45.490> I'd<00:07:46.060> say<00:07:46.120> that's<00:07:47.080> it<00:07:47.409> for<00:07:48.129> this<00:07:48.490> week
