00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.629
 Today I want you a whole 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.809
 special discovery on my part 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.010
 Imagine me still myself 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.640
 not exactly because it does not have it 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.980
 should keep 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.300
 because on the one hand I found it very difficult 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.220
 On the other hand, I am totally accessible 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.460
 enthusiastic and blown away and that 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.150
 this is the saga series 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.970
 the cross cult publisher and according to the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.120
 Klappentext behind on a comic series 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.920
 the word with three awards 6h and one 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.870
 hugo awards was awarded 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.190
 that can not be bad thinks 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.800
 because they are very prestigious 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.540
 award them some at the comic con in 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.380
 san diego I believe are awarded 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.160
 and about every comic artist 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.489
 would be happy 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.829
 well we have now I have the first ones 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.989
 I read both volumes now I know 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.100
 not at all if there are more already 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.420
 Every case has a very interesting one 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.690
 history it's a mix of 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.229
 a fantasy scifi story very much 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.140
 epic very romantic, it is the 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.330
 love relationship between two essential 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.370
 show yourself in which one you can 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.720
 the west 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.369
 it's the love story between 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.750
 alana and marco made two of them 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.220
 come from different planets 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.979
 or small planet and one 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.290
 moon i believe since ancient times so 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.170
 whose peoples have been enemies since time immemorial 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.960
 are, so to speak, the forbidden love 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.850
 between the guy with the horns and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.010
 the woman with the wings the two 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.240
 a child illegally testify to it 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.520
 the story begins with the birth 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.799
 of the child and are then on the run 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.040
 in front of all sorts of people like for example 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.840
 robert prince and his his freiland 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.390
 the whole thing is a big one let me tell you 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.330
 Star Sager is heavily inspired by 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.460
 epic stories like star wars 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.009
 but of course it is completely different 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.530
 over because the story is like that 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.189
 crazy and so imaginative but also 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.689
 so exciting 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.150
 she has me from the first to the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.130
 Last page banned car is brian 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.410
 weeks or something like that and 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.090
 by the way, this is also television 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.560
 screenwriter has among others at 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.500
 Devil Hans on the series Lost 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.860
 been recovered worked 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.239
 tomorrow we always want out of Auggen 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.610
 Weeks referred to the whole one 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.640
 Canadian Fiona Staples boy 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.590
 Canadian comic draftsman and she has 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.090
 decided 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.819
 a complete match to the story 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.440
 to choose real character style so that 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.120
 the crazy pictures I have since 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.430
 long have seen in the comic and the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.799
 is what it may be new 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.799
 makes something harder to access 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.670
 because we really have a lot of abstruse 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:52.040
 picture worlds we have beings the tubes 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.150
 have tvs as heads or planets 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.349
 worlds any known physics 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.170
 let forget or miss 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.549
 to let 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.709
 I'll just open a page 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.849
 and there you already see on a six 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:13.489
 Planets , for example, see the 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:15.170
 so prostituted from the 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.829
 wacky sign style on which you look 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.510
 but first you have to get used to it 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.420
 the story is one of 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.790
 at the beginning to pull in the spell and you 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.359
 really builds an emotional relationship 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.160
 to these two main characters on the 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.260
 one accompanies on this flight and that 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.810
 beautiful is the dialogue is really like that 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.060
 written great so both alone as well 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.489
 also marco the two main characters 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.859
 have their own styles, for example 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.359
 how they talk 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.870
 Allana has totally the dirty mouth 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.730
 and it goes in the first scene 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.930
 that is not a spoiler then or where you 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.269
 this is not the first band here 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.109
 in the first scene for example 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.209
 She describes that as the birth 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.040
 Feels like you 're pooping and having 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.139
 to look at fear their own man as 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.030
 she writes here and hopes that he will 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:10.450
 not cool so yes that's exactly 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.450
 my humor 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.970
 it's dirty and it's dirty 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.820
 surreal 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.340
 but one of the most enthralling science 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.020
 I have been writing fiction stories for a long time 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.310
 have read time but it falls to me 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.530
 Something heavy you these sager 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.570
 unreservedly recommend because they 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.180
 really needs a bit of getting used to 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.590
 and you have to be open to social issues 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.020
 sign goals are with you that 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.010
 but if you are open for it 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.470
 then you will love sager as far as mine 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.240
 secret tip sager from the cross cult 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.720
 verlag certainly does not suit everyone 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.070
 I liked it when you say that 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.230
 you 're open for it , look at it 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.660
 sometimes say to give a chance 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.720
 if not, I can understand 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.160
 not bad either i am not angry like that 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.450
 or so you can definitely on 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.450
 press the abo button and the like button 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.490
 because we introduce and we start with 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.580
 minute man who wants me that 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.600
 anticipate was the best 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.110
 minute - the rorschach and now came 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.030
 last year 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.780
 This band rorschach out of the only 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.780
 this character becomes
