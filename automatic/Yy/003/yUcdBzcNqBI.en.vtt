creators of Toy Story thought was kind

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.680 
creators of Toy Story thought was kind
of<00:01:01.620> funny<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.460> Disney<00:01:03.090> would<00:01:03.270> end<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.480> being

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
of funny that Disney would end up being

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.260

the<00:01:03.840> antagonist<00:01:04.649> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.979> first<00:01:05.189> movie<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.240> I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the antagonist of the first movie but I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.120 
the antagonist of the first movie but I
think<00:01:06.719> there's<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.109> more<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
think there's a little bit more to it I

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.940 
think there's a little bit more to it I
think<00:01:08.579> that<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:09.030> might<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.270> some<00:01:09.990> kind<00:01:10.259> of<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
think that there might be some kind of a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010 
think that there might be some kind of a
plot<00:01:11.700> behind<00:01:12.179> why<00:01:12.299> they<00:01:12.479> did<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.749> because

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
plot behind why they did this because

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.959 
plot behind why they did this because
let's<00:01:13.320> take<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> look<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.640> going<00:01:14.670> on

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
feel like they don't care about the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.779 
feel like they don't care about the
people<00:02:01.499> that<00:02:01.709> watch<00:02:01.889> the<00:02:02.069> original<00:02:02.399> films

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
people that watch the original films

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.849 
people that watch the original films
because<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.659> know<00:02:03.749> obviously<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> kids<00:02:04.740> that

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
because you know obviously the kids that

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.499 
because you know obviously the kids that
watched<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.219> new<00:02:05.459> version<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.179> are<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
watched a new version of it are going to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.940 
watched a new version of it are going to
like<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.779> new<00:02:06.899> version<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.829> they've

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
like the new version because they've

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.559 
like the new version because they've
never<00:02:08.069> seen<00:02:08.189> the<00:02:08.580> old<00:02:08.700> version<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.299> they<00:02:09.360> just

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
never seen the old version and they just

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.850 
never seen the old version and they just
you<00:02:09.689> know<00:02:09.810> they<00:02:09.989> never<00:02:10.110> got<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.409> pick<00:02:10.679> which

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
you know they never got to pick which

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know they never got to pick which
one<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.129> better<00:02:11.450> whether<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.599> not<00:02:12.689> that's<00:02:12.870> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
one was better whether or not that's a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.350 
one was better whether or not that's a
thing<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.519> that's<00:02:14.879> not<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.269> what

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
thing that's that's not really what

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.569 
thing that's that's not really what
theory<00:02:15.599> is<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.900> theory<00:02:16.170> says<00:02:16.379> is<00:02:16.680> that

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
theory is but the theory says is that

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.440 
theory is but the theory says is that
Sid<00:02:18.480> from<00:02:18.989> Toy<00:02:19.680> Story<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.250> again<00:02:21.180> because<00:02:21.420> of

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
Sid from Toy Story is again because of

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.119 
Sid from Toy Story is again because of
the<00:02:21.569> anagram<00:02:21.900> because<00:02:22.260> his<00:02:22.439> name<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.829> also

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
the anagram because his name is also

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.780 
the anagram because his name is also
anagram<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.970> Disney<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.540> kind<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.379> like<00:02:25.590> a

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
anagram to Disney is kind of like a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.149 
anagram to Disney is kind of like a
scapegoat<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:27.269> kind<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.599> like<00:02:27.659> a<00:02:27.780> play<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.260> how

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
scapegoat or kind of like a play on how

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.229 
scapegoat or kind of like a play on how
Pixar<00:02:29.790> did<00:02:30.000> not<00:02:30.150> like<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:31.640> vault<00:02:32.640> thing

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
Pixar did not like this a vault thing

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.610 
Pixar did not like this a vault thing
that<00:02:33.450> Disney<00:02:33.870> was<00:02:33.989> starting<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.379> implement

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
that Disney was starting to implement

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.530 
that Disney was starting to implement
around<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.189> time<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:36.060> they<00:02:36.180> kind<00:02:36.359> of<00:02:36.420> made<00:02:36.510> a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
around that time so they kind of made a

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.569 
around that time so they kind of made a
poke<00:02:36.840> at<00:02:37.049> it<00:02:37.200> by<00:02:37.319> saying<00:02:37.620> if<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.159> take<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> look

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
poke at it by saying if you take a look

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.720 
poke at it by saying if you take a look
at<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.239> movie<00:02:39.569> you<00:02:39.720> see<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.109> all<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.859> SIDS
