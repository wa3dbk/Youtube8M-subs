bit just so you know it's legal but I
just<00:00:41.180> thought<00:00:41.330> I'd<00:00:41.390> check<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:41.840> out<00:00:42.080> see<00:00:42.290> it

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
you can see it now you're a bit see it

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.799 
you can see it now you're a bit see it
on<00:00:52.219> on<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:52.969> part<00:00:53.210> here<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.600> other<00:00:53.630> side

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
on on this part here on the other side

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.319 
on on this part here on the other side
is<00:00:54.410> actually<00:00:54.890> says<00:00:55.130> that<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.489> bikes<00:00:55.730> standard

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
is actually says that the bikes standard

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.299 
is actually says that the bikes standard
with<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.540> stock<00:00:56.809> exhaust<00:00:59.829> has<00:01:00.829> been<00:01:01.070> fought

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
with the stock exhaust has been fought

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.540 
with the stock exhaust has been fought
it<00:01:02.210> puts<00:01:02.660> out<00:01:02.750> 93<00:01:03.289> des<00:01:03.469> belles<00:01:03.710> at<00:01:04.039> six

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
it puts out 93 des belles at six

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.210 
it puts out 93 des belles at six
thousand<00:01:05.210> seven<00:01:06.020> hundred<00:01:06.050> rpm<00:01:06.830> I<00:01:06.950> think<00:01:07.130> it

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
thousand seven hundred rpm I think it

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.970 
thousand seven hundred rpm I think it
was

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
was

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.840 
was
so<00:01:08.910> a<00:01:08.940> 67<00:01:09.600> RPM<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.530> puts<00:01:10.800> out<00:01:10.920> 93<00:01:11.400> des<00:01:11.610> belles

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
so a 67 RPM it puts out 93 des belles

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.110 
so a 67 RPM it puts out 93 des belles
with<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> stock<00:01:12.480> system<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.710> i<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:15.000> wanted

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
with the stock system so i just wanted

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.010 
with the stock system so i just wanted
to<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> comparison<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.410> at<00:01:16.650> 67<00:01:17.550> RPM

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
to get a comparison to see at 67 RPM

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.600 
to get a comparison to see at 67 RPM
what<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.260> exhaust<00:01:19.620> makes<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.430> i<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
what this exhaust makes just so i have a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.220 
what this exhaust makes just so i have a
rough<00:01:20.850> idea<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.720> i<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.080> my<00:01:22.110> own

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
rough idea and then i can do my own

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.710 
rough idea and then i can do my own
research<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.980> find<00:01:23.280> out<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.910> Australia<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.690> in

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
research and find out in Australia or in

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.020 
research and find out in Australia or in
queens<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.620> legal<00:01:25.830> limit<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
queens and what the legal limit is and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.090 
queens and what the legal limit is and
find<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.570> exactly<00:01:27.690> how<00:01:28.140> much<00:01:28.170> over<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.800> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
find out exactly how much over it is and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.650 
find out exactly how much over it is and
then<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.400> i<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.670> stage<00:01:29.910> two<00:01:30.120> saw<00:01:30.330> answer

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
then when i get to stage two saw answer

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.900 
then when i get to stage two saw answer
i<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.410> another<00:01:31.590> test<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.700> I'm

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
i can do another test and see if I'm

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.110 
i can do another test and see if I'm
under<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.800> I<00:01:34.830> mean<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.520> right<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.730> at<00:01:36.000> my

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
under so I mean that right there at my

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.590 
under so I mean that right there at my
idol<00:01:36.420> is

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.450 

93<00:01:41.600> 94

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
93 94

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
93 94
23<00:01:44.420> okay

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
23 okay

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.310 
23 okay
I'm<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> press<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> max<00:01:47.759> hole

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 

so<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:52.950> tells<00:01:53.159> me<00:01:53.460> what's<00:01:53.640> allowed<00:01:53.909> us

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
so that just tells me what's allowed us

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.450 
so that just tells me what's allowed us
is<00:01:54.150> going<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> I'm<00:01:56.310> going

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
the in the exhaust fans see what see if

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.920 
the in the exhaust fans see what see if
it<00:02:33.730> gets<00:02:33.850> any<00:02:33.910> higher<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:34.360> actually<00:02:34.750> i'll

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it gets any higher then actually i'll

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.500 
it gets any higher then actually i'll
release<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.320> max<00:02:35.530> hold<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:37.060> then<00:02:37.120> press<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
release the max hold and then press it

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.800 
release the max hold and then press it
again<00:02:37.860> there<00:02:38.860> we<00:02:38.950> go<00:02:39.240> let's<00:02:40.240> take<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.600> six

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
again there we go let's take it to six

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:51.630 
again there we go let's take it to six
seven<00:02:41.110> again

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.430 

so<00:02:52.640> even<00:02:52.880> out<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.120> PM's<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.690> still<00:02:54.290> about

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
so even out of the PM's it's still about

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.160 
so even out of the PM's it's still about
the<00:02:54.500> same<00:02:54.590> noise<00:02:56.500> 117<00:02:57.500> well<00:02:57.739> okay<00:02:58.220> that's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
the same noise 117 well okay that's

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.260 
the same noise 117 well okay that's
surprising

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.630 

from<00:03:05.020> get<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.260> spot<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.890> enemy<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> street

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.670 
from get a spot the enemy to the street
I<00:03:06.670> think<00:03:06.940> I<00:03:07.090> mean<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.660> cop<00:03:07.900> even<00:03:08.320> though<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.440> don't

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
I think I mean a cop even though I don't

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.450 
I think I mean a cop even though I don't
agree<00:03:08.800> with

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.250 

being<00:03:13.090> fine<00:03:13.390> when<00:03:13.720> he<00:03:13.780> didn't<00:03:14.020> that<00:03:14.110> he

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
being fine when he didn't that he

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.420 
being fine when he didn't that he
