00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
inside and through the spacer you want

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910 
inside and through the spacer you want
to<00:01:44.790> push<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.180> against<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.630> rim<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.620> inner

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
to push it against the rim of the inner

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.680 
to push it against the rim of the inner
bearing<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.940> I'm<00:01:48.150> gonna<00:01:48.299> go<00:01:48.360> ahead<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.540> do

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
bearing so I'm gonna go ahead and do

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.500 
bearing so I'm gonna go ahead and do
that<00:01:48.720> right<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:50.790> once<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.299> you

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
that right now then once you do that you

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.000 
that right now then once you do that you
put<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> little<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.290> pressure<00:01:52.530> not<00:01:52.770> too

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
put a little bit of pressure not too

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.130 
put a little bit of pressure not too
much<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.490> then<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.780> there's<00:01:54.990> any

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
much and then if it's and if there's any

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.539 
much and then if it's and if there's any
resistance<00:01:55.440> you<00:01:55.740> want<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.190> ahead<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
resistance you want just go ahead and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.149 
resistance you want just go ahead and
put<00:01:57.450> some<00:01:57.479> even<00:01:57.869> pressure<00:01:58.080> around<00:01:58.440> all<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
put some even pressure around all of the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
put some even pressure around all of the
bearing<00:01:59.460> mines<00:02:00.180> seems<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.630> coming<00:02:00.930> out

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
bearing mines seems to be coming out

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.789 
bearing mines seems to be coming out
just<00:02:01.320> fine<00:02:01.470> anyway<00:02:02.600> enough<00:02:03.600> goes<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:04.080> now

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
just fine anyway enough goes out now

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.440 
just fine anyway enough goes out now
that<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.159> our<00:02:05.250> bearings<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:06.180> next

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that we have our bearings out the next

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.969 
that we have our bearings out the next
step<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.900> go<00:02:07.049> ahead<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.380> grab<00:02:07.530> our<00:02:07.650> turbo

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
step is to go ahead and grab our turbo

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
step is to go ahead and grab our turbo
wash<00:02:08.159> I<00:02:08.459> personally<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.390> turbo<00:02:09.689> wash<00:02:09.899> over

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
wash I personally like turbo wash over

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
wash I personally like turbo wash over
any<00:02:10.500> other<00:02:10.649> method<00:02:11.280> because<00:02:11.909> it's<00:02:12.090> real

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
any other method because it's real

convenient easy to use they have a
little<00:02:13.950> plastic<00:02:14.400> slide<00:02:14.700> where<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.480> go

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
little plastic slide where you just go

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.270 
little plastic slide where you just go
ahead<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.810> drop<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.110> Bears<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.830> this

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
ahead and drop the Bears in and this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.890 
ahead and drop the Bears in and this
allows<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:17.939> filter<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> dirt<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
allows it to filter all the dirt and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.199 
allows it to filter all the dirt and
it's<00:02:19.230> easy<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.530> shake<00:02:19.830> up<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.220> kind<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:20.970> move

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
it's easy to shake up and kind of move

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.059 
it's easy to shake up and kind of move
and<00:02:21.480> disturb<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.230> particles<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.770> might<00:02:22.890> be

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
and disturb the particles that might be

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.080 
and disturb the particles that might be
lodged<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:23.700> bearings

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
lodged in your bearings

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.120 
lodged in your bearings
so<00:02:24.569> you're<00:02:24.720> gonna<00:02:24.840> go<00:02:25.020> ahead<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.349> open<00:02:25.830> this

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130

of remove any excess moisture and a lot
of<00:03:16.049> dirt<00:03:16.349> that's<00:03:16.590> still<00:03:16.799> loose<00:03:17.040> will<00:03:17.250> kind<00:03:17.459> of

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
of dirt that's still loose will kind of

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.229 
of dirt that's still loose will kind of
come<00:03:17.670> out<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.940> way

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239

let's go ahead and hit both sides gently
against<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.549> paper<00:03:20.640> towel<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.180> then<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.840> want

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
against a paper towel and then you want

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.930 
against a paper towel and then you want
to<00:03:22.140> let<00:03:22.260> them<00:03:22.380> dry<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:22.709> I'd<00:03:23.280> say<00:03:23.519> about<00:03:23.640> an

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
to let them dry for I'd say about an

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.729 
to let them dry for I'd say about an
hour<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.870> let's<00:03:25.019> come<00:03:25.170> back<00:03:25.319> in<00:03:25.440> an<00:03:25.530> hour<00:03:25.620> and

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
hour so let's come back in an hour and

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.350 
hour so let's come back in an hour and
check<00:03:25.950> out<00:03:26.069> how<00:03:26.190> these<00:03:26.370> are<00:03:26.519> doing<00:03:26.730> once<00:03:27.239> your

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
check out how these are doing once your

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.390 
check out how these are doing once your
bearings<00:03:27.690> have<00:03:28.079> finished<00:03:28.440> drying<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.280> want

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
bearings have finished drying you want

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.740 
bearings have finished drying you want
to<00:03:29.459> go<00:03:29.519> ahead<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.790> grab<00:03:29.940> your<00:03:30.090> Lube<00:03:30.299> in<00:03:30.600> this

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
to go ahead and grab your Lube in this

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.050 
to go ahead and grab your Lube in this
case<00:03:30.959> I'm<00:03:31.170> gonna<00:03:31.260> use<00:03:31.410> bone<00:03:31.739> speed<00:03:32.130> cream<00:03:32.400> and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
case I'm gonna use bone speed cream and

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.090 
case I'm gonna use bone speed cream and
you<00:03:33.660> really<00:03:33.930> don't<00:03:34.079> need<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.260> put<00:03:34.470> too<00:03:34.680> much<00:03:34.709> on

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
you really don't need to put too much on

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.259 
you really don't need to put too much on
it<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.489> just<00:03:35.640> go<00:03:35.790> ahead<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.060> grab<00:03:36.239> your

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
it so you just go ahead and grab your

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.300 
it so you just go ahead and grab your
bearing<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:37.380> should<00:03:37.530> be<00:03:37.620> nice<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.010> dry<00:03:38.130> by<00:03:38.280> now

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
bearing it should be nice and dry by now

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.580 
bearing it should be nice and dry by now
you<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:38.940> place<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.209> little<00:03:39.540> bit<00:03:39.750> around<00:03:40.019> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you just place a little bit around the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.860 
you just place a little bit around the
edge<00:03:41.040> gotta<00:03:41.310> go<00:03:41.489> from<00:03:41.760> let's<00:03:42.299> say<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.450> twelve

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
edge gotta go from let's say the twelve

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.210 
edge gotta go from let's say the twelve
o'clock<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.350> bearing<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:43.920> six

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
o'clock of the bearing to the six

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.860 
o'clock of the bearing to the six
o'clock<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:45.120> that's<00:03:45.299> pretty<00:03:45.480> much<00:03:45.600> all<00:03:45.840> you

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
o'clock and that's pretty much all you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.410 
o'clock and that's pretty much all you
need<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.140> do<00:03:46.319> then<00:03:47.010> once<00:03:47.489> that's<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.209> want

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
need to do then once that's in you want

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.289 
need to do then once that's in you want
to<00:03:48.480> kind<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.780> let<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.290> sit<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:50.340> then<00:03:50.880> just<00:03:51.060> spin

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
to kind of let it sit and then just spin

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.729 
to kind of let it sit and then just spin
it<00:03:51.420> around<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:51.959> applies<00:03:52.260> evenly

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
it around so it applies evenly

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.620 
it around so it applies evenly
throughout<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.100> bearing<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:54.269> then<00:03:54.329> once<00:03:54.510> you

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
throughout the bearing and then once you

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.970 
throughout the bearing and then once you
do<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.079> one<00:03:55.350> go<00:03:55.470> ahead<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.680> repeat

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
do that to that one go ahead and repeat

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.280 
do that to that one go ahead and repeat
to<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.220> next<00:03:56.459> one<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:57.569> continue<00:03:58.200> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
to the next one and just continue the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.110 
to the next one and just continue the
same<00:03:58.440> process<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:59.370> remember<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.850> don't<00:03:59.940> want

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
same process and remember you don't want

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.050 
same process and remember you don't want
to<00:04:00.180> use<00:04:00.269> too<00:04:00.450> much<00:04:00.810> too<00:04:01.380> much<00:04:01.500> Lube<00:04:01.850> it's<00:04:02.850> not

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
to use too much too much Lube it's not

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.550 
to use too much too much Lube it's not
necessary<00:04:03.630> once<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.079> got<00:04:04.230> your<00:04:04.350> bearings

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
necessary once you got your bearings

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.289 
necessary once you got your bearings
lubed<00:04:05.040> up<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.549> want<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.760> go<00:04:05.850> ahead<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.030> grab

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
lubed up you want to go ahead and grab

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.840 
lubed up you want to go ahead and grab
your<00:04:06.450> wheels<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.989> go<00:04:07.260> ahead<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.500> place<00:04:07.739> your

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
your wheels and go ahead and place your

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.940 
your wheels and go ahead and place your
bearings<00:04:08.850> into<00:04:09.090> your<00:04:09.510> wheels<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.019> it

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
bearings into your wheels and it

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.340 
bearings into your wheels and it
shouldn't<00:04:11.250> be<00:04:11.340> too<00:04:11.639> much<00:04:12.060> force<00:04:12.690> required<00:04:13.230> to

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
shouldn't be too much force required to

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.830 
shouldn't be too much force required to
put<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.739> bearings<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.190> but<00:04:14.579> if<00:04:14.700> there<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:15.030> some

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
put the bearings in but if there is some

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.270 
put the bearings in but if there is some
resistance<00:04:16.139> you<00:04:16.440> can<00:04:16.470> go<00:04:16.709> ahead<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.859> kind<00:04:17.190> of

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
resistance you can go ahead and kind of

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.500 
resistance you can go ahead and kind of
push<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.669> against<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:17.970> table<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.329> that

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
push it against the table and that

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.810 
push it against the table and that
should<00:04:18.720> do<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.930> trick<00:04:19.320> then<00:04:20.160> for<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.579> oh<00:04:20.609> geez

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
should do the trick then for you oh geez

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.250 
should do the trick then for you oh geez
make<00:04:21.060> sure<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.359> use<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.660> right<00:04:21.690> spacer

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
make sure you use the right spacer

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.620 
make sure you use the right spacer
you'll<00:04:22.740> geez<00:04:22.950> take<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.370> very<00:04:23.639> small<00:04:24.210> thin

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
you'll geez take this very small thin

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.870 
you'll geez take this very small thin
spacer<00:04:25.260> so<00:04:25.889> go<00:04:25.979> ahead<00:04:26.039> and<00:04:26.220> place<00:04:26.370> that<00:04:26.400> and

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
spacer so go ahead and place that and

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.850 
spacer so go ahead and place that and
you<00:04:26.970> can't<00:04:27.240> forget<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:27.750> that's<00:04:27.870> no<00:04:28.470> good<00:04:28.740> if

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
you can't forget that that's no good if

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.469 
you can't forget that that's no good if
you<00:04:29.010> have<00:04:29.250> your<00:04:29.520> wheels<00:04:29.700> with<00:04:29.970> those<00:04:30.090> spacers

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
you have your wheels with those spacers

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.300 
you have your wheels with those spacers
so<00:04:30.660> put<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.380> spacer<00:04:31.770> in<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:31.979> middle<00:04:32.159> of<00:04:32.250> the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
so put the spacer in the middle of the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.339 
so put the spacer in the middle of the
wheel<00:04:32.760> and<00:04:33.240> place<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.630> second<00:04:33.960> bearing<00:04:34.200> on

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
wheel and place the second bearing on
