00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
on with me a large meal and overeating
and<00:00:48.149> today<00:00:48.809> I'm<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> talk<00:00:49.230> about<00:00:49.410> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and today I'm going to talk about that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
and today I'm going to talk about that
four<00:00:49.890> principles<00:00:50.430> behind<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.120> reason<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
four principles behind you reason and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.869 
four principles behind you reason and
why<00:00:52.350> should<00:00:52.739> they<00:00:52.920> actually<00:00:53.250> work<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.730> why

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
why should they actually work and why

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
why should they actually work and why
should<00:00:54.149> they<00:00:54.300> actually<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.500> obviously

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
should they actually do and obviously

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
should they actually do and obviously
I've<00:00:56.250> only<00:00:56.460> been<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.879> dying<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.300> six<00:00:57.570> days

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I've only been just dying for six days

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.630 
I've only been just dying for six days
so<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.949> bear<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.160> me<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.579> my

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so you have to bear with me and my

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
so you have to bear with me and my
actual<00:00:59.969> findings<00:01:00.210> which<00:01:00.570> obviously<00:01:00.809> I'll

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
actual findings which obviously I'll

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.830 
actual findings which obviously I'll
publicize<00:01:01.980> once<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.370> finished<00:01:02.600> I'm<00:01:03.600> whether

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
publicize once I'm finished I'm whether

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.170 
publicize once I'm finished I'm whether
I<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.199> works<00:01:04.379> or<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> give

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
I think it works or not but just to give

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.609 
I think it works or not but just to give
you<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.570> background<00:01:06.990> basis<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:09.470> what<00:01:10.470> should

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you a background basis and what should

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.810 
you a background basis and what should
be<00:01:10.710> involved<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> ovary<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
be involved in the ovary in the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.109 
be involved in the ovary in the
principles<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.689> yeah<00:01:12.840> why<00:01:13.049> should<00:01:13.080> work<00:01:14.119> okay

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
principles and yeah why should work okay

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.820 
principles and yeah why should work okay
so<00:01:15.180> three<00:01:15.869> main<00:01:16.140> principles<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:18.619> with<00:01:19.619> your

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so three main principles and with your

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550 
so three main principles and with your
eating<00:01:20.130> face<00:01:20.630> first<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.900> want<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
eating face first of all you want to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
eating face first of all you want to
start<00:01:22.950> off<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> less<00:01:23.759> aggressive<00:01:24.299> tastes

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
start off for the less aggressive tastes

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.170 
start off for the less aggressive tastes
and<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.890> muscle<00:01:26.189> bland<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.850> suppose<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and the muscle bland and I suppose you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.380 
and the muscle bland and I suppose you
can<00:01:27.270> call<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.630> foods<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.030> basically<00:01:30.030> work

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
can call it foods and basically work

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.950 
can call it foods and basically work
towards<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.770> flavorsome<00:01:32.310> foods<00:01:32.960> and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
towards the more flavorsome foods and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
towards the more flavorsome foods and
this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> general<00:01:34.950> rule<00:01:35.070> because

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
this is just a general rule because

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.069 
this is just a general rule because
generally<00:01:35.790> there's<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.030> bland<00:01:36.299> foods<00:01:36.659> tend<00:01:36.930> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
generally there's up bland foods tend to

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.569 
generally there's up bland foods tend to
have<00:01:37.170> more<00:01:37.350> enzymes<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> prepare<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.520> you

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
have more enzymes in to prepare for you

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.030 
have more enzymes in to prepare for you
so<00:01:39.060> basically<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.509> best<00:01:39.720> thing<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.079> when<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
so basically the best thing is when you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.460 
so basically the best thing is when you
start<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.460> meal<00:01:41.610> start<00:01:42.119> off<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.659> leafy

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
start your meal start off with leafy

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.880 
start your meal start off with leafy
vegetables<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.640> raw<00:01:45.479> food<00:01:45.810> even<00:01:46.649> maybe

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
vegetables and raw food even maybe

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
vegetables and raw food even maybe
Justin<00:01:47.220> raw<00:01:47.399> veggie<00:01:47.640> juice<00:01:47.909> drink<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.570> that

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
Justin raw veggie juice drink do that

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.749 
Justin raw veggie juice drink do that
first<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.979> when<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.490> goes<00:01:50.610> in

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
first of all because when that goes in

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.160 
first of all because when that goes in
the<00:01:50.790> body<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.240> prepares<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> body<00:01:51.780> you've

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the body that prepares the body you've

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
the body that prepares the body you've
got<00:01:52.320> enzymes<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> ready<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.399> well<00:01:53.610> when

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
got enzymes at the ready as well when

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.319

that's am I Stephanie that's definitely
improved<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.430> also<00:03:50.430> another<00:03:51.299> principle<00:03:51.810> you

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
improved and also another principle you

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.780 
improved and also another principle you
know<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.170> isn't<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:53.340> know<00:03:53.400> there's<00:03:53.610> some

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
know this isn't you know there's some

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.160 
know this isn't you know there's some
science<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.180> support<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.750> some<00:03:54.900> isn't

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
science to support this and some isn't

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.699 
science to support this and some isn't
this<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.440> going<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.650> go<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> lot<00:03:56.040> against<00:03:56.489> and

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
this is going to go a lot against and

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.440 
this is going to go a lot against and
you<00:03:58.709> know<00:03:58.799> principles<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.880> the<00:03:59.910> mainstream

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
you know principles and the mainstream

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.620 
you know principles and the mainstream
but<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.320> main<00:04:01.470> thing<00:04:01.500> with<00:04:01.890> this<00:04:02.130> when<00:04:02.340> you

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
but the main thing with this when you

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.850 
but the main thing with this when you
when<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.660> when<00:04:03.780> you're<00:04:04.080> actually<00:04:04.170> fast<00:04:04.590> like

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
when you when you're actually fast like

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.509 
when you when you're actually fast like
this<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:07.019> know<00:04:07.170> then<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:08.010> overeat<00:04:08.489> and

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
this and you know then you overeat and

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.160 
this and you know then you overeat and
your<00:04:08.700> body<00:04:08.790> gets<00:04:09.090> used<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.420> this<00:04:09.540> continually

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
your body gets used to this continually

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.509 
your body gets used to this continually
based<00:04:10.890> on<00:04:11.040> weapons<00:04:11.400> then<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:13.400> nutrients<00:04:14.400> are

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
based on weapons then is nutrients are

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.380 
based on weapons then is nutrients are
actually<00:04:14.730> really<00:04:14.850> once<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.180> know<00:04:15.360> your

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
actually really once you know your

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.300 
actually really once you know your
body's<00:04:15.750> waiting<00:04:16.169> for<00:04:16.350> this<00:04:16.470> large<00:04:16.769> will<00:04:17.100> come

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
body's waiting for this large will come

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.099 
body's waiting for this large will come
in<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.609> no<00:04:17.760> that's<00:04:17.970> coming<00:04:18.299> then<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:18.989> eat

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
in and no that's coming then you eat

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.449 
in and no that's coming then you eat
this<00:04:19.260> meal<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.859> know<00:04:19.950> especially<00:04:20.100> just

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.309 
know we'll see we'll see we'll see how
it<00:05:12.139> goes<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:13.550> then<00:05:13.699> you<00:05:14.210> know<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.389> last<00:05:14.599> last

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
it goes and then you know the last last

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.249 
it goes and then you know the last last
glass<00:05:15.740> off<00:05:16.210> theory<00:05:17.210> as<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.360> why<00:05:17.539> this<00:05:17.690> diet<00:05:18.080> so

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
glass off theory as to why this diet so

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.309 
glass off theory as to why this diet so
good<00:05:18.530> it's<00:05:19.190> also<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:20.479> know<00:05:20.630> principle

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
good it's also you you know principle

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.469 
good it's also you you know principle
being<00:05:21.530> you<00:05:21.949> know<00:05:22.069> just<00:05:22.340> like<00:05:22.520> when<00:05:23.240> you<00:05:23.270> do<00:05:23.449> a

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
being you know just like when you do a

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.740 
being you know just like when you do a
short<00:05:23.900> intense<00:05:24.409> session<00:05:24.949> you<00:05:25.699> know<00:05:25.879> that<00:05:26.599> has

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
short intense session you know that has

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.089 
short intense session you know that has
the<00:05:26.870> equivalent<00:05:27.110> of<00:05:27.319> doing<00:05:27.530> lots<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:27.860> long

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
the equivalent of doing lots of long

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.240 
the equivalent of doing lots of long
sessions<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:29.449> same<00:05:29.690> same<00:05:30.050> thing<00:05:30.380> with<00:05:31.159> this

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
sessions the same same thing with this

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.820 
sessions the same same thing with this
eat<00:05:31.460> in<00:05:31.639> principle<00:05:32.449> that<00:05:32.599> you<00:05:33.259> ever<00:05:33.409> worn<00:05:33.650> me

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
eat in principle that you ever worn me

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.820 
eat in principle that you ever worn me
on<00:05:33.949> say<00:05:34.190> this<00:05:34.340> meals<00:05:34.699> 3,000<00:05:35.389> calories<00:05:35.830> your

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
on say this meals 3,000 calories your

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.870 
on say this meals 3,000 calories your
metabolism<00:05:37.580> then<00:05:37.759> is<00:05:38.599> based<00:05:38.930> in<00:05:39.080> itself<00:05:39.380> on

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880
