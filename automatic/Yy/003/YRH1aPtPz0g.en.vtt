going<00:02:24.070> getting<00:02:24.489> pretty<00:02:24.700> well<00:02:24.880> recently<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:26.880> few

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
going getting pretty well recently a few

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.580 
going getting pretty well recently a few
good<00:02:28.060> ones<00:02:28.239> but<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:29.020> know<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.260> think<00:02:29.470> we're

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
good ones but you know I think we're

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.440 
good ones but you know I think we're
hitting<00:02:29.650> our<00:02:29.830> stride<00:02:29.890> as<00:02:30.280> well<00:02:30.430> now<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:30.880> it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
hitting our stride as well now so it

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.510 
hitting our stride as well now so it
should<00:02:31.600> be<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.780> good<00:02:31.930> spectacle<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.680> if<00:02:33.400> we're

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
should be a good spectacle and if we're

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.680 
should be a good spectacle and if we're
playing<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:33.970> we<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.209> been<00:02:34.330> playing<00:02:34.420> last

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690

couple<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:34.989> weeks<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.320> think<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:35.650> should<00:02:35.800> go

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
couple of weeks I think we should go

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.600 
couple of weeks I think we should go
pull<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.489> through

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.700
