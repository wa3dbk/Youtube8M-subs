00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.200
 Now I last time I've been doing up to Toko that the birth of life that has been shrouded in mystery this time the first 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:14.900
 Let's start with the story of life born in 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.880
 Well , as I saw last time , the first living thing is around this hydrothermal vent. 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.970
 Nikki been told or not it has occurred 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:25.130
 The image of the first creature is like this grain 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:29.029
 The first living thing is how it survived, and it was dissolved on top of that time 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.220
 But I say'm living conditions by changing the things that were taken in energy 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.399
 High 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:38.100
 The first creatures in the world went to the same material backer energy in the ocean 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.490
 As the matter gets less and less 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.450
 so 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.540
 The first creatures are in a food crisis 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:51.210
 Just around the same time 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.410
 A creature that produces energy using a completely new method is a mutation 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.450
 I was born 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.100
 That's 2.7 billion years ago 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.129
 In such a way , a large amount of it was generated in the sea 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.090
 Say to the wind that cyanobacteria the name 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:11.600
 What is the energy source of this organism ? 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 It was power saving carbon monoxide and water 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:21.540
 Use the things of this I cyanobacteria I was O'produced the energy 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.540
 I was trying to exhaust what is actually at the same time finding the energy 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.909
 I think what 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.680
 It seems to use sunlight, carbon dioxide and water 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.280
 Early 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.110
 There is no origin 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:43.100
 It has to Fu Tteyuu photosynthesis of love 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:45.810
 In this work, when a large amount of cyanobacteria came in, a large amount of oxygen was released. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.790
 And say what happened by it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:56.880
 In fact, a large amount of iron metal fence in the sea at that time 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.890
 It takes a giraffe and it becomes rusty iron by reacting with oxygen. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.610
 I was sinking more and more 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.800
 And this kind of feeling that made the layer 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:12.730
 It's very large, so this is actually 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:15.010
 Most of the iron of the raw materials else taking become the raw material of the current iron to say position can take from so is 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:23.349
 I wish it was taken from here 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:25.590
 In oxygen when the reaction comes gradually settled down with the iron of it in the sea after that from here in the air 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:31.230
 Me so overflowing 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:37.819
 If this is but the amount of oxygen in the air'm a not went more and more in the favor 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:42.590
 It is actually said that the evolution of a living thing like now did not occur if it were not 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:48.410
 It seems to have evolved from the recent time I had never been without Mochisansu 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:54.530
 It is this cyano bacteriochrome- like for many current living things, but in fact this is this 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:56.900
 We do share in the back and still inhabit the sea ​​or river various places I further school 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.580
 Most of the aquariums 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.970
 More specifically, if it is used as a rice ball or something, let's take a look at the raw material 8-5 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:10.310
 I will come and get in. 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:16.640
 In this way cyanobacteria are very close and appreciated, though 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:22.440
 However, for the living thing of that time, actually this oxygen was a poisonous thing 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:25.440
 So that caused many creatures to go extinct 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.370
 Meanwhile, another mutation has occurred 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.160
 What 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.860
 About 2 billion years ago 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:39.350
 A living organism that breathes using oxygen was born 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.450
 So you get 10 times more energy than you would otherwise get 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.370
 The result is 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:53.360
 Very active organisms proliferated in full bloom 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.880
 Even those who turn into energy by eating other living things in such active living things 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.970
 Born basis 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:03.190
 There is no beginning of the relationship that this is eaten 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:09.270
 When I said what happened to the creatures I had at that time, it did not mean that everything was extinct. 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:13.340
 First of all, I escaped to an environment with less oxygen to flow from toxic oxygen. 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:19.549
 In order to further oppose meat eating organisms 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:27.319
 I want to get a big body by uniting with other friends like this 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:31.080
 Then this small creatures after their each other to the benefit enters in a large organism's body 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.930
 It was Itarugai who became a relationship 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:40.760
 Like this 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:48.020
 The smaller ones are excreted, nourished and large in the larger stable environment 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:52.800
 If a small time was correct to try to burn utilizing's the energy produced by oxygen organisms 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.969
 It is because I want a cell to live in a world rich in oxygen 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:01.259
 It has become 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:05:08.219
 How then eat and how and relationships to be eaten eat the creatures come more intense 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:09.830
 And such as government by the competition that or not eaten evolution is willing to go was the best in elsewhere 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:13.409
 The strategy is 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:18.100
 It was to come together in a team like this 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:21.160
 So those who got together became one creature 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:27.790
 I say this in the style of cell life 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:32.880
 In many of the cells that stick of one one of the telco to tsunami we're in Fu say cell 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:38.550
 I say to the wind Tteyuu multi-cellular organism to say that the possible biological 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:46.020
 Most of the living things including tax cuts are not this multicellular organism 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:50.409
 By the way, all organisms until the birth of multicellular organisms are said to be single cell organisms 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:57.960
 An organism made of one cell 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:06:03.360
 What was originally a single cell turned into a saigo creature like this 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:08.910
 By the way, when it is a single cell organism, it takes in nutrients and moves the body 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:13.530
 I Ja Yo all in one of the last of me or making a later child was hired became multi-cellular organisms 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:17.630
 Want this one start human one cell is the division of roles by 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:22.850
 First placed in two types of cells in multicellular organisms 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:26.230
 What one other one what it is called the germ cells called somatic cells 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:30.280
 First sake cell-free and say something 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:33.550
 Salmon Tteyuu make the children I role reproductive to make children 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.190
 The role of making a child became germ cell cancer 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:40.570
 It to the body cells 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.529
 All other roles All except the role of making children 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.849
 The somatic cell has become 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:52.510
 If you say this, you may feel that the somatic cells are not so hard 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:59.320
 Is not that what makes a child and I mean very or Tsu just for after all organisms 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:07:00.620
 It is possible that the somatic cell evolves more complicated by leaving it all to the germ cell 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.729
 It was done 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:09.700
 That is to say a multi-cellular organism by this division of roles is 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:13.110
 It does not necessarily say that began to evolve into more complex organisms 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.110
 Up to this point this time by say
