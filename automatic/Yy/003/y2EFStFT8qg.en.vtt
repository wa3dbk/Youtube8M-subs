00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
which I thought was pretty cool so you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
which I thought was pretty cool so you
checked<00:01:58.920> out<00:01:59.070> there<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.640> i<00:01:59.700> also<00:01:59.729> i'm

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
checked out there and then i also i'm

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.149 
checked out there and then i also i'm
starting<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.899> use<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.320> more<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
starting to use it more as a way to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.100 
starting to use it more as a way to
interact<00:02:02.640> with<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.030> guys<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.930> more

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
interact with you guys in a more

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.690 
interact with you guys in a more
conversational<00:02:04.890> manner<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.219> it's<00:02:05.340> more<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
conversational manner so it's more of a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.520 
conversational manner so it's more of a
back-and-forth<00:02:06.030> rather<00:02:06.509> than<00:02:06.689> youtube<00:02:07.409> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
back-and-forth rather than youtube is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.249 
back-and-forth rather than youtube is
much<00:02:07.680> more<00:02:08.090> often<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> one-way<00:02:09.899> kind<00:02:10.170> of

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
much more often like a one-way kind of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.800 
much more often like a one-way kind of
thing

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810
