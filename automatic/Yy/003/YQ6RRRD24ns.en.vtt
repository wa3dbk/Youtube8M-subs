so place it down on any surface I'm

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.380 
so place it down on any surface I'm
using<00:00:42.660> my<00:00:42.960> carpet<00:00:43.440> today<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.789> too<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.300> if

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
using my carpet today you can too or if

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
using my carpet today you can too or if
you<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> cutting<00:00:45.989> table<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.410> works<00:00:46.590> but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you have a cutting table that works but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.670 
you have a cutting table that works but
again<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> no<00:00:48.420> sew<00:00:48.660> project<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.530> it's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
again this is a no sew project so it's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.240 
again this is a no sew project so it's
fun<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:50.879> home<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.750> floor

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
fun to just do it at home on the floor

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
fun to just do it at home on the floor
so<00:00:53.250> once<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> fabric<00:00:54.719> unfold

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
so once you have the fabric unfold

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990 
so once you have the fabric unfold
you're<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> see<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.039> there's<00:00:56.280> no<00:00:56.640> seam

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you're going to see that there's no seam

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.660 
you're going to see that there's no seam
here<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.109> where<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> fold<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.829> this

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
here and this is where the fold is this

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.080 
here and this is where the fold is this
is<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> raw<00:01:00.149> edge<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> raw<00:01:01.289> edge

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
is a raw edge and this is a raw edge

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.979 
is a raw edge and this is a raw edge
