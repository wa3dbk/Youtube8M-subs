integral part of anything that has to do
with<00:01:48.799> prototyping<00:01:49.400> we<00:01:49.670> usually<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.149> some

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
with prototyping we usually have some

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.789 
with prototyping we usually have some
kind<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.780> new<00:01:50.960> thing<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:51.320> you're<00:01:51.470> working<00:01:51.500> on

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
kind of new thing that you're working on

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:52.870 
kind of new thing that you're working on
and<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:51.979> got<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.220> figure<00:01:52.340> out<00:01:52.549> somebody<00:01:52.820> to

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
and you got to figure out somebody to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.180 
and you got to figure out somebody to
hang<00:01:53.000> on<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:55.000> this<00:01:56.000> is<00:01:56.830> this<00:01:57.830> is<00:01:57.890> the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
hang on to it so this is this is the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.690 
hang on to it so this is this is the
original<00:01:58.780> prototype<00:01:59.780> of<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.890> spindle<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.610> as

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
original prototype of the spindle and as

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.670 
original prototype of the spindle and as
you<00:02:01.820> see<00:02:01.970> it's<00:02:02.119> welded<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:03.170> but<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.470> point

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
you see it's welded the but the point

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.139 
you see it's welded the but the point
about<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.009> fixturing<00:02:04.369> is<00:02:04.580> that<00:02:04.729> this<00:02:04.880> flange

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
about the fixturing is that this flange

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.760 
about the fixturing is that this flange
was<00:02:05.330> separate<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:05.840> in<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> video<00:02:06.439> you'll<00:02:06.680> see

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
was separate and in the video you'll see

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.229 
was separate and in the video you'll see
that<00:02:06.979> they're<00:02:07.130> pretty<00:02:07.369> easy<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.939> take<00:02:08.060> this

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
that they're pretty easy to take this

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.080 
that they're pretty easy to take this
flange<00:02:08.569> without<00:02:08.959> this<00:02:09.229> piece<00:02:09.709> on<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.550> just

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
flange without this piece on it and just

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.020 
flange without this piece on it and just
bolt<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.599> your<00:02:11.720> table<00:02:12.459> profile<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.489> spindle

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
bolt it to your table profile a spindle

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.630 
bolt it to your table profile a spindle
it's<00:02:14.450> all<00:02:14.600> one<00:02:14.780> piece<00:02:15.140> brought<00:02:16.130> over<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.459> guy

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
it's all one piece brought over this guy

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.170 
it's all one piece brought over this guy
is<00:02:16.700> alright<00:02:17.690> how<00:02:17.870> do<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.790> fixture<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:19.940> thing

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
is alright how do you fixture this thing

- Joe these holes in the front you have
a<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> horizontal<00:02:24.670> attachment<00:02:25.670> for<00:02:25.880> a

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
a I have a horizontal attachment for a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.170 
a I have a horizontal attachment for a
spindle<00:02:26.720> from<00:02:26.900> my<00:02:27.019> mill<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.549> it's<00:02:28.549> it<00:02:28.850> that

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
spindle from my mill but it's it that

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.789 
spindle from my mill but it's it that
this<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> mill<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.319> thing<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.590> so

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
this is in the mill and the thing is so

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.340 
this is in the mill and the thing is so
long<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.370> horizontal<00:02:32.120> boring<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.989> back<00:02:33.200> this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
long the horizontal boring is back this

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.530 
long the horizontal boring is back this
way<00:02:33.530> can't<00:02:33.799> reach<00:02:33.980> itself<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.610> need<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.390> live

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
way can't reach itself I need to live

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.759 
way can't reach itself I need to live
with<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.750> one<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.019> quite<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.260> while<00:02:36.440> trying

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
with this one for quite a while trying

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.039 
with this one for quite a while trying
to<00:02:36.830> figure<00:02:37.040> out<00:02:37.069> how<00:02:37.250> again<00:02:37.519> do<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:38.060> need<00:02:38.870> to

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
to figure out how again do it I need to

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.390 
to figure out how again do it I need to
hold<00:02:39.140> this<00:02:39.290> like<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.860> reasonably<00:02:40.220> held

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
hold this like this and reasonably held

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.000 
hold this like this and reasonably held
on<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.580> mill<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:41.000> needs<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.269> be<00:02:41.360> perpendicular

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
on the mill it needs to be perpendicular

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.759 
on the mill it needs to be perpendicular
yes<00:02:43.569> but<00:02:44.569> it's<00:02:44.690> got<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.870> be<00:02:44.900> held<00:02:45.110> solid<00:02:45.620> it's

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
yes but it's got to be held solid it's

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.250 
yes but it's got to be held solid it's
got<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.980> be<00:02:46.070> held<00:02:46.250> true<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.180> after<00:02:48.109> thinking

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
got to be held true so after thinking

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.509 
got to be held true so after thinking
about<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.590> for<00:02:48.709> quite<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.010> while<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.280> come<00:02:49.400> up

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
about it for quite a while to come up

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.009 
about it for quite a while to come up
with<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:49.730> idea<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.120> putting<00:02:50.269> it<00:02:50.540> sitting

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
with the idea of just putting it sitting

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.380 
with the idea of just putting it sitting
on<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.500> today<00:02:51.799> these<00:02:52.340> pieces<00:02:52.670> right<00:02:52.910> here<00:02:52.970> are

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
on to today these pieces right here are

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.340 
on to today these pieces right here are
actually<00:02:54.250> material<00:02:55.250> for<00:02:55.600> spindle<00:02:56.600> this<00:02:57.260> is

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
actually material for spindle this is

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.840 
actually material for spindle this is
the<00:02:57.440> spindle<00:02:57.680> cartridge<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.579> is<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
the spindle cartridge this is the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.640 
the spindle cartridge this is the
spindle<00:02:59.090> flange<00:02:59.450> but<00:02:59.900> I<00:02:59.930> had<00:03:00.079> these<00:03:00.230> pieces<00:03:00.560> of

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
spindle flange but I had these pieces of

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.550 
spindle flange but I had these pieces of
material<00:03:00.739> so<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.730> surface<00:03:02.209> ground<00:03:02.480> this<00:03:02.690> both

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
material so I surface ground this both

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.490 
material so I surface ground this both
sides<00:03:03.859> so<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.430> have<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.609> good<00:03:04.790> reference<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.500> took

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
sides so I have a good reference I took

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.530 
sides so I have a good reference I took
this<00:03:06.709> piece<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.310> tubing<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.790> surface<00:03:08.390> ground

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
this piece of tubing and surface ground

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.699 
this piece of tubing and surface ground
both<00:03:08.750> sides<00:03:08.989> let<00:03:09.109> me<00:03:09.170> see<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.440> mess

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
both sides let me see the mess

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.229 
both sides let me see the mess
identified

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
identified

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.599 
identified
and<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.140> best<00:03:12.379> assess<00:03:12.799> how<00:03:13.069> much<00:03:13.129> shims

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
and to that best assess how much shims

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.949 
and to that best assess how much shims
you've<00:03:13.790> put<00:03:14.090> under<00:03:14.329> first<00:03:14.900> I'd<00:03:16.030> spread<00:03:17.030> once

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
you've put under first I'd spread once

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.780 
you've put under first I'd spread once
you<00:03:18.049> get<00:03:18.200> one<00:03:18.379> side<00:03:18.560> squared<00:03:18.980> then<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.579> just

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
you get one side squared then you just

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.179 
you get one side squared then you just
flip<00:03:19.969> it<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.269> each<00:03:20.540> other<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:21.200> these<00:03:21.890> two

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
flip it to each other so these two

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.490 
flip it to each other so these two
ground<00:03:22.430> blocks<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:23.090> didn't<00:03:23.390> use<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.719> set<00:03:24.319> up

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
ground blocks I didn't use the set up

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.610 
ground blocks I didn't use the set up
but<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:25.099> used<00:03:25.810> angle<00:03:26.810> blocks<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.170> ground<00:03:27.409> so

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
but I used angle blocks to the ground so

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.890 
but I used angle blocks to the ground so
these<00:03:28.250> actually<00:03:28.670> are<00:03:28.790> mounting<00:03:29.480> blocks<00:03:29.689> for

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
these actually are mounting blocks for

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.410 
these actually are mounting blocks for
the<00:03:29.959> tailstock<00:03:30.260> two<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.639> they're<00:03:32.030> grounded<00:03:32.299> on

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
the tailstock two so they're grounded on

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.809 
the tailstock two so they're grounded on
both<00:03:32.540> sides<00:03:32.780> so<00:03:33.159> anything<00:03:34.159> that<00:03:34.189> has<00:03:34.489> its

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
both sides so anything that has its

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.479 
both sides so anything that has its
parallel<00:03:35.299> ground<00:03:35.859> precision<00:03:36.859> ground<00:03:37.069> you<00:03:37.310> can

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
parallel ground precision ground you can

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.339 
parallel ground precision ground you can
use<00:03:37.760> because<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.750> will<00:03:38.930> keep<00:03:39.079> everything

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
use because it will keep everything

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.949 
use because it will keep everything
straight<00:03:40.129> up<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.489> down<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:41.629> would<00:03:41.810> go<00:03:41.900> on

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
straight up and down this would go on

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.339 
straight up and down this would go on
the<00:03:42.109> machine<00:03:43.359> and<00:03:44.359> then<00:03:44.480> this<00:03:44.629> goes<00:03:44.900> on<00:03:45.049> top<00:03:45.290> of

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
the machine and then this goes on top of

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.119 
the machine and then this goes on top of
it<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:47.000> now<00:03:47.209> we<00:03:47.930> have<00:03:47.959> enough<00:03:48.349> height<00:03:48.560> now<00:03:48.769> and

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
it and now we have enough height now and

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.800 
it and now we have enough height now and
it's<00:03:49.400> all<00:03:49.760> ground<00:03:50.030> surfaces<00:03:50.450> so<00:03:50.689> we're

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
it's all ground surfaces so we're

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.750 
it's all ground surfaces so we're
keeping<00:03:50.930> our<00:03:51.169> reference<00:03:51.500> all<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.709> way<00:03:51.799> up<00:03:51.950> and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
keeping our reference all the way up and

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.470 
keeping our reference all the way up and
then<00:03:53.290> this<00:03:54.290> guy<00:03:54.500> can<00:03:54.739> go<00:03:54.889> inside<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:56.620> like<00:03:57.620> that

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
then this guy can go inside I like that

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.819 
then this guy can go inside I like that
one<00:03:59.480> draw<00:03:59.780> bolt<00:04:00.079> through<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.379> middle<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.739> this

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
one draw bolt through the middle of this

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.039 
one draw bolt through the middle of this
to<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.549> table<00:04:01.849> slots<00:04:02.180> or<00:04:02.389> in<00:04:02.450> my<00:04:02.569> case<00:04:02.629> kept

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
to the table slots or in my case kept

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.890 
to the table slots or in my case kept
rolling<00:04:03.409> table<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:04.760> worked<00:04:05.060> out<00:04:05.269> fine<00:04:05.510> for

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
rolling table this worked out fine for

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.690 
rolling table this worked out fine for
drilling<00:04:06.379> these<00:04:06.500> holes<00:04:06.560> I<00:04:07.099> don't<00:04:07.400> have<00:04:07.489> enough

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
drilling these holes I don't have enough

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.339 
drilling these holes I don't have enough
horsepower<00:04:07.969> to<00:04:08.120> do<00:04:08.359> these<00:04:08.450> hope<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:08.930> one<00:04:09.049> shot

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
horsepower to do these hope and one shot

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.250 
horsepower to do these hope and one shot
through<00:04:09.889> this<00:04:10.129> middle<00:04:10.370> but<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.870> next<00:04:12.139> one

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
through this middle but the next one

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.899 
through this middle but the next one
will<00:04:12.439> but<00:04:12.680> for<00:04:12.950> now<00:04:13.069> I<00:04:13.129> have<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.489> start<00:04:13.760> with

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
will but for now I have to start with

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.909 
will but for now I have to start with
smaller<00:04:14.180> hole<00:04:14.359> and<00:04:14.780> work<00:04:15.139> up<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.680> work<00:04:15.799> them

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
smaller hole and work up and work them

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.770 
smaller hole and work up and work them
up<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:16.190> work<00:04:16.310> among<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:16.729> you'll<00:04:17.329> see<00:04:17.539> that<00:04:17.659> in

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
up and work among so you'll see that in

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.500 
up and work among so you'll see that in
the<00:04:17.870> video<00:04:18.139> and<00:04:18.500> it's<00:04:19.489> it's<00:04:19.880> serendipitous

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
the video and it's it's serendipitous

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.290 
the video and it's it's serendipitous
that<00:04:20.690> with<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:20.989> this<00:04:21.380> fixture<00:04:22.240> even<00:04:23.240> though

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
that with this this fixture even though

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.149 
that with this this fixture even though
it's<00:04:23.449> a<00:04:23.479> good<00:04:23.630> solid<00:04:23.840> fixture<00:04:24.380> it's<00:04:24.889> a<00:04:24.979> little

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
it's a good solid fixture it's a little

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.159 
it's a good solid fixture it's a little
more<00:04:25.280> narrow<00:04:25.490> than<00:04:25.820> I<00:04:25.849> would<00:04:26.030> like<00:04:26.180> make<00:04:27.050> the

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
more narrow than I would like make the

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.899 
more narrow than I would like make the
flipper<00:04:27.320> top-heavy<00:04:27.770> so<00:04:28.639> for<00:04:29.440> for<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.530> next

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:30.909 
flipper top-heavy so for for the next

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.070 
flipper top-heavy so for for the next
couple<00:04:31.909> spindles<00:04:32.389> that<00:04:32.419> I<00:04:32.510> have<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.720> do<00:04:32.870> I'm

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
couple spindles that I have to do I'm

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.409 
couple spindles that I have to do I'm
going<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.320> get<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.650> piece<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.039> material<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:35.210> is

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
going to get a piece of material this is

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.240 
going to get a piece of material this is
Dom<00:04:35.630> tubing<00:04:35.960> I'm<00:04:36.229> going<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.530> piece<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.740> it's

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
Dom tubing I'm going to piece it it's

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.060 
Dom tubing I'm going to piece it it's
about<00:04:37.400> six<00:04:37.880> inches<00:04:38.150> in<00:04:38.330> diameter<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.990> go<00:04:39.889> all

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
about six inches in diameter and go all

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.230 
about six inches in diameter and go all
the<00:04:40.159> way<00:04:40.190> from<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.520> top<00:04:40.669> to<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.880> floor<00:04:41.090> and

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
the way from the top to the floor and

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.790 
the way from the top to the floor and
eliminate<00:04:41.630> all<00:04:41.720> these<00:04:41.840> various<00:04:42.169> pieces<00:04:42.380> one

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
eliminate all these various pieces one

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.159 
eliminate all these various pieces one
piece<00:04:42.949> of<00:04:43.130> tubing<00:04:43.430> so<00:04:44.330> I'm<00:04:44.599> going<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.840> go<00:04:44.960> from

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
piece of tubing so I'm going to go from

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.469 
piece of tubing so I'm going to go from
one<00:04:45.380> horsepower<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:45.919> 4.6<00:04:46.520> horsepower<00:04:46.580> on<00:04:47.120> on

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
one horsepower to 4.6 horsepower on on

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.810 
one horsepower to 4.6 horsepower on on
the<00:04:47.630> fourth<00:04:48.590> axis<00:04:48.979> so<00:04:49.099> I<00:04:49.130> may<00:04:49.370> be<00:04:49.430> able<00:04:49.669> to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
the fourth axis so I may be able to

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.260 
the fourth axis so I may be able to
actually<00:04:50.630> hog<00:04:50.930> these<00:04:51.139> guys<00:04:51.759> pretty<00:04:52.759> good<00:04:53.000> once

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
actually hog these guys pretty good once

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:08.100 
actually hog these guys pretty good once
I<00:04:53.389> had<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.690> new<00:04:53.810> know
