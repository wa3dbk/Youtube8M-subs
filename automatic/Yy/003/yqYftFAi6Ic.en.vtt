00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
think Corey's a cornerstone of the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.090 
think Corey's a cornerstone of the
franchise<00:01:27.759> but<00:01:28.299> for<00:01:28.689> me<00:01:28.890> what's<00:01:29.890> really

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
franchise but for me what's really

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.560 
franchise but for me what's really
important<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.729> you<00:01:31.179> always<00:01:31.330> have<00:01:31.539> the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
important is that you always have the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.820 
important is that you always have the
main<00:01:31.840> characters<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.560> they're<00:01:32.649> always

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
main characters and they're always

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.770 
main characters and they're always
falling<00:01:33.369> where<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:33.970> could<00:01:34.119> say<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.420> hero's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
falling where you could say the hero's

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.200 
falling where you could say the hero's
journey<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:35.710> always<00:01:35.950> have<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:36.369> hero<00:01:36.610> winning

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
journey you always have the hero winning

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.510 
journey you always have the hero winning
in<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.479> end<00:01:37.750> so<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.409> think<00:01:38.560> that's<00:01:38.890> where<00:01:39.039> we

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
in the end so I think that's where we

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.270 
in the end so I think that's where we
differ<00:01:39.729> from<00:01:39.970> other<00:01:40.270> horror<00:01:40.659> media<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:42.250> I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
differ from other horror media and so I

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.620 
differ from other horror media and so I
want<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.549> make<00:01:42.670> sure<00:01:42.759> that<00:01:43.090> especially<00:01:43.569> with

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
want to make sure that especially with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
our 6th at that we follow that hero's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.580 
our 6th at that we follow that hero's
journey<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:46.119> that<00:01:46.299> you<00:01:46.509> have<00:01:46.750> these<00:01:47.229> heroes
