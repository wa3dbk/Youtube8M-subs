crewmen on Wild Oats just going to
explain<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.780> little<00:00:03.929> bit<00:00:04.080> about<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.920> boat<00:00:05.100> and

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
explain a little bit about the boat and

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.130 
explain a little bit about the boat and
how<00:00:06.000> different<00:00:06.330> it<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.569> some<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.020> other

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
how different it is to some of the other

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.740 
how different it is to some of the other
boats<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.589> race<00:00:08.000> in<00:00:09.000> particular<00:00:09.300> to

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
boats in this race in particular to

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.799 
boats in this race in particular to
investing<00:00:10.440> law<00:00:10.650> we're<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:12.030> little<00:00:12.360> bit<00:00:12.570> older

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
investing law we're a little bit older

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.959 
investing law we're a little bit older
our<00:00:13.019> boat<00:00:13.230> but<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:14.040> designed<00:00:14.639> very

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
our boat but it's it's designed very

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.120 
our boat but it's it's designed very
differently<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.630> very<00:00:15.870> narrow<00:00:16.109> boat<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
differently it's a very narrow boat and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.300 
differently it's a very narrow boat and
quite<00:00:17.430> light<00:00:17.960> we're<00:00:18.960> probably<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.680> terms<00:00:19.949> of

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
quite light we're probably in terms of

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.230 
quite light we're probably in terms of
the<00:00:21.000> power<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.900> carry<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.470> only<00:00:22.619> about

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
the power we can carry we're only about

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.880 
the power we can carry we're only about
60<00:00:24.240> or<00:00:24.269> 70<00:00:24.390> percent<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> power<00:00:25.590> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
60 or 70 percent of the power that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.689 
60 or 70 percent of the power that
investing<00:00:26.609> law<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:27.660> carry<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.220> narrower

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
investing law can carry so a narrower

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.659 
investing law can carry so a narrower
boat<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.960> quite<00:00:31.560> quite<00:00:31.980> different<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.489> terms

in in windy weather when you're going
when<00:01:08.250> you're<00:01:08.820> sailing<00:01:08.970> upwind<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.570> use<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
when you're sailing upwind we use the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
when you're sailing upwind we use the
full<00:01:10.080> center<00:01:10.350> ball<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.610> lighter<00:01:11.880> weather

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
full center ball and in lighter weather

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.640 
full center ball and in lighter weather
and<00:01:12.390> depending<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> angle<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> boat

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and depending on the angle of the boat

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.390 
and depending on the angle of the boat
sailing<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.670> might<00:01:14.850> only<00:01:15.060> use<00:01:15.210> half<00:01:15.540> foot

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
sailing you might only use half foot

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.120 
sailing you might only use half foot
they're<00:01:17.400> quite<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> complex<00:01:18.000> shape<00:01:18.270> they're<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
they're quite a complex shape they're a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.410 
they're quite a complex shape they're a
aerofoil<00:01:20.130> section<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> hydrofoil<00:01:21.390> section

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
aerofoil section or a hydrofoil section

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.649 
aerofoil section or a hydrofoil section
and<00:01:22.020> they're<00:01:22.710> fatter<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:24.090> inside<00:01:24.450> than

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and they're fatter on the inside than

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.660 
and they're fatter on the inside than
they<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.500> outside<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
they are on the outside and what that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.749 
they are on the outside and what that
does<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.270> feticide<00:01:27.750> creates<00:01:28.259> lift<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
does the feticide creates lift and so it

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.460 
does the feticide creates lift and so it
actually<00:01:29.909> apart<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:30.750> stopping<00:01:31.200> light

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
actually apart from stopping light

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800 
actually apart from stopping light
slipping<00:01:31.799> sideways<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.460> actually<00:01:32.729> helps<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
slipping sideways it actually helps the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.390 
slipping sideways it actually helps the
boat<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:34.619> closer<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> wind

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
boat go a little bit closer to the wind

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.399 
boat go a little bit closer to the wind
then<00:01:35.670> ignore<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.420> would<00:01:36.600> otherwise<00:01:36.750> if

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
then ignore that would otherwise if

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
then ignore that would otherwise if
there's<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.920> stuff<00:01:38.100> downstairs<00:01:38.369> on

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
there's a lot of stuff downstairs on

there's a lot of stuff downstairs on
this<00:01:39.420> boat<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> most<00:01:40.890> important

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
this boat one of the most important

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.340 
this boat one of the most important
things<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.060> our<00:01:42.240> keel<00:01:42.479> hard<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.200> see

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
things is there is our keel hard to see

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.230 
things is there is our keel hard to see
with<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> camera<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.579> underneath<00:01:45.030> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
with the camera but underneath this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.590 
with the camera but underneath this
waterproof<00:01:46.020> box<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:47.000> basically<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.210> ocean

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
waterproof box is basically the ocean

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.990 
waterproof box is basically the ocean
and<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.439> we've<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> cable<00:01:50.700> that's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and in there we've got a cable that's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.450 
and in there we've got a cable that's
about<00:01:51.299> five<00:01:51.659> metres<00:01:52.110> deep<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> very

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
about five metres deep it's a very

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
about five metres deep it's a very
narrow<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> steel<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
narrow now a bit of steel or on the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.810 
narrow now a bit of steel or on the
bottom<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> there's<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.219> bulb<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.549> weighs

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
bottom of it there's a bulb that weighs

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.690 
bottom of it there's a bulb that weighs
about<00:01:57.000> 12<00:01:57.600> or<00:01:57.780> 14<00:01:57.899> tonne<00:01:58.439> round<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.310> made<00:01:59.520> out

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
about 12 or 14 tonne round it made out

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.770 
about 12 or 14 tonne round it made out
of<00:01:59.820> lead

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
of lead

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.960 
of lead
and<00:02:00.900> it's<00:02:01.350> controlled<00:02:01.890> by<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.490> big<00:02:02.729> hydraulic

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
and it's controlled by a big hydraulic

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.539 
and it's controlled by a big hydraulic
lever<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.810> hydraulic<00:02:04.470> ram<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.890> pushes<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
lever a hydraulic ram that pushes the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.389 
lever a hydraulic ram that pushes the
lever<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:06.960> decide<00:02:07.380> which<00:02:07.590> allows<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.160> keel

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
lever so I decide which allows the keel

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
lever so I decide which allows the keel
to<00:02:08.910> rotate<00:02:09.270> 40<00:02:09.600> degrees<00:02:09.899> either<00:02:10.140> side<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
to rotate 40 degrees either side of the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.559 
to rotate 40 degrees either side of the
center<00:02:10.890> line<00:02:11.069> that's<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> thing<00:02:12.240> that<00:02:12.270> stops

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
center line that's the thing that stops

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.300 
center line that's the thing that stops
the<00:02:12.690> boat<00:02:12.840> falling<00:02:13.200> over<00:02:13.500> what<00:02:14.040> I'm<00:02:14.130> standing

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
the boat falling over what I'm standing

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.850 
the boat falling over what I'm standing
on<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> moment<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.030> horizontal<00:02:15.959> foil<00:02:16.260> slides

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
on the moment is horizontal foil slides

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.100 
on the moment is horizontal foil slides
from<00:02:17.100> side<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.430> side<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> boat<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.810> can't

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
from side to side in the boat you can't

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.750 
from side to side in the boat you can't
really<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.190> interesting<00:02:20.430> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
really see it's not that interesting to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.360 
really see it's not that interesting to
look<00:02:20.940> at<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.810> there's<00:02:22.470> some<00:02:22.680> again<00:02:23.160> there's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
look at but there's some again there's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.100 
look at but there's some again there's
some<00:02:23.489> hydraulic<00:02:23.970> action<00:02:24.300> under<00:02:24.600> underneath

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
some hydraulic action under underneath

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.800 
some hydraulic action under underneath
my<00:02:25.440> feet<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:26.400> pushes<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.940> foil<00:02:27.270> from<00:02:27.510> side

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
my feet that pushes this foil from side

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.809 
my feet that pushes this foil from side
to<00:02:27.840> side<00:02:27.989> when<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:28.470> fully<00:02:28.650> retracted<00:02:29.250> it

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
to side when it's fully retracted it

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.370 
to side when it's fully retracted it
just<00:02:30.030> sits<00:02:30.209> flush<00:02:30.450> with<00:02:30.510> either<00:02:30.840> side<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.200> the
