and<00:00:41.989> quick<00:00:42.989> ah<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:44.309> got<00:00:44.460> across<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.960> then

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and quick ah you got across and then

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.410 
and quick ah you got across and then
watch<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.559> push<00:00:46.770> itself<00:00:47.100> across<00:00:47.430> now<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.239> may

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
watch it push itself across now you may

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690 
watch it push itself across now you may
be<00:00:48.450> thinking<00:00:48.620> this<00:00:49.620> seems<00:00:49.890> pretty<00:00:50.129> big<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
be thinking this seems pretty big and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
be thinking this seems pretty big and
slow<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.539> three<00:00:51.780> wide<00:00:51.989> trapdoor<00:00:52.649> not

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
slow for three wide trapdoor not

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
slow for three wide trapdoor not
trapdoor<00:00:53.460> drawbridge<00:00:54.090> that's<00:00:55.020> where<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
trapdoor drawbridge that's where you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.369 
trapdoor drawbridge that's where you
would<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:56.010> correct<00:00:56.539> but<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.079> thing

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
would be correct but what this thing

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.580 
would be correct but what this thing
does<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.949> most<00:00:59.190> others<00:00:59.640> don't<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.590> that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
does that most others don't is that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.609 
does that most others don't is that
there's<00:01:02.370> no<00:01:02.460> spin<00:01:02.940> zone<00:01:03.320> connecting<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> two

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
there's no spin zone connecting the two

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.609 
there's no spin zone connecting the two
sides<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.720> an<00:01:06.720> awesome<00:01:07.020> thing<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
sides and an awesome thing is that you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.090 
sides and an awesome thing is that you
can't<00:01:07.890> jump<00:01:08.220> three<00:01:08.850> wide<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.799> really

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
can't jump three wide so now it's really

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.550 
can't jump three wide so now it's really
safe<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.700> impossible<00:01:12.229> if<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.350> want<00:01:13.500> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
safe it's impossible if you want to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
safe it's impossible if you want to
pertain<00:01:13.799> stuff<00:01:14.159> three<00:01:14.700> word<00:01:14.880> gap<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.659> way

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
pertain stuff three word gap is the way

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.700 
pertain stuff three word gap is the way
to<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.490> mm-hmm<00:01:17.490> even<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.479> your<00:01:18.630> sprint<00:01:18.990> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
to do it mm-hmm even if your sprint you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190 
to do it mm-hmm even if your sprint you
can't<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.330> but<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.750> first<00:01:21.780> one

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
can't do it but this is the first one

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.570 
can't do it but this is the first one
we've<00:01:22.350> been<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.590> was<00:01:22.680> found<00:01:22.950> where<00:01:23.159> there's<00:01:23.340> no

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
we've been I was found where there's no

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
we've been I was found where there's no
red<00:01:23.939> stone<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> goes<00:01:24.630> underneath<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:26.040> we

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
red stone that goes underneath so we

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.359 
red stone that goes underneath so we
thought<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.580> was<00:01:26.850> worth<00:01:27.030> uploading<00:01:28.220> but<00:01:29.220> yeah

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
thought I was worth uploading but yeah

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
thought I was worth uploading but yeah
let's<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.909> take<00:01:30.150> away<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.540> top<00:01:30.780> layer<00:01:31.020> here

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
let's just take away this top layer here

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.830 
let's just take away this top layer here
and<00:01:32.329> show<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.750> redstone<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.420> all

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and show you the redstone so here is all

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.990 
and show you the redstone so here is all
the<00:01:36.869> redstone<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:39.750> might<00:01:40.740> seem<00:01:41.280> pretty<00:01:41.670> big

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the redstone it might seem pretty big

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.020 
the redstone it might seem pretty big
again<00:01:42.390> until<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.170> realize<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.880> has

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
again until you realize just what it has

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.660 
again until you realize just what it has
to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.420> let's<00:01:46.020> fill<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> click<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> button<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
to do let's fill it click the button you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.859 
to do let's fill it click the button you
can<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:48.060> what's<00:01:48.329> going<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:50.060> simply<00:01:51.060> button<00:01:51.390> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
can see what's going on simply button so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.690 
can see what's going on simply button so
there<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.170> pushes<00:01:52.500> out<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
there it pushes out and you can see a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
there it pushes out and you can see a
triple<00:01:56.969> piston<00:01:57.360> extender<00:01:57.590> flush<00:01:58.590> triple

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
triple piston extender flush triple

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.249 
triple piston extender flush triple
piston<00:01:59.219> extender<00:01:59.360> fires<00:02:00.360> from<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.750> side<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
piston extender fires from the side and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.980 
piston extender fires from the side and
all<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.040> works<00:02:02.250> nicely<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.810> flow

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
all that works nicely and we get it flow

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.980 
all that works nicely and we get it flow
the<00:02:04.770> way<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:06.000> communicate<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the way it like communicate with the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.990 
the way it like communicate with the
other<00:02:07.049> side<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.710> pushing<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.580> whole

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
other side it's pushing this whole

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.619 
other side it's pushing this whole
bridge<00:02:09.420> into<00:02:10.319> here<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.370> fires<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.120> super

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
bridge into here so it fires the super

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.830 
bridge into here so it fires the super
extender<00:02:13.050> if<00:02:13.349> we<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:13.739> dance<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.840> yeah

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
extender if we just dance like this yeah

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.949 
extender if we just dance like this yeah
possibly<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.099> break<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:18.569> should<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.870> one

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
possibly going to break it should be one

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.860 
possibly going to break it should be one
chick<00:02:19.200> has<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.250> tick<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.420> knowing

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
chick has to be a one tick but knowing

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.770 
chick has to be a one tick but knowing
my<00:02:22.080> ping<00:02:23.150> actually<00:02:24.150> doesn't<00:02:24.390> need<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> way<00:02:24.690> of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
my ping actually doesn't need a way of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.400 
my ping actually doesn't need a way of
doing<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:26.060> yeah<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:30.660> see<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.110> breaks

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
doing this yeah you see it breaks

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.850 
doing this yeah you see it breaks
everything<00:02:31.800> we've<00:02:32.040> made<00:02:32.480> lovely<00:02:33.620> but<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.709> was

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
everything we've made lovely but it was

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.390 
everything we've made lovely but it was
yes<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:36.300> that's<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.750> main<00:02:37.110> tricky<00:02:38.040> part<00:02:38.280> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
yes so that's the main tricky part of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.970 
yes so that's the main tricky part of
this<00:02:38.550> creation<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.349> nice<00:02:40.680> thing

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
this creation but one of the nice thing

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.949 
this creation but one of the nice thing
about<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.910> button<00:02:42.300> operated

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
about this is that it's button operated

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.740 
about this is that it's button operated
so<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:43.800> actually<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.370> same<00:02:44.750> extension

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
so we actually have the same extension

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.869 
so we actually have the same extension
as<00:02:46.080> we<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.379> retraction<00:02:46.950> because<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.489> circuit

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
as we do retraction because this circuit

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.990 
as we do retraction because this circuit
over<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.360> doesn't<00:02:49.230> need<00:02:49.560> an<00:02:49.680> input<00:02:50.010> how

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
over here doesn't need an input how

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.259 
over here doesn't need an input how
about<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.569> that's<00:02:52.290> pretty<00:02:52.470> cool<00:02:53.269> another

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
about that that's pretty cool another

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.610 
about that that's pretty cool another
thing<00:02:54.540> about<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.170> there's<00:02:55.530> one

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
thing about it is that there's one

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.350 
thing about it is that there's one
hundred<00:02:56.010> percent<00:02:56.069> reliable<00:02:56.459> one<00:02:57.090> hundred

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
hundred percent reliable one hundred

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.479 
hundred percent reliable one hundred
percent<00:02:57.560> always<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:58.950> buck<00:02:59.280> it

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
percent always you can buck it

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.750 
percent always you can buck it
everywhere<00:03:00.269> every<00:03:00.780> court<00:03:01.019> anywhere<00:03:01.760> mm-hmm

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
everywhere every court anywhere mm-hmm

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
everywhere every court anywhere mm-hmm
so<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.480> that's<00:03:03.690> rarely<00:03:04.140> achieved<00:03:04.650> with

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
so that that's rarely achieved with

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.190 
so that that's rarely achieved with
complex<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.920> strange<00:03:07.920> mechanics<00:03:09.200> redstone

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
complex and strange mechanics redstone

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.740 
complex and strange mechanics redstone
contraptions<00:03:10.830> but<00:03:10.980> we<00:03:11.129> did<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.370> now<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.360> have<00:03:12.599> to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
contraptions but we did it now I have to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.940 
contraptions but we did it now I have to
say<00:03:12.989> snap<00:03:13.739> did<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.310> whole<00:03:14.519> side<00:03:14.879> here<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.950> we

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
say snap did the whole side here and we

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.920 
say snap did the whole side here and we
worked<00:03:17.159> together<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:18.060> small<00:03:18.269> bit<00:03:18.659> here

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
worked together on this small bit here

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.410 
worked together on this small bit here
which<00:03:19.709> may<00:03:20.040> look<00:03:20.340> like<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.730> very<00:03:21.090> insignificant

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
which may look like a very insignificant

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.030 
which may look like a very insignificant
amount<00:03:22.050> but<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.290> actually<00:03:22.440> took<00:03:22.709> quite<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.950> long

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
amount but it actually took quite a long

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.920 
amount but it actually took quite a long
time<00:03:23.129> didn't<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:25.110> did<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:26.549> he's<00:03:27.239> he's<00:03:27.659> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
time didn't it you did so he's he's the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.210 
time didn't it you did so he's he's the
mastermind<00:03:28.830> behind<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:31.220> communication

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
mastermind behind the communication

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.520 
mastermind behind the communication
between<00:03:32.340> both<00:03:32.760> sides<00:03:32.989> but<00:03:33.989> we<00:03:34.110> works<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.440> it

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
between both sides but we works in it

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.229 
between both sides but we works in it
together<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.099> I'm<00:03:35.280> uploading<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.030> my

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
together so I'm uploading it to my

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.140 
together so I'm uploading it to my
channel<00:03:37.069> yeah<00:03:38.069> this<00:03:38.340> YouTube<00:03:38.700> thing<00:03:38.730> works

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
channel yeah this YouTube thing works

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.360 
channel yeah this YouTube thing works
but<00:03:39.959> yeah<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.349> think<00:03:40.470> that's<00:03:40.860> about<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.190> for

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
but yeah I think that's about it for

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.660 
but yeah I think that's about it for
this<00:03:41.549> video<00:03:42.409> so<00:03:43.409> if<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.650> liked<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.040> please<00:03:44.250> hit

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670
