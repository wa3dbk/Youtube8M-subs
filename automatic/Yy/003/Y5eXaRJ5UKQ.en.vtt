00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.670
 and there is another point in the corrections and 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.950
 which are the corrections in clear air 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.480
 mark the most important points 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.820
 points where the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.800
 clear corrections because we have to 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.290
 play we are talking about a technique of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.060
 chiaroscuro and whenever I use dark 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.829
 you can use clear new to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.230
 highlight and to make contrasts and 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.840
 moments to create volumes and for 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.119
 create depth then an eyelid 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160
 fixed is the one that we have pegadito to the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.470
 eyebrow eyelid fisco this serves in addition 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.200
 to raise your eyes to lift the 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.470
 look at the area that is what they have in 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.970
 the center drawn this area will you 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.520
 It is also important to give volume 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.530
 to the face the fins of the nose that 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.140
 we always have more dark in that area 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.780
 then put a point of light there goes to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.370
 give to illuminate the face the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 corners of the lips is also 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.840
 important that you put points of light 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.579
 to create light in August so that it 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.280
 see the most beautiful skin and always 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.110
 I insist with 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.390
 by the skin the importance that it has 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.400
 work the skin to me I do not care that 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.560
 make a super eyes and the skin is not 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.110
 well worked well if the skin is well 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.750
 worked the rest we are modifying it 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.619
 but the skin is the basis of all our 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.080
 sting makeup is very important that 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.450
 learn to work with dark glades and 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.310
 that they know how to light their faces with 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.770
 points of light that is with the corrections 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 in clear and that they learn to define the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.729
 oval of his face to take advantage of 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.220
 to look prettier to look 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.220
 impressive and so they can apply 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.259
 this knowledge and it's very good that 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.479
 you draw for example if you have a 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.280
 notebook of notes that draw this that 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.259
 put fixed eyelid lip commissure 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.659
 where are the dark areas where they go 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.090
 the clearest 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.100
 usually you raise them clear always 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.220
 they are maintained when we saw corrections 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.020
 of triangular red we put clarity in 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.490
 other areas of the face also that is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.009
 on the sides of the jaw to 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.509
 create volumes but these that are missing 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.380
 today they are the ones that are always maintained 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.049
 then sound 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.000
 the fixed as high it is not the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.979
 space that is from the middle of the eye 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.200
 towards the corner and up to 100 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.150
 fins of the analysis commissures of the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.069
 lips then these are the points of 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.450
 light that you have to create in your
