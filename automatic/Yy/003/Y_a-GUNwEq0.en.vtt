00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.080
 the taste and the glasses are part of their 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.220
 school material safety is a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.349
 fundamental element 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.779
 when you work daily with a lathe or 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.489
 with +3 adores the students of the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.220
 Mechanical manufacturing family spend 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.109
 many hours a day in the workshop 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.659
 outline modeling another that is part of 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.640
 your routine under the guidelines marked 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.019
 by the faculty these students 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.960
 they learn to function with ease 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.550
 inside a workshop simulate the environment 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.740
 of a company and facilitate the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.600
 Contact with the timely machinery are 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.020
 basic aspects to develop this 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.020
 learning 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.430
 for me the main difference is that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.470
 the university is a lot of theory and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.730
 very few practices something that in the end 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.070
 of the university since one is already raised 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 doing a business internship and not 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.190
 is absolutely mandatory at least in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.260
 my time I do not know now 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.299
 and with the professional training that you 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.909
 it guarantees you, it will not be a three or 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.820
 four months of practice then also 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.600
 I for my years not but the people who 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.670
 I think they are a little bit more 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.640
 young people for dual training is something 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.380
 that it's quite interesting to spend nine 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.820
 months knowing a job is 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.310
 The main advantage offered by the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.560
 vocational training duval this option 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.630
 formative is a perfect formula for 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.280
 approaching business reality and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.590
 know first hand the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.710
 peculiarities of a trade you have to 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.450
 access this module because I think 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.900
 a good opportunity facing the market 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.730
 labor 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.320
 you have a great opportunity that is years 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.110
 of experience in a sector in which 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.590
 I 'm also specializing that I do not 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.650
 there are some fixed studies defined for 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.140
 so then I wanted to access this 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.730
 module because they gave me the opportunity to 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.980
 learn in these three years facing the 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.350
 future 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.090
 students like francisco have the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.550
 constant supervision advice 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.170
 of a tutor in practice they are the 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 who are concerned that apprentices 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.400
 end up being workers 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.260
 qualified 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.020
 is an important window helps us to 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.550
 be more competitive and especially the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.320
 modality of learning while 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.150
 we work or work while 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.150
 we learn brings a lot 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.489
 before going to the companies the 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.069
 students must acquire a series of 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.390
 theoretical knowledge it's true 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.849
 that most of his day 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.040
 they run between yesterday but modules like 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.709
 Computer manufacturing requires 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.720
 other types of facilities compared to 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.859
 screens we no longer find only 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.650
 kids out of education 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.170
 secondary education the diversity of 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.060
 students are increasingly the case of Sara 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.950
 university degree in search of a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.019
 more practical training and its not 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.939
 destruction the relationship with the 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.120
 fellow has been very well I have 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:57.310
 welcomed perfectly so when 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.700
 you arrive from the first day and you meet 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.159
 one in a class of 30 students is is the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.230
 only girl scares a little but if 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.230
 you really like it, there is no problem 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.410
 whatever its origin before it is 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.850
 opens a new opportunity to see the 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.350
 said to be a familiar face in the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.840
 companies for crimes the figures of 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.730
 imputation either through the dual fp 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.709
 or with the training module in the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.390
 work centers specialize 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.350
 according to the real needs of the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.460
 market the basic knowledge is 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.710
 they want 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.730
 then what they need is still 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:44.600
 more hours of hours 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.280
 in the company for greater perfection 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.680
 the mechanical manufacturing family 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.180
 supposes the best possible nursery for 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.320
 all the companies dedicated to the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.320
