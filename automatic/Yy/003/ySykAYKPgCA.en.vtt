first of all I'm not going to go through
the<00:00:28.350> whole<00:00:28.529> process<00:00:28.770> just<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.640> last<00:00:29.880> bit

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
the whole process just the last bit

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.939 
the whole process just the last bit
which<00:00:30.449> most<00:00:30.750> people<00:00:31.109> seem<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.350> be<00:00:31.560> having

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
which most people seem to be having

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.460 
which most people seem to be having
difficulty<00:00:32.510> the<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:33.750> thing<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.050> had<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> do

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
difficulty the first thing we had to do

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.750 
difficulty the first thing we had to do
is<00:00:35.300> remove<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:37.320> spindle<00:00:37.739> nut<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.220> goes<00:00:38.399> on

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
is remove the spindle nut that goes on

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.620 
is remove the spindle nut that goes on
the<00:00:39.059> end<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.470> half<00:00:40.710> shaft<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.510> once<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
the end of the half shaft and once you

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.319 
the end of the half shaft and once you
remove<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:42.989> bolt<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:44.370> directly

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
remove that bolt down directly

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.610 
remove that bolt down directly
underneath<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.649> three<00:00:47.489> bolts<00:00:48.620> two

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
underneath there are three bolts two

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.200 
underneath there are three bolts two
nuts<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> bolt<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:50.880> come<00:00:51.030> off

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
nuts and a bolt that will come off

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.860 
nuts and a bolt that will come off
underneath

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
underneath

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.410 
underneath
once<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.649> done<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.370> separate<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
once that's done you separate it and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.400 
once that's done you separate it and
this<00:00:54.629> has<00:00:55.309> free<00:00:56.309> movement<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.149> order<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.289> get

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
this has free movement in order to get

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.380 
this has free movement in order to get
the<00:00:58.530> half<00:00:58.739> axle<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.610> with<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.120> nut

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the half axle out and with that nut

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.860 
the half axle out and with that nut
already<00:01:00.840> removed<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:02.129> swings<00:01:02.579> out<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
already removed this swings out and the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.359 
already removed this swings out and the
half<00:01:04.049> axle<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.710> pulls<00:01:04.979> out<00:01:05.159> from<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.580> rear

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
half axle just pulls out from the rear

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.300 
half axle just pulls out from the rear
so<00:01:08.369> once<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.940> have<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> half<00:01:09.420> axle<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.310> what

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so once you have the half axle out what

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
so once you have the half axle out what
you're<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:13.229> are<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you're going to do is you are going to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.380 
you're going to do is you are going to
see<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:15.689> CV<00:01:16.080> axle<00:01:16.200> basically<00:01:17.210> dangling<00:01:18.210> in

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
see the CV axle basically dangling in

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.039 
see the CV axle basically dangling in
this<00:01:19.110> position<00:01:19.640> now<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:20.970> you're<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this position now if you're going to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
this position now if you're going to
reuse<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.740> half<00:01:22.920> axle<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.490> need<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> support

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
reuse the half axle you need to support

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.640 
reuse the half axle you need to support
the<00:01:24.299> weight<00:01:24.450> somehow<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.170> doesn't<00:01:25.470> tear

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the weight somehow so it doesn't tear

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.030 
the weight somehow so it doesn't tear
out<00:01:25.850> because<00:01:26.850> we're<00:01:27.119> replacing<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> entire

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
out because we're replacing the entire

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
out because we're replacing the entire
axle<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.909> much<00:01:30.119> easier<00:01:30.360> than<00:01:30.630> just

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
axle which is much easier than just

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.770 
axle which is much easier than just
replacing<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.560> boot<00:01:31.820> we<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.030> removed<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
replacing the boot we have removed the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.410 
replacing the boot we have removed the
axle<00:01:34.619> by<00:01:34.770> simply<00:01:35.189> prying<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.030> pulling

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
axle by simply prying on it or pulling

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.770 
axle by simply prying on it or pulling
on<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.640> have<00:01:38.640> removed<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.330> whole<00:01:39.479> thing

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
on it and have removed the whole thing

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.899 
on it and have removed the whole thing
and<00:01:39.990> separated<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.729> want

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and separated it but if you don't want

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.350 
and separated it but if you don't want
to<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:44.090> dangle<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.150> to<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to do that you can just dangle it to the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.510 
to do that you can just dangle it to the
side<00:01:45.570> support<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> weight<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.189> will<00:01:47.310> give

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
side support the weight and it will give

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
side support the weight and it will give
you<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.880> angle<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.990> angle<00:01:49.439> is

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you this angle now this angle is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.050 
you this angle now this angle is
important<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.829> reason<00:01:53.220> why<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.610> important

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
important the reason why it's important

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.510 
important the reason why it's important
is<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> angle<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.369> will

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
is because that is the angle that will

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.899 
is because that is the angle that will
give<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.119> able<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> use<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> tool<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
give you to be able to use the tool and

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.749 
give you to be able to use the tool and
remove<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.509> CV<00:02:00.960> axle<00:02:01.200> from<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> transmission

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
remove the CV axle from the transmission

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.730 
remove the CV axle from the transmission
and<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.540> where<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.750> lot<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.020> people<00:02:04.259> seem<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and that's where a lot of people seem to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.340 
and that's where a lot of people seem to
have<00:02:04.979> problems<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.659> clearance<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.259> the

have problems the clearance on the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
you

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.170 
you
or<00:02:12.390> makes<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.750> very<00:02:12.870> difficult<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:14.400> use<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> pry

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
or makes it very difficult to use a pry

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.589 
or makes it very difficult to use a pry
bar<00:02:15.620> like<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.769> would<00:02:16.920> normally<00:02:17.370> use<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:18.359> take

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.090 
see that it fits right in there and as
you<00:04:42.139> slide<00:04:42.530> out<00:04:42.560> it'll<00:04:42.979> pull<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.639> hub<00:04:44.210> out<00:04:45.100> so

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
you slide out it'll pull the hub out so

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.790 
you slide out it'll pull the hub out so
that's<00:04:46.280> what<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.580> angle<00:04:46.910> you're<00:04:47.030> looking<00:04:47.570> for

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
that's what the angle you're looking for

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.180 
that's what the angle you're looking for
you<00:04:48.800> get<00:04:48.950> to<00:04:49.070> closing<00:04:49.340> that<00:04:49.490> get<00:04:49.760> blurry<00:04:51.190> so

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
you get to closing that get blurry so

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.490 
you get to closing that get blurry so
that's<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.669> angle<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.780> gets<00:04:53.990> in<00:04:54.200> there<00:04:54.320> you

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
that's the angle it gets in there you

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.409 
that's the angle it gets in there you
get<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.800> contact<00:04:55.340> slide<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:56.000> hammer<00:04:56.210> out

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
get that contact slide the hammer out

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.490 
get that contact slide the hammer out
and<00:04:56.660> it<00:04:56.810> pops<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.320> out<00:04:57.410> now<00:04:58.100> as<00:04:59.320> you<00:05:00.320> may<00:05:00.470> have

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
and it pops it out now as you may have

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.060 
and it pops it out now as you may have
learned<00:05:00.860> already

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
learned already

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
you're trying to get it out is to try

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.580 
you're trying to get it out is to try
one<00:05:27.770> spot<00:05:28.660> try<00:05:29.660> and<00:05:29.780> get<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:29.960> out<00:05:30.050> and<00:05:30.260> if

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
one spot try and get it out and if

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
inside that c-clip is going to be in the

inside that c-clip is going to be in the
right<00:05:46.010> position<00:05:46.250> for<00:05:46.760> it<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.389> make<00:05:47.539> it<00:05:47.660> easier

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
right position for it to make it easier

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.379 
right position for it to make it easier
to<00:05:47.990> come<00:05:48.260> out<00:05:50.860> we<00:05:51.860> had<00:05:52.099> a<00:05:52.400> lot<00:05:52.550> of<00:05:52.910> difficulty

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
to come out we had a lot of difficulty

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.570 
to come out we had a lot of difficulty
getting<00:05:53.419> this<00:05:53.840> out<00:05:54.020> and<00:05:54.889> we<00:05:55.039> finally<00:05:55.280> figured

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
getting this out and we finally figured

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.640 
getting this out and we finally figured
out<00:05:55.789> that<00:05:55.849> that<00:05:56.150> slide<00:05:56.690> hammer<00:05:56.960> with<00:05:57.470> that

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
out that that slide hammer with that

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.360 
out that that slide hammer with that
piece<00:05:57.979> it<00:05:58.729> came<00:05:59.030> out<00:05:59.210> in<00:05:59.450> two<00:06:00.289> seconds<00:06:00.770> it<00:06:01.280> was

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
piece it came out in two seconds it was

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.060 
piece it came out in two seconds it was
very<00:06:01.789> easy<00:06:02.289> but<00:06:03.289> it<00:06:03.380> took<00:06:03.500> us<00:06:03.620> forever<00:06:03.889> to

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
very easy but it took us forever to

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.580 
very easy but it took us forever to
figure<00:06:04.310> out<00:06:04.520> the<00:06:04.669> right<00:06:04.820> angle<00:06:05.150> so<00:06:05.560> pull<00:06:06.560> out

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
figure out the right angle so pull out

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.810 
figure out the right angle so pull out
the<00:06:06.889> CV<00:06:07.190> axle<00:06:07.510> let<00:06:08.510> it<00:06:08.630> dropped<00:06:08.930> in<00:06:09.139> an<00:06:09.260> angle

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
the CV axle let it dropped in an angle

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.490 
the CV axle let it dropped in an angle
put<00:06:10.820> that<00:06:10.970> seat<00:06:11.240> bat<00:06:11.570> slide<00:06:11.900> hammer<00:06:12.110> on<00:06:12.320> there

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
put that seat bat slide hammer on there

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.150 
put that seat bat slide hammer on there
and<00:06:13.280> it<00:06:13.370> comes<00:06:13.550> right<00:06:13.760> out

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.220
