movement will make the pan easier on

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.100

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.469 
your viewers the next advanced hand-held
movement<00:04:25.530> is<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.950> tilt<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.490> tilt<00:04:27.210> can<00:04:27.390> be

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
movement is the tilt a tilt can be

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.270 
movement is the tilt a tilt can be
achieved<00:04:27.810> in<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.050> similar<00:04:28.380> manner<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.979> pan

achieved in a similar manner to the pan

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.980 
achieved in a similar manner to the pan
but<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.060> biggest<00:04:30.300> difference<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.960> that

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
but the biggest difference is that

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.350 
but the biggest difference is that
instead<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.470> rotating<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.160> torso<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:33.150> must

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
instead of rotating the torso you must

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.930 
instead of rotating the torso you must
bend<00:04:33.539> it<00:04:33.690> forward<00:04:33.960> or<00:04:34.350> backward<00:04:35.130> depending<00:04:35.820> on

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
bend it forward or backward depending on

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.060 
bend it forward or backward depending on
the<00:04:36.060> direction<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.570> want<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.870> go<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.890> for

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
the direction you want to go and for

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.440 
the direction you want to go and for
this<00:04:38.160> movement<00:04:38.400> it's<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.760> good<00:04:38.970> idea<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.240> keep

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
this movement it's a good idea to keep

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.270 
this movement it's a good idea to keep
the<00:04:39.510> camera<00:04:39.960> as<00:04:40.110> close<00:04:40.200> to<00:04:40.650> your<00:04:40.770> upper<00:04:41.070> torso

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
the camera as close to your upper torso

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.159 
the camera as close to your upper torso
as<00:04:41.580> possible<00:04:42.090> since<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.900> will<00:04:43.020> actually

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
as possible since that will actually

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.330 
as possible since that will actually
give<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.710> greatest<00:04:43.950> tilt<00:04:44.370> distance

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.890 

probably<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.460> hardest<00:04:50.910> advanced<00:04:51.450> handheld

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
probably the hardest advanced handheld

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.350 
probably the hardest advanced handheld
movement<00:04:52.289> is<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.710> dolly<00:04:52.979> now<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:54.000> perform<00:04:54.270> a

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
movement is the dolly now to perform a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.790 
movement is the dolly now to perform a
dolly<00:04:54.570> movement<00:04:55.020> it's<00:04:55.140> best<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.470> keep<00:04:55.650> the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
dolly movement it's best to keep the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.740 
dolly movement it's best to keep the
camera<00:04:55.979> close<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.490> your<00:04:56.610> body<00:04:56.789> while<00:04:57.450> not

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
touching your torso next bend your knees

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.480 
touching your torso next bend your knees
and<00:05:00.510> walk<00:05:00.660> forward<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.289> gentle<00:05:01.710> heel<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.250> toe

and walk forward in a gentle heel to toe

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.550 
and walk forward in a gentle heel to toe
fashion<00:05:02.789> this<00:05:03.720> will<00:05:03.900> allow<00:05:04.110> you<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.289> get<00:05:04.410> rid

fashion this will allow you to get rid
of<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.770> shaky<00:05:05.039> impact<00:05:05.550> of<00:05:05.700> your<00:05:05.820> foot<00:05:06.030> hitting

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
of the shaky impact of your foot hitting

the ground as well as most of the

the ground as well as most of the
up-and-down<00:05:08.820> movement<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.510> walking

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
up-and-down movement that walking

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.560 
up-and-down movement that walking
usually<00:05:10.289> requires<00:05:10.850> that<00:05:11.850> being<00:05:12.060> said<00:05:12.270> this

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
usually requires that being said this

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.360 
usually requires that being said this
move<00:05:12.780> will<00:05:12.900> take<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.200> most<00:05:13.470> practice<00:05:14.070> of<00:05:14.220> all

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
move will take the most practice of all

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.310 
move will take the most practice of all
the<00:05:14.639> advanced<00:05:14.910> movements<00:05:15.419> but<00:05:15.990> is<00:05:16.139> usually

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
the advanced movements but is usually

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.170 
the advanced movements but is usually
worth<00:05:16.710> knowing<00:05:17.039> as<00:05:17.310> it<00:05:17.430> can<00:05:17.550> add<00:05:17.669> color<00:05:17.940> to<00:05:18.030> a

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
worth knowing as it can add color to a
