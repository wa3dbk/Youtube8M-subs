00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.769
 today we are going to make this cake that 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.240
 inside has leopard spots we're going to 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:11.639
 see how we have to do it 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.650
 to make our cake fix 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.170
 we have made cake dough and we have 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.180
 divided good this is a lot of mass here 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.869
 we have put little and here even less 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.570
 we divide it into three bodies then in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 a bowl we are throwing enough cocoa 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.020
 cocoa because we want it to be color 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.280
 chocolate and in the other we miss very little 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.800
 then we are going to remove 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.110
 Well now what we have done is 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.570
 put each of our masses in 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.690
 sleeves 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.670
 well we have put fat and flour in a 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.190
 mold 20 centimeters and have put 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.720
 a first layer of cake we 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.180
 put a first layer of sponge cake 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.010
 this is important it is important to put 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.890
 first a background of the white cake or 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.110
 yellow color that we are going to use then 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.330
 we take the dark chocolate and what 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:07.630
 we do is paint beige like that in parallel 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.690
 to our mold we make like two strips 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.729
 If our mold were square, do not 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.759
 we can do so we do it 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.330
 with round shape because the mold is 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.330
 round 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.530
 we make another one here 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.170
 here another 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.390
 We make different forms 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.390
 round 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.190
 well once we've finished with the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.860
 dark cake what we do is with the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.860
 more clear sponge cake we put on top 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.159
 and we are putting over now with the 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.509
 dark we plug this 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.509
 we are going around 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.819
 well now what we do is with manga 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.760
 we cover with the white cake because 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.439
 we do with manga then to avoid 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.439
 miss the way 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.250
 well, once we have already 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.450
 covered 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.450
 we only put it in the oven
