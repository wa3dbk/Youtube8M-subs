hundred coins Molly boy in which

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.970 
hundred coins Molly boy in which
probably<00:02:30.450> be<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.989> highest<00:02:31.440> profits

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
probably be with the highest profits

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.400 
probably be with the highest profits
we've<00:02:32.130> made<00:02:32.310> our<00:02:32.459> player<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.810> series<00:02:33.870> so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
we've made our player in this series so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.900 
we've made our player in this series so
far<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.890> we<00:02:34.980> go<00:02:35.069> back<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.250> order<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.520> pilot<00:02:35.850> a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
far so we go back to order a pilot a

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.640 
far so we go back to order a pilot a
little<00:02:36.209> bit<00:02:36.300> later<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.810> see<00:02:37.020> household

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
little bit later on and we see household

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.620 
little bit later on and we see household
we<00:02:38.100> also<00:02:38.250> sold<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.819> now<00:02:39.030> though<00:02:39.209> we<00:02:39.300> had<00:02:39.480> to

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
we also sold on now though we had to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.600 
we also sold on now though we had to
lower<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.900> price<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.260> massively<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.709> about<00:02:41.550> a

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
lower the price and massively a about a

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.100 
lower the price and massively a about a
thousand<00:02:42.030> coins<00:02:42.150> less<00:02:42.480> than<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.720> wanted<00:02:42.930> for

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
thousand coins less than I wanted for

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.930 
thousand coins less than I wanted for
him<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.290> put<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.620> stock<00:02:43.830> price<00:02:43.980> at<00:02:44.160> 2500

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
him I just put the stock price at 2500

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.250 
him I just put the stock price at 2500
and<00:02:45.030> that's<00:02:45.150> why<00:02:45.239> we<00:02:45.270> went<00:02:45.450> for<00:02:45.630> I'm<00:02:45.989> not<00:02:46.200> sure

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
and that's why we went for I'm not sure

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.360 
and that's why we went for I'm not sure
if<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.470> reason<00:02:46.650> he<00:02:46.709> wasn't<00:02:46.950> silence<00:02:47.220> because

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
if the reason he wasn't silence because

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.620 
if the reason he wasn't silence because
we're<00:02:47.550> centre-backs<00:02:48.060> as<00:02:48.269> long<00:02:48.420> as<00:02:48.540> they've

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
we're centre-backs as long as they've

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.960 
we're centre-backs as long as they've
got<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.810> fallback<00:02:49.110> formation<00:02:49.769> they<00:02:50.550> get<00:02:50.700> quite

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
got a fallback formation they get quite

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.460 
got a fallback formation they get quite
decent<00:02:51.360> chemistry<00:02:51.750> anyway<00:02:51.989> if<00:02:52.290> you're

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
decent chemistry anyway if you're

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.630 
decent chemistry anyway if you're
playing<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.800> fallback<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.459> many

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
playing with a fallback one so many

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.040 
playing with a fallback one so many
people<00:02:53.850> burn<00:02:54.030> wooden<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.390> pay<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.660> extra<00:02:54.870> for

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
people burn wooden to pay the extra for

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.840 
people burn wooden to pay the extra for
the<00:02:55.140> 412<00:02:55.440> into<00:02:55.769> when<00:02:56.340> they<00:02:56.430> could<00:02:56.580> just<00:02:56.610> use

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
the 412 into when they could just use

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.490 
the 412 into when they could just use
like<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.000> four<00:02:57.300> four<00:02:57.510> two<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.989> they're<00:02:58.290> still

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
like a four four two and they're still

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.680 
like a four four two and they're still
get<00:02:58.650> pretty<00:02:59.040> decent<00:02:59.340> chemistry<00:02:59.700> but<00:02:59.850> we<00:03:00.569> got

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
get pretty decent chemistry but we got

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.910 
get pretty decent chemistry but we got
off<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.900> do<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.019> bit<00:03:01.170> more<00:03:01.200> training<00:03:01.739> with<00:03:01.830> the

with the most the moment so i might make

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.290 
with the most the moment so i might make
this<00:03:07.380> team<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.370> first<00:03:08.489> team<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.819> Bundesliga

this team the first team I Bundesliga
team<00:03:09.420> cuz<00:03:09.569> are<00:03:09.690> some<00:03:09.870> really<00:03:10.080> really<00:03:10.290> good

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
players but you can see we go off and up

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.880 
players but you can see we go off and up
by<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.690> mullah<00:03:13.080> here<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.350> was<00:03:13.530> checking<00:03:13.739> through

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
by a mullah here I was checking through

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.350 
by a mullah here I was checking through
the<00:03:14.010> prices<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.519> before<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.060> free<00:03:15.209> one

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
the prices in before to the free one

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.550 
the prices in before to the free one
formation<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.900> was<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.050> cheaper<00:03:16.380> spy

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
formation this was a cheaper spy

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.350 
formation this was a cheaper spy
probably<00:03:17.310> about<00:03:17.430> two<00:03:17.640> thousand<00:03:18.090> coins<00:03:18.209> that

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
probably about two thousand coins that

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.880 
probably about two thousand coins that
don't<00:03:18.600> think<00:03:18.780> he<00:03:18.840> was<00:03:18.930> worse<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.470> prices<00:03:19.680> he

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
don't think he was worse the prices he

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.229 
don't think he was worse the prices he
was<00:03:20.010> going<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.549> Alyssa's<00:03:20.850> one<00:03:20.970> up<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:21.209> a

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
was going for so Alyssa's one up for a

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.420 
was going for so Alyssa's one up for a
thousand<00:03:21.690> more<00:03:21.980> hopefully<00:03:22.980> he'll<00:03:23.100> Sally's

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
thousand more hopefully he'll Sally's

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.979 
thousand more hopefully he'll Sally's
and<00:03:23.579> probably<00:03:23.880> not<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.269> great<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.810> wing

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
and probably not that great on the wing

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.240 
and probably not that great on the wing
off<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.320> would<00:03:25.590> prefer<00:03:25.739> him<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.070> middle<00:03:26.190> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
off I would prefer him in the middle of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.350 
off I would prefer him in the middle of
the<00:03:26.340> park<00:03:26.579> at<00:03:26.730> least<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:27.000> was<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.180> case<00:03:27.299> in

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
the park at least that was the case in

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.600 
the park at least that was the case in
fifa<00:03:27.720> 12<00:03:27.930> but<00:03:28.200> nevertheless<00:03:28.980> he<00:03:29.220> might<00:03:29.370> go<00:03:29.489> for

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
fifa 12 but nevertheless he might go for

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.130 
fifa 12 but nevertheless he might go for
that<00:03:29.670> price<00:03:29.880> him<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.450> crews<00:03:30.780> are<00:03:30.989> both

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
that price him and crews are both

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.240 
that price him and crews are both
playing<00:03:31.320> for<00:03:31.590> Bayern<00:03:31.739> Munich<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.130> they're

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
playing for Bayern Munich and they're

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.920 
playing for Bayern Munich and they're
both<00:03:32.340> Jim<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:32.970> when<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.570> get<00:03:33.720> players

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
both Jim and so when you get players

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.259 
both Jim and so when you get players
earlier<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.410> same<00:03:34.620> league<00:03:35.000> over<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> same

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
to trade on that much because it's a

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.840 
to trade on that much because it's a
