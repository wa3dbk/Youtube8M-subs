00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.270 
there's red down here on the inside I
don't<00:02:01.570> know<00:02:01.630> how<00:02:01.960> ideas<00:02:02.350> can<00:02:02.560> see<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.829> but<00:02:03.219> it's

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
don't know how ideas can see it but it's

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.580 
don't know how ideas can see it but it's
right<00:02:03.579> down<00:02:03.789> here<00:02:03.820> on<00:02:04.299> on<00:02:04.929> both<00:02:05.289> sides

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
right down here on on both sides

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.919 
right down here on on both sides
actually<00:02:05.950> there's<00:02:06.159> some<00:02:06.789> down<00:02:06.969> here<00:02:07.359> as<00:02:07.570> well

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
actually there's some down here as well

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.380 
actually there's some down here as well
so<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.380> adds<00:02:08.560> like<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:09.009> nice<00:02:09.220> effect<00:02:09.700> that

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
so it adds like this nice effect that

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.360 
so it adds like this nice effect that
she<00:02:10.750> has<00:02:10.960> in<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.230> movie<00:02:11.470> for<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.890> most<00:02:12.070> part<00:02:12.220> I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
she has in the movie for the most part I

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.980 
she has in the movie for the most part I
feel<00:02:12.400> like<00:02:12.610> her<00:02:12.790> dress<00:02:12.970> really<00:02:13.330> hugs<00:02:13.750> her

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
feel like her dress really hugs her

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.660 
feel like her dress really hugs her
better<00:02:14.290> than<00:02:14.500> some<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.800> other<00:02:14.920> dolls<00:02:15.220> it

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
better than some of the other dolls it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.920 
better than some of the other dolls it
may<00:02:15.820> just<00:02:15.850> be<00:02:16.030> because<00:02:16.270> she's<00:02:16.540> pinned<00:02:16.780> down

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
may just be because she's pinned down

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.750 
may just be because she's pinned down
still<00:02:17.319> right<00:02:17.470> now<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.680> haven't<00:02:18.160> taken<00:02:18.340> any<00:02:18.670> of

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
still right now and haven't taken any of

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.720 
still right now and haven't taken any of
the<00:02:18.910> tee<00:02:19.060> sheet<00:02:19.470> plastic<00:02:20.470> pieces<00:02:20.830> out<00:02:21.100> but<00:02:21.700> I

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
the tee sheet plastic pieces out but I

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.730 
the tee sheet plastic pieces out but I
feel<00:02:22.030> like<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.420> dress<00:02:22.600> really<00:02:22.900> hugs<00:02:23.500> her

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
feel like this dress really hugs her

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.170 
feel like this dress really hugs her
tighter<00:02:24.010> than<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.280> other<00:02:24.370> ones<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.940> maybe

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
tighter than the other ones and maybe

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.970 
tighter than the other ones and maybe
that's<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.870> add<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.410> effect<00:02:26.830> that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
that's just to add the effect that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.960 
that's just to add the effect that
Maleficent<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:28.030> much<00:02:28.270> thinner

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
Maleficent is that much thinner

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.790 
Maleficent is that much thinner
then<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.480> rest<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.900> villains<00:02:30.200> because<00:02:30.560> I

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
then the rest of the villains because I

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.160 
then the rest of the villains because I
believe<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.430> she's<00:02:31.940> probably<00:02:32.420> one<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
believe that she's probably one of the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.080 
believe that she's probably one of the
thinnest<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.770> all<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.280> them<00:02:34.430> most<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.760> them<00:02:34.940> are

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
thinnest of all of them most of them are

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.150 
thinnest of all of them most of them are
a<00:02:35.120> little<00:02:35.180> bit<00:02:35.480> curvier<00:02:35.840> than<00:02:35.900> Maleficent<00:02:36.530> she

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
a little bit curvier than Maleficent she

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.100 
a little bit curvier than Maleficent she
really<00:02:37.490> just<00:02:37.640> has<00:02:37.760> no<00:02:38.000> figure<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> movies

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
really just has no figure in the movies

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.660 
really just has no figure in the movies
she's<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:39.560> an<00:02:39.680> ominous<00:02:40.190> presence<00:02:40.400> of

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
she's just an ominous presence of

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.490 
she's just an ominous presence of
darkness<00:02:41.120> on<00:02:41.390> her<00:02:41.630> head<00:02:41.840> instead<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
darkness on her head instead of the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.680 
darkness on her head instead of the
spike<00:02:42.800> she<00:02:43.100> actually<00:02:43.250> has<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.880> doll<00:02:44.330> hair

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
spike she actually has the doll hair

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.110 
spike she actually has the doll hair
that's<00:02:44.930> formed<00:02:45.380> up<00:02:45.620> into<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.220> kind<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.700> updo

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
that's formed up into this kind of updo

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.940 
that's formed up into this kind of updo
shaped<00:02:47.690> like<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:47.930> horns<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.470> they're

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
shaped like the horns and they're

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.740 
shaped like the horns and they're
tightly<00:02:49.250> spun<00:02:49.790> around<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.300> looks<00:02:50.480> like<00:02:50.630> what

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
tightly spun around it looks like what

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.630 
tightly spun around it looks like what
they<00:02:50.870> did<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.170> they<00:02:51.200> took<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.620> hair<00:02:51.800> pulled<00:02:52.490> it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
they did is they took the hair pulled it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.090 
they did is they took the hair pulled it
up<00:02:52.760> into<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.690> horn<00:02:54.020> shape<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.530> then<00:02:54.590> wrap<00:02:54.830> the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
up into a horn shape and then wrap the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.830 
up into a horn shape and then wrap the
rest<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.490> hair<00:02:55.640> on<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.240> then<00:02:56.630> on<00:02:56.750> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
rest of the hair on it and then on the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.450 
rest of the hair on it and then on the
back<00:02:57.050> they've<00:02:57.440> tied<00:02:57.710> it<00:02:57.830> all<00:02:57.950> together<00:02:58.100> with

metallic<00:04:58.840> ball<00:04:59.620> that's<00:05:00.009> in<00:05:00.129> the<00:05:00.250> middle<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:01.000> it

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
metallic ball that's in the middle so it

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.760 
metallic ball that's in the middle so it
adds<00:05:01.210> its<00:05:01.479> nice<00:05:01.690> little<00:05:02.020> at<00:05:02.110> crinkled<00:05:02.469> effect

that's<00:05:10.509> into<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.169> again<00:05:11.560> like<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.889> Queen

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
that's into it and again like the Queen

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.580 
that's into it and again like the Queen
doll<00:05:12.520> her<00:05:12.909> eyelashes<00:05:13.629> are<00:05:13.779> rooted<00:05:14.199> in<00:05:14.319> and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
doll her eyelashes are rooted in and

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.830 
doll her eyelashes are rooted in and
they<00:05:15.159> are<00:05:15.400> shellacked<00:05:15.940> upwards<00:05:16.449> but<00:05:16.569> they<00:05:16.719> are

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
they are shellacked upwards but they are

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.230 
they are shellacked upwards but they are
not<00:05:17.020> shall<00:05:17.590> I<00:05:17.710> outwards<00:05:18.370> there<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:18.879> looks<00:05:19.180> like

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
not shall I outwards there it looks like

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.490 
not shall I outwards there it looks like
they're<00:05:19.539> just<00:05:19.930> going<00:05:20.319> straight<00:05:20.710> up<00:05:20.949> and<00:05:21.340> so<00:05:22.150> it

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
they're just going straight up and so it

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.040 
they're just going straight up and so it
it<00:05:23.500> just<00:05:23.770> really<00:05:24.009> adds<00:05:24.400> more<00:05:25.300> of<00:05:25.449> that<00:05:25.599> horn
