these are some rocks not bad anyways
well<00:00:36.020> this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> zero<00:00:37.530> taper<00:00:39.500> this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
well this is a zero taper this is the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.049 
well this is a zero taper this is the
double<00:00:41.250> zero<00:00:41.460> plug<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:46.399> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.789> States

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
double zero plug so this you can States

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.110 
double zero plug so this you can States
it's<00:00:48.600> definitely<00:00:49.969> double<00:00:50.969> zeros<00:00:51.360> bigger<00:00:53.120> but

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it's definitely double zeros bigger but

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.410 
it's definitely double zeros bigger but
before<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> stretch<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.410> these<00:00:56.149> since<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.239> have

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
before I stretch to these since I have

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.229 
before I stretch to these since I have
worn<00:00:57.660> these<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.350> three<00:00:59.250> months<00:00:59.430> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
and a half so I might just be making a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.260 
and a half so I might just be making a
video<00:02:01.850> for<00:02:02.179> 716<00:02:02.959> soon<00:02:03.640> because<00:02:04.640> i'm<00:02:04.819> planning

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
video for 716 soon because i'm planning

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.660 
video for 716 soon because i'm planning
to<00:02:05.330> buy<00:02:05.539> my<00:02:05.690> plugs<00:02:05.990> very<00:02:06.380> soon<00:02:06.709> I<00:02:07.009> planned<00:02:07.459> by

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
to buy my plugs very soon I planned by

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.020 
to buy my plugs very soon I planned by
silicon<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.690> because<00:02:08.959> my<00:02:09.110> ears<00:02:09.580> up<00:02:10.580> enough

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
silicon just because my ears up enough

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.250 
silicon just because my ears up enough
room<00:02:11.330> for<00:02:11.660> another<00:02:11.780> stretch<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:14.569> can<00:02:14.780> see<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
room for another stretch you can see the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.390 
room for another stretch you can see the
plug<00:02:15.590> moves<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:16.959> just<00:02:17.959> moves<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:19.130> very

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
plug moves in just moves like very

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.110 
plug moves in just moves like very
easily<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.950> if<00:02:21.950> there's<00:02:22.190> enough<00:02:22.549> room<00:02:22.580> for

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
easily so if there's enough room for

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.670 
easily so if there's enough room for
another<00:02:23.870> stretch<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.989> end<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.319> think<00:02:27.350> I

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
another stretch so in the end I think I

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.820 
another stretch so in the end I think I
might<00:02:27.920> be<00:02:28.040> going<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.400> half-inch<00:02:28.730> not<00:02:29.239> sure<00:02:29.420> yet

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
might be going to half-inch not sure yet

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.630 
might be going to half-inch not sure yet
we'll<00:02:30.830> see<00:02:31.010> how<00:02:31.040> thick<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:31.549> its<00:02:31.700> extensive<00:02:32.299> and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
we'll see how thick so its extensive and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.780 
we'll see how thick so its extensive and
yeah<00:02:35.079> i'll<00:02:36.079> show<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.320> guys<00:02:36.530> hold<00:02:37.280> my<00:02:37.459> bug<00:02:39.790> that
