we<00:00:22.810> like<00:00:22.990> EPDM<00:00:23.650> because<00:00:24.369> it's<00:00:24.550> very<00:00:24.670> durable

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
we like EPDM because it's very durable

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.260 
we like EPDM because it's very durable
last<00:00:26.020> very<00:00:26.470> long<00:00:26.740> time<00:00:27.010> and<00:00:27.400> also<00:00:27.730> it's<00:00:27.939> easy

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
last very long time and also it's easy

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.600 
last very long time and also it's easy
for<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.779> roofers<00:00:29.170> to<00:00:29.380> use<00:00:29.590> some<00:00:30.430> of<00:00:30.550> the

systems if they get over complicated the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.830 
systems if they get over complicated the
roofers<00:00:33.040> can<00:00:33.280> make<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.820> mess<00:00:34.120> out<00:00:34.329> of<00:00:34.360> them

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
roofers can make a mess out of them

beep EDM is very easy for them to get
right<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.170> first<00:00:38.379> time<00:00:42.629> starting<00:00:43.629> early<00:00:43.930> with

Carlile<00:00:44.530> we<00:00:44.830> helped<00:00:45.160> them<00:00:45.280> pioneer<00:00:45.879> some<00:00:46.150> of

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
Carlile we helped them pioneer some of

Carlile we helped them pioneer some of
the<00:00:46.360> systems<00:00:46.809> in<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:47.500> beginning<00:00:47.860> it<00:00:48.670> seems

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
the systems in the beginning it seems

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.570 
the systems in the beginning it seems
weird<00:00:49.780> if<00:00:50.260> they<00:00:50.350> were<00:00:50.559> done<00:00:50.860> perfectly<00:00:51.400> they

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
weird if they were done perfectly they

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.579 
weird if they were done perfectly they
worked<00:00:51.820> well<00:00:52.059> if<00:00:52.300> there<00:00:52.510> was<00:00:52.720> some<00:00:53.019> negligence

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
worked well if there was some negligence

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:54.990 
worked well if there was some negligence
on<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.860> part<00:00:53.890> of<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.250> contractor<00:00:54.879> they

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
on the part of the contractor they

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.400 
on the part of the contractor they
didn't<00:00:55.210> work<00:00:55.360> so<00:00:55.390> well

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
didn't work so well

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.069 
didn't work so well

beep<00:01:02.770> EDM<00:01:03.190> came<00:01:03.520> out<00:01:03.699> with<00:01:04.000> rough<00:01:04.750> strips<00:01:05.080> that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
beep EDM came out with rough strips that

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.620 
beep EDM came out with rough strips that
hold<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.280> rubber<00:01:06.430> tight<00:01:06.789> to<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.060> wall<00:01:07.090> and

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
hold the rubber tight to the wall and

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.160 
hold the rubber tight to the wall and
also<00:01:08.500> taped<00:01:09.369> seams<00:01:09.700> in<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.600> old<00:01:10.750> days<00:01:10.960> of

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
also taped seams in the old days of

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.650 
also taped seams in the old days of
roofers<00:01:11.649> were<00:01:11.830> a<00:01:11.890> little<00:01:12.039> bit<00:01:12.340> wax<00:01:13.060> on<00:01:13.390> their

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
roofers were a little bit wax on their

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.510 
roofers were a little bit wax on their
application<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.770> glue<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.190> didn't<00:01:15.399> get

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
application of the glue and didn't get

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.249 
application of the glue and didn't get
enough<00:01:15.729> glue<00:01:15.940> down<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.270> cause<00:01:16.479> seam<00:01:16.810> problems

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
enough glue down to cause seam problems

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.919 
enough glue down to cause seam problems
but<00:01:17.890> as<00:01:18.009> I<00:01:18.039> always<00:01:18.280> say<00:01:18.610> 50<00:01:19.060> feet<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.390> tape<00:01:19.570> only

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
but as I always say 50 feet of tape only

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.279 
but as I always say 50 feet of tape only
goes<00:01:20.110> 50<00:01:20.500> feet<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.460> it's<00:01:21.820> improved<00:01:22.780> quality<00:01:23.050> a

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
goes 50 feet so it's improved quality a

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.460 
goes 50 feet so it's improved quality a
lot<00:01:23.530> also<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.640> contractors<00:01:25.360> are<00:01:25.720> able<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.259> do

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
lot also the contractors are able to do

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.160 
lot also the contractors are able to do
these<00:01:26.710> seams<00:01:27.130> very<00:01:28.000> easily<00:01:28.299> without<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:28.930> lot<00:01:29.140> of

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
these seams very easily without a lot of

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.230 
these seams very easily without a lot of
training<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.860> they<00:01:30.100> stick<00:01:30.430> every<00:01:30.700> time<00:01:30.970> and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
training and they stick every time and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.350 
training and they stick every time and
last<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.630> very<00:01:31.659> long<00:01:31.960> time

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.990 

well<00:01:37.750> after<00:01:38.080> observing<00:01:38.710> EPDM<00:01:39.310> for<00:01:39.550> over<00:01:39.760> 30

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
well after observing EPDM for over 30

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.960 
well after observing EPDM for over 30
years<00:01:40.120> it<00:01:40.870> performs<00:01:41.530> very<00:01:41.680> well<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.730> it

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
years it performs very well and it

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.000 
years it performs very well and it
performs<00:01:43.450> well<00:01:43.540> in<00:01:43.720> all<00:01:44.110> climates<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.860> I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
performs well in all climates that I

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.130 
performs well in all climates that I
know<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.460> in<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:46.060> north<00:01:46.330> being<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.900> black

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
know of in the north being a black

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.350 
know of in the north being a black
membrane<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:48.010> believe<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.670> helps<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.210> roof

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
membrane I believe it helps the roof

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.510 
membrane I believe it helps the roof
insulation<00:01:49.720> get<00:01:50.230> warmed<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:50.950> daytime<00:01:51.460> so

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
insulation get warmed in the daytime so

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.310 
insulation get warmed in the daytime so
at<00:01:51.940> night<00:01:52.120> it<00:01:52.300> has<00:01:52.450> some<00:01:52.690> of<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:52.840> heat<00:01:53.170> to

at night it has some of that heat to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
at night it has some of that heat to
retain<00:01:54.210> EPDM<00:01:55.210> has<00:01:55.720> been<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.080> perfect<00:01:56.530> performer

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
retain EPDM has been a perfect performer

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.850 
retain EPDM has been a perfect performer
in<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.670> north<00:02:00.300> this<00:02:01.300> roof<00:02:01.570> was<00:02:01.780> installed<00:02:02.020> 31

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
in the north this roof was installed 31

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.440 
in the north this roof was installed 31
years<00:02:03.130> ago<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.580> was<00:02:03.700> one<00:02:03.850> of<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.060> earliest

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
years ago it was one of the earliest

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.320 
years ago it was one of the earliest
EPDM<00:02:05.140> roofs<00:02:05.410> put<00:02:05.680> on<00:02:05.800> in<00:02:05.920> this<00:02:06.040> area<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.940> is<00:02:07.060> in

EPDM roofs put on in this area it is in
medical<00:02:07.690> facilities<00:02:07.870> so<00:02:08.500> they<00:02:08.530> wanted<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.130> good

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
medical facilities so they wanted a good

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.630 
medical facilities so they wanted a good
roof<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:10.330> has<00:02:10.690> been<00:02:10.990> a<00:02:11.200> superior<00:02:11.980> performing

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
roof this has been a superior performing

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.030 
roof this has been a superior performing
roof<00:02:12.850> because<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.510> has<00:02:13.690> great<00:02:14.080> slopes<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
roof because it has great slopes the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.740 
roof because it has great slopes the
deck<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.520> lightweight<00:02:15.850> insulating

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
deck is a lightweight insulating

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.050 
deck is a lightweight insulating
