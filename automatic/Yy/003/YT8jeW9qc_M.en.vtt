00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.000 

in<00:01:26.900> this<00:01:27.110> game<00:01:27.230> you're<00:01:27.470> going<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.650> be<00:01:27.740> putting

you know faces and faces with the nose
and<00:01:36.050> there's<00:01:36.590> all<00:01:36.710> sorts<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.190> different

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.340 
and there's all sorts of different
pieces<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.120> they're<00:01:38.210> really<00:01:38.450> thick<00:01:38.810> tiles<00:01:39.080> I

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
pieces and they're really thick tiles I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.980 
pieces and they're really thick tiles I
mean<00:01:39.500> these<00:01:39.590> are<00:01:39.770> really<00:01:40.120> good<00:01:41.120> quality<00:01:41.570> tiles

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
mean these are really good quality tiles

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.870 
mean these are really good quality tiles
and<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:42.740> as<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.950> game<00:01:43.130> progresses<00:01:43.580> you're

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
and so as the game progresses you're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.850 
and so as the game progresses you're
going<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.210> build<00:01:44.450> different<00:01:44.860> monsters

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
going to build different monsters

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.410 
going to build different monsters
there's<00:01:46.100> actually<00:01:46.460> monsters<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.060> are<00:01:47.120> just

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
there's actually monsters that are just

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.570 
there's actually monsters that are just
one<00:01:47.840> tile<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:48.950> take<00:01:49.070> these<00:01:49.190> out<00:01:49.370> if<00:01:49.490> you

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
one tile you can take these out if you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.150 
one tile you can take these out if you
don't<00:01:49.640> like<00:01:49.940> randomness<00:01:50.480> and<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:51.410> would<00:01:51.650> very

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
don't like randomness and I would very

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.400 
don't like randomness and I would very
much<00:01:52.250> recommend<00:01:52.550> that<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.120> do<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:53.630> but<00:01:54.260> you

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
much recommend that you do so but you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.260 
much recommend that you do so but you
can<00:01:54.560> have<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.980> know<00:01:55.100> really<00:01:55.280> small<00:01:55.729> creatures

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
can have you know really small creatures

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.750 
can have you know really small creatures
like<00:01:56.720> for<00:01:56.960> example<00:01:57.130> see<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:58.310> guy<00:01:58.460> he's<00:01:58.729> just

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
like for example see this guy he's just

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.390 
like for example see this guy he's just
ears<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.390> head<00:01:59.690> and<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.050> body<00:02:00.260> or<00:02:00.590> maybe

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
ears a head and a body or maybe

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.860 
ears a head and a body or maybe
creatures<00:02:01.820> that<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.000> little<00:02:02.300> bit<00:02:02.390> bigger<00:02:02.660> than

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
creatures that a little bit bigger than

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.590 
creatures that a little bit bigger than
that<00:02:02.930> now<00:02:03.320> we're<00:02:03.710> going<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.860> add<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:04.220> nose<00:02:04.670> to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
that now we're going to add a nose to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.960 
that now we're going to add a nose to
this<00:02:05.810> guy<00:02:06.020> here<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.250> nose<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:07.850> sure

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
this guy here that is a nose for sure

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.790 
this guy here that is a nose for sure
and<00:02:08.330> then<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.020> can<00:02:09.200> go<00:02:09.320> all<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.500> way<00:02:09.530> up<00:02:09.649> to

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
and then you can go all the way up to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.920 
and then you can go all the way up to
the<00:02:09.830> larger<00:02:10.340> size<00:02:10.550> creatures<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.690> have<00:02:11.900> a

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
the larger size creatures that have a

part a back part a tail ahead a nose and
ears<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.480> have<00:02:20.570> all<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.930> together

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
ears and so you have all that together

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.330 
ears and so you have all that together
it<00:02:21.320> makes<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.620> very<00:02:21.650> that's<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
it makes it very that's this is the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.640 
it makes it very that's this is the
biggest<00:02:22.550> size<00:02:22.880> creature<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.720> get<00:02:23.930> now

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
biggest size creature you can get now

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.720 
biggest size creature you can get now
when<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.890> finish<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.220> creature<00:02:25.490> you're<00:02:25.610> going

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
when you finish a creature you're going

when you finish a creature you're going
to<00:02:25.790> get<00:02:25.850> points<00:02:26.209> equal<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.660> value<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.930> that

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
to get points equal to the value of that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.720 
to get points equal to the value of that
creature<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.700> 4<00:02:29.120> 6<00:02:29.840> 7<00:02:30.350> 8<00:02:30.709> 9<00:02:30.739> 10<00:02:31.010> 11<00:02:31.400> 12

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
creature so this is 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.270 
creature so this is 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.130 
back and you can't do weird things at
least<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:40.580> version<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.269> game<00:02:41.390> you

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
least in this version of the game you

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.009 
least in this version of the game you
can't<00:02:42.410> put<00:02:42.650> like<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> head<00:02:43.489> on<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.820> tail<00:02:44.090> that's

can't put like a head on the tail that's

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.449 
can't put like a head on the tail that's
not<00:02:45.230> possible<00:02:45.500> they're<00:02:45.830> not<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.070> right<00:02:46.220> size

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
not possible they're not the right size

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.110 
not possible they're not the right size
anyway<00:02:47.090> now<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.959> go<00:02:48.830> for<00:02:49.070> trying<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.970> get

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
anyway now you can go for trying to get

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120 
anyway now you can go for trying to get
one<00:02:50.390> that's<00:02:50.510> all<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.900> same<00:02:51.080> colors<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:51.950> let's

one that's all the same colors so let's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.870 
one that's all the same colors so let's
say<00:02:52.280> for<00:02:52.459> example<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:53.230> put<00:02:54.230> together<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:55.670> one

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
say for example I put together this one

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.330 
say for example I put together this one
here<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:58.510> it's<00:02:59.510> all<00:02:59.900> yellow<00:03:00.530> well<00:03:01.160> because

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
here and it's all yellow well because

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.310 
here and it's all yellow well because
it's<00:03:01.610> all<00:03:01.820> yellow<00:03:02.180> I'm<00:03:02.510> going<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.870> get<00:03:03.050> extra

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
it's all yellow I'm going to get extra

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.740 
it's all yellow I'm going to get extra

that you do as the game goes by and this

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.710 
that you do as the game goes by and this
somewhat<00:05:18.470> confusing<00:05:19.370> scoring<00:05:20.180> track<00:05:20.450> when

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
somewhat confusing scoring track when

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.820 
somewhat confusing scoring track when
you<00:05:20.810> make<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:20.960> scoring<00:05:21.290> track<00:05:21.440> you<00:05:21.560> should<00:05:21.710> make

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
you make a scoring track you should make

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.110 
you make a scoring track you should make
it<00:05:21.919> confusing<00:05:22.130> man<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.669> follow<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:23.000> numbers

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
it confusing man you follow the numbers

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.520 
it confusing man you follow the numbers
but<00:05:23.450> this<00:05:23.540> one's<00:05:23.750> a<00:05:23.810> little<00:05:23.900> busy<00:05:24.290> for<00:05:24.440> my

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
but this one's a little busy for my

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.350 
but this one's a little busy for my
taste<00:05:24.800> but<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.669> what<00:05:25.820> it<00:05:25.850> is<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.060> it's<00:05:26.300> a

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
taste but it is what it is and it's a

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.880 
taste but it is what it is and it's a
way<00:05:26.479> to<00:05:26.540> keep<00:05:26.690> track<00:05:26.870> of<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.140> points<00:05:27.500> there's

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
way to keep track of the points there's

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.710 
way to keep track of the points there's
a<00:05:27.950> little<00:05:28.070> bit<00:05:28.280> more<00:05:28.580> than<00:05:29.000> that<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.540> rule

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
a little bit more than that the rule

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.530 
a little bit more than that the rule
book<00:05:29.960> almost<00:05:30.440> seems<00:05:30.800> too<00:05:31.310> complex<00:05:32.150> for<00:05:32.300> what

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
book almost seems too complex for what

book almost seems too complex for what
it<00:05:32.660> is<00:05:32.750> what<00:05:32.960> i<00:05:32.990> mean<00:05:33.169> is<00:05:33.200> Rho<00:05:33.530> bugs<00:05:33.710> like<00:05:33.860> what

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
it is what i mean is Rho bugs like what

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.980 
it is what i mean is Rho bugs like what
you<00:05:34.550> can<00:05:34.700> connect<00:05:34.940> this<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.330> is<00:05:35.450> and<00:05:35.720> not<00:05:35.810> this

you can connect this it is and not this
it<00:05:36.200> is<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.530> I'm<00:05:36.620> thinking<00:05:36.830> who<00:05:37.100> cares<00:05:37.430> does<00:05:38.030> it

are that frenzied over how the game

are that frenzied over how the game
plays<00:05:41.830> you're<00:05:42.830> disconnecting<00:05:43.430> creatures<00:05:43.790> and

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
plays you're disconnecting creatures and

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.560 
plays you're disconnecting creatures and
having<00:05:43.970> fun<00:05:44.419> doing<00:05:44.720> it<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:46.430> you<00:05:46.970> know<00:05:47.090> as

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
having fun doing it and the you know as

having fun doing it and the you know as
I<00:05:47.720> said<00:05:47.750> in<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:47.990> beginning<00:05:48.110> this<00:05:48.470> isn't<00:05:48.800> a

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
I said in the beginning this isn't a

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.350 
I said in the beginning this isn't a
game<00:05:48.979> I<00:05:49.039> would<00:05:49.190> ever<00:05:49.400> sit<00:05:49.580> around<00:05:49.760> my<00:05:49.970> gaming

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
game I would ever sit around my gaming

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.730 
game I would ever sit around my gaming
play<00:05:50.719> but<00:05:50.900> it's<00:05:51.020> certainly<00:05:51.169> a<00:05:51.349> game<00:05:51.500> I<00:05:51.590> could

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
play but it's certainly a game I could

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.469 
play but it's certainly a game I could
play<00:05:51.830> with<00:05:51.889> my<00:05:52.009> family<00:05:52.280> I<00:05:52.580> think<00:05:53.090> the<00:05:53.150> tiles

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
play with my family I think the tiles

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.390 
play with my family I think the tiles
are<00:05:53.569> very<00:05:53.870> high-quality<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.979> way<00:05:55.099> they<00:05:55.219> fit

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
are very high-quality the way they fit

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.129 
are very high-quality the way they fit
together<00:05:55.490> is<00:05:55.849> super<00:05:56.240> fraud<00:05:56.479> it's<00:05:56.719> really<00:05:56.990> cool

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
together is super fraud it's really cool

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.570 
together is super fraud it's really cool
to<00:05:57.199> see<00:05:57.409> all<00:05:57.439> the<00:05:57.620> different<00:05:57.680> creatures<00:05:58.250> it's

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
to see all the different creatures it's

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.240 
to see all the different creatures it's
an<00:05:58.729> not<00:05:59.180> dr.<00:05:59.659> Seuss<00:05:59.990> but<00:06:00.289> it's<00:06:00.409> close<00:06:00.680> to<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:00.889> dr.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
an not dr. Seuss but it's close to a dr.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.219 
an not dr. Seuss but it's close to a dr.

Seuss vibe in fact a dr. Seuss theme

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.369 
Seuss vibe in fact a dr. Seuss theme
would<00:06:03.439> fit<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:03.919> great<00:06:04.280> on<00:06:04.400> this<00:06:04.780> but<00:06:05.780> it<00:06:05.960> has

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:06.379 
would fit so great on this but it has

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:07.839 
would fit so great on this but it has
that<00:06:06.560> cool<00:06:06.830> feature<00:06:07.069> to<00:06:07.250> it<00:06:07.310> that<00:06:07.460> there's<00:06:07.699> one

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
that cool feature to it that there's one

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.760 
that cool feature to it that there's one
big<00:06:07.909> negative<00:06:08.659> I<00:06:08.900> mean<00:06:09.379> I<00:06:09.409> mentioned<00:06:09.710> the

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
big negative I mean I mentioned the

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.350 
big negative I mean I mentioned the
scoreboard<00:06:10.219> that's<00:06:10.639> minor<00:06:10.879> but<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.210> big

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
scoreboard that's minor but the big

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.029 
scoreboard that's minor but the big
negative<00:06:11.780> is<00:06:11.900> that<00:06:12.229> the<00:06:12.319> different<00:06:12.620> colors

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
negative is that the different colors

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.010 
negative is that the different colors
themselves<00:06:13.849> don't<00:06:14.449> have<00:06:14.599> some<00:06:14.780> sort<00:06:14.960> of

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
themselves don't have some sort of

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.899 
themselves don't have some sort of
pattern<00:06:15.349> in<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.770> background<00:06:16.250> so<00:06:16.729> that<00:06:16.759> you

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
pattern in the background so that you

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.309 
pattern in the background so that you
can<00:06:17.090> tell<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.300> difference<00:06:17.569> between<00:06:17.599> magenta

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
can tell the difference between magenta

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.740 
can tell the difference between magenta
and<00:06:18.680> blue<00:06:19.250> and<00:06:19.400> yellow<00:06:19.580> now<00:06:20.210> they're<00:06:20.389> not<00:06:20.509> that

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
and blue and yellow now they're not that

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.390 
and blue and yellow now they're not that
easily<00:06:21.020> mixed<00:06:21.650> up<00:06:21.800> for<00:06:22.009> folks<00:06:22.219> who<00:06:22.340> are

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
easily mixed up for folks who are

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.309 
easily mixed up for folks who are
colorblind<00:06:22.610> but<00:06:23.000> still<00:06:23.389> that's<00:06:23.629> their<00:06:23.719> it's<00:06:24.080> I

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
colorblind but still that's their it's I

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.350 
colorblind but still that's their it's I
would<00:06:24.979> have<00:06:25.069> added<00:06:25.219> a<00:06:25.370> different<00:06:25.669> pattern<00:06:25.849> to

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
would have added a different pattern to

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.679 
would have added a different pattern to
differentiate<00:06:27.080> between<00:06:27.199> them<00:06:27.560> also<00:06:27.770> I<00:06:28.689> think

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
differentiate between them also I think

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:32.019 
differentiate between them also I think
it's<00:06:29.960> great<00:06:30.139> the<00:06:30.590> artwork<00:06:30.860> is<00:06:31.099> real<00:06:31.370> clean<00:06:31.789> and

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
it's great the artwork is real clean and

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.240 
it's great the artwork is real clean and
simple<00:06:32.210> so<00:06:32.629> it's<00:06:33.080> easy<00:06:33.259> to<00:06:33.349> put<00:06:33.590> together<00:06:33.680> it's

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
simple so it's easy to put together it's

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.070 
simple so it's easy to put together it's
easy<00:06:34.400> a<00:06:34.520> different<00:06:34.990> differentiate<00:06:35.990> between

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
easy a different differentiate between

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.899 
easy a different differentiate between
the<00:06:36.289> back<00:06:36.500> of<00:06:36.680> the<00:06:36.740> front<00:06:36.919> if<00:06:37.129> anything<00:06:37.669> I

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
the back of the front if anything I

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:39.490 
the back of the front if anything I
might<00:06:38.029> have<00:06:38.090> added<00:06:38.300> even<00:06:38.509> more<00:06:38.659> silly<00:06:39.199> stuff

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
might have added even more silly stuff

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.589 
might have added even more silly stuff
although<00:06:39.710> there's<00:06:39.949> a<00:06:40.039> little<00:06:40.219> mini<00:06:40.879> expansion

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
although there's a little mini expansion

for it almost is not the game but to

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:52.600 
for it almost is not the game but to
