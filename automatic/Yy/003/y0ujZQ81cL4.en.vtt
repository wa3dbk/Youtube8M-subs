the abandoned mill is an infection map

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.110 
the abandoned mill is an infection map
which<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.530> based<00:01:26.860> off<00:01:27.040> of<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.310> real<00:01:27.490> marrow<00:01:27.760> mill

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
which is based off of a real marrow mill

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.600 
which is based off of a real marrow mill
where<00:01:28.480> I<00:01:28.510> live<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.050> as<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.470> can<00:01:29.620> see<00:01:29.830> I've

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
done my best to try to match up shots

done my best to try to match up shots
that<00:01:32.380> I've<00:01:32.470> taken<00:01:32.710> in<00:01:32.950> game<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:33.490> in<00:01:33.730> real<00:01:33.790> life

you<00:01:38.920> can<00:01:39.070> see<00:01:39.220> my<00:01:39.430> version<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.910> mill<00:01:40.060> now

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
you can see my version of the mill now

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.870 
you can see my version of the mill now
I've<00:01:41.110> tried<00:01:41.560> my<00:01:41.770> best<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:42.220> try<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.430> match<00:01:42.700> these

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
I've tried my best to try to match these

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.730 
I've tried my best to try to match these
up<00:01:42.940> as<00:01:43.210> perfect<00:01:43.570> as<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:43.750> can<00:01:43.810> but<00:01:44.350> obviously

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
up as perfect as I can but obviously

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.770 
up as perfect as I can but obviously
there<00:01:45.040> was<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.190> kind<00:01:45.760> of<00:01:45.790> some<00:01:46.030> limitations<00:01:46.660> of

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
there was a kind of some limitations of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.210 
there was a kind of some limitations of
what<00:01:46.900> I<00:01:46.930> couldn't<00:01:47.290> couldn't<00:01:47.560> do<00:01:47.680> with<00:01:48.190> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
what I couldn't couldn't do with the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.250 
what I couldn't couldn't do with the
mill<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:48.790> from<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.510> what<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:49.780> did<00:01:49.870> with<00:01:50.080> was

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
mill so from that what I did with was

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.810 
mill so from that what I did with was
the<00:01:50.380> mill<00:01:50.560> was<00:01:50.710> I<00:01:50.740> selected<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.340> three<00:01:51.370> best

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
the mill was I selected the three best

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.600 
the mill was I selected the three best
rooms<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.420> would<00:01:52.660> really<00:01:53.560> match<00:01:53.890> what<00:01:54.190> halo

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
rooms that would really match what halo

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.880 
rooms that would really match what halo
was<00:01:54.880> capable<00:01:55.120> of<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:55.780> from<00:01:56.260> there<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.470> built

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
was capable of and from there I built

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.920 
was capable of and from there I built
them<00:01:57.070> now<00:01:57.460> they're<00:01:57.760> not<00:01:57.940> specifically<00:01:58.720> in<00:01:58.840> the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
them now they're not specifically in the

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.930 
them now they're not specifically in the
correct<00:01:59.260> order<00:01:59.530> as<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.010> mill<00:02:00.190> actually<00:02:00.460> shows

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
correct order as the mill actually shows

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.030 
correct order as the mill actually shows
or<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.270> mill<00:02:01.660> actually<00:02:01.870> is<00:02:02.170> but<00:02:02.620> two<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:02.950> the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
or a mill actually is but two of the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.700 
or a mill actually is but two of the
three<00:02:03.280> are<00:02:03.460> but<00:02:04.420> as<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.750> can<00:02:04.840> see<00:02:04.900> they're

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
three are but as you can see they're

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.400 
three are but as you can see they're
pretty<00:02:06.220> similar<00:02:06.640> as<00:02:07.240> for<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.870> rooms<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.230> went

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
pretty similar as for the rooms I went

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.590 
pretty similar as for the rooms I went
now<00:02:08.500> not<00:02:08.679> all<00:02:08.800> doors<00:02:09.100> are<00:02:09.280> similar<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.390> where

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
now not all doors are similar and where

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.210 
now not all doors are similar and where
windows<00:02:10.960> are<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.410> needed<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.860> switch<00:02:12.100> it

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
windows are but I needed to switch it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.140 
windows are but I needed to switch it
around<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.520> little<00:02:12.580> bit<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:13.000> make<00:02:13.090> it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
around a little bit to make it

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.480 
around a little bit to make it
compatible<00:02:13.600> for<00:02:13.840> halo<00:02:14.260> as<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.100> can<00:02:15.190> see<00:02:15.340> right

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
compatible for halo as you can see right

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.340 
compatible for halo as you can see right
here<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:16.000> try<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.450> take<00:02:16.630> two<00:02:16.840> screenshots<00:02:17.320> so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
here I try to take two screenshots so

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.540 
here I try to take two screenshots so
they're<00:02:17.500> similar<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.950> I've<00:02:18.010> kind<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.220> faded

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
they're similar and I've kind of faded

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.830 
they're similar and I've kind of faded
them<00:02:18.640> together<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.180> little<00:02:19.480> editing

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
them together and it's a little editing

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.780 
them together and it's a little editing
work<00:02:19.959> but<00:02:20.560> nonetheless<00:02:21.040> let's<00:02:21.430> jump<00:02:21.640> right

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
work but nonetheless let's jump right

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.770 
work but nonetheless let's jump right
