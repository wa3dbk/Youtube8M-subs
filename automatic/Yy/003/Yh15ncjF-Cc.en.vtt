a little bit of a closer of all these

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.729 
a little bit of a closer of all these
little<00:02:34.239> features<00:02:34.689> that<00:02:34.810> are<00:02:34.930> going<00:02:35.079> on<00:02:35.319> but

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
little features that are going on but

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.619 
little features that are going on but
like<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:35.890> say<00:02:36.159> that<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.640> latex<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.209> really

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
like I say that the latex is really

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.229 
like I say that the latex is really
really<00:02:37.780> tacky<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.610> thumb<00:02:39.819> you've<00:02:40.060> got

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
really tacky on the thumb you've got

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.710 
really tacky on the thumb you've got
surround<00:02:40.930> firm<00:02:41.620> with<00:02:41.829> it<00:02:41.950> stitches<00:02:42.849> with<00:02:43.599> an

surround firm with it stitches with an
inseam<00:02:44.170> there<00:02:44.409> so<00:02:44.530> you've<00:02:44.620> got<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.739> negative

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
inseam there so you've got a negative

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.300

it's got the fang wishing Brandon on
there<00:03:02.109> and<00:03:02.500> then<00:03:03.209> obviously<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.480> key<00:03:04.659> feature

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
there and then obviously the key feature

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.839 
there and then obviously the key feature
is<00:03:05.079> that<00:03:05.200> it's<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.799> surround<00:03:06.159> cup<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.670> wrap

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
is that it's a surround cup so the wrap

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.210 
is that it's a surround cup so the wrap
the<00:03:07.000> latex<00:03:07.389> comes<00:03:07.690> around<00:03:07.989> as<00:03:08.079> bumpy's<00:03:08.500> it

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
the latex comes around as bumpy's it

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.039 
the latex comes around as bumpy's it
wraps<00:03:09.459> around<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.879> outside<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:10.569> hands<00:03:10.930> or
