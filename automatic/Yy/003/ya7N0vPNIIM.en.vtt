00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
 [Music] 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.469
 wait for what that does not come 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.570
 the joke comes device ever heard 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.700
 what what do already heard the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.750
 play and the heard never heard 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.860
 never pointed that could be too 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.730
 song of me his play fun on 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.260
 [Music] 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:37.489
 or maybe I'm just pointed 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:39.320
 beware, I'm on the top of lalala 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.380
 Platzspitz except for actually quite 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.059
 Just play it works like 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.170
 follow here below the hat off is located 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.629
 the need to tip game watch 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:56.180
 he comes here on the black point 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.830
 while one must try the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.379
 The other person has to make a point of pulling away 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.559
 try with the hat on the tips too 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.300
 but only catch if I have a one 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.240
 or a six dice i would be in here 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.760
 This glass rhein should be a 1 or 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.979
 a six come yes then tries the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.650
 to pull off a speci 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.700
 See the others to catch him 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.159
 move away or expenses 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.110
 because only a 5 is here or a 4 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.210
 or 3 or a 2 and then have them 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.450
 then awaken get the opponent to the point 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.680
 when the catch de 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.720
 that bit down skin though that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.830
 theme 1 or no 6 is also the one 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.670
 opponent introduction and that is 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.550
 probably for the height 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.270
 you have to gallows up with this hand 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.610
 touch 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.530
 yes and only then you can of course 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.910
 if you believe the number to recognize 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.570
 because that will be here in this 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.800
 Of course you can turn a glass of something 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.860
 start every two times changes the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.540
 so if we play two games 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.850
 So it has been played twice 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.240
 pulled away or caught then he gets 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.800
 others the pointed and the opponent that is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.420
 no matter if that has to hold on now 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.070
 just back again 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.269
 You should be stuck in this place 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.959
 not too close 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.720
 okay okay so i have a coin here 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.769
 and I decide now I thought 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.830
 of course not drive 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.390
 but I wanted to make you decide 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.629
 Now for the first time by coin you are blue 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.739
 yes you are you do not know who is leaving and 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.810
 who gets the video so good if blue 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.310
 comes then you pull out first if 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.850
 red comes then you see first away 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.870
 so far that comes first away that remains 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.579
 as it is 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.540
 so please only the games hand on the 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.200
 table 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.359
 Ok, and that's what I'm talking about 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.299
 keep the violins first 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.489
 The winner of this game has nine points 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.780
 okay okay i did not have to on that either 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:03:09.730
 watch dice 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:15.180
 but not only at 16 now so one 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:18.609
 round trip thanks ok, the easiest and again 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.079
 yes that's good that was the slow motion 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.239
 It is my goal says so slowly was there 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:34.810
 but not or 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:36.389
 I am not in any case a hope 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.590
 another point by point is next 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.389
 the game machine but i believe it 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.720
 harder really someone 2 10 o'clock 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:46.599
 starts a bit with me, I ask 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.159
 the thing here is that the girl with me 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:56.290
 that or not exactly 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:57.110
 check there I did not okay 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:04.250
 so yes 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:05.200
 okay it goes on only at 1 and 6 a 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.590
 third point 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.590
 [Applause] 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.220
 obviously a piece is very 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.220
 responsive 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.410
 point 14 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.479
 so now we have now again 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:31.280
 after twice again so it stands 4 to 0 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.350
 for axel who has only nine points 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.000
 wins the game very briefly only the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.440
 players please on the table only the 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.090
 Do not play at the table we want 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:47.980
 you stay well paying attention says 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:50.560
 axel or action faster 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.120
 [Applause] 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.710
 [Music] 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.980
 You can do both at the same time 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.980
 see 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:01.029
 Where 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.640
 [Music] 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.209
 [Music] 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:32.539
 Today , going away very well 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:37.840
 yes change again 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:41.440
 it is 6 to 0 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.440
 a hand asks 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:53.760
 [Music] 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.769
 Yes 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.300
 the reaction time at the wendler increases 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.470
 wish you left 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.470
 [Music] 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.140
 ok you will always that one 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:17.009
 slightly irritated bad times 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.900
 I've heard 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:21.300
 seven to zero is still two 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.689
 points then axel would have this game 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.689
 to lose 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.920
 [Music] 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:39.820
 [Applause] 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:43.810
 and almost always change so well 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:47.800
 seldom axel it now manages to move away 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.690
 Axel has found the game pointed that 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.639
 but who knows? 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.639
 Wendler again with the baby added 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.460
 [Music] 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.550
 if he touches the ground then it works 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.550
 Not 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.470
 [Applause] 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.860
 [Music] 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.860
 Yes 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:31.110
 we're going around 50 now is always 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.110
 play 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:40.150
 she clearly showed who in 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:42.790
 in terms of reaction time is better but it 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.140
 is not over yet there are still 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.580
 many play completely different games 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.100
 skills demand we look at them 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:51.010
 the score according to spitz take care 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:54.510
 and he is not happy axel goes with 5 

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:59.650
 1 in leadership 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:06.940
 Travens right left okay she has too 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:09.340
 would have been a bit first ripe 

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.500
 I almost said there pops in the 

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.850
 gang in so too late on the brake 

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.800
 been 

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.240
 on the engine still probably rather runs 

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.410
 yet and the course must first 

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.410
 be restored immediately
