 Five're not built gotta add now 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.110
 The word top is added to the third, so now the third one is in front of it 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:39.900
 Before 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.850
 To rise to this movement is the wind 10 people dwaejyo 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.010
 Ttwimyeon that the fourth emergency 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:51.210

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.910
 Add it gets naelreum 20s 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 Come say 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.170
 The total number 0 and the first schools based 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.039
 Seconds to second grade 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.090
 The third opening to the multi- 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:13.860
 '18 Then the fifth grade system 5 only because there the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.850
 Because there are only 2 of 5, why do you answer to the last fifth gag 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.900
 20 people in total are already in good hands. 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:28.619
 However, some degree fits amounts Can I have more haejumyeon 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.590
 As the front approached the front of the cumulative value and edaga braided woojok be again in front of him 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.400
 Adding these things is important 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.940
 That 's the cumulative number of the ranks and it's over. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.970
 The party leaders control 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:49.170
 The number of his first number is the first. 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.350
 The first comedy craft shipbuilding anyway because there'll only after 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.400
 It's going to be different. 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.820
 But as Bob says, the cumulative booth of the last rank 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.200
 At the very end, that's because we're the last one. 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:10.410
 When you see it too late doejyo have happened throughout the required 20 years 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:16.500
 For parties because Invincible also mean a jam Ongjin added step by step before writing 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.150
 I do not know the concept of a more came Fees do not need with the last one we 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.680
 Nobody comes in. 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.659
 It's almost gone after the chow chow . 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.010
 My last sent to the Om without any target can easily know the ranking 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.939
 Problem 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.500
 I'm just saying now that I'm an example. 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:41.470
 It's a turtle in Yogi. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:47.900
 At least 20 over 20 25 Obesity now I will see the grade 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:51.860
 If it's one person that if I were not in the party then six people 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.689
 How about before the nose to the nose 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:02.720
 There are a few people. Ten people are piled up now. 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:08.090
 The nose Mayo iteunikka age to accumulate in front of the second one I or column 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.310
 Now when you sin, when in front of two teojyeoteul from the front or second column also once again 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.890
 The time that would have been the father of evidence 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.799
 From the 11th to the next 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:25.760
 Now to the meat + Command's identity forged the Spirit, are you now 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:31.010
 So when it comes to new things, the 16th or the 11th door 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:35.480
 How can I be invincible How can I bring you euro 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.420
 It's right here in front of you. Here you are. And it's over. 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.940
 That 's not 10. 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.139
 It is not now, and it is 11th that it is not the tenth in the eigi 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.420
 From the beginning 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:52.760
 Yogeo exceeds the second cumulative Then the gag every class that I am a firm 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.910
 Because the tide is 16. 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.480
 I'm talking about there might be a second that God could have 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.239
 What used thou freedom there is just something I'm ttajineun from 10th 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.549
 Did you do that? Let me give you an example. 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:13.400
 If I was the second comedian I included in the second shot , continue on. 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:17.370
 If there is a second comedian included, I am in front of him 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:22.139
 Kerr is also a little bit in front of him now assistant Geoga 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.699
 So I have a lot of golfers, so the next second I have included 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.699
 The cumulative number of 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.310
 I will forward the third and fourth, what fits between the time it been another 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.370
 You have to do it five times. 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:41.490
 I'm not allowed to see the third one . 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:45.030
 It's not a shoestring, but once again , 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.620
 I'll try my last brother. 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:54.600
 Then if I have the last chance to go quickly, 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:05:01.250
 * Do you ever put 16 people to go and kill based on additional 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.250
 Then that is because the class I belong to 22 purposely assistant 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:10.590
 When I'm gone 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:17.449
 7 because the total'll 17th or eighth - Laguna 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:20.060
 Is it the ninth after the first is not it, I'll get in requirements 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:25.010
 There you are. 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:28.160
 Over lack of Chuck the first time more haejumyeon but good writing written 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:33.440
 At the end of the last invincible number 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:40.190
 This can mean only full seconds earlier received a combination of two numbers diopter 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:44.570
 Also, when I accumulated a few good housing when the front got out step by step in order from 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:49.520
 It can be seen at a glance whether you belong to the second, if so stated so 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:54.590
 I have to add it if I write. If I belong here , I belong here. 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:59.480
 If you want to know if there is an area ahead of you, do 2 + 3 + 5 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:02.780
 But it's just a little bit or because there's already a string 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:07.160
 Is the vinegar vaporized? 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:10.310
 It's also here. There 's 20 seconds in front of you and 10 seconds . 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:15.950
 I can do it in one place. 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:20.030
 By that party composition included in Table 3 also bowed concept of maintenance for 3 against 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:23.150
 The dot commemorates the next concept of the two tribes that is over. 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.770
 Of course it is not the other way. 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.150
 If the flat so that the eye by changing the grip by changing the graph again 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:35.240
 The contents are coming out. 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:38.480
 Beginning next time and frequency reference source and the cumulative another one 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.570
 I'll study the process of switching to graphs. 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:46.610
 It's the first unit so it does not cry here. 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:49.210
 I put it to my well-finished revenge for the graph from the next time 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.210
 Let's see.
