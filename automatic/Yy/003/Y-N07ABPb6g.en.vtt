by one inch steel tubing I believe it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.950 
by one inch steel tubing I believe it
ah<00:00:48.590> it's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.739> little<00:00:50.100> thick<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:51.510> tougher<00:00:51.870> than

ah it's a little thick it's tougher than

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.979 
ah it's a little thick it's tougher than
I<00:00:52.110> thought<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.470> was<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.150> see

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.229 

it'll<00:00:57.989> weld<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.470> real<00:00:58.680> nice<00:00:58.950> but<00:00:59.610> anyhow<00:00:59.970> what

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it'll weld up real nice but anyhow what

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.350 
it'll weld up real nice but anyhow what
we're<00:01:00.360> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.720> is<00:01:00.960> uh<00:01:01.879> I'll<00:01:02.879> show<00:01:03.059> you

we're going to do is uh I'll show you

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.750 
we're going to do is uh I'll show you
design<00:01:03.900> well<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.309> little<00:01:05.489> sketch

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
design well it's just a little sketch

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.970 
design well it's just a little sketch
but<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:08.280> top<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:08.790> truck<00:01:09.120> needs<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.690> be<00:01:09.980> it's

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
but the top of my truck needs to be it's

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.580 
but the top of my truck needs to be it's
going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.550> 56<00:01:12.270> inches<00:01:12.570> long<00:01:12.810> okay

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
going to be 56 inches long okay

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.910 
going to be 56 inches long okay
all<00:01:14.220> together<00:01:14.460> from<00:01:14.850> top<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.480> bottom<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.080> 45

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
all together from top to bottom and 45

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.360 
all together from top to bottom and 45
inches<00:01:17.190> wide<00:01:17.460> from<00:01:17.760> side<00:01:18.120> to<00:01:18.420> side<00:01:19.190> I'm<00:01:20.190> going

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
inches wide from side to side I'm going

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.300 
inches wide from side to side I'm going
to<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.580> angled<00:01:21.000> edges<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.870> I<00:01:22.159> think<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
to have angled edges on it I think that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.530 
to have angled edges on it I think that
will<00:01:23.400> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> contour<00:01:24.120> a<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.180> bit<00:01:24.390> better

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
will kind of contour a little bit better

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.430 
will kind of contour a little bit better
with<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.530> roof<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> truck<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.320> we're

with the roof of the truck so what we're

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.540 
with the roof of the truck so what we're
going<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.680> we're<00:01:28.830> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.010> get<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.280> part

going to do we're going to get this part

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.610 
going to do we're going to get this part
built<00:01:29.820> first<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.900> will<00:01:31.050> have<00:01:31.260> some<00:01:31.440> cross

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
built first it will have some cross

that<00:05:00.920> are<00:05:00.980> going<00:05:01.130> to<00:05:01.220> hold<00:05:01.430> up<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.910> top<00:05:02.150> piece

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
that are going to hold up the top piece

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.070 
that are going to hold up the top piece
I'd<00:05:03.500> like<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.100> maybe<00:05:05.030> put<00:05:05.360> mesh<00:05:05.600> around<00:05:05.780> the

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
I'd like to maybe put mesh around the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.390 
I'd like to maybe put mesh around the
outside<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.710> also<00:05:08.110> but<00:05:09.110> so<00:05:09.620> far<00:05:09.890> that's

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
outside of it also but so far that's

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
outside of it also but so far that's
what<00:05:10.670> I've<00:05:10.790> gotten<00:05:11.360> done<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:12.680> corners<00:05:13.100> I<00:05:13.420> do

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
what I've gotten done the corners I do

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.060 
what I've gotten done the corners I do
not<00:05:14.780> think<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.170> cut<00:05:15.380> those<00:05:15.560> at<00:05:16.690> at<00:05:17.690> 22<00:05:18.230> 1/2

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
not think you cut those at at 22 1/2

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.060 
not think you cut those at at 22 1/2
degree<00:05:19.700> like<00:05:20.090> I<00:05:20.240> told<00:05:20.480> you<00:05:20.750> I<00:05:20.960> don't<00:05:21.740> think

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
degree like I told you I don't think

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.810 
degree like I told you I don't think
that's<00:05:22.250> what<00:05:22.430> it<00:05:22.520> is

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
that's what it is

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.700 
that's what it is
because<00:05:23.440> these<00:05:24.440> are<00:05:24.770> all<00:05:24.950> I<00:05:26.080> messed<00:05:27.080> up<00:05:27.260> here<00:05:27.530> I

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
because these are all I messed up here I

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.430 
because these are all I messed up here I
cut<00:05:28.370> these<00:05:28.520> at<00:05:28.790> 22<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.270> a<00:05:29.330> half<00:05:29.480> degree<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:32.440> as

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
cut these at 22 and a half degree and as

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.680 
cut these at 22 and a half degree and as
you<00:05:33.950> can<00:05:34.100> tell<00:05:35.230> they<00:05:36.230> do<00:05:36.290> not<00:05:36.590> line<00:05:36.830> up<00:05:37.690> they

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
you can tell they do not line up they

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.740 
you can tell they do not line up they
should<00:05:38.750> be<00:05:39.190> straight<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:41.210> put<00:05:41.390> a<00:05:41.420> straight

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
should be straight to put a straight

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.750 
should be straight to put a straight
piece<00:05:41.930> in<00:05:42.170> here<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.380> should<00:05:42.590> be<00:05:42.680> straight<00:05:43.010> and

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
piece in here it should be straight and

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.320 
piece in here it should be straight and
as<00:05:43.970> you<00:05:44.120> can<00:05:44.240> see<00:05:44.450> it's<00:05:44.840> not<00:05:45.140> straight<00:05:46.150> that<00:05:47.150> is

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
as you can see it's not straight that is

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.990 
as you can see it's not straight that is
actually<00:05:47.750> straight<00:05:48.220> and<00:05:49.220> you<00:05:49.340> can<00:05:49.490> see<00:05:49.700> that

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
actually straight and you can see that

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.540 
actually straight and you can see that
yeah<00:05:50.630> it's<00:05:50.900> not<00:05:51.020> going<00:05:51.170> to<00:05:51.230> work<00:05:51.760> but<00:05:53.500> anyhow

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550
