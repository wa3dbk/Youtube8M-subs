going to go ahead and wash my face and

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.400 
going to go ahead and wash my face and
my<00:02:15.850> sis<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.540> really<00:02:16.780> long<00:02:16.810> time<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.140> heat<00:02:17.380> up

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
my sis is a really long time to heat up

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.130 
my sis is a really long time to heat up
so<00:02:17.620> usually<00:02:17.950> I'll<00:02:18.070> just<00:02:18.220> use<00:02:18.400> warm<00:02:19.030> water<00:02:19.140> but

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
so usually I'll just use warm water but

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.890 
so usually I'll just use warm water but
i<00:02:20.650> don't<00:02:21.250> use<00:02:21.459> like<00:02:21.760> particularly<00:02:22.480> warm<00:02:22.690> water

i don't use like particularly warm water

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.480 
i don't use like particularly warm water
because<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:23.680> takes<00:02:23.920> too<00:02:24.070> long<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
because it just takes too long and it

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.470 
because it just takes too long and it
doesn't<00:02:24.700> really<00:02:24.790> be<00:02:25.000> fine<00:02:25.209> anyway<00:02:26.670> um<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:28.030> take

prevent dryness and I really like the

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.940 
prevent dryness and I really like the
way<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.540> makes<00:03:31.660> my<00:03:31.810> skin<00:03:31.870> soft<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.560> it's

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
way that it makes my skin soft and it's

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.520 
way that it makes my skin soft and it's
dual<00:03:33.190> action<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.120> supposedly<00:03:34.960> prevent

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
dual action so it supposedly prevent

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.410 
dual action so it supposedly prevent
breakouts<00:03:36.010> but<00:03:36.460> I<00:03:36.700> don't<00:03:37.180> know<00:03:37.270> if<00:03:37.360> it

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
breakouts but I don't know if it

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.760 
breakouts but I don't know if it
actually<00:03:37.480> does<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.110> just<00:03:38.290> like<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.530> way<00:03:38.560> that

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
actually does I just like the way that

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.710 
actually does I just like the way that
it<00:03:38.920> moisturizes<00:03:39.490> my<00:03:39.610> face<00:03:39.790> another<00:03:40.540> thing
