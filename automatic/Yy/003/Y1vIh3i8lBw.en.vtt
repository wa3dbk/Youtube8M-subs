00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.150
 explain how divisions are made 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.130
 with five figures in the divisor nothing more 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.980
 that unlike previous videos 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.509
 let's write the subtracting or 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.460
 let's do all the subtraction not 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.189
 directly from head of agreement 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.090
 we started looking at the divider I have the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.630
 number 83 thousand 594 and the finger we have to 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.720
 take a number equal or greater than 97 thousand 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.700
 16 is greater with which we also cut 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.220
 five figures 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.110
 and now you are going to do the following we will 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.000
 to leave the figure on the left of the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.329
 divider that is attached to this box 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.399
 this angle of agreement 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.060
 and we cover 1 2 3 and 4 figures both encrypted 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.760
 letter 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.620
 and in the dividend in the number that we have 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.370
 we are going to do the same thing 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.090
 we cover 1 2 3 and 4 figures 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.820
 with which remains the 9 will be the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.150
 reference for number 8 or table 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.299
 of 8 whose result is closer to 9 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.250
 this case is going to be 8 by 18 because 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.720
 because you do not have to go through 8 for 2 are 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:20.170
 16 agree and now we write the 1 in 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.380
 the quotient and we start from right to 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.700
 left 1 by 4 4 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.480
 one for 99 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.880
 1 x 55 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.970
 a goal 63 one by 88 the result 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.720
 we not only subtract the dividend 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.900
 no less 42 or from 4 to 62 of 9 up 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.350
 11 2 it would take me 15 and an ak took me 6 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:54.090
 until 10 4 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.340
 134 to 73 did not give me any of 8 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.560
 up to 91 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.409
 the next step would be to go down to the figure 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.270
 next the 5 that we put it to the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.670
 right what we have left over from the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.209
 difference of agreement here 5 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.940
 and now the same process we cover four 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.020
 figures 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.680
 in the divisor and we cover 1 2 3 and 4 figures 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.620
 in the dividend and now we say the 13 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.590
 would go to 8 the table of 8 whose 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.440
 result is closer to 13 be the most 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.070
 approach to be a master also because 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.470
 8 by 2 are 16 according as the 1 what 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.840
 we write we copy it also in the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:49.510
 patient and the same operation one by 4 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:51.540
 41 for 99 1 for 551 for 33 and one for 88 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:58.560
 we are just 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:02.069
 from 4 to 51 from 9 to 12 m 56 to 12 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:08.700
 it would take a pressure to the box until 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:11.530
 40 none 8 up to 13 would go 5 and one of 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.830
 one to 10 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.830
 now we lower the next figure on 8 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.200
 that we put it to the right of the last 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.960
 that we have left over in agreement is always 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.940
 the same mechanism is very simple 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.890
 and now we are going to cover so you can see 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.440
 but you know what the number of the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:35.240
 left the reference we plug four 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.780
 figures and one two three and four figures already 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.780
 we say it 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.090
 talk about 8 that is not 50 or the 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.180
 result that comes closest in this 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.450
 case will be 8 with 6 48 because 8 by 7 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.900
 it's 56 we've passed 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.569
 what should be done 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.049
 the century we copy in the patient and 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.950
 we started 6 for 4 24 it would take me two 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:08.040
 it puts 54 plus 256 it took me 56 for 530 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:12.990
 more 535 3d evo for 318 plus 321 me 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:17.100
 would take two yes for 848 plus 250 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:21.750
 and finally we do not subtract from four 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.910
 horns would be 4 of 6 to 11 would go 5 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.120
 I'm taking a 5 since I 'm 6 up 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:34.950
 13 and 7 would lead to a greater than I carry 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.950
 2 to 64 did not give me any of 000 or of 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.520
 50 50 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.710
 agree look how the rest is the two 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.410
 We will delete the figures from the left 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.060
 agree because they do not go or do not count 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.919
 of agreement is a natural number 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.490
 whereupon the result of this 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:59.040
 division has been 116 and the rest we have 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:02.600
 4 thousand 754 tell you that the rest never 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.150
 can be bigger than the divisor 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.240
 Well, we have finished looking 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.700
 you want to see more divisions where 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.980
 operation subtracts side directly from 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.980
 head click on the link that I have 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.180
 left at the bottom of agreement 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.180
 a cordial greeting
