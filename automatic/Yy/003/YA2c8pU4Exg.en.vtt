00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:08.809
 moonfish or mola mola is one of 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.660
 the most magnificent sea creatures 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.369
 its Latin name translates as 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.060
 millstone that completely 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.350
 fits the size and shape of this fish 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.990
 resembling a large disk flattened by 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.330
 the edges is the largest of the bones 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.220
 bony fish in a group that includes 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.800
 virtually all modern sharks and 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.740
 stingray stingray in adult condition 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.040
 the moon reaches two and a half meters and 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.870
 length over 500 kilograms sometimes 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.329
 reaches 1000 kilograms 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.150
 in the Guinness Book of Records are given 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.940
 data fish caught in 1908 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.730
 not far from Sedna and the length of which 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.489
 made up 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:54.500
 4.26 meters and a weight of 2235 kilograms more 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.110
 decent their theologically sources are not 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.000
 challenge the leadership of the moon but have 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:05.180
 more moderate dimensions just 3.33 meters 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.760
 and two thousand kilograms not counting the size 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.640
 moon fish is marvelous and extraordinary 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.250
 view of the profile of this fish is almost such 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:19.220
 as round as the disk of the full moon in general 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.710
 in some places it is called the fish sun apparently 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.630
 for the love of sunbathing time from 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.310
 time the fish in the dust is out to 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.549
 show yourself in all its glory 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.500
 but the reason for this is more everyday 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.260
 the way fish seek to get rid of 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.580
 countless parasites living dick u 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.200
 them on the skin of the fish body 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.130
 ends with an elongated round mouth 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.830
 full teeth period 60 solid plate 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.229
 skin is unusually thick strong 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.650
 flexible so even the hull of the ship is not 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.530
 withstands forehead collisions forehead and out 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.409
 it deepens the colors 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.350
 moonfish is the most prolific fish in the world 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.630
 female throws up to 300 million eggs 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.030
 the size of each egg is about one 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.799
 millimeter if you add up all the eggs 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.280
 option then you can get a chain of length 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.390
 at 300 kilometers when occur when 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.239
 birth 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.970

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.819
 long spikes which then disappear 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.769
 live these hard weight and in all seas 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.700
 tropical and temperate zones 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.110
 from time to time they are carried into the dark sea 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.040
 Baltic coast of Scandinavia

 newfoundland 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.350
 the moon fish in most cases holds 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.950
 near the surface of the water 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.319
 at a depth of 300 meters 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.750
 fry of this species swim as usual 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.670
 fish and adult shoes are a significant part 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.739
 their time lying on his side in 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.780
 surfaces or turning over 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.170
 fins alternately exposing them from 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.989
 water 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.480
 the moon is very bad swimmer not capable 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:03.220
 overcome a strong current therefore 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:08.350
 moon fish looks very apathetic u200 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:12.910
 a kilogram fish without a brain 2000 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.730
 kilogram fish and 200 kilogram 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.519
 fish brain weight was only 4 grams and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.950
 what can be concluded that he is a fish 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.230
 absolutely stupid she is practically not 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.400
 reacts to the approach of people and her 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.650
 you can often catch a hook 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.200
 only hook as suspended 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.810
 skin scales are very thick and 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.609
 hard fibrous layer even sharp 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.250
 end harpoon but unable to pierce 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.959
 his harpoon bounces off such armor and 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.109
 the moon fish continues its slow and 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.959
 swimming to eat moon fish no no 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.510
 need intensive hunt is 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.489
 usually in an environment rich in plankton she 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.060
 limited to sucking their prey 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.459
 sailing within reach 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.380
 shrimp mollusks jellyfish juvenile larvae 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.810
 not disdaining also food from plants 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.910
 moon fish prefer loneliness but 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.220
 from time to time and met in pairs 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.910
 even though the big fish 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.890
 moons cannot cause man 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.680
 no harm in some places in 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.870
 south africa coast fishermen experience 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.060
 superstitious horror when meeting this fish 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.570
 considering it a harbinger of failure and 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.150
 hasty roll up to the shore 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.920
 this is probably due to the fact that the moon 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.260
 approaching the shores just before not 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.590
 good weather and fishermen binds and 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.730
 occurrences with impending storm 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.470
 grieving person also represents 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.160
 severe danger for this sea 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.100
 resident 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.740
 in some East Asian countries on 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.410
 where the moon fish is considered a delicacy and and 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.600
 catch specially in other places

 after that, it becomes quite
