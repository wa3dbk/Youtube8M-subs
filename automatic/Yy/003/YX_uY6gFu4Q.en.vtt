you<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.320> adjust<00:02:32.120> adjust<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.540> front<00:02:33.840> left<00:02:34.709> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
you can adjust adjust the front left and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.210 
you can adjust adjust the front left and
right<00:02:35.600> here<00:02:36.600> these<00:02:37.440> are<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.770> general

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
right here these are for general

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.059 
right here these are for general
assembly<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.120> general<00:02:39.900> adjustment<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.739> begin

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
assembly and general adjustment to begin

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.400 
assembly and general adjustment to begin
with<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.120> nice<00:02:42.330> thing<00:02:42.600> about<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:43.080> general

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
with the nice thing about the general

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.130 
with the nice thing about the general
adjustment<00:02:43.950> here<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:45.180> when<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.930> make<00:02:46.110> a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
adjustment here is that when you make a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.350 
adjustment here is that when you make a
general<00:02:46.560> adjustment<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.550> very<00:02:47.790> important

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
general adjustment it's very important

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.780 
general adjustment it's very important
but<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.590> do<00:02:49.680> not<00:02:49.830> have<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.250> worry<00:02:50.519> about<00:02:50.850> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
but you do not have to worry about the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.060 
but you do not have to worry about the
setting<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.880> PID<00:02:54.269> with<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> computer<00:02:55.470> you

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
setting the PID with a computer you

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.410 
setting the PID with a computer you
don't<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.519> worry<00:02:56.730> about<00:02:56.880> setting<00:02:57.390> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
don't have to worry about setting the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.949 
don't have to worry about setting the
PID<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.920> technology<00:02:59.790> allows<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.750> just

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
PID the technology allows you to just

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.280 
PID the technology allows you to just
set<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.640> gentlest<00:03:02.640> general<00:03:03.150> adjustment<00:03:03.810> for

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
set the gentlest general adjustment for

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.860 
set the gentlest general adjustment for
horizontal<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.640> then<00:03:06.239> afterwards

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
horizontal of this and then afterwards

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
horizontal of this and then afterwards
I'll<00:03:07.350> show<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.709> on<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.100> model<00:03:08.459> that's<00:03:08.580> already

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
I'll show you on a model that's already

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.810 
I'll show you on a model that's already
set<00:03:09.120> up<00:03:09.239> with<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.420> camera<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.400> fine-tune

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
set up with a camera you can fine-tune

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.699 
set up with a camera you can fine-tune
that<00:03:12.269> adjustment<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.680> a

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
that adjustment to so that you have a

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.460 
that adjustment to so that you have a
good<00:03:14.040> stable<00:03:14.400> horizontal<00:03:15.329> projection<00:03:15.930> for

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
good stable horizontal projection for

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.620 
good stable horizontal projection for
the<00:03:16.590> camera<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.850> let<00:03:18.000> me<00:03:18.120> put<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.480> up<00:03:20.600> out<00:03:21.600> of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
the camera so let me put this up out of

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.800 
the camera so let me put this up out of
the<00:03:21.900> way<00:03:25.340> now<00:03:26.340> here's<00:03:26.670> one<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.480> already

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the way now here's one is already

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.020 
the way now here's one is already
assembled<00:03:28.440> we<00:03:29.010> have<00:03:29.160> placed<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.610> camera

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
assembled we have placed the camera

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.949 
assembled we have placed the camera
already<00:03:30.630> onto<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:33.200> pad<00:03:34.200> mount<00:03:34.470> here<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.980> is

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
already onto the pad mount here and is

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.050 
already onto the pad mount here and is
as<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.799> see<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.250> very<00:03:38.579> much<00:03:38.790> out<00:03:39.030> of

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
as you can see is very much out of

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.380 
as you can see is very much out of
adjustment<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:41.310> what<00:03:41.459> I'm<00:03:41.549> going<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.760> do<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.120> I

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
adjustment so what I'm going to do is I

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.990 
adjustment so what I'm going to do is I
will<00:03:42.450> set<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:42.959> down<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.440> will<00:03:44.280> go<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.730> site

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
will set it down I will go to the site

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.870 
will set it down I will go to the site
adjustments<00:03:45.840> group<00:03:46.400> adjust<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.549> back<00:03:47.850> a

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
adjustments group adjust it back a

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.870 
adjustments group adjust it back a
little<00:03:48.269> bit<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:52.620> get<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.799> general<00:03:53.130> adjustment

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
little bit to get a general adjustment

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.030 
little bit to get a general adjustment
that's<00:03:54.480> probably<00:03:54.780> good<00:03:55.079> enough<00:03:55.170> there<00:03:55.620> but<00:03:55.829> i

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
that's probably good enough there but i

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.650 
that's probably good enough there but i
want<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.640> show<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.150> can<00:03:57.269> also

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
want to show you that you can also

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.280 
want to show you that you can also
adjust<00:03:58.290> left<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.160> right

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.830 

and<00:04:04.290> when<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.500> had<00:04:04.620> just<00:04:04.770> left<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.250> right<00:04:05.840> the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
and when you had just left and right the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.680 
and when you had just left and right the
gimbal<00:04:07.230> will<00:04:07.560> give<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:08.040> general<00:04:08.520> balance<00:04:08.970> but

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
gimbal will give a general balance but

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.690 
gimbal will give a general balance but
the<00:04:09.870> true<00:04:10.140> thing<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.830> when<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.370> want<00:04:11.580> to

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the true thing is that when you want to

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.610 
the true thing is that when you want to
have<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:11.880> fine<00:04:12.300> adjustment<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.020> horizontal

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
have a fine adjustment to the horizontal

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.010 
have a fine adjustment to the horizontal
and<00:04:13.770> so<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.460> gimbal<00:04:14.850> will<00:04:15.030> work<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.510> be<00:04:15.690> stable

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
and so the gimbal will work to be stable

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.040 
and so the gimbal will work to be stable
as<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.620> move<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.330> switch<00:04:18.750> on<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
as you move you have a switch on the

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.660 
as you move you have a switch on the
back<00:04:19.320> here<00:04:19.380> where<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.160> Kent<00:04:20.400> where<00:04:20.580> the

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
back here where the Kent where the

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.360 
back here where the Kent where the
camera<00:04:21.030> battery<00:04:21.360> is<00:04:21.650> so<00:04:22.650> you'll<00:04:22.830> turn<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.310> on

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
camera battery is so you'll turn that on

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.710 
camera battery is so you'll turn that on
and<00:04:24.710> then<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:25.920> it<00:04:26.070> just<00:04:26.340> perfectly<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.690> the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
and then is it just perfectly to the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.110 
and then is it just perfectly to the
stable<00:04:28.260> horizontal<00:04:28.860> position<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.760> I'm

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
stable horizontal position and I'm

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.120 
stable horizontal position and I'm
talking<00:04:30.300> about<00:04:30.480> stable<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.230> can<00:04:31.380> see<00:04:31.590> as<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.860> I

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
talking about stable you can see as I I

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.720 
talking about stable you can see as I I
just<00:04:33.120> left<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.630> right<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:35.070> camera<00:04:35.460> stays

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
just left and right the camera stays

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.570 
just left and right the camera stays
stable<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.720> horizontal<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.530> then<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.310> kind<00:04:38.550> of

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
stable and horizontal and then I kind of

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.840 
stable and horizontal and then I kind of
just<00:04:38.820> forward<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:39.900> back<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:41.460> camera

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
just forward and back and the camera

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
just forward and back and the camera
stays<00:04:42.530> always<00:04:43.530> stays<00:04:44.040> stable<00:04:44.540> so<00:04:45.540> there's<00:04:45.810> a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
stays always stays stable so there's a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.320 
stays always stays stable so there's a
really<00:04:46.500> nice<00:04:46.680> feature<00:04:47.010> about<00:04:47.190> this<00:04:47.640> one<00:04:47.850> is

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
really nice feature about this one is

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.650 
really nice feature about this one is
that<00:04:48.390> it's<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.920> intended<00:04:50.910> use<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.300> the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
that it's the the intended use of the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.300 
that it's the the intended use of the
gimbal<00:04:52.020> is<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.320> keep<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.650> stable<00:04:53.130> and

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
gimbal is to keep the stable and

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.970 
gimbal is to keep the stable and
horizontal<00:04:53.910> but<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.720> can<00:04:54.870> see<00:04:55.140> that<00:04:55.170> when<00:04:55.890> the

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
horizontal but you can see that when the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.880 
horizontal but you can see that when the
batteries<00:04:56.430> on<00:04:56.640> that<00:04:57.300> is<00:04:57.600> controlling<00:04:58.230> exactly

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
batteries on that is controlling exactly

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.820 
batteries on that is controlling exactly
these<00:04:59.460> two<00:04:59.730> motors<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.390> that's<00:05:01.320> reason<00:05:01.680> why

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
these two motors and that's reason why

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.770 
these two motors and that's reason why
it's<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:02.190> important<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:02.910> do<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.360> general

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
it's so important to do a general

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.670 
it's so important to do a general
adjustment<00:05:04.530> at<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.710> beginning<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:06.000> get<00:05:06.180> the

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
adjustment at the beginning to get the

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.640 
adjustment at the beginning to get the
camera<00:05:07.680> balanced<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:08.430> best<00:05:08.670> you<00:05:08.760> can<00:05:08.850> first

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
camera balanced as best you can first

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.590 
camera balanced as best you can first
visually<00:05:10.650> once<00:05:11.640> you<00:05:11.790> have<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.120> visually

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
visually once you have it visually

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.750 
visually once you have it visually
balanced<00:05:13.170> then<00:05:13.770> you<00:05:13.920> can<00:05:14.100> turn<00:05:14.310> on<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.580> switch

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
balanced then you can turn on the switch

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.830 
balanced then you can turn on the switch
and<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.300> will<00:05:15.420> fine-tune<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.740> horizontal<00:05:17.840> it

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
and it will fine-tune the horizontal it

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.230 
and it will fine-tune the horizontal it
makes<00:05:19.080> it<00:05:19.230> very<00:05:19.410> easy<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.860> use<00:05:20.190> very<00:05:20.700> very

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
makes it very easy to use very very

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.720 
makes it very easy to use very very
quick<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:22.080> use<00:05:22.290> in<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.500> field<00:05:22.740> as<00:05:23.010> i<00:05:23.520> said

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
quick to use in the field as i said

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.700 
quick to use in the field as i said
before<00:05:23.850> right<00:05:24.570> out<00:05:24.720> of<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.930> box<00:05:25.140> there's<00:05:25.500> no

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
before right out of the box there's no

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.960 
before right out of the box there's no
assembly<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.540> didn't<00:05:27.540> have<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:27.750> use<00:05:27.900> any<00:05:28.110> tools

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
assembly I didn't have to use any tools

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.140 
assembly I didn't have to use any tools
I<00:05:29.970> just<00:05:30.930> all<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.530> had<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.830> do<00:05:32.130> was<00:05:32.850> put<00:05:33.120> the

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
I just all I had to do was put the

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.860 
I just all I had to do was put the
camera<00:05:33.690> onto<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.260> seat<00:05:34.790> adjusted<00:05:35.870> connected

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
camera onto the seat adjusted connected

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.770 
camera onto the seat adjusted connected
to<00:05:36.990> make<00:05:37.140> sure<00:05:37.320> it's<00:05:37.500> secure<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:38.100> then<00:05:39.030> start

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
to make sure it's secure and then start

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.530 
to make sure it's secure and then start
to<00:05:39.930> do<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.080> general<00:05:40.590> assembly<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.400> then<00:05:42.120> after

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
to do a general assembly and then after

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.900 
to do a general assembly and then after
I<00:05:42.600> did<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:42.840> general<00:05:43.320> assembly<00:05:43.650> I<00:05:44.040> hit<00:05:44.790> the

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
I did the general assembly I hit the

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.020 
I did the general assembly I hit the
switch<00:05:45.180> on<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.360> back<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:46.169> it<00:05:46.740> does<00:05:47.030> it

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
switch on the back and it does it

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.190 
switch on the back and it does it
provides<00:05:48.450> a<00:05:49.280> fine<00:05:50.280> tune<00:05:50.610> as<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:51.200> horizontal

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
provides a fine tune as a horizontal

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.010 
provides a fine tune as a horizontal
stupid<00:05:52.620> stabilization<00:05:53.400> so<00:05:54.300> it's<00:05:54.540> a<00:05:54.660> very<00:05:54.690> good

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
stupid stabilization so it's a very good

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.150 
stupid stabilization so it's a very good
very<00:05:55.560> good<00:05:55.680> gimbal<00:05:56.220> I<00:05:56.630> it's<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.960> very<00:05:58.680> easy<00:05:58.770> to

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160
