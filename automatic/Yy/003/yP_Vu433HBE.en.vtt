in<00:00:06.140> this<00:00:06.439> video<00:00:06.799> I'll<00:00:07.279> show<00:00:07.640> you<00:00:07.670> how<00:00:07.819> to

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
in this video I'll show you how to

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.740 
in this video I'll show you how to
create<00:00:08.480> the<00:00:08.930> stop-motion<00:00:09.290> effect<00:00:10.510> let's<00:00:11.510> take

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
create the stop-motion effect let's take

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.799 
create the stop-motion effect let's take
a<00:00:11.780> look<00:00:12.019> at<00:00:12.170> some<00:00:12.349> examples<00:00:13.629> here's<00:00:14.629> an

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
a look at some examples here's an

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.540 
a look at some examples here's an
example<00:00:15.139> of<00:00:15.410> a<00:00:15.530> deck<00:00:15.679> of<00:00:15.710> cards<00:00:16.340> that

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
example of a deck of cards that

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:25.359 
example of a deck of cards that
automatically<00:00:17.480> deal<00:00:18.110> themselves<00:00:24.070> in<00:00:25.070> the

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
automatically deal themselves in the

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.790 
automatically deal themselves in the
second<00:00:25.759> example<00:00:26.149> we<00:00:26.570> see<00:00:27.200> two<00:00:27.470> Lego

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
second example we see two Lego

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.150 
second example we see two Lego
characters<00:00:28.130> in<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:28.849> battle<00:00:29.180> scene<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:32.980> in<00:00:33.980> this

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
characters in a battle scene and in this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.119 
characters in a battle scene and in this
third<00:00:34.219> example<00:00:35.030> we<00:00:35.840> see<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.079> power<00:00:36.469> ranger

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
third example we see the power ranger

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.750 
third example we see the power ranger
drinking<00:00:37.670> some<00:00:37.910> milk

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
drinking some milk

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.700 
drinking some milk
so<00:00:40.760> stop-motion<00:00:41.690> can<00:00:41.930> be<00:00:42.080> used<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:42.560> many

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
so stop-motion can be used in many

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.910 
so stop-motion can be used in many
creative<00:00:43.220> ways<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.820> we'll<00:00:44.329> show<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:44.600> how

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
creative ways and we'll show you how

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
creative ways and we'll show you how
using<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.100> deck<00:00:46.340> of<00:00:46.520> cards<00:00:46.970> example<00:00:48.940> but

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
using the deck of cards example but

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.330 
using the deck of cards example but
before<00:00:50.360> we<00:00:50.510> do<00:00:50.690> that<00:00:50.720> let's<00:00:51.590> first<00:00:51.980> talk<00:00:52.280> about

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
before we do that let's first talk about

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.690 
before we do that let's first talk about
the<00:00:52.820> basic<00:00:53.239> setup<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.810> you'll<00:00:54.050> need<00:00:54.700> mount

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
the basic setup that you'll need mount

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.440 
the basic setup that you'll need mount
your<00:00:55.970> video<00:00:56.270> camera<00:00:56.750> on<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:56.930> tripod<00:00:58.239> shoot<00:00:59.239> the

your video camera on a tripod shoot the
complete<00:00:59.960> footage<00:01:00.410> continuously<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:01.880> this

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
complete footage continuously like this

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.789 
complete footage continuously like this
as<00:01:04.399> you<00:01:04.610> can<00:01:04.790> see<00:01:05.059> while<00:01:05.810> I'm<00:01:06.079> moving<00:01:06.530> each

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
as you can see while I'm moving each

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.789 
as you can see while I'm moving each
card<00:01:07.189> I'm<00:01:07.520> also<00:01:08.119> making<00:01:08.540> sure<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.200> my<00:01:09.380> hand

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
card I'm also making sure that my hand

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.789 
card I'm also making sure that my hand
is<00:01:10.240> completely<00:01:11.240> outside<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.899> video<00:01:12.439> frame

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
is completely outside the video frame

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.160 
is completely outside the video frame
between<00:01:13.310> each<00:01:13.729> move<00:01:14.060> now<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:14.990> very

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
between each move now this is very

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.859 
between each move now this is very
important<00:01:15.819> now<00:01:16.819> let's<00:01:17.119> speed<00:01:17.450> up<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.719> video

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
important now let's speed up the video

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.649 
important now let's speed up the video
to<00:01:18.409> see<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.859> rest<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.520> footage<00:01:19.789> so<00:01:20.509> that

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
to see the rest of the footage so that

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:28.539 
to see the rest of the footage so that
you<00:01:20.840> get<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.170> idea<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:26.439> third<00:01:27.439> set<00:01:28.280> your

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
you get the idea and third set your

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.719 
you get the idea and third set your
camera<00:01:28.969> to<00:01:29.060> manual<00:01:29.270> exposure<00:01:30.259> mode<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:31.069> that

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
camera to manual exposure mode and that

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.809 
camera to manual exposure mode and that
you<00:01:31.909> shoot<00:01:32.209> in<00:01:32.450> even<00:01:32.929> lighting<00:01:33.670> locking<00:01:34.670> the

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
you shoot in even lighting locking the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.449 
you shoot in even lighting locking the
exposure<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:35.509> manual<00:01:35.990> mode<00:01:36.020> will<00:01:36.920> ensure

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
exposure in manual mode will ensure

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.739 
exposure in manual mode will ensure
consistent<00:01:38.299> exposure<00:01:39.819> now<00:01:40.819> let's<00:01:41.060> begin<00:01:41.509> by

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
consistent exposure now let's begin by

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.800 
consistent exposure now let's begin by
dragging<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.499> shuffle<00:01:42.950> avi<00:01:43.490> file<00:01:43.939> onto<00:01:44.209> the

and here we see all the frames we
extracted<00:04:08.459> in<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.910> multi<00:04:09.390> trim<00:04:09.720> tool<00:04:10.340> let's

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
extracted in the multi trim tool let's

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.589 
extracted in the multi trim tool let's
go<00:04:11.610> ahead<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.060> preview<00:04:12.270> our<00:04:12.690> work<00:04:14.599> so

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
go ahead and preview our work so

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.080 
go ahead and preview our work so
stop-motion<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.739> nothing<00:04:17.190> more<00:04:17.400> than<00:04:17.669> playing

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
stop-motion is nothing more than playing

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.979 
stop-motion is nothing more than playing
back<00:04:18.419> these<00:04:18.750> still<00:04:19.169> frames<00:04:19.560> in<00:04:19.829> sequence<00:04:20.430> and

back these still frames in sequence and

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.990 
back these still frames in sequence and
remember<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.470> multi<00:04:22.919> trim<00:04:23.160> tool<00:04:23.430> is<00:04:23.700> ideal

remember the multi trim tool is ideal

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.740 
remember the multi trim tool is ideal
for<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.810> kind<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.320> precise<00:04:25.830> editing<00:04:26.750> now

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
for this kind of precise editing now

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.140 
for this kind of precise editing now
stop-motion<00:04:28.680> editing<00:04:29.220> can<00:04:29.610> be<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.850> bit

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
stop-motion editing can be a bit

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.540 
stop-motion editing can be a bit
time-consuming<00:04:30.770> but<00:04:31.770> I'm<00:04:31.919> sure<00:04:32.160> you'll<00:04:32.400> agree

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
time-consuming but I'm sure you'll agree

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.620 
time-consuming but I'm sure you'll agree
the<00:04:33.090> end<00:04:33.360> result<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:34.320> well<00:04:34.830> worth<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.389> so<00:04:36.389> let's

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
the end result is well worth it so let's

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.080 
the end result is well worth it so let's
close<00:04:36.930> out<00:04:37.200> with<00:04:37.410> some<00:04:37.590> creative<00:04:38.070> ideas<00:04:38.220> for

close out with some creative ideas for

00:04:39.090 --> 00:05:16.990 
close out with some creative ideas for
stop-motion<00:04:40.100> enjoy
