the other side heroes on both sides and
we'll<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.629> how<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.109> raid<00:01:01.379> will<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
we'll see how this raid will go so I

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.310 
we'll see how this raid will go so I
decided<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> attack<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:03.809> those<00:01:04.049> sides

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
decided to attack from those sides

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
decided to attack from those sides
because<00:01:04.619> probably<00:01:04.890> his<00:01:05.189> traps<00:01:05.610> would<00:01:05.850> be

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
because probably his traps would be

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.880 
because probably his traps would be
already<00:01:06.780> set<00:01:07.680> off<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:10.140> very<00:01:10.530> close<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
already set off and it was very close to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.850 
already set off and it was very close to
loot<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.360> top<00:01:12.630> there's<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.020> lot<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.409> loot<00:01:13.590> too

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
loot so up top there's a lot of loot too

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.969 
loot so up top there's a lot of loot too

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
spell that's now gone was a complete

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.050 
spell that's now gone was a complete
waste<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.729> did<00:01:29.909> nothing<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.880> Pekka<00:01:32.880> is

and<00:01:37.880> yeah<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.299> raid<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:41.009> pretty<00:01:41.280> well

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and yeah the raid was going pretty well

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.480 
and yeah the raid was going pretty well
because<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.869> already<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.770> lot<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
because I have already have a lot of

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.550 
because I have already have a lot of
resources<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:45.810> King<00:01:46.020> castle<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.470> my

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
resources to have my King castle at my

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.219 
resources to have my King castle at my
wizards<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:48.030> put<00:01:48.240> McLean<00:01:48.540> castle<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:48.930> top

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
wizards and I put McLean castle on top

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.080 
wizards and I put McLean castle on top
because<00:01:49.829> there<00:01:50.369> still<00:01:50.640> was<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> lot<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
because there still was a lot of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.050 
because there still was a lot of
resources<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.960> full<00:01:52.350> gold<00:01:52.680> mines<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.310> full

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
resources to full gold mines and a full

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.959 
resources to full gold mines and a full
dark<00:01:54.390> elixir<00:01:54.689> drill<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.439> who<00:01:56.369> doesn't<00:01:56.759> want

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
dark elixir drill and who doesn't want

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.600 
dark elixir drill and who doesn't want
to<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.479> resources<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.040> thought<00:01:59.369> why<00:01:59.579> not

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to get resources so I thought why not

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.969 
to get resources so I thought why not
just<00:01:59.820> drop<00:02:00.329> my<00:02:00.450> clan<00:02:00.689> castle<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.290> free<00:02:01.619> spells

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
just drop my clan castle to free spells

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.459 
just drop my clan castle to free spells
I<00:02:02.310> wanted<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.969> take<00:02:03.329> out<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.630> mortar<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.229> well

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
I wanted to take out that mortar as well

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.249 
I wanted to take out that mortar as well
but<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.040> didn't<00:02:05.369> help<00:02:05.600> but<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.990> saw<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
but that didn't help but then I saw I

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.979 
but that didn't help but then I saw I
still<00:02:07.710> had<00:02:07.829> two<00:02:08.099> Pickers<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> bottom<00:02:09.360> in

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
still had two Pickers at the bottom in

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.550 
still had two Pickers at the bottom in
the<00:02:10.110> middle<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.709> one<00:02:11.129> expo<00:02:11.640> was<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:12.209> empty

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
wizards at the bottom and on the Left I

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
took out the elixir pump so this rate is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.100 
took out the elixir pump so this rate is
going<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.580> well<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.120> still<00:02:30.390> took<00:02:30.630> out<00:02:30.840> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
going really well I still took out a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.900 
going really well I still took out a
little<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.769> gold<00:02:31.980> with<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> wizard<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.760> the

little bit of gold with a wizard on the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.780 
little bit of gold with a wizard on the
side<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:34.290> couldn't<00:02:34.680> pop<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.160> three<00:02:35.430> star

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
side and I couldn't pop that three star

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.000 
side and I couldn't pop that three star
because<00:02:36.180> there<00:02:36.360> still<00:02:36.630> were<00:02:36.930> like<00:02:37.140> five<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
because there still were like five the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.740 
because there still were like five the
cams<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.489> archer<00:02:38.790> towers<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.390> Tesla's

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
cams and archer towers and the Tesla's

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.449 
cams and archer towers and the Tesla's

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
are in the pain-in-the-ass the mortar

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.670 
are in the pain-in-the-ass the mortar
and<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.670> air<00:02:41.819> defenses<00:02:42.269> don't<00:02:42.569> matter

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and the air defenses don't matter

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.400 
and the air defenses don't matter
but<00:02:44.670> that's<00:02:45.209> other<00:02:45.360> offense<00:02:45.690> would<00:02:45.959> be<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> pain

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
but that's other offense would be a pain

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.350 
but that's other offense would be a pain
in<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> ass<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:47.280> my<00:02:47.640> golems<00:02:48.000> were<00:02:48.150> still

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.830 
in the ass but if my golems were still
alive

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
