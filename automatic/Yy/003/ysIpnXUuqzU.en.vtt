00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.610
 Today I woke up inspired by the word 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.799
 God and I want to get a message 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.129
 For you, what I'm feeling in mine. 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:17.100
 My heart has been thinking a lot about 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.820
 importance of doing well 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.850
 our plantation of the day and I found 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.020
 here in the word of God a psalm 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.030
 It's 126 that I want to read to you. 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.040
 When the Lord God brought us back 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.460
 to jerusalem 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.010
 It seemed like we were dreaming like rivers. 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.949
 enchanting with joy then the other 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.460
 nations said you made great 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.920
 things for them in fact you did 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.179
 great things for us and for that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 we are happy or without the phase with which 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:58.140
 let us prosper again just as rain and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.559
 dry bed of the rivers that 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.470
 those who sow crying do 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.400
 harvest with joy to those who left 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.400
 crying taking the seed to sow 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 they came back singing full of joy 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.740
 doing in arms 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.560
 the bundles of the harvest amen look people and 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.050
 except it is very deep 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.090
 there's a part of a verse that I like 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.390
 very always 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.790
 proclaiming that it is great things made the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.120
 lord for us so we're glad 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.090
 because we should be thankful to God 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.720
 every day regardless of the situation 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.640
 because I 'm sure God is good 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.980
 all the time 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.220
 massamÃ¡ the specific message that I 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:51.660
 I want to share with you is at 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.150
 verse 126 says that those who 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.560
 who sow crying do the harvest 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.140
 with joy is a prophetic message is 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.930
 A god plan in your life I do not know 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.090
 How is your sowing in that moment? 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.369
 how are you doing 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.400
 the planting of your wonder garden 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.340
 But I wish that every time you 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.129
 go out to sow in your day to day 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.069
 personal spiritual life in the 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.920
 your health not independent if you left 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.049
 to sow weeping with sacrifices with 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.860
 fights with challenges 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:34.180
 Believe when you come back from this harvest. 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.040
 You're going to come back happy, smiling, because it's 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.260
 This is what God has for us. 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.480
 we often have to pay the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.940
 price 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.160
 so in a team for example as 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.560
 professionals tell us to pay the price 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.349
 success to pay the price of success 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.930
 it is often leave to be crying 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.609
 I am weeping in quotation marks because our 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.079
 work is very tasty but sometimes 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.989
 with sacrifice 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.040
 Many mothers leave their children at home. 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.440
 husbands often we are 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.560
 tired and discouraged and we need 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.750
 We get up and we leave home to 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.480
 enrich lives transform the lives of 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:20.919
 people and in very very very very 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.319
 we have done this with sacrifice 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.120
 even though we know we have 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.620
 something much better up front that is a 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.319
 beautiful harvest 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.049
 we know that if we plant good ones 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.540
 fruits we will reap good fruits 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.010
 if we plant bad fruit, let's go 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.109

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.310
