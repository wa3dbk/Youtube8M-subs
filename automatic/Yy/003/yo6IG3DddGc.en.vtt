00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
saw now one of the issues I have with

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.690 
saw now one of the issues I have with
this<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.800> paint<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> know<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.670> be

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this is the paint and I know it can be

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.010 
this is the paint and I know it can be
really<00:00:38.790> nitpicky<00:00:39.360> about<00:00:39.390> paint<00:00:39.690> sometimes

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
really nitpicky about paint sometimes

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.090 
really nitpicky about paint sometimes
but<00:00:40.230> once<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.440> guys<00:00:40.530> take<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> closer<00:00:40.980> look

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
but once you guys take a closer look

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.069 
but once you guys take a closer look
right<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.570> I'm<00:00:42.750> totally

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
right here and see that I'm totally

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.610 
right here and see that I'm totally
kidding

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
kidding

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.139 
kidding
there<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:44.190> paint<00:00:44.460> issues<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:44.910> because

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
there are no paint issues at all because

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.430 
there are no paint issues at all because
there's<00:00:45.329> no<00:00:45.420> paint<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.989> literally<00:00:46.410> all

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
there's no paint it's literally all

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.020 
there's no paint it's literally all
sculpt<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.550> did<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.730> great<00:00:47.910> job

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
sculpt and I think they did a great job

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
sculpt and I think they did a great job
with<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:49.230> picked<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.829> good<00:00:50.010> like

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
with this they picked a really good like

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.150 
with this they picked a really good like
translucent<00:00:50.969> clear<00:00:51.750> looking<00:00:52.020> blue<00:00:52.379> material

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
translucent clear looking blue material

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.010 
translucent clear looking blue material
for<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.719> reads<00:00:54.899> really

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
for this and I think it reads really

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.479 
for this and I think it reads really
well<00:00:55.289> because<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.559> doesn't<00:00:55.800> come<00:00:55.949> across<00:00:56.250> as

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
well because it doesn't come across as

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.970 
well because it doesn't come across as
plastic<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.270> does<00:00:57.420> read<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
plastic it really does read as I see so

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
plastic it really does read as I see so
good<00:00:59.010> job<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.690> like

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
good job to them on that and what I like

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.939 
good job to them on that and what I like
about<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.469> really<00:01:01.559> lets<00:01:01.859> you

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949

about this is it really lets you
appreciate<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> sculpt<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.420> like

over
especially<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> braids<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> braids

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
especially the braids I think the braids

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.510 
especially the braids I think the braids
look<00:01:10.020> really<00:01:10.229> cool<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.369> like

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
look really cool but what I really like

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.980 
look really cool but what I really like
is<00:01:11.700> there's<00:01:11.939> no<00:01:12.060> neck<00:01:12.390> disk

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
is there's no neck disk

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.510 
is there's no neck disk
you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.290> usually<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.710> neck<00:01:13.920> connects<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you know usually the neck connects to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.920 
you know usually the neck connects to
this<00:01:14.640> disc<00:01:14.909> which<00:01:15.090> connects<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> head<00:01:15.750> but

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
this disc which connects to the head but

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.149 
this disc which connects to the head but
this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> neck<00:01:16.860> going

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
this is just like the neck going

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.249 
this is just like the neck going
straight<00:01:17.729> into<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> head<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> I

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
straight into the head and I like that I

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499 
straight into the head and I like that I
wish<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:19.650> pops<00:01:19.890> could<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:21.240> can't

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
wish more pops could do that you can't

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.179 
wish more pops could do that you can't

he<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.159> nitpicky<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> say<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.909> not

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
he can be nitpicky to say this is not

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.580 
he can be nitpicky to say this is not
the<00:01:54.210> pose<00:01:54.479> she's<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.079> she<00:01:55.229> gets<00:01:55.409> frozen

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the pose she's in when she gets frozen

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.050 
the pose she's in when she gets frozen
at<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> end<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.130> movie<00:01:56.340> spoiler<00:01:56.880> alert

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
at the end in the movie spoiler alert

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.310 
at the end in the movie spoiler alert
but<00:01:57.270> that's<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:57.960> they're<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.200> for

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
but that's not what they're going for

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.539 
but that's not what they're going for
they're<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.740> taking<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.040> pop<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
they're just taking the pop that you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.160 
they're just taking the pop that you
already<00:01:59.640> have<00:02:00.149> or<00:02:00.360> might<00:02:00.570> want<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.020> they're

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
already have or might want and they're

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.959 
already have or might want and they're
doing<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> cool<00:02:01.619> variation<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.850> go

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
doing a cool variation on it it's not go

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.700 
doing a cool variation on it it's not go
for<00:02:03.149> screen<00:02:03.299> accuracy<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.380> regard<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
for screen accuracy and in that regard I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770 
for screen accuracy and in that regard I
think<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.979> does<00:02:05.130> look<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.549> cool<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.060> dig

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
think this does look really cool I dig

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.670 
think this does look really cool I dig
the<00:02:06.960> crap<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the crap out of it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680 
the crap out of it
lastly<00:02:08.520> here's<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.789> comparison<00:02:09.090> between<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
lastly here's a comparison between the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.540 
lastly here's a comparison between the
exclusive<00:02:10.140> ona<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.800> regular<00:02:11.129> one<00:02:11.340> I

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
exclusive ona and the regular one I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.730 
exclusive ona and the regular one I
think<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:12.450> complement<00:02:12.840> each<00:02:12.870> other<00:02:13.050> nicely

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
think they complement each other nicely

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
think they complement each other nicely
but<00:02:13.950> she<00:02:14.130> also<00:02:14.250> works<00:02:14.580> very<00:02:14.760> well<00:02:14.850> on<00:02:15.000> her<00:02:15.210> own

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
but she also works very well on her own

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.260 
but she also works very well on her own
as<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.140> really<00:02:16.440> awesome<00:02:16.620> pop<00:02:17.150> thanks<00:02:18.150> for
