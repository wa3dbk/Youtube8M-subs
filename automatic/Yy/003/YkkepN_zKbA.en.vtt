00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.360 
are in our nikon coolpix camera now the
nice<00:04:54.570> thing<00:04:54.840> about<00:04:54.870> this<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:56.160> if<00:04:56.250> you're

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
nice thing about this and if you're

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.580 
nice thing about this and if you're
researching<00:04:56.759> these<00:04:57.180> there's<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.080> lot<00:04:58.349> of<00:04:58.470> them

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
researching these there's a lot of them

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.200 
researching these there's a lot of them
that<00:04:58.740> do<00:04:58.860> different<00:04:59.130> things<00:04:59.699> this<00:04:59.970> one

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
that do different things this one

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.080 
that do different things this one
actually<00:05:00.690> acts<00:05:01.050> as<00:05:01.530> extra<00:05:02.310> room<00:05:02.610> in<00:05:02.880> your

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
actually acts as extra room in your

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.960 
actually acts as extra room in your
phone<00:05:03.389> meaning<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.229> plug<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.949> SD<00:05:05.430> card<00:05:05.669> into

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
phone meaning you plug the SD card into

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.120 
phone meaning you plug the SD card into
the<00:05:06.210> reader<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.750> then<00:05:07.139> plug<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.530> reader<00:05:07.740> into

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
the reader and then plug the reader into

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.420 
the reader and then plug the reader into
your<00:05:08.250> phone<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.849> now<00:05:09.840> it's<00:05:10.110> not<00:05:10.289> just<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:11.190> take

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
your phone and now it's not just to take

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.180 
your phone and now it's not just to take
the<00:05:11.699> images<00:05:12.300> or<00:05:12.509> the<00:05:12.599> videos<00:05:12.960> from<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:13.830> SD

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
the images or the videos from the SD

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.800 
the images or the videos from the SD
card<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.580> put<00:05:14.729> them<00:05:14.849> on<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.060> your<00:05:15.180> phone<00:05:15.389> you

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
card and put them on to your phone you

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.839 
card and put them on to your phone you
can<00:05:15.990> actually<00:05:16.199> use<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:17.130> manipulate<00:05:17.669> them

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
can actually use and manipulate them

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.020 
can actually use and manipulate them
from<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.750> SD<00:05:19.139> card<00:05:19.470> so<00:05:19.979> it<00:05:20.099> actually<00:05:20.460> extends

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
from the SD card so it actually extends

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.570 
from the SD card so it actually extends
the<00:05:21.389> storage<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:21.990> your<00:05:22.050> phone<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.710> makes<00:05:23.460> it

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
the storage of your phone and makes it

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.610 
the storage of your phone and makes it
where<00:05:23.699> you<00:05:23.789> don't<00:05:23.940> have<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.320> actually<00:05:25.320> drag

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
where you don't have to actually drag

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.040 
where you don't have to actually drag
and<00:05:25.650> drop<00:05:26.070> these<00:05:26.340> these<00:05:26.910> images<00:05:27.599> and<00:05:27.810> files

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
and drop these these images and files

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.779 
and drop these these images and files
onto<00:05:28.349> your<00:05:28.590> phone<00:05:28.860> before<00:05:29.070> you<00:05:29.310> can<00:05:29.430> access

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
onto your phone before you can access

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.149 
onto your phone before you can access
them<00:05:29.970> so<00:05:30.150> it's<00:05:30.270> really<00:05:30.539> just<00:05:30.870> like<00:05:31.159> allowing

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
them so it's really just like allowing

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.029 
them so it's really just like allowing
you<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.550> have<00:05:32.669> more<00:05:33.030> storage<00:05:33.360> on<00:05:33.570> your<00:05:33.750> phone

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
you to have more storage on your phone

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.010 
you to have more storage on your phone
and<00:05:35.039> it<00:05:35.190> comes<00:05:35.370> directly<00:05:35.789> from<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.419> SD<00:05:36.539> card

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
and it comes directly from the SD card

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.950 
and it comes directly from the SD card
so<00:05:37.710> a<00:05:37.740> bigger<00:05:38.250> SD<00:05:38.669> card<00:05:38.940> could<00:05:39.150> just<00:05:39.300> expand

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
so a bigger SD card could just expand

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.779 
so a bigger SD card could just expand
your<00:05:40.110> phone<00:05:40.320> storage<00:05:40.650> even<00:05:40.860> more<00:05:41.159> along<00:05:41.550> with

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
your phone storage even more along with

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.909 
your phone storage even more along with
not<00:05:42.090> having<00:05:42.360> enough<00:05:42.840> battery<00:05:43.320> we<00:05:43.680> got<00:05:43.830> to

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
not having enough battery we got to

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.320 
not having enough battery we got to
worry<00:05:44.099> about<00:05:44.159> charging<00:05:44.940> all<00:05:45.060> of<00:05:45.210> these

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
worry about charging all of these

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.089 
worry about charging all of these
devices<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:46.320> lot<00:05:46.500> of<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.710> time<00:05:46.889> you're

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
devices and a lot of the time you're

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.010 
devices and a lot of the time you're
going<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.250> be<00:05:47.370> limited<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:47.940> just<00:05:48.240> one<00:05:48.659> outlet

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
going to be limited to just one outlet

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.890 
going to be limited to just one outlet
so<00:05:49.500> we<00:05:49.650> purchased<00:05:50.099> an<00:05:50.340> anchor<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.300> wall<00:05:51.720> adapter

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
so we purchased an anchor a wall adapter

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.950 
so we purchased an anchor a wall adapter
which<00:05:52.740> allows<00:05:53.070> us<00:05:53.430> to<00:05:53.610> use<00:05:54.060> one<00:05:54.360> outlet<00:05:54.750> to

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
which allows us to use one outlet to

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.200 
which allows us to use one outlet to
charge<00:05:55.169> up<00:05:55.440> to<00:05:55.470> four<00:05:55.889> different<00:05:56.099> USB<00:05:56.759> devices

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
charge up to four different USB devices

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.620 
charge up to four different USB devices
at<00:05:57.509> the<00:05:57.599> same<00:05:57.630> time<00:05:58.110> now<00:05:58.710> be<00:05:58.889> wary<00:05:59.130> when<00:05:59.370> buying

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
at the same time now be wary when buying

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.760 
at the same time now be wary when buying
