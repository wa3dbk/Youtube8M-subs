00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.430 
print look but I mean at the same time
it's<00:02:23.090> just<00:02:23.209> like<00:02:23.420> kind<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.840> funky<00:02:24.260> design

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
it's just like kind of a funky design

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.370 
it's just like kind of a funky design
almost<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.310> shape<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.640> hearts<00:02:26.030> if

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
almost like in the shape of hearts if

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.620 
almost like in the shape of hearts if
you<00:02:27.380> want<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.680> really<00:02:28.040> stretch<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.430> out<00:02:28.669> I<00:02:29.000> did

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
you want to really stretch it out I did

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.390 
you want to really stretch it out I did
like<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.019> they<00:02:30.169> decided<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.829> not<00:02:31.010> just<00:02:31.250> do

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
like that they decided to not just do

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.350 
like that they decided to not just do
the<00:02:31.579> typical

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
the typical

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.540 
the typical
black<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:33.350> they<00:02:33.500> actually<00:02:33.830> put<00:02:34.040> some<00:02:34.310> color

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
black that they actually put some color

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.270 
black that they actually put some color
on<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.850> end<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.270> laces<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.960> was<00:02:36.830> able<00:02:36.980> to

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
on the end of the laces I was able to

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.910 
on the end of the laces I was able to
hit<00:02:37.580> on<00:02:37.850> lace<00:02:38.420> supply<00:02:38.810> when<00:02:39.200> they<00:02:39.380> restock

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
hit on lace supply when they restock

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.810 
hit on lace supply when they restock
those<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:41.750> know<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.050> screw<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.410> laces<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.520> I

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
those you know the screw on laces and I

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.670 
those you know the screw on laces and I
got<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.060> red<00:02:44.270> ones<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.810> then<00:02:45.020> a<00:02:45.050> black<00:02:45.410> pair

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
got the red ones and then a black pair

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.350 
got the red ones and then a black pair
that's<00:02:45.830> coming<00:02:46.100> in<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.730> I'll<00:02:46.820> definitely<00:02:47.240> be

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
that's coming in so I'll definitely be

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.730 
that's coming in so I'll definitely be
throwing<00:02:47.690> those<00:02:47.840> in<00:02:48.050> to<00:02:48.200> see<00:02:48.350> what<00:02:48.620> they<00:02:48.710> look

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
throwing those in to see what they look

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.340 
throwing those in to see what they look
like<00:02:49.100> with<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.790> think<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.210> red<00:02:50.390> might<00:02:50.630> be

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
like with this I think the red might be

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.950 
like with this I think the red might be
off<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.620> little<00:02:51.830> bit<00:02:52.190> but<00:02:52.880> either<00:02:53.360> way<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.900> just

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
off a little bit but either way I just

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.530 
off a little bit but either way I just
want<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.380> try<00:02:54.680> out<00:02:54.800> some<00:02:54.830> different<00:02:55.280> options

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
want to try out some different options

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.030 
want to try out some different options
inside<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.690> shoe<00:02:56.870> not<00:02:57.110> much<00:02:57.320> really<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.740> see

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
inside the shoe not much really to see

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.980 
inside the shoe not much really to see
it's<00:02:58.310> just<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:59.120> very<00:02:59.270> bottom<00:02:59.690> you<00:02:59.810> can<00:02:59.960> see

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
it's just the very bottom you can see

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.710 
it's just the very bottom you can see
the<00:03:00.170> Nike<00:03:00.950> swoosh<00:03:01.130> in<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.610> air<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.210> back<00:03:02.390> pull

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
tab which reads foamposite that crazy

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.160 
tab which reads foamposite that crazy
back<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:07.070> pattern<00:03:07.790> here<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.330> then<00:03:08.540> also<00:03:08.870> the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170

swoosh that's on the back of it my pair

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.000 
swoosh that's on the back of it my pair
didn't<00:03:11.690> have<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.870> lot<00:03:12.230> but<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.560> can<00:03:12.590> see<00:03:12.980> a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
didn't have a lot but you can see a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.520 
didn't have a lot but you can see a
couple<00:03:13.640> little<00:03:14.209> spots<00:03:14.540> where<00:03:14.720> they<00:03:14.959> were<00:03:15.020> lazy

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
couple little spots where they were lazy

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.040 
couple little spots where they were lazy
as<00:03:15.830> far<00:03:16.070> as<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.370> glue<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.940> not<00:03:17.570> cleaning<00:03:17.870> it

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
as far as the glue and not cleaning it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.260 
as far as the glue and not cleaning it
up<00:03:18.170> very<00:03:18.380> well<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:19.190> plan<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:19.880> wearing<00:03:20.060> these

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
up very well but I plan on wearing these

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.699 
up very well but I plan on wearing these
so<00:03:20.570> it's<00:03:20.690> not<00:03:20.780> really<00:03:21.110> something<00:03:21.350> that's<00:03:21.620> that

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
so it's not really something that's that

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.650 
so it's not really something that's that
big<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.130> deal<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.400> me<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.270> kind<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.510> see

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
big of a deal to me you can kind of see

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.390 
big of a deal to me you can kind of see
there<00:03:23.870> how<00:03:24.140> it's<00:03:24.500> just<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.770> little<00:03:24.890> messy

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
there how it's just a little messy

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.270 
there how it's just a little messy
the<00:03:25.820> normal<00:03:26.270> foamposite<00:03:27.020> pro<00:03:27.050> bottom<00:03:27.680> except

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
guys as far as the EZ colorway getting

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.580 
guys as far as the EZ colorway getting
played<00:03:37.580> out<00:03:37.610> or<00:03:38.060> did<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.660> guys<00:03:38.780> still<00:03:39.170> really

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
played out or did you guys still really

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.350

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
being able to grab the actually Z's I

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.790 
being able to grab the actually Z's I
think<00:03:44.330> I<00:03:44.480> could<00:03:44.630> get<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.810> spot<00:03:45.140> on<00:03:45.170> job<00:03:45.590> with

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
think I could get a spot on job with

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.890 
think I could get a spot on job with
this<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.280> really<00:03:46.760> like<00:03:46.970> what<00:03:47.180> they<00:03:47.300> turned<00:03:47.750> out

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.810 
this I really like what they turned out
to<00:03:48.050> look<00:03:48.080> like<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.709> think<00:03:48.830> they<00:03:49.130> look<00:03:49.340> even

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
to look like I think they look even

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.820 
to look like I think they look even
better<00:03:50.030> on<00:03:50.330> feet<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:51.080> I'll<00:03:51.260> definitely<00:03:51.470> show
