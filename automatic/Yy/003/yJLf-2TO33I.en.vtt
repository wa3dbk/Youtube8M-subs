key that it's on i've regulated it so
that<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> correct<00:00:48.600> height

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
that it is it at the correct height

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.549 
that it is it at the correct height
standard<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.789> about<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> half<00:00:51.390> inch<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.500> know

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
standard is about a half inch you know

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.189 
standard is about a half inch you know
anywhere<00:00:53.399> between<00:00:53.870> probably<00:00:54.870> fifteen

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
anywhere between probably fifteen

anywhere between probably fifteen
sixteenths<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> half<00:00:56.460> inch<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.449> know

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
sixteenths up to a half inch you know

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.260 
sixteenths up to a half inch you know
some<00:00:57.780> pianos<00:00:58.170> will<00:00:58.440> require<00:00:59.010> slightly<00:00:59.699> more

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
some pianos will require slightly more

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.540 
some pianos will require slightly more
but<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:01.350> most<00:01:01.620> cases<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> go

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
but in most cases you don't want to go

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.119 
but in most cases you don't want to go
over<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> half<00:01:03.570> inch<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> sharp

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
over a half inch for for the sharp

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.630 
over a half inch for for the sharp
height<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> I've<00:01:07.500> got<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.770> regulated<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
height so I've got this regulated at a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
height so I've got this regulated at a
half<00:01:08.850> inch<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.850> key<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
half inch and so this this key is at the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.859 
half inch and so this this key is at the
right<00:01:13.290> point<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.299> in<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> moment<00:01:15.720> I'll<00:01:15.840> show

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
right point and in a moment I'll show

you level the sharps you want to make

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.590 
you level the sharps you want to make
sure<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.729> white<00:02:02.909> notes<00:02:03.090> are<00:02:03.299> sharp

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
sure that the white notes are sharp

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.929 
sure that the white notes are sharp
which<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.530> may<00:02:04.770> already<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.250> noticed<00:02:05.369> that

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
which you may already have noticed that

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
which you may already have noticed that
I<00:02:05.969> don't<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.329> them<00:02:07.079> level<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.740> piano

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I don't have them level on this piano

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.109 
I don't have them level on this piano
you<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.220> see<00:02:08.459> there's<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> different

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you can see there's a different

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.630 
you can see there's a different
difference<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.140> height<00:02:10.319> between<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:11.400> key

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
difference in height between this key

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.020 
difference in height between this key
and<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.819> key<00:02:11.970> but

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
and that key but

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.850 
and that key but
I'll<00:02:15.030> do<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.239> down<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.690> road<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.020> for<00:02:16.800> at

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
I'll do that down the road but for at

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.089 
I'll do that down the road but for at
this<00:02:16.980> point<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.700> we've<00:02:17.879> got<00:02:18.230> these<00:02:19.230> two<00:02:19.650> you

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
this point and we've got these two you

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.040 
this point and we've got these two you
can<00:02:20.160> see<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.760> one<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.599> gonna<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
can see that this one it's gonna have to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.500 
can see that this one it's gonna have to
come<00:02:22.230> up<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.280> did<00:02:23.489> have<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.819> raise<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.269> one

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
come up and I did have to raise this one

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.559 
come up and I did have to raise this one
to<00:02:24.660> get<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.140> right<00:02:25.319> height<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.569> I'm

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
to get it to the right height so I'm

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.600 
to get it to the right height so I'm
gonna<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.989> probably<00:02:28.140> raise<00:02:28.530> most<00:02:29.400> of

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
gonna have to probably raise most of

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.500 
gonna have to probably raise most of
these<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:29.970> course<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.269> want<00:02:30.450> to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
these and of course you want to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.570 
these and of course you want to
determine<00:02:31.019> what<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.470> right<00:02:31.680> height<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.160> first

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
determine what the right height is first

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.240 
determine what the right height is first
before<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:33.090> start<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.250> adjusting

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
before you start going and adjusting

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.280 
before you start going and adjusting
them<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.700> know<00:02:35.819> based<00:02:36.120> on<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.780> amount<00:02:37.260> of

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
them you know based on the amount of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.610 
them you know based on the amount of
aftertouch<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.750> key<00:02:39.750> dip<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.290> forth

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
aftertouch and and key dip and so forth

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.400 
aftertouch and and key dip and so forth
and<00:02:40.830> all<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.130> before<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.720> determining

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
and all that before you so determining

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.100 
and all that before you so determining
all<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.799> first<00:02:44.330> what<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> right<00:02:45.660> height<00:02:45.900> is

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
all that first what the right height is

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.930 
all that first what the right height is
for<00:02:46.410> your<00:02:46.530> piano<00:02:46.709> might<00:02:47.099> be<00:02:47.250> slightly<00:02:47.580> lower

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
for your piano might be slightly lower

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.809 
for your piano might be slightly lower
than<00:02:48.060> than<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.959> half<00:02:49.230> inch<00:02:49.440> but<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.580> piano

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
than than a half inch but on this piano

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.550 
than than a half inch but on this piano
I've<00:02:51.120> determined<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.690> half<00:02:51.900> inches<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
I've determined that half inches is a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.479 
I've determined that half inches is a
good<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.810> as<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.989> go<00:02:55.110> from<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:56.069> key<00:02:56.310> to

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
good so as you go from one one key to

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.970 
good so as you go from one one key to
the<00:02:56.579> next<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.170> see<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.560> most<00:02:58.799> of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
the next and you can see that most of

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.949 
the next and you can see that most of
these<00:02:59.040> are<00:02:59.099> gonna<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.700> be<00:02:59.819> raised<00:03:00.660> up

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
these are gonna have to be raised up

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.080 
these are gonna have to be raised up
okay<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.650> what<00:03:01.769> you're<00:03:01.950> doing<00:03:02.069> in<00:03:02.400> I'll<00:03:02.910> show

you'll do we to try to determine that

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.470 
you'll do we to try to determine that
actually<00:03:37.859> all<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.040> these<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:39.060> one<00:03:39.299> will

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
actually all of these but this one will

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.809 
actually all of these but this one will
start<00:03:39.810> with<00:03:39.959> needs<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.829> come<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.040> okay<00:03:41.430> what

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
start with needs to come up okay what

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
the balance rail felt okay there's gonna

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.789 
the balance rail felt okay there's gonna
be<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.840> at<00:03:55.769> least<00:03:55.950> there<00:03:56.099> should<00:03:56.130> be<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:57.799> felt

II love how much how much punching you
need<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:31.380> add<00:04:32.000> based<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.240> how<00:04:33.390> high<00:04:33.630> or<00:04:33.690> low<00:04:33.870> it

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
need to add based on how high or low it

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.670 
need to add based on how high or low it
is<00:04:37.010> okay<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.040> know<00:04:38.160> I've<00:04:38.280> added<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:40.530> I'm

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
is okay you know I've added that and I'm

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.930 
is okay you know I've added that and I'm
gonna<00:04:40.860> check<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.310> now<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.460> won't<00:04:41.670> be<00:04:41.730> able<00:04:41.790> to

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
gonna check it now you won't be able to

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.030 
gonna check it now you won't be able to
see<00:04:42.210> here<00:04:42.600> with<00:04:42.780> but<00:04:43.050> that's<00:04:43.440> much<00:04:43.740> closer

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
see here with but that's much closer

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.360 
see here with but that's much closer
it's<00:04:44.430> probably<00:04:45.360> could<00:04:45.540> use<00:04:45.570> another<00:04:46.220> three<00:04:47.220> or

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
it's probably could use another three or

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.310 
it's probably could use another three or
five<00:04:47.610> thousandths<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.390> an<00:04:48.510> inch<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:48.870> punching

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
five thousandths of an inch of punching

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.350 
five thousandths of an inch of punching
to<00:04:50.010> bring<00:04:50.190> it<00:04:50.310> up<00:04:50.460> to<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:51.000> where<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:51.300> should<00:04:51.480> be

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
to bring it up to so where it should be

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.480 
to bring it up to so where it should be
if<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.450> hit<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.660> hit<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.500> hard<00:04:55.800> it'll<00:04:56.010> click<00:04:56.280> but

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
if I hit it hit it hard it'll click but

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.550 
if I hit it hit it hard it'll click but
I<00:04:56.580> can<00:04:56.760> see<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.090> there's<00:04:57.330> there's<00:04:58.140> just<00:04:58.410> a

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
I can see that there's there's just a

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.400 
I can see that there's there's just a
slight<00:04:59.130> amount<00:04:59.669> a<00:04:59.730> gap<00:04:59.970> there<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:00.480> so<00:05:01.140> that<00:05:01.290> at

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
slight amount a gap there so so that at

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.320 
slight amount a gap there so so that at
least<00:05:01.530> gets<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:01.950> close<00:05:02.070> and<00:05:02.490> like<00:05:02.760> I<00:05:02.910> say<00:05:03.090> I<00:05:03.120> can

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
least gets it close and like I say I can

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.510 
least gets it close and like I say I can
take<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.630> key<00:05:03.810> off<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.200> add<00:05:04.290> another<00:05:04.560> another

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
take the key off and add another another

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.040 
take the key off and add another another
white<00:05:05.820> punching<00:05:06.330> would<00:05:06.450> be<00:05:06.540> which<00:05:06.870> would<00:05:06.900> be

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
white punching would be which would be

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.260 
white punching would be which would be
three<00:05:07.290> thousandths<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.890> an<00:05:08.010> inch<00:05:08.100> or<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.430> green

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
three thousandths of an inch or a green

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
three thousandths of an inch or a green
we<00:05:09.810> step<00:05:10.110> five<00:05:10.560> thousandths<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.190> an<00:05:11.310> inch

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
we step five thousandths of an inch

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.600 
we step five thousandths of an inch
just<00:05:13.290> to<00:05:13.380> bring<00:05:13.530> it<00:05:13.680> up<00:05:13.800> okay<00:05:14.190> so<00:05:14.250> that's<00:05:14.520> how

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
just to bring it up okay so that's how

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.670 
just to bring it up okay so that's how
to<00:05:14.700> how<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.270> level<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:15.900> get<00:05:16.260> them<00:05:16.380> all<00:05:16.500> the

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
to how to level and get them all the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.600 
to how to level and get them all the
same<00:05:16.890> height<00:05:18.140> now<00:05:19.140> here<00:05:19.410> I've<00:05:19.500> got<00:05:19.680> another

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
same height now here I've got another

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.770 
same height now here I've got another
one<00:05:20.850> I'm<00:05:20.970> going<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.150> show<00:05:21.390> you<00:05:21.450> how<00:05:21.600> do<00:05:21.660> I

one I'm going to show you how do I
adjust<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:23.280> tool<00:05:23.520> to<00:05:23.790> get<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.150> right

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
adjust the tool to get to the right

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.060 
adjust the tool to get to the right
height<00:05:24.480> we<00:05:24.660> have<00:05:24.690> there's<00:05:25.260> two<00:05:25.440> adjustments

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.750 
little bit and then you just tighten it
down<00:05:47.640> too<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.360> get<00:05:48.780> it<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.050> set<00:05:49.310> so<00:05:50.310> you<00:05:50.370> can<00:05:50.610> do

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
down too to get it to set so you can do

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.270 
down too to get it to set so you can do
that<00:05:50.970> and<00:05:51.330> then<00:05:51.660> to<00:05:51.900> make<00:05:52.080> fine<00:05:52.380> a<00:05:52.410> smaller

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
that and then to make fine a smaller

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.909 
that and then to make fine a smaller
adjustments<00:05:53.750> you've<00:05:54.750> got<00:05:55.490> this<00:05:57.350> cylinder<00:05:58.350> or

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
adjustments you've got this cylinder or

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.469 
adjustments you've got this cylinder or
threaded<00:05:59.220> cylinder<00:05:59.669> that<00:05:59.850> will<00:06:00.030> go<00:06:00.150> up<00:06:00.330> and

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
threaded cylinder that will go up and

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.780 
threaded cylinder that will go up and
down<00:06:00.570> okay<00:06:01.530> and<00:06:01.560> it's<00:06:01.800> got<00:06:01.979> this<00:06:02.160> collet<00:06:02.640> here

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
down okay and it's got this collet here

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.370 
down okay and it's got this collet here
that'll<00:06:03.150> that<00:06:03.540> holds<00:06:03.780> it<00:06:03.870> in<00:06:03.990> place<00:06:04.110> you're

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
that'll that holds it in place you're

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.040 
that'll that holds it in place you're
just<00:06:04.440> gonna<00:06:04.740> loosen<00:06:04.950> that<00:06:05.250> up<00:06:05.630> and<00:06:06.630> you<00:06:06.810> can

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
just gonna loosen that up and you can

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
just gonna loosen that up and you can
either<00:06:07.229> if<00:06:07.830> you<00:06:07.979> turn<00:06:08.220> it<00:06:08.370> I<00:06:12.950> turn<00:06:13.950> it

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
either if you turn it I turn it

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.540 
either if you turn it I turn it
counterclockwise<00:06:14.430> that'll<00:06:15.419> raise<00:06:15.950> that<00:06:16.950> that

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
counterclockwise that'll raise that that

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.219 
counterclockwise that'll raise that that
threaded<00:06:17.880> cylinder<00:06:18.450> if<00:06:18.720> you<00:06:18.900> turn<00:06:19.110> it

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
threaded cylinder if you turn it

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.590 
threaded cylinder if you turn it
clockwise<00:06:19.710> it's<00:06:20.430> gonna<00:06:20.580> make<00:06:20.850> it<00:06:21.000> go<00:06:21.120> down<00:06:21.330> so

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
clockwise it's gonna make it go down so

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.480 
clockwise it's gonna make it go down so
once<00:06:21.810> you've<00:06:21.990> got<00:06:22.169> it<00:06:22.200> at<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:23.100> height<00:06:23.280> that

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
once you've got it at the height that

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.640 
once you've got it at the height that
you<00:06:23.640> wanted<00:06:23.970> it<00:06:24.090> at<00:06:24.210> and<00:06:24.690> you<00:06:24.780> can<00:06:24.960> either

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
you wanted it at and you can either

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.960 
you wanted it at and you can either
measure<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:26.070> by<00:06:26.190> the<00:06:26.250> key<00:06:26.580> or<00:06:26.820> you<00:06:26.940> can<00:06:27.090> take

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
measure it by the key or you can take

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.030 
measure it by the key or you can take
take<00:06:29.970> a<00:06:30.000> stainless<00:06:30.479> steel<00:06:30.510> rule<00:06:30.990> and<00:06:31.290> you<00:06:31.860> can

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
take a stainless steel rule and you can

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.340 
take a stainless steel rule and you can
measure<00:06:32.600> you<00:06:33.600> know<00:06:33.690> at<00:06:33.810> what<00:06:33.990> point<00:06:34.580> that

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
measure you know at what point that

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.830 
measure you know at what point that
that's<00:06:37.890> at<00:06:38.130> home<00:06:38.310> okay<00:06:38.520> now<00:06:38.640> I've<00:06:39.360> got<00:06:39.660> mine

can<00:06:44.640> see<00:06:44.910> that<00:06:44.940> it<00:06:45.270> doesn't<00:06:45.920> come<00:06:46.920> all<00:06:47.100> the<00:06:47.250> way

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
can see that it doesn't come all the way

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.800 
can see that it doesn't come all the way

right point you kind of hold that

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.680 
right point you kind of hold that
cylinder<00:07:07.200> in<00:07:07.320> place<00:07:07.560> and<00:07:07.890> then<00:07:08.760> lock<00:07:09.450> down

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
cylinder in place and then lock down

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.860 
cylinder in place and then lock down
your<00:07:09.720> collet<00:07:10.310> so<00:07:11.310> this<00:07:11.640> this<00:07:12.330> isn't<00:07:12.690> going<00:07:12.810> to

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
your collet so this this isn't going to

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.610 
your collet so this this isn't going to
move<00:07:13.050> at<00:07:13.200> all

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
move at all

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.980 
move at all
and<00:07:13.800> of<00:07:13.890> course<00:07:14.100> the<00:07:14.250> set<00:07:14.490> screw<00:07:14.880> holds<00:07:15.810> that

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
and of course the set screw holds that

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.050 
and of course the set screw holds that
the<00:07:16.470> flow<00:07:16.680> pin<00:07:16.920> in<00:07:17.040> place<00:07:17.070> okay<00:07:17.730> so<00:07:17.790> now

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
the flow pin in place okay so now

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.000 
the flow pin in place okay so now
everything's<00:07:18.480> locked<00:07:18.690> in<00:07:19.020> at<00:07:19.680> the<00:07:19.860> height

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 
everything's locked in at the height

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.650 
everything's locked in at the height
that<00:07:20.160> you<00:07:20.220> wanted<00:07:20.580> add<00:07:20.760> and<00:07:21.060> you<00:07:21.180> can<00:07:21.330> go<00:07:21.480> and

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 
that you wanted add and you can go and

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.280 
that you wanted add and you can go and
and<00:07:22.290> use<00:07:22.710> it<00:07:22.950> now<00:07:23.460> when<00:07:23.610> you<00:07:23.700> measure<00:07:24.110> it<00:07:25.110> might

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.290 
and use it now when you measure it might

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.630 
and use it now when you measure it might
have<00:07:25.440> a<00:07:25.470> little<00:07:25.710> different<00:07:25.980> measurement<00:07:26.520> back

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:26.640 
have a little different measurement back

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.890 
have a little different measurement back
here<00:07:26.910> than<00:07:27.060> you<00:07:27.150> do<00:07:27.240> in<00:07:27.390> the<00:07:27.450> front<00:07:27.660> so<00:07:27.810> you

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 
here than you do in the front so you

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.240 
here than you do in the front so you
want<00:07:28.020> to<00:07:28.080> measure<00:07:28.200> in<00:07:28.470> the<00:07:28.500> same<00:07:28.740> place<00:07:29.010> all

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.250 
want to measure in the same place all

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.740 
want to measure in the same place all
the<00:07:29.400> time<00:07:29.580> usually<00:07:29.730> it's<00:07:30.000> right<00:07:30.180> at<00:07:30.330> the<00:07:30.360> front

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:30.750 
the time usually it's right at the front

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.270 
the time usually it's right at the front
I<00:07:31.070> usually<00:07:32.070> put<00:07:32.280> the<00:07:32.460> front<00:07:32.730> edge<00:07:32.880> of<00:07:34.280> these

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 
I usually put the front edge of these

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.850 
I usually put the front edge of these
feet<00:07:36.050> right<00:07:37.050> at<00:07:37.230> the<00:07:37.320> front<00:07:37.530> edge<00:07:37.650> of<00:07:37.800> the

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 
feet right at the front edge of the

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.470 
feet right at the front edge of the
Sharpe<00:07:38.220> okay<00:07:38.880> and<00:07:39.000> that<00:07:39.090> gives<00:07:39.330> you<00:07:39.450> a

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:39.480 
Sharpe okay and that gives you a

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.860 
Sharpe okay and that gives you a
consistent<00:07:40.110> feel<00:07:41.100> so<00:07:41.430> that's<00:07:42.420> how<00:07:42.570> to<00:07:42.630> make

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:42.870 
consistent feel so that's how to make

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.430 
consistent feel so that's how to make
the<00:07:43.020> adjustments<00:07:43.650> to<00:07:44.220> the<00:07:44.460> to<00:07:45.180> the<00:07:45.330> tool<00:07:45.540> so

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 
the adjustments to the to the tool so

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.940 
the adjustments to the to the tool so
fairly<00:07:46.830> fairly<00:07:47.160> simple<00:07:47.610> tool<00:07:47.850> to<00:07:47.880> use<00:07:48.240> to

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:48.950 
fairly fairly simple tool to use to

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.650 
fairly fairly simple tool to use to
