00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.350
 I am leonora milan we are in the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.990
 educal bookstore in the national center of 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.420
 the arts in the green armchair I'm a biologist 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.340
 but I do not dedicate practically anything 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.379
 have to do with my area of 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.670
 academic specialization I'm from 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.710
 speaker drivers 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.239
 I have a hard time sitting in my 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.250
 house to decide good these two hours 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.899
 are going to be to read I feel that if 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.539
 I was going to paint the classes 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.250
 If I dedicate two hours to read more than 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.870
 a defense I have done as of 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.409
 take advantage of certain moments of my life and 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.360
 of my life to win a few pages at 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.399
 book that I'm reading in turn what 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.409
 I appreciate a lot for example is when 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.199
 I can go to all my activities 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.759
 subway day the metrobus and read and if I 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.130
 you say my ten-day vacation 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.710
 they will be reading an unlimited amount of 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.509
 books is a perfect action reading 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.450
 for me it's a thing that I do in transit 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.729
 or on vacation or when the girl yo 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.740
 already a lot had habits of 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.080
 reading that my mom could not of any 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.179
 way to sponsor for example we came to 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.860
 the book fair for children and youth and 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.179
 already for me it is now more father than 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.979
 Christmas because it was when I had better 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.720
 I would buy a bunch of books myself 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.030
 I came a moment in my childhood that in 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.470
 her two or three books a day now I 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.690
 happens , I have more books than time to 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.039
 read them especially the story 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.630
 endless that was one of the books 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.729
 What I wanted to recommend was 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.320
 probably the book that I read the most 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.420
 When i was a child 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.940
 almost always they ask me to recommend a 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.470
 book I talk about him and he does not give me any 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.780
 pity that it is a book that you find in 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.180
 the juvenile literature category both 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.310
 the endless story as how like as 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.520
 the tales of the exxon to harder and 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.050
 We can give you something and teach you something 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.110
 to people of any age the themes 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.420
 that they touch are very nailed if you want 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.190
 that are nailed and are only 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.149
 very nice story companies 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.519
 you want to take the smoke lightly 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.560
 It is very easy to nail tea in a novel of 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.860
 murakami I do not know if it's my favorite of 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.799
 murakami but I remember that it was 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.410
 probably the one who told me more things 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.570
 at the time I read it 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.420
 and this also suits a bit what 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.610
 murakami does in the other books that is 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.100
 explore the character a lot and just 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.690
 kafka who is the main character of 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.360
 Kafka on the shore is a little boy who 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.270
 that is going badly and at some point 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.750
 find 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.610
 with a character that is not real with 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.320
 who has more empathy and more closeness 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.450
 of characters that if you are in the 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.040
 day to day of his life that would be bad 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.170
 in a novel in my protagonist 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.200
 Talk to cats, this is one of those 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.800
 books that you do not discover but that you 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.540
 they recommend this is probably the 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.800
 only book that I would have liked that 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.280
 could be realized and I 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.130
 find me in that circumstance because 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.050
 speaks of a shared reading two 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.030
 people are reading the same book at 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.450
 same time and they are inside the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.010
 book that seems incredible to me imagine 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.290
 the possibility of saying that we are going to 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.510
 talk about the Lord of the Rings' and 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.010
 find the literal and be in that 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.010
 place by reading
