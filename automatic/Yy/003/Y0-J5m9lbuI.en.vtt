as you can see here it increases system

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.679 
as you can see here it increases system
performance<00:00:23.699> increases<00:00:24.060> amount<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.539> memory

that's<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> useful<00:00:31.529> thing<00:00:31.890> there<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
that's really a useful thing there and

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.120 
that's really a useful thing there and
also<00:00:33.899> does<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> lot<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.440> other<00:00:34.590> things<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.100> you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
also does a lot of other things as you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.370 
also does a lot of other things as you
can<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.520> prevent<00:00:36.239> system<00:00:36.600> crashes<00:00:36.840> caused<00:00:37.200> by

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
can see prevent system crashes caused by

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
can see prevent system crashes caused by
memory<00:00:37.680> problems<00:00:38.070> etc<00:00:38.370> etc<00:00:38.760> okay

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
memory problems etc etc okay

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
memory problems etc etc okay
there<00:00:40.290> are<00:00:40.620> obviously<00:00:40.980> these<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:41.460> small

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
there are obviously these are very small

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.420 
there are obviously these are very small
programs<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:43.020> download<00:00:43.440> they<00:00:43.770> work<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.219> all

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
programs to download they work on all

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
programs to download they work on all
Windows<00:00:44.789> operating<00:00:44.969> systems<00:00:45.570> including

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
Windows operating systems including

Windows operating systems including
Windows<00:00:46.350> 7<00:00:46.710> which<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> very<00:00:47.219> useful<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:48.059> so

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
Windows 7 which is very useful but so

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
Windows 7 which is very useful but so
they<00:00:48.360> mostly<00:00:48.899> today<00:00:49.170> most<00:00:49.620> people<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:50.309> at

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
they mostly today most people have at

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.630 
they mostly today most people have at
least<00:00:50.850> 4<00:00:51.270> gigs<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> memory<00:00:51.780> upwards<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.280> these

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
least 4 gigs of memory upwards so these

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
least 4 gigs of memory upwards so these
aren't<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.239> used<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.690> much<00:00:54.899> today<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.410> they

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
aren't really used as much today as they

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.319 
aren't really used as much today as they
were<00:00:55.860> back<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> day<00:00:56.550> when<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:56.969> only<00:00:57.120> had

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
were back in the day when we only had

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 
were back in the day when we only had
you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.660> half<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> mega<00:00:58.590> memory<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.100> know

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you know half a mega memory you know

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.080 
you know half a mega memory you know
like<00:00:59.460> say<00:00:59.879> 5<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.530> 12<00:01:01.530> makes<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.890> memory<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.460> now

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
like say 5 and 12 makes a memory of now

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.620 
like say 5 and 12 makes a memory of now
we've<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.600> got<00:01:03.870> 4<00:01:04.439> gigs<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.920> upwards<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.180> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
we've all got 4 gigs and upwards as I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.870 
we've all got 4 gigs and upwards as I
said<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.170> even<00:01:07.200> 2<00:01:07.680> gigs<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.790> if

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
said you know even 2 gigs really but if

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.460 
said you know even 2 gigs really but if
you're<00:01:09.000> using<00:01:09.270> something<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.570> Photoshop<00:01:09.930> or

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you're using something like Photoshop or

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
you're using something like Photoshop or
something<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.010> nature<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.640> these<00:01:11.909> do

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
something of that nature then these do

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.609 
something of that nature then these do
come<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.600> handy<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.170> want<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.380> clear<00:01:13.590> out

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
come in handy when you want to clear out

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.130 
come in handy when you want to clear out
some<00:01:13.979> memory<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.610> pull<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> back<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.570> pull<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
some memory and pull it back and pull it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
some memory and pull it back and pull it
back<00:01:16.320> ok<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.490> there's<00:01:17.670> some<00:01:17.850> little<00:01:18.119> look<00:01:18.270> that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
back ok so there's some little look that

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
back ok so there's some little look that
so<00:01:18.600> many<00:01:18.689> other<00:01:18.869> programs<00:01:19.380> we've<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.580> have

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
so many other programs we've got we have

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.910 
so many other programs we've got we have
also<00:01:20.939> got<00:01:21.420> memory<00:01:21.869> cleanup<00:01:22.350> which<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.680> another

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
also got memory cleanup which is another

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
also got memory cleanup which is another
freeware<00:01:23.400> program<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> from

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the description as I said this works in

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.850 
the description as I said this works in
Windows<00:01:28.710> 7<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.520> well<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.939> Vista<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> XP<00:01:31.020> so

all<00:01:32.009> operating<00:01:32.579> systems<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.840> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
all operating systems really which is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.520 
all operating systems really which is
pretty<00:01:34.350> useful<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.579> does<00:01:35.790> pretty<00:01:36.090> much

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
pretty useful and it does pretty much

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.719 
pretty useful and it does pretty much
pretty<00:01:37.530> much<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.009> same<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.460> everyone

pretty much the same as you everyone
really<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.360> there's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> little<00:01:40.140> button<00:01:40.560> there

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
really and there's a little button there

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.649 
really and there's a little button there
that's<00:01:40.979> called<00:01:41.310> clear<00:01:41.610> system<00:01:41.880> cache<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that's called clear system cache and

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.200 
that's called clear system cache and
that<00:01:43.500> will<00:01:43.829> reclaim<00:01:44.369> some<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:44.909> memory

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that will reclaim some of your memory

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.910 
that will reclaim some of your memory
back<00:01:45.479> especially<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.259> haven't<00:01:46.409> got<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> lot

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
back especially if you haven't got a lot

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.710 
back especially if you haven't got a lot
so<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> may<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.490> useful<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.570> you've

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
so it may be useful for you if you've

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.080 
so it may be useful for you if you've
only<00:01:48.810> got<00:01:48.960> say<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.890> amount<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.430> memory<00:01:50.610> say<00:01:50.880> 1

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
only got say that amount of memory say 1

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.399 
only got say that amount of memory say 1
gig<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.390> memory<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.899> gonna<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.140> very<00:01:52.290> useful

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
gig of memory it's gonna be very useful

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.010 
gig of memory it's gonna be very useful
for<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.640> sort<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.939> program<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.840> there's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
for you this sort of program so there's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
for you this sort of program so there's
some<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.409> look<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.979> last<00:01:56.310> one<00:01:56.640> we've

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
some a little look at the last one we've

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.999 
some a little look at the last one we've
got<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.270> called<00:01:57.509> MZ<00:01:58.140> Ram<00:01:58.439> Booster

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
got is called MZ Ram Booster

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.240 
got is called MZ Ram Booster
now<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.460> M<00:01:59.610> said<00:01:59.820> Ram<00:02:00.030> booster<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.950> does

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
now this is M said Ram booster it does

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.550 
now this is M said Ram booster it does
pretty<00:02:02.520> much<00:02:02.640> everything<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:04.079> you've<00:02:04.320> got

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
pretty much everything here you've got

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.609 
pretty much everything here you've got
actually<00:02:04.860> optimized<00:02:05.490> now<00:02:06.110> recover<00:02:07.110> memory

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
actually optimized now recover memory

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
actually optimized now recover memory
and<00:02:07.860> you've<00:02:08.069> also<00:02:08.250> got<00:02:08.640> start<00:02:08.970> optimization

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and you've also got start optimization

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.600 
and you've also got start optimization
and<00:02:10.080> you've<00:02:10.470> got<00:02:10.590> CPU<00:02:11.520> booster<00:02:12.030> now

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and you've got CPU booster now

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180 
and you've got CPU booster now
these<00:02:13.150> are<00:02:13.540> also<00:02:13.750> got<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.320> burr<00:02:14.380> option<00:02:14.770> tab<00:02:15.010> so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
these are also got a burr option tab so

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.310 
these are also got a burr option tab so
you<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:15.400> actually<00:02:15.820> tweak<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.390> as<00:02:16.750> much<00:02:17.140> as<00:02:17.290> you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
you can actually tweak it as much as you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.280 
you can actually tweak it as much as you
like<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:18.370> here<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.000> make<00:02:19.870> all<00:02:20.050> your<00:02:20.200> own

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
like in here and make all your own

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.020 
like in here and make all your own
settings<00:02:20.830> up<00:02:21.010> not<00:02:21.160> even<00:02:21.310> bother<00:02:21.580> setting<00:02:21.940> it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
settings up not even bother setting it

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.580 
settings up not even bother setting it
up<00:02:22.090> because<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.600> don't<00:02:22.930> really<00:02:23.200> use<00:02:23.410> these

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
up because I don't really use these

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.470 
up because I don't really use these
programs<00:02:23.770> anymore<00:02:24.460> but<00:02:24.640> if<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.940> do<00:02:25.150> need<00:02:25.390> to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
programs anymore but if you do need to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.090 
programs anymore but if you do need to
use<00:02:25.660> them<00:02:25.810> then<00:02:26.020> these<00:02:26.230> are<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.500> sort<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:26.770> ones

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
use them then these are the sort of ones

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.970 
use them then these are the sort of ones
that<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.460> want<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.880> be<00:02:28.570> using<00:02:28.840> ok<00:02:29.410> tweaks<00:02:29.770> as

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
that you want to be using ok tweaks as

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.400 
that you want to be using ok tweaks as
you<00:02:30.100> can<00:02:30.220> see<00:02:30.400> here<00:02:31.020> there's<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.110> few<00:02:32.290> little

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
you can see here there's a few little

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.960 
you can see here there's a few little
tweaks<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.010> can<00:02:33.160> actually<00:02:33.310> use<00:02:33.640> and

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
tweaks that you can actually use and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.560 
tweaks that you can actually use and
also<00:02:34.540> we've<00:02:34.990> got<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.260> CPU<00:02:35.950> control<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.360> see

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
also we've got a CPU control you can see

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.960 
also we've got a CPU control you can see
there<00:02:37.950> ok<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.220> make<00:02:39.400> your<00:02:39.580> changes

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
there ok you can make your changes

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.030 
there ok you can make your changes
whatever<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.690> want<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.900> do<00:02:41.050> ok<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.920> you've

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
whatever you want to do ok and you've

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.660 
whatever you want to do ok and you've
also<00:02:42.220> got<00:02:42.510> tray<00:02:43.510> icon<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.130> actually<00:02:45.459> set

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
also got tray icon you can actually set

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.180 
also got tray icon you can actually set
it<00:02:45.700> up<00:02:45.850> there<00:02:46.180> or<00:02:46.360> show<00:02:46.900> free<00:02:47.200> RAM<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.070> on

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
it up there or show free RAM and so on

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.830 
it up there or show free RAM and so on
and<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.430> on<00:02:48.459> so<00:02:48.610> on<00:02:48.820> here<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.480> that's<00:02:49.630> pretty

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
and so on so on here so that's pretty

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.900 
and so on so on here so that's pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:50.260> really<00:02:51.070> ok<00:02:51.550> then<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.790> can

website that you can go to and read up

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.260 
website that you can go to and read up
about<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.310> little<00:03:00.489> bit<00:03:00.610> more<00:03:00.910> because<00:03:01.000> I'm

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
about it a little bit more because I'm

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.740 
about it a little bit more because I'm
probably<00:03:01.750> not<00:03:01.959> touched<00:03:02.770> on<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.420> enough<00:03:04.420> really

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
probably not touched on it enough really

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.660 
probably not touched on it enough really
but<00:03:04.959> I'm<00:03:05.140> just<00:03:05.290> gonna<00:03:05.440> try<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:05.950> squeeze<00:03:06.459> all

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
but I'm just gonna try and squeeze all

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.250 
but I'm just gonna try and squeeze all
three<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:06.970> these<00:03:07.060> applications<00:03:07.780> in<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.170> you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
three of these applications in so you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.479 
three of these applications in so you
can<00:03:08.410> actually<00:03:08.530> see<00:03:08.800> them<00:03:08.980> this<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.370> other

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
can actually see them this is the other

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.210 
can actually see them this is the other
one<00:03:09.670> called<00:03:09.910> memory<00:03:10.330> cleaner<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.950> pretty

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
one called memory cleaner it is pretty

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.310 
one called memory cleaner it is pretty
much<00:03:12.400> really<00:03:13.270> simple<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.870> use<00:03:14.080> really

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
much really simple to use really

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.840 
much really simple to use really
probably<00:03:14.680> more<00:03:14.920> simple<00:03:15.370> than<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.610> other<00:03:15.730> one

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
probably more simple than the other one

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.520 
probably more simple than the other one
because<00:03:16.030> you've<00:03:16.150> only<00:03:16.270> got<00:03:16.510> these<00:03:16.989> two<00:03:17.230> types

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
because you've only got these two types

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.289 
because you've only got these two types
of<00:03:17.709> buttons<00:03:17.980> here<00:03:18.280> really<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.760> actually<00:03:19.090> use

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
of buttons here really to actually use

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.350 
of buttons here really to actually use
okay<00:03:19.780> now<00:03:20.530> what<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.459> does<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:21.940> say<00:03:22.180> for

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
okay now what it does is say for

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.970 
okay now what it does is say for
instance<00:03:22.450> your<00:03:22.900> find<00:03:23.200> your<00:03:23.350> system<00:03:23.680> getting<00:03:23.890> a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
instance your find your system getting a

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.410 
instance your find your system getting a
bit<00:03:24.100> slow<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.459> you've<00:03:24.610> used<00:03:24.820> all<00:03:25.000> your<00:03:25.090> memory

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
bit slow and you've used all your memory

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.660 
bit slow and you've used all your memory
up<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.690> can<00:03:25.840> see<00:03:26.049> a<00:03:26.080> mere<00:03:26.320> average<00:03:26.769> usage<00:03:27.190> and

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
up you can see a mere average usage and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.000 
up you can see a mere average usage and
maximum<00:03:28.299> usage<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.019> on<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:29.530> on<00:03:29.709> you

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
maximum usage and so on and so on you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.830 
maximum usage and so on and so on you
can<00:03:30.130> actually<00:03:30.310> see<00:03:30.610> memory<00:03:31.000> usage<00:03:31.450> here<00:03:31.720> as

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
can actually see memory usage here as

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.259 
can actually see memory usage here as
well<00:03:32.080> okay<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.549> if<00:03:33.610> you're<00:03:33.760> starting<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.120> run

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
well okay so if you're starting to run

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.180 
well okay so if you're starting to run
out<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.630> you're<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:35.320> actually<00:03:35.950> got<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.130> few

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
out and you're you actually got a few

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.280 
out and you're you actually got a few
applications<00:03:37.000> open<00:03:37.360> then<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.900> can<00:03:38.140> actually

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
applications open then you can actually

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.650 
applications open then you can actually
clear<00:03:39.010> system<00:03:39.489> cache<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.030> what<00:03:40.120> this<00:03:40.239> will<00:03:40.450> do

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
clear system cache and what this will do

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.720 
clear system cache and what this will do
is<00:03:40.900> reclaim<00:03:41.590> some<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:41.860> your<00:03:42.040> memory<00:03:42.370> now<00:03:42.580> if

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
is reclaim some of your memory now if

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.880 
is reclaim some of your memory now if
you<00:03:42.880> look<00:03:43.030> here<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.989> will<00:03:44.170> drop<00:03:44.380> down<00:03:44.620> in<00:03:44.830> a

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
you look here this will drop down in a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.530 
you look here this will drop down in a
minute<00:03:45.160> now<00:03:45.310> we've<00:03:45.519> not<00:03:45.730> got<00:03:45.910> anything<00:03:46.180> come

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
minute now we've not got anything come

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.630 
minute now we've not got anything come
from<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.840> tool<00:03:47.049> but<00:03:47.290> just<00:03:47.560> bear<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:47.860> mind<00:03:47.890> if

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
from the tool but just bear in mind if

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.460 
from the tool but just bear in mind if
you<00:03:48.850> had<00:03:48.940> Photoshop<00:03:49.480> open<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:50.080> stuff<00:03:50.290> like

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
you had Photoshop open and stuff like

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.800 
you had Photoshop open and stuff like
that<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:50.950> let's<00:03:50.980> push<00:03:51.340> this<00:03:51.459> button<00:03:51.670> here<00:03:51.850> and

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
that so let's push this button here and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.920 
that so let's push this button here and
you'll<00:03:53.080> see<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.380> drop<00:03:53.680> hopefully<00:03:54.810> we'll<00:03:55.810> head

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
you'll see it drop hopefully we'll head

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.360 
you'll see it drop hopefully we'll head
didn't<00:03:56.170> hardly<00:03:56.290> drop<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.680> whole<00:03:56.830> old<00:03:57.220> there

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
didn't hardly drop this whole old there

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.759 
didn't hardly drop this whole old there
you<00:03:57.459> go<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:58.570> did<00:03:58.750> actually<00:03:58.900> drop<00:03:59.260> but<00:03:59.560> not<00:03:59.739> a

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
you go it did actually drop but not a

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.560 
you go it did actually drop but not a
vast<00:04:00.010> amounts<00:04:01.350> okay<00:04:02.350> so<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:04.000> it's<00:04:04.180> not<00:04:04.299> really

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
vast amounts okay so so it's not really

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.300 
vast amounts okay so so it's not really
enough<00:04:04.750> open<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.290> benefit<00:04:05.680> where<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.040> go<00:04:06.160> it's

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
enough open to benefit where you go it's

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.180 
enough open to benefit where you go it's
dropped<00:04:06.519> down<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:07.080> 395<00:04:08.080> now<00:04:08.320> it's<00:04:08.650> not<00:04:08.950> vast

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
dropped down to 395 now it's not vast

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.710 
dropped down to 395 now it's not vast
amounts<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.700> be<00:04:09.820> fair<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:11.970> you'd<00:04:12.970> need<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.360> test

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
amounts to be fair so you'd need to test

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.600 
amounts to be fair so you'd need to test
that<00:04:13.870> under<00:04:14.260> load<00:04:14.680> more<00:04:15.010> when<00:04:15.250> you've<00:04:15.370> got<00:04:15.579> a

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
that under load more when you've got a

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.610 
that under load more when you've got a
lot<00:04:15.850> more<00:04:16.030> stuff<00:04:16.239> open<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.870> see<00:04:17.049> how<00:04:17.109> much<00:04:17.320> it

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
lot more stuff open to see how much it

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.610 
lot more stuff open to see how much it
does<00:04:17.829> reclaim<00:04:18.370> for<00:04:18.700> you<00:04:18.910> okay<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.440> last

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
does reclaim for you okay so the last

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.200 
does reclaim for you okay so the last
one<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:21.250> last<00:04:21.459> program<00:04:21.880> we're<00:04:22.000> gonna<00:04:22.120> be

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
one the last program we're gonna be

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.820 
one the last program we're gonna be
taking<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.570> look<00:04:22.690> at<00:04:22.870> ease

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
taking a look at ease

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.010 
taking a look at ease
Ram<00:04:24.310> rush<00:04:24.640> ease<00:04:24.910> pretty<00:04:25.240> much

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
Ram rush ease pretty much

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.719 
Ram rush ease pretty much
the<00:04:26.139> same<00:04:26.380> thing<00:04:26.680> runs<00:04:26.949> in<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.250> bottom<00:04:27.400> right

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
the same thing runs in the bottom right

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.029 
the same thing runs in the bottom right
hand<00:04:27.759> corner<00:04:28.030> here<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.840> you<00:04:29.470> just<00:04:29.650> click<00:04:29.919> on

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
hand corner here and you just click on

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.400 
hand corner here and you just click on
this<00:04:30.220> button<00:04:30.280> start<00:04:31.030> optimization<00:04:31.900> there's

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
this button start optimization there's

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.400 
this button start optimization there's
not<00:04:32.680> really<00:04:32.860> much<00:04:33.099> more<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.639> it<00:04:33.789> really<00:04:34.410> just

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
not really much more to it really just

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.930 
not really much more to it really just
click<00:04:35.650> on<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.370> will<00:04:36.400> actually<00:04:36.669> start

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
click on that and it will actually start

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.850 
click on that and it will actually start
to<00:04:37.150> optimize<00:04:37.389> okay<00:04:38.110> now<00:04:38.259> I<00:04:38.289> don't<00:04:38.410> know<00:04:38.710> how

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
to optimize okay now I don't know how

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.650 
to optimize okay now I don't know how
good<00:04:39.099> these<00:04:39.280> are<00:04:39.340> gonna<00:04:39.669> be<00:04:39.880> for<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.389> so<00:04:40.599> you

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
good these are gonna be for you so you

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.749 
good these are gonna be for you so you
just<00:04:40.720> have<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.169> play<00:04:41.380> with<00:04:41.410> them<00:04:41.710> but<00:04:42.370> back<00:04:42.580> in

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
just have to play with them but back in

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.159 
just have to play with them but back in
the<00:04:42.880> day<00:04:43.060> when<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.360> didn't<00:04:43.599> hardly<00:04:43.900> have<00:04:44.020> any

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
the day when you didn't hardly have any

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.749 
the day when you didn't hardly have any
memory<00:04:44.590> at<00:04:44.710> all<00:04:44.919> then<00:04:45.190> these<00:04:45.370> were<00:04:45.550> pretty

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
memory at all then these were pretty

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.420 
memory at all then these were pretty
useful<00:04:46.240> but<00:04:46.479> I<00:04:46.660> don't<00:04:47.380> know<00:04:47.530> how<00:04:47.680> useful<00:04:48.099> they

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
useful but I don't know how useful they

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.249 
useful but I don't know how useful they
are<00:04:48.550> two<00:04:48.729> people<00:04:49.090> with<00:04:49.240> loads<00:04:49.690> of<00:04:49.840> memory<00:04:50.169> I'm

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
are two people with loads of memory I'm

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:51.390 
are two people with loads of memory I'm
not<00:04:50.440> sure<00:04:50.620> they're<00:04:50.770> gonna<00:04:50.860> be<00:04:50.979> that<00:04:51.220> much

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
not sure they're gonna be that much

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.749 
not sure they're gonna be that much
easier<00:04:51.430> but<00:04:51.970> there<00:04:52.419> you<00:04:52.509> go<00:04:52.690> so<00:04:53.650> anyway<00:04:54.130> my
