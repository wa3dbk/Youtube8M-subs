00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
thyroid cartilage this one right here

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.290 
thyroid cartilage this one right here
that's<00:02:34.530> been<00:02:34.800> cut<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.430> thigh<00:02:35.970> row

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
that's been cut is thigh row

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.530 
that's been cut is thigh row
I<00:02:36.540> mean<00:02:36.780> sternohyoid<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.150> see<00:02:39.390> that

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
I mean sternohyoid and you can see that

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.059 
I mean sternohyoid and you can see that
here<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.110> that's<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.620> longest<00:02:40.769> one

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
here so that's gonna be the longest one

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.170 
here so that's gonna be the longest one
it's<00:02:41.310> gonna<00:02:41.400> go<00:02:41.580> all<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.790> way<00:02:41.849> up<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> the

can<00:03:39.090> see<00:03:39.239> your<00:03:39.359> thyroid<00:03:39.840> cartilage<00:03:40.320> right

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
can see your thyroid cartilage right

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.910 
can see your thyroid cartilage right
there

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
there

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.180 
there
here's<00:03:41.670> your<00:03:41.790> thyroid<00:03:42.180> hyoid<00:03:42.570> membrane<00:03:43.190> let's

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
here's your thyroid hyoid membrane let's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.040 
here's your thyroid hyoid membrane let's
flip<00:03:44.489> him<00:03:44.519> up<00:03:44.760> here

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.380 

hopefully<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.140> guys<00:03:50.230> can<00:03:50.290> see<00:03:50.740> this<00:03:50.860> okay<00:03:51.390> so

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
hopefully you guys can see this okay so

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.970 
hopefully you guys can see this okay so
here's<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.930> Roy<00:03:53.110> cartilage<00:03:53.560> here's<00:03:53.860> your

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
here's the Roy cartilage here's your

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.540 
here's the Roy cartilage here's your
omohyoid<00:03:54.960> so<00:03:55.960> your<00:03:56.170> hyoid<00:03:56.500> bone<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.680> up<00:03:56.950> here

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
omohyoid so your hyoid bone is up here

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.390 
omohyoid so your hyoid bone is up here
here's<00:03:58.030> your<00:03:58.210> thyrohyoid<00:03:58.600> muscle<00:03:59.620> this<00:04:00.190> right

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
here's your thyrohyoid muscle this right

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.710 
here's your thyrohyoid muscle this right
here<00:04:00.610> is<00:04:00.640> anterior<00:04:01.150> belly<00:04:01.300> of<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.570> digastric

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
here is anterior belly of the digastric

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.100 
here is anterior belly of the digastric
you<00:04:02.500> can<00:04:02.650> see<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.040> it's<00:04:03.160> going<00:04:03.310> through<00:04:03.610> the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
you can see that it's going through the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.140 
you can see that it's going through the
stylohyoid<00:04:05.110> muscle<00:04:06.100> there's<00:04:06.460> posterior

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
stylohyoid muscle there's posterior

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.600 
stylohyoid muscle there's posterior
belly<00:04:07.270> of<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.570> digastric<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:09.070> can<00:04:09.280> see<00:04:09.490> the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
belly of the digastric you can see the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.360 
belly of the digastric you can see the
split<00:04:10.000> from<00:04:10.780> your<00:04:11.050> common<00:04:11.740> carotid<00:04:11.950> artery

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
split from your common carotid artery

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.000 
split from your common carotid artery
this<00:04:12.640> would<00:04:12.820> be<00:04:12.970> external<00:04:13.810> carotid<00:04:14.500> artery

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
this would be external carotid artery

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.759 
this would be external carotid artery
and<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.910> would<00:04:16.090> be<00:04:16.180> internal<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.080> this

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
and this would be internal and this

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.090 
and this would be internal and this
white<00:04:18.040> nerve<00:04:18.310> running<00:04:18.670> with<00:04:19.000> those<00:04:20.100> with

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
white nerve running with those with

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.610 
white nerve running with those with
internal<00:04:21.489> jugular<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.180> carotid<00:04:22.630> is<00:04:23.260> your

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
internal jugular and the carotid is your

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.890 
internal jugular and the carotid is your
vagus<00:04:23.800> nerve<00:04:24.160> so<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.640> would<00:04:24.790> be<00:04:24.910> left<00:04:25.120> Vegas

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.840

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.460 

underneath<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:40.270> digastric<00:04:40.690> you<00:04:41.110> can<00:04:41.260> see

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
underneath the digastric you can see

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.350 
underneath the digastric you can see
mylohyoid<00:04:41.830> let's<00:04:42.610> see<00:04:42.729> we<00:04:42.850> can<00:04:43.000> see<00:04:43.180> those<00:04:43.300> a

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
mylohyoid let's see we can see those a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.320 
mylohyoid let's see we can see those a
little<00:04:43.630> bit<00:04:43.750> better

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
little bit better

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.090 
little bit better
so<00:04:46.330> here's<00:04:46.740> anterior<00:04:47.740> belly<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:48.010> the

so here's anterior belly of the

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.370 
so here's anterior belly of the
digastric<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:49.090> this<00:04:49.419> is<00:04:49.660> my<00:04:49.840> little<00:04:50.020> hyoid

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.790 
digastric and this is my little hyoid
underneath<00:04:51.750> now<00:04:52.750> if<00:04:52.870> we<00:04:52.990> turn<00:04:53.229> this<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.680> the
