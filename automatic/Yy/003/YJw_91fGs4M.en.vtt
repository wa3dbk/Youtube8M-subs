the<00:00:04.800> cars<00:00:12.049> a<00:00:13.049> shin<00:00:13.259> Stan<00:00:14.059> if<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.150> look<00:00:15.329> under

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
the cars a shin Stan if you look under

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.480 
the cars a shin Stan if you look under
here<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:16.170> can<00:00:16.320> see<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.530> its<00:00:16.980> position

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
here you can see that its position

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.240 
here you can see that its position
specifically<00:00:18.360> here<00:00:19.080> for<00:00:19.320> maximum<00:00:19.710> support

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
specifically here for maximum support

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.279 
specifically here for maximum support
the<00:00:20.789> positioning<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.510> safety<00:00:21.779> stand<00:00:22.109> is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the positioning of the safety stand is

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.300 
the positioning of the safety stand is
important<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.279> spread<00:00:24.590> pressure<00:00:25.590> across<00:00:26.009> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
important to spread pressure across the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
important to spread pressure across the
car<00:00:28.189> over<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.669> safety<00:00:29.910> release

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
car over here we have the safety release

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.749 
car over here we have the safety release
handles<00:00:30.810> there's<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.830> other<00:00:31.919> side<00:00:32.460> as

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
handles there's one on the other side as

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.430 
handles there's one on the other side as
well<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.240> the<00:00:33.330> same<00:00:33.540> location<00:00:35.270> this<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
well in the same location this is the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.889 
well in the same location this is the
pressure<00:00:38.010> lever<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:39.090> lowers<00:00:40.039> our<00:00:41.039> lift<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
pressure lever it lowers our lift and

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.310 
pressure lever it lowers our lift and
here<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.230> button<00:00:43.770> raises<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.020> now<00:00:46.170> we're

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
here this button raises so now we're

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.600 
here this button raises so now we're
going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> show<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.070> intricacies<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
going to show you the intricacies and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.569 
going to show you the intricacies and
using<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.690> lift<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> key<00:00:50.100> thing<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.430> know

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
using the lift so the key thing to know

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
using the lift so the key thing to know
is<00:00:50.609> that<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:51.120> each<00:00:51.329> click<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.890> car<00:00:53.070> is
