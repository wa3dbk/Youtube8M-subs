00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.690 

that's<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.789> half<00:01:53.999> the<00:01:54.179> camp<00:01:56.299> afterwards

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
that's like half the camp afterwards

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.590 
that's like half the camp afterwards
force<00:01:59.700> them<00:01:59.850> afterwards

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
force them afterwards

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.179

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
locate your 710 cap should be on the top

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.690 
locate your 710 cap should be on the top
of<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.459> valve<00:03:38.670> cover<00:03:38.760> with<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.510> oil<00:03:39.689> sign

that's<00:03:49.300> gonna<00:03:49.510> clean<00:03:49.810> up<00:03:50.280> carbon<00:03:51.280> cap<00:03:51.580> inside

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
that's gonna clean up carbon cap inside

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:02.660 
that's gonna clean up carbon cap inside
inside<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.050> motor<00:03:57.720> right<00:03:58.720> into<00:03:58.989> your<00:03:59.110> fuel

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
it wasn't so indeed this whole block

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.230 
it wasn't so indeed this whole block
could<00:06:14.140> just<00:06:14.290> be<00:06:14.440> smoked<00:06:15.010> up<00:06:15.280> this<00:06:15.460> is<00:06:15.580> a<00:06:15.610> lot<00:06:15.970> of

you completed putting it through the

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.610 
you completed putting it through the
motor<00:06:52.090> and<00:06:52.270> you've<00:06:52.419> run<00:06:52.599> it<00:06:52.750> all<00:06:52.900> through<00:06:53.169> to

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
motor and you've run it all through to

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.290 
motor and you've run it all through to
want<00:06:53.770> to<00:06:53.830> do<00:06:53.919> is<00:06:54.039> drive<00:06:54.280> it<00:06:54.340> really<00:06:55.030> hard<00:06:55.210> for

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
want to do is drive it really hard for

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.439 
want to do is drive it really hard for
about<00:06:55.539> eight<00:06:56.440> to<00:06:56.500> ten<00:06:56.830> kilometers<00:06:57.449> really

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
about eight to ten kilometers really

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.659 
about eight to ten kilometers really
working<00:06:58.780> through<00:06:58.900> the<00:06:59.020> motor<00:06:59.280> we<00:07:00.280> can<00:07:00.490> clean

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
working through the motor we can clean

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.350 
working through the motor we can clean
up<00:07:00.699> the<00:07:00.849> most<00:07:01.120> carbon<00:07:01.539> possible<00:07:02.940> so<00:07:03.940> you<00:07:04.120> line

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
up the most carbon possible so you line

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:16.159 
up the most carbon possible so you line
up<00:07:04.389> to<00:07:04.509> a<00:07:04.660> light<00:07:04.900> race<00:07:05.560> somebody
