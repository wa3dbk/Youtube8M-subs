00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
you see there in the last two films he

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.810

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
is a superstar and I would think that I

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.330 
is a superstar and I would think that I
still<00:04:18.540> would<00:04:18.750> criticize<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.500> riding<00:04:19.890> tactics

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340

today<00:04:20.520> going<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:21.660> early<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:22.320> think<00:04:22.620> he<00:04:23.010> Tom<00:04:23.670> he

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
today going so early I think he Tom he

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.720 
today going so early I think he Tom he
could<00:04:24.330> wait<00:04:24.540> another<00:04:24.870> two<00:04:25.260> furlongs<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.100> his

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
could wait another two furlongs and his

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.420 
could wait another two furlongs and his
his<00:04:27.210> change<00:04:27.600> of<00:04:27.840> gear<00:04:28.140> would<00:04:28.650> still<00:04:29.070> kill

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
his change of gear would still kill

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.640 
his change of gear would still kill
these<00:04:29.640> horses<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.210> his<00:04:30.750> winning<00:04:31.230> distance

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
these horses and his winning distance

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.700 
these horses and his winning distance
would<00:04:31.860> be<00:04:31.890> bigger<00:04:32.370> than<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.120> was<00:04:33.330> today<00:04:33.660> he<00:04:34.500> is

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
would be bigger than it was today he is

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.740
