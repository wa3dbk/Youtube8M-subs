Sapp step back and I said okay what is
the<00:02:08.409> common<00:02:08.739> denominator<00:02:08.769> is<00:02:09.369> not<00:02:09.459> recovering

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
the common denominator is not recovering

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.099 
the common denominator is not recovering
well<00:02:10.030> they're<00:02:10.149> progressing<00:02:10.689> so<00:02:10.810> they<00:02:10.899> got<00:02:11.019> to

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.109

these people

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.009 
these people
believe<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.430> my<00:02:15.790> macro<00:02:16.360> was<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> macro<00:02:16.840> it

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
believe that my macro was a macro it

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.119 
believe that my macro was a macro it
doesn't<00:02:17.319> matter<00:02:17.440> where<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.739> comes<00:02:17.920> from<00:02:17.980> so

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
doesn't matter where it comes from so

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.500 
doesn't matter where it comes from so
they<00:02:18.370> feel<00:02:18.640> their<00:02:18.819> diet<00:02:19.000> with<00:02:19.180> things<00:02:19.420> that

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
enough micros in a period and I also

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.340 
enough micros in a period and I also
supplement<00:04:42.150> microbes<00:04:42.479> on<00:04:42.600> top<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.169> take

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
supplement microbes on top of it I take

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.159 
supplement microbes on top of it I take
extra<00:04:43.680> things<00:04:43.860> like<00:04:43.949> copper<00:04:45.169> selenium

extra things like copper selenium
magnesium<00:04:47.130> there's<00:04:47.820> other<00:04:47.940> things<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.240> take

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
magnesium there's other things that take

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.110 
magnesium there's other things that take
on<00:04:48.449> top<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:48.990> because<00:04:49.199> they<00:04:49.289> are<00:04:50.120> minerals

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
on top of it because they are minerals

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.999 
on top of it because they are minerals
that<00:04:51.210> get<00:04:51.360> depleted<00:04:51.600> more<00:04:52.139> than<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.860> ones

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009

one the only thing and it was a big

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.060 
one the only thing and it was a big
study<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:01.139> can<00:05:01.289> find<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:01.650> in<00:05:01.740> line<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:01.979> I

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
study you can find that in line and I

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.620 
study you can find that in line and I
got<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.220> fucking<00:05:02.550> find<00:05:02.729> it<00:05:02.849> for<00:05:02.940> you<00:05:03.060> but

there's<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.870> one<00:05:04.530> common<00:05:04.979> factor<00:05:05.190> out<00:05:05.729> of<00:05:05.930> 5,000

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
there's a one common factor out of 5,000

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.779 
there's a one common factor out of 5,000
or<00:05:07.020> 50,000<00:05:07.710> see<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.949> 550<00:05:08.490> whatever<00:05:08.729> it
