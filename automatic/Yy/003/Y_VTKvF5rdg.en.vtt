00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.989
 so I put a troop everywhere 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 So here we just did not tell you 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.180
 all because it's going to be too long but 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.710
 for example sometimes there's 3 by 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.410
 example there are three healer 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.059
 but hey that's because he had to 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.390
 that I'm filling up what had 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:02.340
 spent 2 2 places for actually there 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 was not enough room finally not enough 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.210
 of troops place 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.390
 we're going to say that like that to fill but 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.070
 220 places so here is the clan 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.930
 also a happy new year 2015 and we see 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.110
 immediately attacked so we will 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.439
 not attack I will try 100% so 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.189
 not on a pretty complicated village on 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.250
 a pretty nice village so there I 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.820
 touched but actually there I touched but 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.750
 which I loved about 150 gm finally 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.509
 I used about a hundred 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 fiftieth pop 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.130
 to put all my troops so that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.780
 cost me so much so so bowl 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.850
 so I hope we'll find a pretty 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.549
 good booty for the case for the bridge in this 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.170
 moment it is not the case 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.689
 in fact there I realize that me 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:04.759
 make that my sentence is not very 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.759
 French still has not 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.110
 at worst we will attack you know 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.459
 convince and cali there I was not complaining 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.760
 to later attack him like him I 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:22.530
 would put him a ti a little 100% 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.480
 I hope we are going to attack him it's going to be 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.540
 quite simple 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.220
 so how do you go about it 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.549
 start putting a little golem our 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.620
 classes to buy me v8 hop a little bit low he 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.310
 is not even max were so what to put 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.040
 a little goolen here are my breakages 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.870
 bricks that are good here we put a 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.799
 little history to help the poor 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.420
 here is the following swing a pic to valence 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.099
 and a drag the balloons the wizards 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.120
 ayoub launched three cured a valve that 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.590
 binds the balloons the servants that's the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.940
 badly among the puppies of the pjj was 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.519
 launch it first 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:09.989
 completely forgotten legion so here we 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:14.549
 balance all that the king the queen 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.560
 we will swing one who sees here with 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:22.049
 a healing spell to heal our 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:25.859
 dragon oil and i way so the 100 % live 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:28.350
 we are not going to do it I do not think I have 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.859
 do everything I'm going to put a little 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.600
 fulton spell we want we'll get up 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:38.730
 only kind of lightning that's not very 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.489
 important everything clash I keep the fate of 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.290
 sow for after all the king and the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.470
 queen they preferred to isolate themselves all 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.000
 two amounts the king is dead so there 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.560
 all my troops are touring the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.150
 village but I think I could 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.130
 find a gp too much then there is 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.919
 both cured who heals well 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.290
 we hear goyer brand is not serious 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:04.139
 of the e3 yesterdayi excuse me I had not seen 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.590
 the three lives that's the ball 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.389
 100 % and m it's going to be done very 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.419
 easily actually I thought that 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.859
 start metro peel and frenchies to 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.079

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.180
 I fuck a little lot of her here 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.280

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:26.550

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.830

 montclera estate hre military camp but 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.389
