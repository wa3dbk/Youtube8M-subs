all right welcome to my I just wanted to

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.180 
all right welcome to my I just wanted to
try<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:07.980> out<00:00:08.280> but<00:00:09.380> it's<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:11.179> vain<00:00:13.190> movement

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
try this out but it's a vain movement

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.570 
try this out but it's a vain movement
speed<00:00:14.460> slash<00:00:14.849> attack<00:00:15.269> speed<00:00:16.369> pretty<00:00:17.369> much

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
speed slash attack speed pretty much

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.810 
speed slash attack speed pretty much
maxed<00:00:18.470> attack<00:00:19.470> speed<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.859> like<00:00:20.070> point<00:00:20.490> zero

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
maxed attack speed is like point zero

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.120 
maxed attack speed is like point zero
zero<00:00:21.060> zero<00:00:21.119> four<00:00:22.490> below<00:00:23.490> max<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.980> mean<00:00:25.980> look

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
zero zero four below max but I mean look

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.620 
zero zero four below max but I mean look
at<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.300> 556<00:00:27.300> movement<00:00:27.810> speed<00:00:29.510> these<00:00:30.510> are

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
at that 556 movement speed these are

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.650 
at that 556 movement speed these are
just<00:00:30.750> BOTS<00:00:30.990> because

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110 

you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:38.400> wanted<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.670> try<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.880> out<00:00:39.060> I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you know I just wanted to try this out I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.630 
you know I just wanted to try this out I
don't<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.690> could<00:00:39.870> actually<00:00:40.050> viably<00:00:40.739> do

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
don't think you could actually viably do

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.660 
don't think you could actually viably do
this<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.060> game<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.630> I<00:00:43.220> guess<00:00:44.220> anything's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
this in game but I guess anything's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.720 
this in game but I guess anything's
possible

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.280 

and<00:00:52.090> pretty<00:00:52.810> much<00:00:52.930> it<00:00:53.830> seems<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.310> keep<00:00:54.490> by

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
and pretty much it seems to keep by

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.250 
and pretty much it seems to keep by
obviously<00:00:56.940> actual<00:00:57.940> players<00:00:58.270> would<00:00:58.690> do<00:00:59.080> much

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
obviously actual players would do much

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.090 
obviously actual players would do much
better<00:01:00.630> but<00:01:02.130> look<00:01:03.130> how<00:01:03.280> fun<00:01:03.550> this<00:01:03.580> is<00:01:03.790> I<00:01:03.970> mean

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
better but look how fun this is I mean

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.740 
better but look how fun this is I mean
she's<00:01:06.100> so<00:01:06.280> fast<00:01:08.160> so<00:01:09.160> I<00:01:09.190> got<00:01:09.400> bloodthirster<00:01:10.090> for

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
she's so fast so I got bloodthirster for

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.030 
she's so fast so I got bloodthirster for
a<00:01:10.780> lifesteal<00:01:11.260> keeps<00:01:12.220> her<00:01:12.370> alive<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:17.040> don't

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
a lifesteal keeps her alive and I don't

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.520 
a lifesteal keeps her alive and I don't
even<00:01:18.100> know<00:01:18.250> if<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.400> can<00:01:18.460> do<00:01:18.610> this

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.370 

look<00:01:21.890> like<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:24.070> now<00:01:25.070> pretty<00:01:25.369> sure<00:01:25.490> I'm<00:01:25.549> back

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.280 

okay<00:01:31.840> still<00:01:32.840> not<00:01:32.869> tanky<00:01:33.380> enough<00:01:33.409> to<00:01:33.770> do<00:01:33.920> baron

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
okay still not tanky enough to do baron

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.060 
okay still not tanky enough to do baron
not<00:01:36.290> enough<00:01:36.530> lifesteal<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:38.860> wanted<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:39.920> see

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
not enough lifesteal I wanted to see

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.920 
not enough lifesteal I wanted to see
what<00:01:40.190> max<00:01:40.430> attack<00:01:40.880> speed<00:01:41.180> looks<00:01:41.390> like<00:01:41.630> and

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
what max attack speed looks like and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.300 
what max attack speed looks like and
this<00:01:42.350> is<00:01:42.560> pretty<00:01:42.770> freakin<00:01:43.220> close<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.740> that's

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
this is pretty freakin close so that's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.700 
this is pretty freakin close so that's
pretty<00:01:46.729> much<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:48.759> 27<00:01:49.759> 0<00:01:50.350> no<00:01:51.350> I'm<00:01:51.680> gonna<00:01:51.830> die
