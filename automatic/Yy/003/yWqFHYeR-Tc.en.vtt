now<00:00:06.120> we<00:00:06.180> talk<00:00:06.480> about<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.720> hydrogen<00:00:07.200> fuel<00:00:07.470> cell

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
now we talk about a hydrogen fuel cell

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.049 
now we talk about a hydrogen fuel cell
vehicle<00:00:08.130> today<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.400> couple<00:00:08.760> things<00:00:08.880> to

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
vehicle today a couple things to

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.820 
vehicle today a couple things to
understand<00:00:09.570> we're<00:00:09.719> talking<00:00:09.840> about<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.200> Pamella

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
understand we're talking about a Pamella

that's<00:00:13.380> what<00:00:13.590> goes<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.889> inside<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.460> box

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
that's what goes on inside this box

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.790 
that's what goes on inside this box
shape<00:00:15.030> thing<00:00:15.299> about<00:00:15.570> yeah<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:16.440> not<00:00:16.590> very

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
shape thing about yeah it's not very

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.609 
shape thing about yeah it's not very
large<00:00:17.270> secondly<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.420> hydrogen<00:00:18.869> fuel<00:00:19.439> in

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
large secondly it's hydrogen fuel in

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.689 
large secondly it's hydrogen fuel in
other<00:00:19.710> words<00:00:19.859> you're<00:00:19.949> putting<00:00:20.160> hydrogen<00:00:20.340> in

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
other words you're putting hydrogen in

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.370 
other words you're putting hydrogen in
on<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:20.970> side<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.510> create<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.960> chemical

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
on one side to create the chemical

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.849 
on one side to create the chemical
reaction<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.130> generates<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> electricity

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
reaction this generates the electricity

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.050 
reaction this generates the electricity
hydrogen<00:00:25.859> from<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.099> tank<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> car<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
hydrogen from a tank in the car is

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.419 
hydrogen from a tank in the car is
exposed<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> plate<00:00:28.050> coated<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.590> platinum<00:00:29.039> on

one side of a sort of sandwich the
Platinum<00:00:32.040> plate<00:00:32.250> causes<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> hydrogen<00:00:33.390> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
Platinum plate causes the hydrogen to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.389 
Platinum plate causes the hydrogen to
break<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:33.989> into<00:00:34.200> positive<00:00:34.710> protons<00:00:35.160> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
break up into positive protons and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.549 
break up into positive protons and
negative<00:00:35.820> electrons<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.510> membrane<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
positive ones to get through so those

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.010 
positive ones to get through so those
negative<00:00:41.879> electrons<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.899> around

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
negative electrons have to go around

that<00:00:43.800> circuit<00:00:44.219> creates<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> positive<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that circuit creates the positive and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
that circuit creates the positive and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.599 
backers so what's a like driving a fuel
cell<00:01:01.320> car<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.160> driving<00:01:02.460> an<00:01:02.520> electric

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
cell car just like driving an electric

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.820 
cell car just like driving an electric
car<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.539> remember<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.930> fuel<00:01:04.320> cell<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
car because remember a fuel cell is a

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.880 
car because remember a fuel cell is a
source<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.519> electricity<00:01:06.110> powered<00:01:07.110> by<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.590> very

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
source of electricity powered by a very

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.370 
source of electricity powered by a very
clean<00:01:08.280> very<00:01:08.729> abundant<00:01:09.210> fuel<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.140> not

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
clean very abundant fuel but it is not

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.030 
clean very abundant fuel but it is not
the<00:01:10.619> powertrain<00:01:11.369> source<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.270> moves<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.689> car

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
the powertrain source that moves the car

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
the powertrain source that moves the car
that's<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.310> difference<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.869> when<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that's a difference so really when it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.770 
that's a difference so really when it
comes<00:01:16.140> down<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.830> electric<00:01:17.820> cars<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.270> fork

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
comes down to is electric cars that fork

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.109 
comes down to is electric cars that fork
two<00:01:19.140> ways<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.860> toward<00:01:20.220> hydrogen<00:01:20.820> fuel-cell

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
two ways one toward hydrogen fuel-cell

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.929 
two ways one toward hydrogen fuel-cell
one<00:01:21.780> toward<00:01:22.200> battery<00:01:22.680> electric<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.729> big

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
one toward battery electric the big

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.550 
one toward battery electric the big
difference<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.869> go<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.049> refill

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
difference here is when you go to refill

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.149 
difference here is when you go to refill
it's<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.009> whole<00:01:26.220> another<00:01:26.490> world<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
it's a whole another world so the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.270 
it's a whole another world so the
benefits<00:01:29.610> number<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.570> clean<00:01:31.229> hydrogen<00:01:32.009> fuel

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
benefits number one clean hydrogen fuel

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.730 
benefits number one clean hydrogen fuel
cell<00:01:32.610> electric<00:01:32.759> cars<00:01:33.479> emit<00:01:34.140> nothing<00:01:34.560> but

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
cell electric cars emit nothing but

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.249 
cell electric cars emit nothing but
water<00:01:35.070> vapor<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:35.970> much<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:37.200> is

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
water vapor and not much of it this is

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.560 
water vapor and not much of it this is
