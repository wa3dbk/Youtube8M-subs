00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.740
 the extent to which our poles developed other brain 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.740
 technical qualities to humans 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.029
 we are aware of our own identity although individuality 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.659
 1 we achieved the ability to think for ourselves so 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:30.089
 On the one hand we are forming memories that will last a lifetime 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.809
 as our first day 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.809
 at school 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.260
 we can remember what was happening around us 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.040
 but the real action is happening inside 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.660
 the brain is a mass of 100 billion nerve cells 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.740
 combined 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.540
 they generate enough electricity to keep a light bulb 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.550
 lighting up everything 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.550
 the cell communicate employ 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.480
 many years 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.480
 each impulse is a tiny ferment of thought 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.590
 when we saw a new word 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.550
 our ears convert the sound of electrical impulses our brains 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.270
 I know I'm going to learn 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 because the connections between brain cells 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.220
 they are not permanent 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 the brain is recognized 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.090
 the nerve cells send tendrils we call the probes 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 constantly 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.690
 the cells find a tiny space yamassoun assigned 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.020
 chemical substances except in space 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 to allow 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.329
 the new connections by 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.969
 a new memory 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.979
 we learn by making new connections between brain cells 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.849
 and then network 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.399
 by repetition 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.379
 the more intense the reinforcement 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.379
 much more likely that memory is made 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.319
 when someone asks us to cut out that memory 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.229
 the same pattern of axons 6 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.229
 and the memory comes back to life 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.080
 our brain responds by sending messages in the media 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.219
 that activate the muscles our arms 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.219
 we raise much more 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.459
 in childhood 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.399
 our brains have a preference for 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:19.019
 and they are growing fast 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.650
 Rapid growth allows our brains 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.379
 easily form new connections 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.379
 a skill that would disappear from violence 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.159
 and while our brain keeps learning 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.849
 our bodies in commission
