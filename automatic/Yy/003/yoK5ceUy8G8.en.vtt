brew that perfect cup of coffee and part
of<00:00:27.020> that<00:00:27.200> is<00:00:27.500> just<00:00:28.490> simply<00:00:28.760> letting<00:00:29.270> a<00:00:29.510> brew

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
of that is just simply letting a brew

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.330 
of that is just simply letting a brew
come<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.680> completion<00:00:31.070> as<00:00:32.060> we<00:00:32.330> brew<00:00:32.840> today

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
were baking a cake if you pull it early

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.020 
were baking a cake if you pull it early
you<00:01:06.560> end<00:01:06.770> up<00:01:06.950> with<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.159> less<00:01:07.490> than<00:01:07.700> desirable

you end up with a less than desirable
product<00:01:08.630> brewing<00:01:09.380> coffee<00:01:09.590> is<00:01:09.920> much<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.370> same

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
product brewing coffee is much the same

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.350 
product brewing coffee is much the same
way<00:01:11.680> during<00:01:12.680> this<00:01:12.830> brew<00:01:13.070> process<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:14.120> brew

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
way during this brew process the brew

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.899 
way during this brew process the brew
actually<00:01:15.049> comes<00:01:15.650> through<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:16.130> phases<00:01:16.700> where

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
actually comes through in phases where

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.240 
actually comes through in phases where
you<00:01:17.000> have<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> strong<00:01:17.600> intense<00:01:18.350> flavor<00:01:18.680> profile

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
you have a strong intense flavor profile

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.980 
you have a strong intense flavor profile
in<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.640> first<00:01:19.880> third<00:01:20.180> then<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:20.600> begins<00:01:20.810> to

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
in the first third then it begins to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.980 
in the first third then it begins to
lighten<00:01:21.470> up<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.220> tail<00:01:22.430> end<00:01:22.729> is<00:01:22.969> very<00:01:23.539> pale

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
lighten up and the tail end is very pale

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.920 
lighten up and the tail end is very pale
and<00:01:24.289> you've<00:01:25.070> extinguished<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.000> good<00:01:26.570> parts

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
and you've extinguished the good parts

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.080 
and you've extinguished the good parts
of<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.140> coffee<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:27.710> want<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.009> take<00:01:28.219> right

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
of the coffee that we want to take right

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.209 
of the coffee that we want to take right
now<00:01:29.119> we<00:01:29.360> have<00:01:29.750> approximately<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.590> cup<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.130> a

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
now we have approximately a cup and a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.840 
now we have approximately a cup and a
half<00:01:31.840> brewed<00:01:32.840> into<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.259> decanter<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.700> what

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
half brewed into the decanter so what

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.910 
half brewed into the decanter so what
we're<00:01:35.000> going<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:35.270> do<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:35.810> demonstrate<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:36.680> is

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
we're going to do to demonstrate this is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.090 
we're going to do to demonstrate this is
capture<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:37.939> portion<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:40.210> use<00:01:41.210> it<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.509> compare

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
capture a portion and use it to compare

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.219 
capture a portion and use it to compare
with<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.280> middle<00:01:43.579> brew<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.240> near<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.810> end<00:01:44.960> of

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
with the middle brew and near the end of

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.560 
with the middle brew and near the end of
the<00:01:45.350> brew<00:01:45.560> as<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.460> brew<00:01:46.609> cycle<00:01:46.880> continues

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
the brew as the brew cycle continues

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.599 
the brew as the brew cycle continues
here<00:01:47.899> we'll<00:01:48.289> take<00:01:48.530> another<00:01:48.649> sample<00:01:49.070> at

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
here we'll take another sample at

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.980 
here we'll take another sample at
approximately<00:01:50.420> half<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.780> decanter<00:01:52.810> at<00:01:53.810> this

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
approximately half a decanter at this

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.050 
approximately half a decanter at this
point<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.530> decanter<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.039> approximately<00:01:55.820> half

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
point the decanter is approximately half

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.760 
point the decanter is approximately half
full<00:01:56.390> we'll<00:01:56.600> take<00:01:56.840> our<00:01:57.020> second<00:01:57.409> sample

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.489 

compared<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.009> first<00:02:01.249> cup<00:02:01.520> we<00:02:01.759> drew<00:02:02.060> is

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:02.499 
compared to the first cup we drew is

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:07.040 
compared to the first cup we drew is
considerably<00:02:03.499> lighter

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.480 

one<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.259> important<00:02:08.710> parts<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.100> this<00:02:09.250> and

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
one of the important parts of this and

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.889 
one of the important parts of this and
I'm<00:02:09.580> sure<00:02:09.820> you've<00:02:10.060> seen<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:10.570> your<00:02:10.690> office

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
I'm sure you've seen it in your office

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.620 
I'm sure you've seen it in your office
place<00:02:11.350> or<00:02:11.890> maybe<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.460> have<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> brewer<00:02:13.150> at<00:02:13.360> home

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
place or maybe you have a brewer at home

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.410 
place or maybe you have a brewer at home
that<00:02:14.320> has<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:15.010> pause<00:02:15.400> sequence<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.270> can

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
that has a pause sequence so you can

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.380 
that has a pause sequence so you can
draw<00:02:16.660> coffee<00:02:17.050> early<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.890> you'll<00:02:18.670> find<00:02:19.030> that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
draw coffee early and you'll find that

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.510 
draw coffee early and you'll find that
that<00:02:19.660> first<00:02:20.050> cup<00:02:20.350> off<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.830> front<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.340> very

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
that first cup off of the front is very

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.540 
that first cup off of the front is very
strong<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.450> intense<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.770> great<00:02:24.190> cup<00:02:24.460> of

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
strong and intense it's a great cup of

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.580 
strong and intense it's a great cup of
coffee<00:02:24.610> what<00:02:25.570> you've<00:02:25.750> left<00:02:26.020> for<00:02:26.140> everybody

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590
