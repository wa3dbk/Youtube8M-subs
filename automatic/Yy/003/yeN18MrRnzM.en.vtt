there are a couple of other kick
triggers<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.600> don't<00:03:04.050> have<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:04.950> can't

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
triggers that I don't have so I can't

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.380 
triggers that I don't have so I can't
show<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.460> them<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:05.880> I'll<00:03:05.970> throw<00:03:06.120> up<00:03:06.210> some

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
show you them but I'll throw up some

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
pictures here while I talk about them

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.760 
pictures here while I talk about them
there's<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.940> there<00:03:09.720> are<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> few<00:03:10.080> floor<00:03:10.410> model

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
there's the there are a few floor model

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.800 
there's the there are a few floor model
kick<00:03:11.220> triggers<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.390> they<00:03:12.660> use

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
kick triggers that have they use

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.170 
kick triggers that have they use
inverted<00:03:13.380> meters<00:03:13.680> like<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.370> pentek<00:03:14.850> ergo

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
inverted meters like the pentek ergo

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.840 
inverted meters like the pentek ergo
kick<00:03:15.390> which<00:03:15.690> runs<00:03:15.930> for<00:03:16.170> $60<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.130> then<00:03:17.640> there's

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
kick which runs for $60 and then there's

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.290 
kick which runs for $60 and then there's
the<00:03:18.000> roland<00:03:18.360> KD<00:03:18.570> 7<00:03:18.780> which<00:03:19.170> runs<00:03:19.410> for<00:03:20.300> $120

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
the roland KD 7 which runs for $120

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.300 
the roland KD 7 which runs for $120
mostly<00:03:22.260> because<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:22.800> an<00:03:22.920> older<00:03:23.160> model

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
mostly because it's just an older model

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.250 
mostly because it's just an older model
i<00:03:23.520> believe<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:23.880> been<00:03:24.030> discontinued<00:03:24.630> and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
i believe it's been discontinued and

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.620 
i believe it's been discontinued and
then<00:03:25.590> there<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.550> pin<00:03:26.850> tech<00:03:27.060> gig<00:03:27.390> kick

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
then there is the pin tech gig kick

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.090 
then there is the pin tech gig kick
which<00:03:27.870> looks<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.260> lot<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.709> roadie<00:03:28.890> kick

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
which looks a lot like the roadie kick

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.979 
which looks a lot like the roadie kick
rocker<00:03:29.340> except<00:03:29.820> it's<00:03:29.970> actually<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.360> mesh
