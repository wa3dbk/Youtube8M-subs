00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
there we go now I mentioned this G shop

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.259 
there we go now I mentioned this G shop
which<00:03:15.769> is<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:15.950> raised<00:03:16.189> seventh<00:03:16.640> note<00:03:16.849> in<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
which is the raised seventh note in the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.160 
which is the raised seventh note in the
key<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.629> minor

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
key of a minor

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.990 
key of a minor
we<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.349> no<00:03:18.470> sharps<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:18.890> flats<00:03:18.980> but<00:03:19.790> when

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
we have no sharps and flats but when

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.759 
we have no sharps and flats but when
we're<00:03:20.150> playing<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.540> harmonic<00:03:20.959> scale<00:03:21.230> would

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
we're playing the harmonic scale would

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.490 
we're playing the harmonic scale would
take<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.280> seventh<00:03:22.730> note<00:03:22.909> of<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.150> scale

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
take that seventh note of the scale

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.740 
take that seventh note of the scale
which<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.620> G<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.189> we<00:03:25.879> raise<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.329> by<00:03:26.480> one

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
which is a G and we raise it by one

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.380 
which is a G and we raise it by one
semitone<00:03:27.019> or<00:03:27.470> one<00:03:27.650> fret<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.849> becomes<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.239> G

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
semitone or one fret it becomes a G

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.990 
semitone or one fret it becomes a G
sharp<00:03:30.159> so<00:03:31.159> the<00:03:31.250> next<00:03:31.430> scale<00:03:31.640> we're<00:03:31.790> going<00:03:31.909> to

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
sharp so the next scale we're going to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.630 
sharp so the next scale we're going to
play<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.510> e<00:03:32.540> hat<00:03:32.930> e<00:03:33.140> minor<00:03:33.680> harmonic<00:03:34.129> scale

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
play is the e hat e minor harmonic scale

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.819 
play is the e hat e minor harmonic scale
and<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:34.970> one<00:03:35.690> again<00:03:35.900> will<00:03:36.200> have<00:03:36.409> a<00:03:36.590> raised

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
and that one again will have a raised

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.640 
and that one again will have a raised
seventh<00:03:37.250> note<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.700> in<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:37.879> case<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:39.500> would

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
seventh note in it in this case it would

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.610 
seventh note in it in this case it would
be<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.890> D<00:03:40.069> sharp<00:03:40.310> now<00:03:40.579> when<00:03:40.760> we<00:03:40.849> get<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.620> okay

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
be a D sharp now when we get to it okay

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
be a D sharp now when we get to it okay
so<00:03:42.920> we're<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.159> start<00:03:43.310> off<00:03:43.459> with<00:03:43.489> an
