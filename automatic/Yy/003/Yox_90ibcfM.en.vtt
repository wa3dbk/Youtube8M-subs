can knock on that all you want but that

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.560 
can knock on that all you want but that
has<00:01:37.950> completely<00:01:38.520> changed<00:01:38.610> how<00:01:39.030> people<00:01:39.060> game

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
has completely changed how people game

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.679 
has completely changed how people game
it<00:01:39.990> from<00:01:40.500> mobile<00:01:41.220> yeah<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.460> would<00:01:41.729> say<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it from mobile yeah I would say if you

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.940 
it from mobile yeah I would say if you
look<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.259> total<00:01:43.560> historical

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
look at this from a total historical

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.590 
look at this from a total historical
perspective<00:01:44.369> eventually<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.180> would<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.479> in

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
perspective eventually that would get in

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.460 
perspective eventually that would get in
FIFA

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
FIFA

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.289 
FIFA
why<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.920> Madden<00:01:47.310> because<00:01:47.460> FIFA<00:01:48.119> is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
why not Madden because FIFA is

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.179 
why not Madden because FIFA is
