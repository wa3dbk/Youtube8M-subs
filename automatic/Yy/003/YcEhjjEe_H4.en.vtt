00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.770
 in my classes I basically use this program that orbits the test in the 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.290
 version 5 but it is user are 4 that the very heavy 5th place version has 300 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.459
 wood 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:13.609
 P 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.689
 it is very slow from your very slow computer 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.329
 so test it 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:24.029
 it works with two actual described posture systems of September says 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.649
 that we are to blame the official system that the score system 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:29.720
 which is complete 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.720
 entities the necessary information of a song 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.630
 and it also works with tablature system which is not a system 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.760
 complete but for beginners to be simpler to understand 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.350
 starting here explanation 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.400
 in tablature ceta we have six lines 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.160
 because each line of output here is present one of the strings 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.320
 from guitar to night 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 so what do you have in the lower coordinate? 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 wake up thicker than this thing is that 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.360
 and here we wake up more cement 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.730
 the crow 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.490
 you see that the serial number appeared on the number that goes in the table turra 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.399
 obs 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.850
 are numbers 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.779
 Do you think that you have to attack? 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.260
 So for example if you have me 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.230
 the fear about 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.230
 this line here this line represents 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.210
 the 6th race 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.060
 so if you take the 6th race 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.670
 and tighten 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.870
 in the first house 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.300
 kiko was missing out here if you were to think about the second house 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
 in the third house 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.720
 fourth house 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.830
 and the images 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.840
 if you 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.320
 photo carnahan 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.490
 it was too much siena 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.490
 it's the same thing 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.390
 the bea cason 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.419
 with him but yes 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.969
 bangu 2 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.969
 once canonical francine 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.310
 so basically 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.340
 such a tradition to win the chemistry test study project in which 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.059
 You know 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.099
 basically this 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.279
 That is 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.619
 if I understood 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.149
 that you notice that it is running 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.529
 at the time hence the sixth quota 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.529
 in the house to 1 and you do the same thing 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.120
 in your subway style it's pretty simple
