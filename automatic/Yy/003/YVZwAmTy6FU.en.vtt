00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.010
 and then guys from October and on channel axn 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.170
 dollars in the area and I'm the maico 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.519
 good people this is a video a little 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.290
 different that we always do there 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.360
 generally the notion our channel and 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.329
 It comes down to doing day care 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.149
 it also boils down to making 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.640
 rands marketing tip everything else however 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.219
 today we are going to change a little bit of 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.649
 ask yourself the reason why so 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.410
 when I was negotiating to make a 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.390
 video that will probably be the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.230
 next video the cold hut we go 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.149
 Bet the problem is that you were to see 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.640
 the boy there I will not say the name 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:11.799
 What are you going to see there and started ks? 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.229
 So I asked that so we still 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.140
 Pick up there to be educated, huh? 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.450
 We ask you to say like this, and there we go. 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.960
 get to advertise the channel and 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.570
 everything else and it does not respond felipe not 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.729
 why will my answer say 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.490
 the next so I do not have to 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.040
 sure that the guy is using some 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.310
 something that is not cool everything else is not 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.100
 We will take revenge and then our 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.119
 how to make our suspicion 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.570
 correct 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.040
 I thought like I'm going to kill a guy. 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.890
 which uses a program that we will not cite 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.680
 which alone is 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.450
 from there comes news of the heavens. 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.820
 my friend mateus who is always in 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.509
 helping the channel and now has generated more 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.189
 still 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.700
 and then we will start our new 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.649
 season that will be called mathew boot 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.450
 but hey guys you can see here 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.189
 We were already starting. 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.130
 only had a slight problem in the middle 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.600
 of all of which had a small 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.819
 little problem 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.010
 I did not have attack magic because 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.790
 I walk as if cold is not here 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.840
 had no shock at all 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.310
 i am bi and the thousand and sucks 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.920
 first time before recording the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.069
 video went to hydro I bought the magic 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.319
 I bought a suit and huck bought a high 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.470
 demand podium home he the person 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.189
 pick up if it solves simply 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:40.310
 we will get attacked in icm revived something 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.920
 of the genre and or what happened I'm 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.030
 Seeing here, we 'll get a 45 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.739
 around the world and so on and 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.450
 So much account that we gave to try 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.150
 kill he could not 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.010
 Then I have an hour I got a spindle 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.900
 time was recording on the last 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.599
 video recording of killing you boots at 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.879
 people did not do well to bet more 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.569
 Finally we go I'll give one a 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.760
 increased in small small 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.889
 speed you've seen the lyon and thence 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.799
 we're trying to steal him potter harry 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.260
 potter is a beauty and hence the people in the 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.109
 tire and medium 22 which degree also short 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.109
 will get on top of the guy and can not 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.690
 kill and from then until the musik I do not know if 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.699
 you know to take the pigeon jec 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.359
 con artist, people are going to make music 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:32.299
 the butyne kill the kill the boot martin 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.280
 butt but finally this song there 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.680
 while we can kill and 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.870
 try to kill him and what happens to 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.609
 We're out of luck. 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.829
 when it seemed that our friend mateus 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.359
 there he was catching us attacking until 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.220
 we got to that point here 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.489
 at this point there is almost killing killing 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.479
 later button a beauty killed 10 in the 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.500
 team 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:58.400
 Look at the real 37 fights and eighty-seven 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.950
 gps and 33 today 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.739
 but at last here was you saw here 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.470
 our much was crap just was not 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.209
 worse than that because of the people leaving 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.920
 that killed an goiano 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.280
 we won a mike rigg so it went like this 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.840
 a beauty thus gave a total loss to 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.039
 people could hardly kill and I 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.859
 I had a certainty that I have a role 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.859
 more key if you want to accomplish but finally 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.030
 it's already a video how to say something but 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.280
 It's already a video. 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.960
 so people this is what I wanted 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.000
 Show you a little video today. 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.740
 different and we 're trying 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.470
 do something better for the team that can 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.180
 roll because the team lets debut in their 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.190
 Who do not know what, then we go. 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.740
 try to do something more 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.660
 Let's try to do something more for ourselves. 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.620
 help and stop these team bugs 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.419
 although you know that the boot says the other 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.310
 butch leitzinger people make the payment 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.050
 more than us but we will have 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.260

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.550
 one more difficulty for our 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.820
