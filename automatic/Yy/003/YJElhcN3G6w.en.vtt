00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.360
 Internet walks in all videos dior lip 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.000
 maximizer and I also received a request 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.790
 do a product review video so 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.930
 impression of look compare like me 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.789
 I look without either a maximizer wound along with 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.859
 im just right now on my lips 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.980
 please keep watching it 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.980
 video 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.540
 Well 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.500
 And now a few words about my impressions 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.470
 to me just recently I got this tester 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.890
 product and I was able a couple of days on want 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.080
 test you know i have a little bit 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.729
 double impression from this 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:36.010
 product on the one hand yes he is good it 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.630
 good gloss even such gloss dash 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.000
 hygienic moisturizer i would 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.790
 said as she practically does not give 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.490
 no color, even though you can do 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.640
 gives no color gives it shine 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.369
 on the lips and at the same time has a thin 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:57.320
 enough flavor which is about a minute 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.330
 after four or five we weather out honestly 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.770
 saying so several times 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.540
 wore them from prada came in looked 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.239
 pricing himself in the mirror looking at himself 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.910
 but somehow I didnâ€™t like it 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.010
 products and if you asked me 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.550
 I would buy it for such money 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.799
 I would not have you, I did not buy 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.140
 Of course I can not advise you 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.930
 if you want to buy 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.970
 I'm just testing with my tester 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.299
 I did not want to buy this 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.000
 product to you for its full value 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.549
 this is not what I like all the same I 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.140
 I think that there is a professional 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.830
 moisturizer as hygienic 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.150
 lipstick is 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.970
 lip gloss that give some 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.830
 shine or color but there is lipstick as well 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.900
 means for me a little bit strange she 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.390
 contains this halogen which 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.750
 how would increase lips smoothing 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.450
 irregularities are possible and this means 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.299
 like girls with enough dry 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.560
 lips and with lips that are a little bit 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.620
 such know such grease a little 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.030
 in general, but there are such lips that 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.640
 always need to moisten a little before 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.459
 applying lipstick to my lips about themselves by 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.590
 naturally enough of such 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.050
 bulging plump and they don't have any 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.660
 folds there they are 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.300
 everything is absolutely so maybe i don't 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.340
 noticed no special effect 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.140
 the only thing I noticed is this 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.120
 that he is naked in principle moistened on them 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.150
 there is no color meaning they are just 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.770
 nicely moistened but really for sure 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.420
 the same effect seems to me possible 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.910
 achieve if you take an ordinary 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.830
 moisturizing is not a day's command or 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.980
 some hygienically moisturizing 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.370
 cream so girls my opinion 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.830
 you heard if you like naturally 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.260
 I'm not going to buy it myself 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.970
 buy from dior me much more 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.310
 like colored glitter 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.590
 And this means a little bit strange 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.750
 as if super magnifying 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.300
 general marketing move in my opinion 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.010
 someone will like it anyway especially 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.890
 I think girls will like it again 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.590
 repeat with dry lips and teeth 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.630
 who are a little bit lacking 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.370
 exactly natural smoothness 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.549
 friends I hope that you have my review 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.890
 turned out to be interesting and useful to see and 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.080
 of course my next videos come on 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.090
 every one I make for you new 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.090
 video plots such
