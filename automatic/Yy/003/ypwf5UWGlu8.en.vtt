I'm using the 64 gig micro sd card

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.410 
I'm using the 64 gig micro sd card
because<00:00:51.579> there's<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.789> lot<00:00:51.969> of<00:00:52.120> them<00:00:52.239> out<00:00:52.359> there

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
because there's a lot of them out there

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.279 
because there's a lot of them out there
and<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:54.129> Phantom<00:00:54.460> 3<00:00:54.690> does<00:00:55.690> not<00:00:55.840> necessarily

if<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.690> started<00:02:02.080> recording<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.610> would<00:02:03.790> start

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
if I started recording that would start

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.240 
if I started recording that would start
to<00:02:04.150> count<00:02:04.360> down<00:02:04.570> because<00:02:05.370> that's<00:02:06.370> consuming

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.170 

physical<00:02:10.030> space<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:11.770> my<00:02:12.010> micro<00:02:12.370> SD<00:02:12.700> card<00:02:12.970> so

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
physical space on my micro SD card so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.920 
physical space on my micro SD card so
see<00:02:13.330> now<00:02:13.360> it's<00:02:13.600> down<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.780> 220<00:02:14.620> 147<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.750> let's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
see now it's down to 220 147 so let's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.990 
see now it's down to 220 147 so let's
format<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.470> again<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.520> let's<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:18.850> go

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
format it again and let's just go

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.260 
format it again and let's just go
through<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.300> various<00:02:19.570> mode<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.260> can<00:02:20.530> see

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
through the various mode so you can see

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.780 
through the various mode so you can see
with<00:02:22.270> this<00:02:22.480> 64<00:02:23.080> gig<00:02:23.260> microSD<00:02:23.980> memory<00:02:24.010> card

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
with this 64 gig microSD memory card

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.910 
with this 64 gig microSD memory card
how<00:02:25.480> much<00:02:25.720> recording<00:02:26.290> time<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.650> would<00:02:26.770> have

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
how much recording time you would have

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.180 
how much recording time you would have
in<00:02:27.100> different<00:02:27.250> video<00:02:27.670> modes<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.480> 4k<00:02:28.900> 32<00:02:29.830> hours

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
in different video modes so 4k 32 hours

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.800 
in different video modes so 4k 32 hours
21<00:02:30.610> minutes<00:02:30.640> 57<00:02:31.150> seconds<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:37.270> now<00:02:37.420> let's<00:02:37.660> go<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
21 minutes 57 seconds so now let's go to

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.430 
21 minutes 57 seconds so now let's go to
4k<00:02:38.560> 24<00:02:39.220> now<00:02:40.120> keep<00:02:40.330> in<00:02:40.480> mind<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.140> most

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
4k 24 now keep in mind this is the most

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.100 
4k 24 now keep in mind this is the most
detailed<00:02:42.270> format<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.870> also

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
detailed format that it is this is also

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.310 
detailed format that it is this is also
often<00:02:44.590> referred<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:45.130> as<00:02:45.280> cinema<00:02:45.700> 4k<00:02:46.320> because

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
often referred to as cinema 4k because

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.660 
often referred to as cinema 4k because
it's<00:02:47.500> 4096<00:02:48.370> by<00:02:48.580> 2160<00:02:49.170> resolution<00:02:50.170> at<00:02:50.740> 24

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
it's 4096 by 2160 resolution at 24

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.010 
it's 4096 by 2160 resolution at 24
frames<00:02:51.850> per<00:02:52.030> second<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.510> let's<00:02:52.720> see<00:02:52.780> how<00:02:52.870> much

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
frames per second so let's see how much

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.220 
frames per second so let's see how much
space<00:02:53.260> how<00:02:53.560> much<00:02:53.680> time<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.100> allows<00:02:55.050> um<00:02:56.050> so

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
space how much time that allows um so

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.320 
space how much time that allows um so
actually<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.710> allows<00:02:56.920> 2<00:02:57.220> hours<00:02:57.670> 21<00:02:58.300> minutes

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
actually it allows 2 hours 21 minutes

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.700 
actually it allows 2 hours 21 minutes
and<00:02:58.720> 57<00:02:59.080> seconds<00:02:59.940> okay<00:03:00.940> let's<00:03:01.180> go<00:03:01.330> down<00:03:01.710> from

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
and 57 seconds okay let's go down from

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.840 
and 57 seconds okay let's go down from
4k<00:03:03.160> let's<00:03:03.520> just<00:03:03.670> go<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.850> 1080<00:03:05.160> well<00:03:06.160> let's<00:03:06.730> go

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
4k let's just go to 1080 well let's go

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.580 
4k let's just go to 1080 well let's go
to<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.570> 4k<00:03:08.790> 24<00:03:10.320> 4096<00:03:11.490> 2162<00:03:12.959> 3840<00:03:13.959> by<00:03:13.989> 2160

30<00:03:15.100> frames<00:03:15.340> per<00:03:15.459> second<00:03:15.790> which<00:03:15.910> we<00:03:16.090> looked<00:03:16.570> at

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
30 frames per second which we looked at

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.830 
30 frames per second which we looked at
originally<00:03:17.290> now<00:03:18.220> there's<00:03:18.489> also<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.850> 3840<00:03:19.810> by

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
originally now there's also a 3840 by

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.370 
originally now there's also a 3840 by
2160<00:03:21.150> 24<00:03:22.150> frames<00:03:22.450> per<00:03:22.630> second<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.050> let's<00:03:23.230> see

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
2160 24 frames per second so let's see

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.990 
2160 24 frames per second so let's see
how<00:03:23.530> much<00:03:23.739> recording<00:03:24.220> time<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.640> one<00:03:24.820> would

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
how much recording time that one would

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.290 
how much recording time that one would
produce<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:29.590> says<00:03:29.800> 2<00:03:30.100> hours<00:03:30.520> 21<00:03:31.270> minutes

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
produce and it says 2 hours 21 minutes

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.890 
produce and it says 2 hours 21 minutes
and<00:03:31.930> 57<00:03:32.920> seconds<00:03:33.459> interesting<00:03:33.970> well<00:03:34.720> let's

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
and 57 seconds interesting well let's

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.110 
and 57 seconds interesting well let's
jump<00:03:35.140> down<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:35.680> let's<00:03:36.220> jump<00:03:36.430> down<00:03:36.489> from<00:03:36.880> 4k

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
jump down to let's jump down from 4k

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.020 
jump down to let's jump down from 4k
let's<00:03:37.600> go<00:03:37.750> down<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:40.390> 1080p<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.650> 1920<00:03:42.550> by

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
let's go down to to 1080p so 1920 by

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.220 
let's go down to to 1080p so 1920 by
1080<00:03:43.540> 60<00:03:43.930> frames<00:03:44.530> per<00:03:44.560> second<00:03:46.080> okay<00:03:47.080> now

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
1080 60 frames per second okay now

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.080 
1080 60 frames per second okay now
that's<00:03:47.380> significantly<00:03:48.070> changed<00:03:48.550> because<00:03:49.000> now

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
that's significantly changed because now

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.509 
that's significantly changed because now
you<00:03:49.269> can<00:03:49.480> see<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.720> says<00:03:49.900> 3<00:03:50.230> hours<00:03:50.650> 32<00:03:51.489> minutes

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
you can see it says 3 hours 32 minutes

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.229 
you can see it says 3 hours 32 minutes
and<00:03:52.060> 58<00:03:52.930> seconds<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.470> that's<00:03:53.590> 1080p<00:03:54.400> 60<00:03:55.209> frames

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
and 58 seconds so that's 1080p 60 frames

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.990 
and 58 seconds so that's 1080p 60 frames
per<00:03:55.540> second<00:03:56.280> let's<00:03:57.280> bump<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.580> down<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.760> little

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
per second let's bump it down a little

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.940 
per second let's bump it down a little
bit<00:03:58.120> more<00:03:58.330> now<00:03:58.420> keep<00:03:58.630> in<00:03:58.750> mind<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.050> 1080p<00:03:59.590> 60

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
bit more now keep in mind that 1080p 60

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.420 
bit more now keep in mind that 1080p 60
frames<00:03:59.980> per<00:04:00.250> second<00:04:01.019> that's<00:04:02.019> twice<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:03.010> of

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
frames per second that's twice that of

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.430 
frames per second that's twice that of
the<00:04:03.730> previous<00:04:04.209> generation<00:04:04.750> phantom<00:04:05.140> three

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
the previous generation phantom three

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.590 
the previous generation phantom three
that<00:04:05.650> was<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.700> know<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.910> was<00:04:07.000> topping<00:04:07.450> out

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
that was you know that was topping out

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.600 
that was you know that was topping out
at<00:04:07.630> 1080p<00:04:08.410> 30<00:04:08.650> frames<00:04:08.920> per<00:04:09.010> second<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:09.430> let's

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
at 1080p 30 frames per second so let's

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.880 
at 1080p 30 frames per second so let's
go<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.959> but<00:04:10.959> we're<00:04:11.260> going<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.440> get<00:04:11.530> down<00:04:11.680> to

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
go to but we're going to get down to

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.210 
go to but we're going to get down to
1080p<00:04:12.250> 30<00:04:12.670> but<00:04:13.120> let's<00:04:13.300> do<00:04:13.480> 1080p

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
1080p 30 but let's do 1080p

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.600 
1080p 30 but let's do 1080p
48<00:04:16.220> frames<00:04:16.489> per<00:04:16.760> second<00:04:17.120> first<00:04:18.459> let's<00:04:19.459> see

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
48 frames per second first let's see

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.320
