00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 hello everyone with you arkady on the clock hour 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.460
 nights I decided to mount my Sonya 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.509
 in principle, there is nothing complicated 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.179
 so we will not consider the video as a guide 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:18.210
 let there be a video of the repair process 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.850
 that is, I just decided to take it off so let's 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.070
 start last time i told you what i 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.660
 got Sonya 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.340
 snap 1 but she had a problem with the block 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.780
 drive also i split what i found in 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.840
 his new city but he was with 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.030
 defect defect defect purely mechanical 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.399
 can any email from 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.340
 mechanical here but nothing mechanics 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.610
 there is no complicated gear too 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.640
 but I don't understand why it doesn't work 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.379
 apparently the very form in which 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.010
 Polish body is cast 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.969
 said with a defect and 1 pin on which 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.920
 keeps 4 to the curve and in one direction 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.719
 the laser goes fine and the other side 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.840
 drying dough stand gear 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:13.229
 slips oh well casually smog 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.220
 I hope to find another one in your town with 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.220
 this will not be such a misfortune 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.509
 how much money can you spend 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:29.070
 find the laser does not open the floor 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.700
 anyway , let's open a worker 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.970
 we will try to install and start here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.780
 disassemble the prefix itself here, too, nothing 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.780
 complex 6 bolts calm unscrew 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.689
 5 these blocks 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:54.479
 drives are pretty but inexpensive well has 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.560
 the price of 1 costs 570 rubles in principle 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.840
 for details 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.840
 imagine 95 is still ok 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.079
 purely not parts to a finger on ebay 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.660
 plus what difference do these also on Chinese 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.220
 assembly production so the same 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.450
 but then at least you can under warranty 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.830
 come back there 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.120
 already back will not send so here 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.840
 It looks like our console 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.670
 disassembled here screen 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.620
 boyfriend of the board of shit will not disassemble 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:39.349
 never need let's get ours 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:39.349
 laser and we will install 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.950
 first, as far as I remember, you need to enable 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.670
 here is this lace 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.880
 He is responsible for the motor that moves 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.880
 laser 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.970
 then already the case of the train 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.610
 cases u need to be careful him 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.390
 very easy to kill so don't 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.280
 Take your time and you do it themselves so 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.950
 as i said nothing complicated about it 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.220
 absolutely 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:26.770
 just still would get like we all 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.770
 hit day 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.280
 it seems so it was well let's put 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.500
 we will not fasten the mug though no 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.440
 You can do it without a cover right now 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.920
 show how to do it 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.260
 turn on the cable for the TV 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.330
 connect to 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:57.100
 don't touch anything here 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:04:03.020
 here 220 volts still teach you bad 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.280
 Then there will be a list not so well, of course 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:11.080
 need a disk 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.080
 let's take a cube so that in our coz 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:25.419
 so and as far as you know the prefix is ​​not 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:28.150
 will start with an open shawl here 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:34.800
 labor keeper then little window 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.800
 bullet him just hold a screwdriver 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.530
 familiar sound 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:05:02.959
 here it is memories and nostalgia so but 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:04.739
 sort of fends off normally 

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:07.979
 nothing clicks 

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:09.719
 and means of a no but I think this 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.379
 Right I will direct it, too dumb 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.379
 turned up 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:27.820
 as far as I understand everything is normal laser 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.820
 will be ok any problems 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:40.849
 now you can play freely on 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.849
 it will probably stop loading 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:52.650
 Once again, our prostavochka but left 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:55.729
 put the lid and twist like this 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.280
 there was this little repair 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.990
