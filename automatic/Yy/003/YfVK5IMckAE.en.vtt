comes inside the art book but at the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.330 
comes inside the art book but at the
same<00:04:14.900> time<00:04:15.110> I<00:04:15.170> think<00:04:15.560> somebody<00:04:15.920> might<00:04:15.980> have<00:04:16.280> a

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
same time I think somebody might have a

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.550 
same time I think somebody might have a
problem<00:04:16.609> with<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:16.940> because<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:18.320> can't

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
problem with it because you can't

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.979 
problem with it because you can't
necessarily<00:04:18.890> line<00:04:19.519> this<00:04:19.729> up<00:04:19.810> next<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.900> the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
necessarily line this up next to the

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.570 
necessarily line this up next to the
