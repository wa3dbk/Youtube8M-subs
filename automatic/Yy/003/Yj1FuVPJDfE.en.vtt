several<00:00:01.110> conditions<00:00:01.589> can<00:00:01.920> lead<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.190> sudden

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
several conditions can lead to sudden

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.880 
several conditions can lead to sudden
cardiac<00:00:03.149> death<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.840> young<00:00:03.990> athletes<00:00:04.529> let's

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
cardiac death and young athletes let's

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.160 
cardiac death and young athletes let's
talk<00:00:05.160> about<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:06.359> most<00:00:06.600> common<00:00:07.020> one

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
talk about the most common one

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.400 
talk about the most common one
hypertrophic<00:00:07.859> cardiomyopathy<00:00:08.240> right<00:00:09.410> yeah

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy right yeah

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.940 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy right yeah
that<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.240> represents<00:00:12.240> probably<00:00:12.929> about<00:00:13.380> 25

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
that that represents probably about 25

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.060 
that that represents probably about 25
or<00:00:14.130> 30<00:00:14.160> percent<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.660> causes<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.410> sudden

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
or 30 percent of the causes of sudden

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.740 
or 30 percent of the causes of sudden
death<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.449> at<00:00:19.230> times<00:00:19.699> hereditary<00:00:20.699> at<00:00:20.970> times

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
death it is at times hereditary at times

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.560 
death it is at times hereditary at times
is<00:00:22.109> not<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.789> talked<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.300> bit<00:00:24.449> about

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
is not and we talked a little bit about

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.200 
is not and we talked a little bit about
the<00:00:24.810> athletes<00:00:25.260> heart<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.400> difference<00:00:26.880> is

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the athletes heart the difference is

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.330 
the athletes heart the difference is
that<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.840> individuals<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.740> thickening

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
that these individuals have thickening

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.849 
that these individuals have thickening
of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.519> heart<00:00:29.789> muscle<00:00:30.410> hypertrophied<00:00:31.410> hearts

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
of the heart muscle hypertrophied hearts

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.069 
of the heart muscle hypertrophied hearts
but<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.759> look<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.270> muscle<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.870> not

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
but if you look at that muscle it's not

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.780 
but if you look at that muscle it's not
normal<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.680> mean<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.190> sort<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> criss

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
normal I mean it's sort of criss

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.440 
normal I mean it's sort of criss
crossing<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.690> very<00:00:37.680> random<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> very

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
crossing and it's very random and very

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.430 
crossing and it's very random and very
bizarre<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.270> normal<00:00:42.600> muscle<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
bizarre and it's not normal muscle and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
bizarre and it's not normal muscle and
the<00:00:43.530> key<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.070> distinguish<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:44.760> what

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the key is to distinguish it from what

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.779 
the key is to distinguish it from what
we<00:00:45.180> call<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.079> athlete<00:00:46.500> saw<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
we call the athlete saw it but it is the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
we call the athlete saw it but it is the
most<00:00:47.969> common<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:49.100> often<00:00:50.100> only<00:00:51.000> presents<00:00:51.390> with

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
most common it often only presents with

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.510 
most common it often only presents with
sudden<00:00:52.050> death<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.649> other<00:00:52.920> words<00:00:53.160> there's<00:00:53.370> not

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
sudden death in other words there's not

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.610 
sudden death in other words there's not
always<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.180> prodrome<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.110> something<00:00:55.469> that's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
always a prodrome or something that's

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
always a prodrome or something that's
going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> identify<00:00:56.059> who<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> die

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
going to identify who is going to die

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.400 
going to identify who is going to die
suddenly<00:00:58.520> these<00:00:59.520> people<00:01:00.109> individuals<00:01:01.109> often

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
suddenly these people individuals often

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.830 
suddenly these people individuals often

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
have normal physical exams they don't

another symptom and that's what we call

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.730 
another symptom and that's what we call
syncope<00:01:38.009> or<00:01:38.040> fainting<00:01:38.270> with<00:01:39.270> exertion<00:01:39.869> that's

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
died early of sudden death and and they

biopsy but unfortunately often the first
thing<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.829> happens<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.640> either<00:01:59.909> pass

thing that happens is they either pass

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.480 
thing that happens is they either pass
that<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:00.990> syncope<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.469> they're<00:02:01.680> dying<00:02:01.950> while
