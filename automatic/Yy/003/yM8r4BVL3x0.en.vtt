00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.000
 then let's move on now to talk about what 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:09.040
 what would be our connections 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.710
 hypothalamus hypophysis arias that is going away 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.200
 to give in two ways we will have the 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.539
 of the hypothalamus with our a of the 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.939
 pituitary and that of the hypothalamus with 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.060
 our neuroses being that of the 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.700
 hypothalamus with that of the pituitary gland a 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.340
 moral type communication 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.590
 and that of the hypothalamus with our neuro 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.460
 hypophysis is going to be a communication from 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.460
 nervous type 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.000
 so let's explain this with this 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.320
 drawing that we have here where 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.040
 we will say that this we are going to get to 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.560
 level of the hypothalamus mostly to 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.720
 level of the supra optic nuclei and the 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.080
 core to ventricular what is going to 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.809
 make the neural bodies of our 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.630
 releasing neurons that would be these 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:07.810
 bodies that we have here then we go to 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:12.280
 say that we are going to have it in the plexus 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.740
 primary of the portal system then 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.170
 we're going to have the secondary plexus of 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.229
 our portal system that will give 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.920
 towards the general circulation and we're going to 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.050
 have a little plexus at the level of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.050
 our neuro hypophysis this is neuro 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.450
 hypophysis and this is to the officer 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.040
 of our neurosis is that it is also going to 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.710
 give directly into the circulation 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.420
 general then what is the difference 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.190
 of the connection of the pituitary with 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.230
 the neuro hypophysis that our of the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.590
 hypophysis has to go through 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.440
 blood your hormones are going to 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.480
 transport through these plexuses 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.220
 from these blood capillaries sorry 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.400
 by means of the plexuses both the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.450
 primary as the secondary unlike 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.390
 of our neuro ofisis where the one that 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.270
 based directly add the substance 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.930
 hormonal to the general circulation 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:16.760
 then let's say you are 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:23.410
 let's give the example of the hormone 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:26.030
 of rh that our hormone this 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.840
 liberating tc then we have 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.480
 our trh network is going to go through 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.750
 medium of granules by a flow blow 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.450
 mico remember this is the flow 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.040
 it's going to happen at the level of the nervous system 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.500
 central because it was a luxury 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.110
 acz or plastic she will move on to what 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.570
 they are going to make our capillaries then 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.820
 through these capillaries is going to get 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.570
 is going to go through what would be the eminence 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.420
 half or the tube and it will get to what 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.090
 would be our pituitary gland then 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.480
 its great they have not been secreting 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.540
 those of the hormone then achieved a 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.360
 time here since we are using the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:13.000
 trh example of this is to bring 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.040
 to stimulate 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.040
 our cells shot troops 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.970
 so that you are somehow believed 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.670
 what would be our stimulating hormone 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:35.480
 thyroid sh tc very well estate 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.330
 sh our hormone is going to go to the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.880
 general circulation to then reach 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.690
 what would be our thyroid gland 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.230
 so that they are created later 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.130
 our thyroid hormones 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.410
 so let's talk about why 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.970
 transport 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.550
 by transport of the neurosis we are going to 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.770
 have that also by flows or plastic 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.230
 from the nuclei of the bodies 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.690
 neuronal we're going to grab and it's going to 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.440
 come transporting what would be our 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.140
 our way we are going to talk here for 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.739
 example of what our idea would be 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.890
 true then we will have the bh 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.260
 green circulating through flows 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.880
 plastics and this one is going to drain 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.970
 directly in the general circulation 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.590
 to go to exercise their functions 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.900
 as for example in the kidney 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.920
 of this we will talk better in the next 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.500
 video likewise then then 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.570
 we are clear then the difference 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.180
 the types of hypothalamus connections 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.600
 officials now let's talk about what 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.600
 would
