actually playing online with random

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
actually playing online with random
people<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.149> live<00:00:48.300> or<00:00:48.450> die<00:00:48.600> by

how good these people are and we end up

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
how good these people are and we end up
playing<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.170> actually<00:00:52.500> pretty<00:00:52.530> fun<00:00:52.800> I

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
playing and it was actually pretty fun I

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.590 
playing and it was actually pretty fun I
actually<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.699> enjoyed<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> map<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
actually really enjoyed the map for the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600 
actually really enjoyed the map for the
most<00:00:54.840> part<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.379> actually<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> would<00:00:56.190> say<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
most part it's actually I would say is a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.279 
most part it's actually I would say is a
bit<00:00:56.820> better<00:00:57.030> than<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> original<00:00:57.390> map<00:00:58.020> just

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
bit better than the original map just

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.959 
bit better than the original map just
because<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> original<00:00:58.859> map<00:00:59.250> itself<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.760> kind

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
because the original map itself you kind

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.779 
because the original map itself you kind
of<00:01:00.059> felt<00:01:00.270> confined<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.949> being<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.520> one

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
of felt confined as to being in this one

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.549 
of felt confined as to being in this one
building<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.719> didn't<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.229> feel<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
building it just didn't really feel that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.500 
building it just didn't really feel that
great<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.189> me<00:01:05.280> whereas<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.180> you're

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
great for me whereas this you're

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.880

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
actually outdoors there's a little bit

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.410 
actually outdoors there's a little bit
of<00:01:07.950> sunshine<00:01:08.159> coming<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> bright<00:01:09.210> colors

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
of sunshine coming out the bright colors

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.730 
of sunshine coming out the bright colors
things<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.380> definitely<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
things like that it's definitely a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.130 
things like that it's definitely a
pretty<00:01:11.070> nice<00:01:11.340> looking<00:01:11.610> overall<00:01:12.119> map<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> lots

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of different areas for you to go to the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
of different areas for you to go to the
sewer<00:01:15.270> itself<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.960> I'll<00:01:16.080> tell<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.350> going

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
sewer itself and I'll tell you going

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
down there into the sewer is not fun for

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.899 
down there into the sewer is not fun for
me<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.400> dark<00:01:20.580> it's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
me because one it's really dark it's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
me because one it's really dark it's
hard<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.689> well<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:22.710> actually

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
hard to see as well as there's actually

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.350 
hard to see as well as there's actually
usually<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.400> lot<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.670> things<00:01:23.850> down<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.060> you

usually a lot of things down there you
have<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.540> go<00:01:24.750> down<00:01:24.900> there<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> get

phase where it's the same kind of idea

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
phase where it's the same kind of idea
as<00:01:31.500> what<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.860> had<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> original<00:01:32.460> XO<00:01:32.850> zombie

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
as what we had in the original XO zombie

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.760 
as what we had in the original XO zombie
map<00:01:33.299> or<00:01:33.420> basically<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.290> infected<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
map or basically if you get infected you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.690 
map or basically if you get infected you
need<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> go<00:01:35.100> into<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> decontamination

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
need to go into a decontamination

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
need to go into a decontamination
chamber<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.720> that's<00:01:37.350> what<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.619> end<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.799> doing

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
chamber and that's what we end up doing

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.200 
chamber and that's what we end up doing
so<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.460> basically<00:01:38.700> stand<00:01:39.030> down

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so you have to get basically stand down

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.910 
so you have to get basically stand down
there<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> dark<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.350> these<00:01:40.500> zombies

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there in the dark with all these zombies

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.109 
there in the dark with all these zombies
sometimes<00:01:41.400> dogs<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> all<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.060> things

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
sometimes dogs and all these things

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.850 
sometimes dogs and all these things
actually<00:01:42.509> end<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:42.930> coming<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.590> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
actually end up coming up for you I

cool<00:02:01.649> now<00:02:02.040> how<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.399> works<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.299> basically

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
cool now how it works is it's basically

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.480 
cool now how it works is it's basically
what<00:02:03.869> people<00:02:04.140> describe<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
what people describe to that is kind of

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.459 
what people describe to that is kind of
like<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.850> microwave<00:02:06.509> gun<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.049> way<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> kind

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
like a microwave gun in a way you kind

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.510 
like a microwave gun in a way you kind
of<00:02:07.560> shoot<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.369> then

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
of shoot it at and then

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.980 
of shoot it at and then
and<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.030> kind<00:02:09.240> of<00:02:09.270> makes<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.660> start<00:02:09.930> to

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
and it kind of makes them start to

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.900 
and it kind of makes them start to
explode<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> little<00:02:10.800> bit<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.640> really

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
explode a little bit but it's really

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.580 
explode a little bit but it's really
kind<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.240> weird<00:02:12.450> because<00:02:12.750> once<00:02:13.170> again<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.500> my

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
kind of weird because once again in my

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.350 
kind of weird because once again in my
limited<00:02:13.800> experience<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.610> noticed<00:02:15.060> if<00:02:15.240> you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
limited experience I noticed if you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.450 
limited experience I noticed if you
don't<00:02:15.630> finish<00:02:15.900> them<00:02:16.050> off<00:02:16.470> they<00:02:17.070> don't

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
don't finish them off they don't

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.430 
don't finish them off they don't
actually<00:02:17.760> explode<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> keep

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
actually explode that you have to keep

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.710 
actually explode that you have to keep
on<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.860> until<00:02:19.920> they<00:02:20.370> explode<00:02:20.520> otherwise<00:02:21.330> it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
on going until they explode otherwise it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.030 
on going until they explode otherwise it
doesn't<00:02:21.810> seem<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.230> work<00:02:22.380> now<00:02:22.560> let<00:02:22.710> me<00:02:22.740> know<00:02:22.830> if

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
doesn't seem to work now let me know if

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.230 
doesn't seem to work now let me know if
that's<00:02:23.190> wrong<00:02:23.460> but<00:02:23.700> that's<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.120> my<00:02:24.210> own

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
that's wrong but that's just for my own

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.790 
that's wrong but that's just for my own
limited<00:02:24.720> experience<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.320> using<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.680> weapons

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
limited experience of using the weapons

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.860 
limited experience of using the weapons
so<00:02:26.130> far<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.880> yes<00:02:27.210> it's<00:02:27.390> actually<00:02:27.630> well<00:02:27.780> those

so far but yes it's actually well those

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.510 
so far but yes it's actually well those
weapons<00:02:28.020> which<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.590> very<00:02:28.830> good<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.340> get<00:02:29.490> a

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
weapons which is very good if you get a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.730 
weapons which is very good if you get a
nice<00:02:29.760> tight<00:02:30.150> train<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.900> zombies<00:02:31.290> behind<00:02:31.620> you

nice tight train of zombies behind you
you<00:02:31.830> turn<00:02:31.980> around<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.460> can<00:02:32.610> light<00:02:32.790> them

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
you turn around that you can light them

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.700 
you turn around that you can light them
all<00:02:33.090> up<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.450> they<00:02:33.780> even<00:02:33.870> give<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> kind<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.530> in

like that or when you really kind of
need<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.750> because<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.350> look<00:02:43.500> down<00:02:43.620> there<00:02:43.800> in

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
need it because you look down there in

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.560 
need it because you look down there in
the<00:02:43.950> bottom<00:02:44.100> right<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.820> actually<00:02:44.970> says<00:02:45.300> what

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the bottom right it actually says what

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.270 
the bottom right it actually says what
percent<00:02:45.960> i<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.320> now<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.830> essentially

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
percent i have now that is essentially

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.220 
percent i have now that is essentially
my<00:02:47.640> ammo<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.360> gun<00:02:48.600> does<00:02:48.780> not<00:02:48.930> overheat

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.920 
my ammo this gun does not overheat
actually<00:02:49.920> works<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.480> percentage<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.690> kind

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
actually works as a percentage so kind

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.870 
actually works as a percentage so kind
of<00:02:52.050> unlike<00:02:52.470> using<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.980> more<00:02:53.220> kind<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.550> unlike

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
of unlike using a more kind of unlike

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.400 
of unlike using a more kind of unlike
using<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.420> laser<00:02:54.570> weapon<00:02:55.020> which<00:02:55.140> can<00:02:55.320> overheat

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
using a laser weapon which can overheat

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.890 
using a laser weapon which can overheat
this<00:02:56.130> one<00:02:56.400> actually<00:02:56.580> goes<00:02:56.790> by<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.390> percentage

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
this one actually goes by a percentage

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.110 
this one actually goes by a percentage
and<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.830> percentage<00:02:59.310> decreases<00:02:59.970> and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
and that percentage decreases and

keep<00:03:05.670> in<00:03:05.790> mind<00:03:05.970> things<00:03:06.240> like<00:03:06.570> upgrading<00:03:07.260> your

keep in mind things like upgrading your

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.200 
keep in mind things like upgrading your
weapon<00:03:07.710> will<00:03:07.860> give<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.100> more<00:03:08.220> ammo<00:03:08.550> as<00:03:08.700> well<00:03:09.060> as

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
weapon will give it more ammo as well as

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.120

skinning Ike máximos within the game
that<00:03:11.340> will<00:03:11.430> actually<00:03:11.580> take<00:03:12.180> your<00:03:12.390> Ambo<00:03:12.630> and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
that will actually take your Ambo and

mckee by the Ambo on this gun works a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.930 
mckee by the Ambo on this gun works a
bit<00:03:16.170> differently<00:03:16.200> as<00:03:16.890> compared<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.700> some<00:03:17.910> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
bit differently as compared to some of

bit differently as compared to some of
the<00:03:18.000> other<00:03:18.090> weapons<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.570> may<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.870> seen<00:03:19.080> in

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
the trailer games included I mean it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.170 
the trailer games included I mean it
definitely<00:03:22.650> works<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.459> lot<00:03:23.580> different<00:03:24.000> than<00:03:24.120> a

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
definitely works a lot different than a

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
far here while playing infection and i

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.990 
far here while playing infection and i
gotta<00:03:34.680> say<00:03:34.920> if<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.250> really<00:03:35.550> had<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.730> pick

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
gotta say if I really had to pick

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.790 
gotta say if I really had to pick
between<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.510> two<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.930> still<00:03:37.200> think<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.530> might

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
between the two I still think I might

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.680 
between the two I still think I might
like<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.550> cel-3<00:03:38.940> collar<00:03:39.209> eyes<00:03:39.420> are<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.630> bit

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
like the cel-3 collar eyes are a bit

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.630 
like the cel-3 collar eyes are a bit
more<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.440> just<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.800> feels<00:03:40.830> as<00:03:41.220> though<00:03:41.340> it's<00:03:41.370> one

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
more it just it feels as though it's one

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.340 
more it just it feels as though it's one
of<00:03:41.700> those<00:03:41.760> powerful<00:03:42.150> weapons<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:43.050> it's

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
of those powerful weapons that like it's

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.900 
of those powerful weapons that like it's
just<00:03:43.500> more<00:03:43.709> useful<00:03:44.250> where's<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.580> other<00:03:44.700> ones

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
just more useful where's the other ones

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.010 
just more useful where's the other ones
like<00:03:45.120> oh<00:03:45.270> I<00:03:45.300> don't<00:03:45.510> know<00:03:45.630> if<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.810> should<00:03:45.840> be

different traps traps there you can

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.150 
different traps traps there you can
actually<00:04:06.570> call<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.050> alligators<00:04:07.739> down<00:04:07.950> there

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160

of<00:06:36.060> every<00:06:36.330> single<00:06:36.510> one<00:06:36.750> of<00:06:36.780> the<00:06:36.960> brand<00:06:37.230> new

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
of every single one of the brand new

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.720 
of every single one of the brand new
maps<00:06:37.500> that<00:06:37.620> we<00:06:37.710> got<00:06:37.830> the<00:06:37.950> ascendance<00:06:38.340> dlc<00:06:38.700> and

hopefully guys stay tuned for that

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.180 
hopefully guys stay tuned for that
because<00:06:40.170> it's<00:06:40.440> probably<00:06:40.650> take<00:06:40.860> a<00:06:40.890> while<00:06:40.980> to

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
because it's probably take a while to

because it's probably take a while to
render<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:41.490> upload<00:06:41.520> because<00:06:41.940> it's<00:06:42.030> all<00:06:42.120> give

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210
