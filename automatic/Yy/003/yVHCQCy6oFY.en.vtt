00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.380
 Welcome to my kitchen, Cocina Con Carmen 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.160
 Today we will make four types of canapés 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.040
 And the ingredients that we will need are the following: 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.840
 For the first one we will need: 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.480
 Small toast bread 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.160
 Or sliced ​​bread cut in four 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.440
 Roquefort cheese or cheese that you like 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.860
 Palometa or salmon 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.340
 And chives 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.100
 The first thing we have to do is take the toast bread 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.880
 We take a piece of Roquefort cheese 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.000
 We put it on top of the toast and spread it 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.900
 Now we will have to take the pommel 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.140
 We cut more or less a square that fits on top of the toast 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.420
 We put it on top 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.380
 Now the pieces of chives 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.480
 We cut them so tiny 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.020
 And we'll put it on you like that 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.940
 And we will do the same with the following 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.760
 For the second one we will need: 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.580

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.060
 Black pitted olives 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.320
 And anchovies 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.020
 First we take some cheese 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.840
 And we anoint it 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.680
 A) Yes 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.560
 We catch the anchovy 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.900
 We put it on top 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.080
 If we see that we have to cut a bit 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.800
 And that's it 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.680
 A little red pepper 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.160
 We cut a band-aid 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.940
 And we put it on top of the anchovy 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.080
 And with the black olive 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.140
 We will have to cut him 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.500
 And we put it like that on the sides 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.000
 And the second one is finished 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.780
 So we should continue with the following 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.940
 For the third we will need: 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.520
 Toast bread or sliced ​​bread cut in four 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.160

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.120
 We take a piece of potato omelet 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.420
 We put the toast on it to cut more or less the piece that we are going to put over 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.800
 So, we have the piece of tortilla prepared 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.440
 We put ketchup on toast 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.420
 And on top of the piece of potato omelet 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.060
 Then we put some mayonnaise on top 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.160
 And next we cut a piece of red pepper and we put it like that 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.580
 Then 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.420
 Two pieces of chives cut it small 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.000
 And we'll put it on top of the mayonnaise 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.480
 And see how nice it looks 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.580

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.180
 Black caviar substitute 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.700
 And olives stuffed with red peppers 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.400
 The first thing we have to do is mix the tuna with mayonnaise 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.940
 We move it 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.240
 Once mixed we take a teaspoon 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.260
 And with the help of the other we put it on top of the toast 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.360
 A) Yes 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.680
 We put some caviar substitute on top 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.180
 A) Yes 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.420
 And we take an olive 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.820
 We cut it in half 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.420
 And we put it in the corner 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.700
 And here we have made the last canapé 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.160
