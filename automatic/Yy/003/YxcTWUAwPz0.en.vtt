00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello everyone with you channel technique suan 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 today this problem does not start 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:23.400
 machine as if all the electronics work 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:27.949
 here time shows mileage is yes 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.949
 and especially music 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:46.230
 everything works as if but when we 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:51.320
 start turning the ignition key with us 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:58.739
 there is such a situation here 1 to 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:02.820
 slightly playable turn 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:08.670
 a little key turns on and now 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:12.049
 I turn on and everything turns off 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.760
 and music 5 continues to play 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.760
 you would demonstrate 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:36.530
 so the problem is clearly to blame 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.950
 battery will remove batteries 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.040
 recharge 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.960
 so raised the hood and 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.479
 there is nothing complicated here is ours 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:55.969
 battery and remove the terminals 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:02:03.259
 removed the battery shot I'm here on 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:06.429
 volts minus and plus plus y and shows 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.879
 we have 11, 2 volts 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.890
 was your why not depend all 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:19.489
 the car 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:21.980
 but will have to put on detente and so 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.319
 for charging i use o charger 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.049
 moto device 119 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:32.060
 but you may have another device 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:35.180
 this is the essence and no matter how important 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.160
 Connect the probes correctly to or 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.459
 crocodiles so to speak on the battery 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.180
 keep the order first + red 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.180
 + y 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:57.980
 I move a minus to a minus connection 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.859
 but we still have a charger 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:09.049
 works when connected only then 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:14.169
 will include in the outlet include our 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:17.720
 better like a light bulb is green 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:21.680
 red color means too if suddenly 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.090
 properly connected pike and on yellow 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.359
 the fact that so was one recharged when 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.919
 recharge our green light 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.130
 light bulb means 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.389
 Kay that we have charged the batteries 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.919
 we can shoot 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:41.840
 named steve tops so see green 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.380
 the light turned on can be turned off 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.380
 recharging 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:53.599
 so 1 charging the battery we take 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.449
 dough expose 5 volts and see what 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:01.430
 this time shows us -3 minus and 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:10.440
 plus plus y see 12, those 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:14.400
 so can better Batman can say that 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.750
 that our battery can be charged 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.390
 connect the car and as it should 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.870
 connect the battery first 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.590
 we connect plus we will connect then 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.920
 minus and if we turn that off 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.110
 first minus and then plus don't forget 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.520
 keys should be here they ignition 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.250
 cars 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:44.720
 so we see in the car that we have 0 and 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:49.159
 on the screen that the battery was disconnected 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.159
 turn the ignition key and 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:02.260
 and what does it all work for us 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.310
