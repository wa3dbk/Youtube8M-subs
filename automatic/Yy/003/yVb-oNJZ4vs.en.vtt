00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 many motorcyclists cannot 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.310
 give up personalizing your own 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.930
 motorcycle or even to create a bike that 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.090
 it is made by hand the famous ones 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 custom the famous vintage motorcycles that much 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.780
 let's see around this time though 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.549
 a difficulty when having a motorcycle 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.080
 personalized and also find a helmet 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.490
 that reflects precisely to its own 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.260
 personality and personality of 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.279
 own motorcycle we are at the stand 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.869
 nolan nolan group 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.960
 as you see my right we have one 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.789
 wall that covered with caps of 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.680
 graphics precisely made by nolan that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 this year we seem to understand tip 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.790
 really a lot on what the is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 vintage look and the custom look and in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.570
 general the possibility of finding a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.070
 helmet that fits really well 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.780
 to his own personality his own bike 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.969
 we are here with sergio ballario which is the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.590
 Italian sales director who nolan 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.940
 I ask immediately to present this again 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.730
 great news that I have supported you on 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.680
 this fantastic special then the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.930
 novelty is called n21 and I don't hide myself 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.300
 than for the Italian market but not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.940
 only in general for the ninth year 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.199
 will be the driving novelty of the whole 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.340
 ours of our whole season 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.920
 within all those that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.930
 then let us present this reason 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.820
 because the 21 however goes in a band 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.950
 of a market segment that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.390
 certainly the one that develops the numbers 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.310
 most important because we talk about the mini 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.040
 kind though actually this helmet 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.500
 born not so much not only for 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 therefore meet a minijack requirement 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 scooter rather than to cover more 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 needs as you see from the colors 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.740
 shown here and are oriented both lo 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.030
 scooters but also a lot in the cafÃ© world 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.689
 racer that has been rediscovered 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.229
 recently but rather to the chaste 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.750
 then two configurations I try to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.090
 synthesize n 21 to 21 visors 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.100
 the nine element the said long so 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.630
 certainly the n 21 is more protective 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.540
 instead it is the most fashionable product 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.680
 Caston more vintage and already among cesa 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.810
 both are developed in two 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.030
 caps for more comfort 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.130
 fit as well as a matter 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.170
 safety 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.180
 version n 21 is born with a single one 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.790
 inner visor which is a visor 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.189
 transparent approved and version 21 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.229
 but I 'm going is the most functional one 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.479
 let's say for clear it was long with 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.399
 internal bps which at this point is a bps 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.410
 dark so a helmet really that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.569
 tip so much on the possibility in this 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.180
 model to find a graphic that 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.500
 like 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.659
 adapts to your personality like 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.489
 we said or why not a helmet that points 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.049
 also very practical and comfortable 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.150
 let's say it looks like a nice mix 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.040
 between the two things and in this case with one 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.629
 deliberately retro graphics deliberately 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.280
 vintage but with a technology 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.409
 absolutely safety 2015 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.109
 I absolutely emphasize this concept 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.969
 why this type of helmet that 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.909
 meets market needs ed 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:39.069
 aesthetics obviously does not disregard from 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.780
 what our ours are 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.420
 stop from a security point of view 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.370
 then helmet is made of polycarbonate but 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.500
 polycarbonate here one speaks of the former also 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.870
 the material that we alone use from 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.639
 always having features of di di 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.439
 impact resistance completely 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.090
 different from the bsa of the classic materials 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.799
 then everything is just plastic 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.810
 invite our customers to come to 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.629
 discover this helmet that will be 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.099
 available approximately from December in our 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.840
 modena showroom and we can't do it 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.459
 other than to thank all the 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.109
 nolan group enters in particular sergio 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.489
 for this beautiful presentation of 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.379
 we give ourselves a fantastic product 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.919
 appointment to the next eicma for others 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.569
 great news 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.370
 it was a pleasure thanks for 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.030
 the opportunity and to the next apple with the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.719
