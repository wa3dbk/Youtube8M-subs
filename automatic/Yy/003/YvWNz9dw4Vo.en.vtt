00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.680
 happened with this photographer that in the 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.420

 photographs he does not know about lighting 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.890
 never passed any kind of class and what 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.250
 he likes it is good to take advantage of the light 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.540
 natural and maybe and you will even have to 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.729
 read people 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.280
 look I do not know some I see them very 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.420
 all natural for photoshop 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.640
 and they are girls who are beautiful but 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.630
 yes but do not look like a super thin 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.880
 190 model that weighs 40 kilos but 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.740
 besides she is already common they are already happening 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.470
 are passing the images that are 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.720
 mixed the first stage were friends and 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.209
 sequences amazing way and then 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.330
 they were models that were interested in the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.450
 work and they started asking him today 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.510
 take pictures no now I do yes I know of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.040
 friends but not if they are very sensual the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.769
 true and when they are in their layer of 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.230
 boyfriends like to give photos to the 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.330
 monkeys and I have a friend that if you 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.700
 sent to take pictures to make a 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.620
 calendar for your boyfriend and agency and 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.660
 also equals the good proposed to go to 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.420
 someone so professional or whatever and 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.819
 he asked a friend I know 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.739
 and he took real photos to win over 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.510
 her boyfriend and good luck of these 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.910
 people end after 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.319
 finally it 's architect ended up being 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.000
 is doing to you this is doing 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.180
 photography and is dedicating access 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.310
 because it is leaving a good 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.549
 What I most wanted most is the eye 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.730
 sensitivity of what you see the moment 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.140
 Exactly there are some pictures too that are 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.959
 wonderful that people like with the moon 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.329
 in your hand or be many is your hand 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.099
 is a professional in the area that is for 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.739
 and obviously there are some others that 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.349
 they pose them as how not to 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.680
 but that photo where he looks at the 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.500
 selphy and the model friend whatever it is 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.260
 stopping the mirror is very clever 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.450
 besides I am I have some friends 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.489
 photographers who would be outraged and 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.290
 annoying not because if they tell you good a 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.269
 photographer is one who is dedicated to 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.310
 he knows he studies and that it takes time and 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.620
 that is good devotes many years of his 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.419
 life being a photographer and they would be 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.459
 very annoying because then do not go out with your 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.500
 cellular and take pictures is to be a photographer 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.389
 but this person, I think that the 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.919
 taste to aesthetics made me have this 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.840
 kind of pictures like the ones we're 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.569
 seeing here and the bodies of the friends 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.889
 that has also helped a lot that 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.129
 there they were made if you have the 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:06.250
 sensitivity well with permission that is yes 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.720
 yes yes there are a lot of people that do not 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.180
 has the possibilities 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.340
 they have that sensitivity have that eye 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.960
 because they will not do it and if they do 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.200
 also for something is making money 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.840
 Of course not all are all in 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:24.850
 instagram that they feel that because they have 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.980
 127 likes are photographers and also if it is 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.230
 true that is not all the big ones 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.060
 photographers I do not mean celebrities that 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.530
 make even for advertisements not to 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.120
 photographers who have a camera 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.950
 professional who take a course with light 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.160
 they can not take the best 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.080
 photographs you study a lot the 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.060
 trajectory of some friends and they are 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.940
 but there is also a chance that good 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.950
 there is not a gift that perhaps that 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.080
 other people have and can get good 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.630
 photographs without having to be totally 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.430
 expert if what happens is that already in 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.700
 instagram good same laugh when you 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.120
 they take the picture the food that you say 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.250
 it seems that someone vomited it 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.430
 very nice on your plate but at the time of 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.700
 upload the photo not then with all the 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.890
 filters that I tell you they say is more 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.540
 easy to find boyfriend who leaked to 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.910
 so 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.010
 instagram fascinate me because I am 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.580
 very many in terms of photo more 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.990
 important in fact then I get into the 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.780
 the photos like they want more videos to 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.840
 JMAS and those which they put me 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.580
 to see or know the people or anything but 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.070
 I am also struck by ingenuity 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.380
 of many instagram users I say 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.170
 there are also many who swear models 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.820
 and then avatar can not be served 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.710
 also lower two lines but to me 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.570
 instagram why I like it for more photos 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.890
 yes to me there are also some very fans photos 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.630
 that even has to do with landscapes or 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.640
 colorful games no I do not see many 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.870
 those of the bikinis because it happened for 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.390
 that my nations are 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.120
 strings m paths neither way of the 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.280
 light not then but then with options 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.440
 I also have not known about that, yes I am not 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.600
 very often on sale but I do see a lot 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.070
 people that yes that good in the case of 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.860
 this guy because now he is doing very well 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.350
 well and let's join in a crossbow for the 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.470
 beginning was that I do not know a sunset 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:16.570
 then it was already are I am this mountain 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.900
 I do not know if I'm seeing the photo thank you 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.000
 no 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.190
 parties seek only find that and your 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.690
 eyes and your moon 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:30.220
 that's the theme of talent because there 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.340
 is to have a chance what can they do 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.530
 go out and take pictures and who knows 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.479
 Well, we have bold, we invite you to 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.470
 keep questioning the information with 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:40.470
 the following videos
