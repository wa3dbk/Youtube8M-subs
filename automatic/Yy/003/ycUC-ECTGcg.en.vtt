 this new video a cut with number 1 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.460
 think about what you will ask yourself 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.619
 I find it silly and I do not 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 compensates at all and sure that to you 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.280
 neither does he throw all those things overboard 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.230
 kilos of fat that we have lost during 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.149
 the year not only for this great investment 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.820
 of time but of perseverance discipline 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.550
 and delivery daily second advice how 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.070
 We are going to give each other a whim and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.079
 We are going to win the odd calorie 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.030
 we will also compensate it as with two 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.829
 options the first let's double the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.870
 time of our aerobic training 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.090
 watts rowing elliptical swimming 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.680
 race if practiced for example 25 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.969
 minutes like I do now 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.059
 during these Christmas dates 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.870
 we will practice 50 minutes motion 2 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.460
 increases from 20 to 30 minutes 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.840
 anaerobic weight because during this 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.570
 training is also lost 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.480
 many calories you will also earn 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.500
 also muscle tips numbers if 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.790
 everyone at the table will be one of the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.460
 activities that we will practice the most 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.990
 surrounded by family friends and many of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 they will take everything in their mouths 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.970
 serve on that table and of course you do not 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.680
 will support your decision to carry out 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 this advice but do not think that you're 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.610
 crazy at all you are mine 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 those who know what is right by 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 that attention we're going to learn to 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 select the best of each table in the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.790
 first courses 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.320
 go for shrimp or seafood 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.090
 is what I only always do in the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.130
 Christmas meals are two dishes 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.080
 again meat enjoys the turkey of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.550
 chicken rabbit loss chicken 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.230
 that have no fat avoid the pig 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.960
 they also really enjoy the 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.360
 vegetables the vegetables the soups that yes 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.890
 the defatted ones even good try 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.050
 avoid salt since it's almost mission 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.910
 impossible not to eat salt during these 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.890
 dates even much more complicated than 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.450
 for the rest of the year but we have it 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.850
 what to try includes in your vocabulary 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.220
 please mine without salt already eat in a 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.320
 restaurant at home with your family and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.880
 friends but try to receive a deadline 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.250
 nole 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.350
 and salt added minute advice let's go 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.670
 try to drink water during meals 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.770
 and the dinners I know that for many of you 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.450
 it will be quite complicated no great 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.920
 effort but we have to try 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.560
 because the reward will be at the end 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.050
 when we can toast with life that 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.540
 more offer us and enjoy it at 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.130
 maximum and we do not feel swollen by 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.860
 all arrivals that we would have ingested 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.900
 during the whole dinner we can celebrate 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.000
 the end of the year with the cup for everything 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.250
 high the sixth council for these dates 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.240
 Christmas tries to avoid that also 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.220
 see that it is quite complicated 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.630
 the sugars I invite them practically 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.340
 always throughout the year perhaps 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.530
 I include in the trap day or the hash 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.570
 milk some sugary piece but in 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.850
 few times and in this case if 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.470
 I do what I do at the end of a meal and if 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.000
 I do it at the end of a dinner it's because 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.310
 I'm going to party to dance with everyone 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.250
 my friends and if you do it better than they are 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.800
 pieces of pure chocolate because they are more 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.200
 low fat but better avoid 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.520
 the sugars this mere advice do not let 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.200
 your workouts in the gym 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.940
 your targeted classes and even 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.440
 your outdoor escapades in 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.970
 this Christmas we have time to 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.320

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.370

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.140
 Christmas days we can not allow 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.510
