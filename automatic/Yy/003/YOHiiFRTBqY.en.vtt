00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180 

now<00:00:00.960> we're<00:00:01.110> going<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.260> talk<00:00:01.439> about<00:00:01.589> bunny<00:00:01.949> hop

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
now we're going to talk about bunny hop

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.420 
now we're going to talk about bunny hop
360s<00:00:03.049> once<00:00:04.049> you<00:00:04.170> have<00:00:04.319> your<00:00:04.440> bunny<00:00:04.710> hop<00:00:04.950> 180<00:00:05.310> is

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
360s once you have your bunny hop 180 is

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.490 
360s once you have your bunny hop 180 is
down<00:00:05.640> 360s<00:00:06.569> are<00:00:06.690> pretty<00:00:06.870> much<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.080> next

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
down 360s are pretty much the next

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.299 
down 360s are pretty much the next
logical<00:00:07.919> step<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:08.970> take<00:00:10.309> it's

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
logical step that you can take it's

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.370 
logical step that you can take it's
actually<00:00:11.639> considerably<00:00:12.420> different<00:00:12.630> doing<00:00:13.259> a

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
actually considerably different doing a

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.860 
actually considerably different doing a
bunny<00:00:13.710> hop<00:00:13.889> 360<00:00:14.519> than<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.880> doing<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> 360<00:00:15.690> off

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
bunny hop 360 than it is doing a 360 off

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.000 
bunny hop 360 than it is doing a 360 off
of<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.109> jump<00:00:16.430> it<00:00:17.630> requires<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:19.050> much<00:00:19.619> stronger

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
of a jump it requires a much stronger

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.609 
of a jump it requires a much stronger
pop<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.510> really<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:22.020> think<00:00:22.080> requires

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
pop and it really I think requires

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.560 
pop and it really I think requires
better<00:00:23.039> form<00:00:23.430> too<00:00:23.730> because<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.150> don't<00:00:24.510> have

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
better form too because you don't have

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.540 
better form too because you don't have
nearly<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:24.960> much<00:00:25.140> time<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.529> spin<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.430> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
nearly as much time to spin it so you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.019 
nearly as much time to spin it so you
actually<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.330> spin<00:00:27.630> everything<00:00:27.689> faster

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
actually have to spin everything faster

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.330 
actually have to spin everything faster
the<00:00:30.029> way<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.630> lot<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> people<00:00:31.260> first<00:00:32.160> learn

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the way that a lot of people first learn

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.000 
the way that a lot of people first learn
how<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:32.759> bunny<00:00:32.969> hop<00:00:33.180> 360s<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> by<00:00:34.170> doing<00:00:34.230> 360

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
how to do bunny hop 360s is by doing 360

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.920 
how to do bunny hop 360s is by doing 360
tail<00:00:35.190> taps<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.640> flat<00:00:35.880> ground<00:00:36.149> which<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.780> when

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
tail taps on flat ground which is when

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.950 
tail taps on flat ground which is when
you<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> 180<00:00:37.820> you<00:00:38.820> land<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.510> back<00:00:39.690> wheel

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
you do a 180 you land on your back wheel

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
you do a 180 you land on your back wheel
and<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.230> don't<00:00:40.410> let<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.649> front<00:00:40.890> wheel

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and you don't let your front wheel

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.880 
and you don't let your front wheel
touchdown<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.790> from<00:00:42.480> there<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.590> almost

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
touchdown and from there you do almost

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250 
touchdown and from there you do almost
like<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> Foofa<00:00:44.460> new<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.789> pick<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> spin

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
like a Foofa new and pick up and spin

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.190 
like a Foofa new and pick up and spin
completing<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> 360<00:00:47.570> what<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.750> does<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
completing the 360 what that does is it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.979 
completing the 360 what that does is it
gives<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> better<00:00:49.980> sense<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.989> continuing

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
gives you a better sense of continuing

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.279 
gives you a better sense of continuing
that<00:00:52.350> spin<00:00:52.739> past<00:00:53.039> 180<00:00:53.550> degrees<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> that's<00:00:55.050> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that spin past 180 degrees and that's it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.779 
that spin past 180 degrees and that's it
so<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> pretty<00:00:55.770> important<00:00:56.250> step<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.610> take

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
so it's a pretty important step to take

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.279 
so it's a pretty important step to take
and<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.180> you're<00:00:57.300> having<00:00:57.329> trouble<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:58.170> your

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and if you're having trouble with your

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
and if you're having trouble with your
360<00:00:58.770> s<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.160> might<00:00:59.309> want<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.640> back<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.850> that

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
360 s you might want to go back to that

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.689 
360 s you might want to go back to that
step<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.590> really<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.280> said<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.579> will

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
step because it really as I said it will

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
step because it really as I said it will
allow<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.379> regain<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> sense<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
allow you to regain a sense for the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.429 
allow you to regain a sense for the
continuation<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.479> motion<00:01:06.930> throughout<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
continuation of motion throughout the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.910 
continuation of motion throughout the
spin<00:01:08.390> for<00:01:09.390> me<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.540> personally<00:01:10.409> think<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
spin for me I personally think that the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.070 
spin for me I personally think that the
best<00:01:11.100> way<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> learn<00:01:11.549> bunny<00:01:11.820> hop<00:01:12.000> 360s<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.840> off

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
best way to learn bunny hop 360s is off

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
best way to learn bunny hop 360s is off
of<00:01:13.229> something<00:01:13.470> flat<00:01:13.890> into<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.590> very<00:01:16.590> close

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
of something flat into a very very close

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.390 
of something flat into a very very close
to<00:01:17.340> flat<00:01:17.610> wedge<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:19.500> reason<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.950> say<00:01:20.189> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
to flat wedge the reason that I say that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.450 
to flat wedge the reason that I say that
is<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:22.439> forces<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.140> travel<00:01:25.140> at<00:01:25.460> with

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
is that it forces you to travel at with

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.200 
is that it forces you to travel at with
just<00:01:27.210> enough<00:01:27.330> speed<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.340> make<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.549> into<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
just enough speed to make it into that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.969 
just enough speed to make it into that
wedge<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> does<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> keeps<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
wedge and what that does is it keeps you

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.370 
wedge and what that does is it keeps you
from<00:01:34.979> whipping<00:01:35.640> around<00:01:35.970> too<00:01:36.329> much<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> gives

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
from whipping around too much and gives

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.950 
from whipping around too much and gives
you<00:01:37.530> more<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.860> sense<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.479> using<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.630> quick

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you more of a sense of using a quick

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
you more of a sense of using a quick
carve<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.829> front<00:01:41.009> wheel<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.460> generate

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
carve with your front wheel to generate

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.030 
carve with your front wheel to generate
that<00:01:42.119> type<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> spin<00:01:42.869> which<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.649> really<00:01:43.860> going

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that type of spin which is really going

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.410 
that type of spin which is really going
to<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.250> pretty<00:01:44.460> helpful<00:01:44.640> once<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.180> start

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
to be pretty helpful once you start

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.440 
to be pretty helpful once you start
trying<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.899> bunny<00:01:46.110> hop<00:01:46.290> 360s<00:01:47.180> over<00:01:48.180> bigger

stuff where you know if you're trying to
