00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
my camera batteries have been trying to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.359 
my camera batteries have been trying to
die<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.769> me<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.800> run<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.920> camera

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
die on me so I have to run this camera

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.330 
die on me so I have to run this camera
with<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> plugged<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.099> kind<00:00:32.309> of

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
with it plugged in so that kind of

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.310 
with it plugged in so that kind of
limits<00:00:32.669> severely<00:00:33.270> limits<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.200> do

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320

the question of the problem that the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.799 
the question of the problem that the
viewer<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.469> having<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.579> his<00:00:57.059> choke<00:00:57.570> on

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
viewer was having was that his choke on

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.740 
viewer was having was that his choke on
his<00:00:57.899> carburetor<00:00:58.260> functioned<00:00:59.039> properly<00:00:59.750> it

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
his carburetor functioned properly it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.319 
his carburetor functioned properly it
did<00:01:00.960> fast<00:01:01.260> idle<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.920> indeed<00:01:02.550> keep<00:01:02.910> down<00:01:03.120> like

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
did fast idle and indeed keep down like

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.109 
did fast idle and indeed keep down like
it's<00:01:03.510> supposed<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.930> when<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.409> warming<00:01:04.680> up

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
it's supposed to when it was warming up

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.090 
it's supposed to when it was warming up
but<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> problem<00:01:06.720> he's<00:01:06.869> having<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
but the problem he's having is that the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.880 
but the problem he's having is that the
idle<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.700> too<00:01:08.880> fast<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.570> title<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.200> fast<00:01:10.650> idle

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
idle is too fast the title the fast idle

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.230 
idle is too fast the title the fast idle
is<00:01:11.220> way<00:01:11.549> too<00:01:11.610> fast<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.760> got<00:01:14.760> thinking<00:01:15.060> about

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
is way too fast so I got thinking about

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
is way too fast so I got thinking about
it<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> didn't<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:15.900> cover<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.380> very

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it and I didn't really cover this very

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.850 
it and I didn't really cover this very
good<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> choke<00:01:17.490> videos<00:01:18.500> there<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.680> an

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
good in the choke videos there is an

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.710 
good in the choke videos there is an
adjustment<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> fast<00:01:20.939> idle<00:01:21.210> speed<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
adjustment for the fast idle speed on a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
adjustment for the fast idle speed on a
quarter<00:01:22.140> jet<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.799> dual<00:01:23.009> jet<00:01:23.340> which

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
quarter jet and a dual jet which

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
quarter jet and a dual jet which
remember<00:01:24.450> me<00:01:24.570> saying<00:01:24.750> before<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> dual<00:01:25.470> jet

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
remember me saying before a dual jet

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.880 
remember me saying before a dual jet
you'll<00:01:26.070> know<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.759> basically<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> front

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
you'll know is this basically the front

you'll know is this basically the front
half<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:30.590> Quadrajet<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:32.820> guys<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.390> have

half of a Quadrajet you guys that have
these<00:01:34.110> 231<00:01:34.860> Buicks<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.549> some<00:01:36.450> other<00:01:36.630> engines

these 231 Buicks and some other engines

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.190 
these 231 Buicks and some other engines
you<00:01:37.350> properly<00:01:37.799> familiar<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.340> those<00:01:38.520> they

you properly familiar with those they

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
you properly familiar with those they
they<00:01:40.200> work<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.280> far<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.520> choke<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
they work you know as far as choke and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
they work you know as far as choke and
primary<00:01:43.020> aside<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.799> they're<00:01:44.100> that

primary aside and all that they're that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.190 
primary aside and all that they're that
just<00:01:44.759> essentially<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> same<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> quarter

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
just essentially the same as a quarter

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.850 
just essentially the same as a quarter
jet<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.829> no<00:01:47.009> secondaries<00:01:48.530> but<00:01:49.530> anyway<00:01:49.829> I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
jet just no secondaries but anyway I

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.429 
jet just no secondaries but anyway I
wanted<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> show<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.299> real<00:01:51.659> quick<00:01:51.960> where<00:01:52.259> this

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
wanted to show you real quick where this

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.319 
wanted to show you real quick where this
idle<00:01:52.829> speed<00:01:53.100> adjustment<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.090> fast

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
idle speed adjustment is for the fast

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.760 
idle speed adjustment is for the fast
idle<00:01:54.600> now<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.960> gotta<00:01:55.170> pay<00:01:55.229> attention<00:01:55.680> what

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
idle now you gotta pay attention what

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.870 
idle now you gotta pay attention what
I'm<00:01:55.890> saying<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.369> because<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.610> kind<00:01:59.820> of

you just the base idle this is after

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.350 
you just the base idle this is after
after<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.590> car<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.340> warmed<00:02:54.700> up<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.090> engines

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
after the car is warmed up the engines

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.090 
after the car is warmed up the engines
hot<00:02:55.569> it's<00:02:55.959> operating<00:02:56.500> temperature<00:02:56.920> that

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
hot it's operating temperature that

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.759 
hot it's operating temperature that
choke<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.489> not<00:02:57.700> on<00:02:57.910> now<00:02:58.840> if<00:02:59.170> you're<00:02:59.410> like<00:02:59.560> the

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
choke is not on now if you're like the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.229 
choke is not on now if you're like the
viewer<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.250> was<00:03:00.489> telling<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.850> about<00:03:00.880> that

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
viewer that I was telling you about that

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.570 
viewer that I was telling you about that
he's<00:03:01.450> having<00:03:01.660> some<00:03:01.959> problems

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
he's having some problems

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.130 
he's having some problems
he<00:03:03.580> said<00:03:03.790> his<00:03:03.910> engines<00:03:04.269> just<00:03:04.420> running<00:03:04.750> away<00:03:04.840> is

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
he said his engines just running away is

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.910 
he said his engines just running away is
like<00:03:05.700> 2500<00:03:06.700> rpm<00:03:07.450> when<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.170> chokes<00:03:08.410> on<00:03:08.650> that's

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
like 2500 rpm when the chokes on that's

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.349 
like 2500 rpm when the chokes on that's
wait<00:03:09.130> that's<00:03:09.489> way<00:03:09.670> too<00:03:09.700> high<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:11.970> he<00:03:12.970> says<00:03:13.209> it

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
wait that's way too high so he says it

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.750 
wait that's way too high so he says it
does<00:03:13.510> idle<00:03:13.930> normally<00:03:14.290> once<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.650> warms<00:03:15.100> up<00:03:15.400> so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
does idle normally once it warms up so

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.849 
does idle normally once it warms up so
that<00:03:16.090> tells<00:03:16.329> me<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:17.079> have<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.290> go<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.590> the

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
that tells me that you have to go to the

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.789 
that tells me that you have to go to the
other<00:03:18.540> idle<00:03:19.540> speed<00:03:19.780> adjustment<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
other idle speed adjustment this is the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.490 
other idle speed adjustment this is the
fast<00:03:21.220> idle<00:03:21.489> speed<00:03:21.880> adjustment<00:03:22.420> these<00:03:23.320> are

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
fast idle speed adjustment these are

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.080 
fast idle speed adjustment these are
separate<00:03:23.920> these<00:03:24.130> do<00:03:24.340> two<00:03:24.549> different<00:03:24.910> things

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090

hell it is but that's the fast idle
speed<00:03:44.200> adjustment<00:03:44.799> you<00:03:45.579> need<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.910> adjust<00:03:46.000> this

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
speed adjustment you need to adjust this

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.180 
speed adjustment you need to adjust this
when<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.810> engine<00:03:47.109> is<00:03:47.230> running<00:03:47.500> on<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.950> choke

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
when the engine is running on the choke

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.780 
when the engine is running on the choke
on<00:03:48.489> fast<00:03:49.030> idle<00:03:49.980> if<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.130> try<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.340> adjust<00:03:51.489> it

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
on fast idle if you try to adjust it

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.340 
on fast idle if you try to adjust it
after<00:03:52.060> it's<00:03:52.180> hot<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.569> warmed<00:03:52.870> up<00:03:53.019> you<00:03:53.200> won't

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
after it's hot and warmed up you won't

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.870 
after it's hot and warmed up you won't
they<00:03:53.560> won't<00:03:53.709> do<00:03:53.890> anything<00:03:53.920> won't<00:03:54.489> make<00:03:54.700> any

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
they won't do anything won't make any

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.490 
they won't do anything won't make any
difference<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.420> know<00:03:55.660> next<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.140> won't<00:03:56.319> know

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
difference you know next you won't know

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.849 
difference you know next you won't know
what's<00:03:56.859> going<00:03:57.160> good<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.480> till<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.829> next

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
what's going good on it till the next

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.400 
what's going good on it till the next
time<00:04:00.190> it's<00:04:00.489> on<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.790> choke<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:01.510> let's<00:04:02.230> take<00:04:02.380> a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
time it's on the choke so let's take a

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.590 
time it's on the choke so let's take a
little<00:04:02.680> side<00:04:03.640> look<00:04:03.940> at<00:04:04.120> this

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
little side look at this

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.449 
little side look at this
so<00:04:05.139> you<00:04:05.200> can<00:04:05.410> kind<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.680> worry<00:04:05.889> interest<00:04:06.280> self

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
so you can kind of worry interest self

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.090 
so you can kind of worry interest self
and<00:04:06.549> you<00:04:06.609> see<00:04:06.819> it<00:04:06.970> kind<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.799> kind<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.859> got<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
and you see it kind of kind of got the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.940 
and you see it kind of kind of got the
same<00:04:09.310> situation<00:04:10.000> as<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:11.350> other<00:04:11.470> side<00:04:11.739> the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
same situation as the the other side the

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.129 
same situation as the the other side the
base<00:04:12.130> idle<00:04:12.549> it's<00:04:12.700> got<00:04:12.850> a<00:04:13.030> little<00:04:13.299> arm<00:04:13.480> here<00:04:13.900> and

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
base idle it's got a little arm here and

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.170 
base idle it's got a little arm here and
it's<00:04:14.260> got<00:04:14.440> where<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.040> screw<00:04:15.340> screws<00:04:15.639> into<00:04:16.030> it

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
it's got where the screw screws into it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.120 
it's got where the screw screws into it
and<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.419> spring<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.109> all<00:04:17.169> that<00:04:17.409> so<00:04:17.650> functions

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
and the spring and all that so functions

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.580 
and the spring and all that so functions
the<00:04:18.250> same<00:04:18.280> way<00:04:18.720> but<00:04:19.720> that's<00:04:19.930> what<00:04:20.140> sets<00:04:20.440> your

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
the same way but that's what sets your

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.290 
the same way but that's what sets your
fast<00:04:20.890> idle<00:04:21.159> speed<00:04:21.489> on<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.729> village

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
fast idle speed on a village

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
now what you don't want to do is you

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.070 
now what you don't want to do is you
don't<00:05:06.789> want<00:05:06.909> to<00:05:06.969> get<00:05:07.090> confused<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.840> get<00:05:07.990> the

don't want to get confused and get the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.379 
don't want to get confused and get the
wrong<00:05:08.229> screws<00:05:08.849> then<00:05:09.849> you<00:05:09.940> see<00:05:10.120> there's<00:05:10.360> two

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
wrong screws then you see there's two

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:11.969 
wrong screws then you see there's two
other<00:05:10.719> screws<00:05:11.080> here<00:05:11.319> right<00:05:11.500> on<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.740> front<00:05:11.949> of

the carburetor this one and this one

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.100 
the carburetor this one and this one
these<00:05:15.460> are<00:05:15.520> idle<00:05:15.969> mixture<00:05:16.120> screws<00:05:16.659> and<00:05:16.870> this

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
these are idle mixture screws and this

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.409 
these are idle mixture screws and this
is<00:05:17.289> a<00:05:17.319> whole<00:05:17.680> different<00:05:18.310> ball<00:05:18.729> of<00:05:18.759> wax<00:05:18.909> I've

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
is a whole different ball of wax I've

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.839 
is a whole different ball of wax I've
covered<00:05:19.690> this<00:05:19.900> on<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.110> different<00:05:20.440> video<00:05:20.849> so

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
covered this on a different video so

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.580 
covered this on a different video so
this<00:05:22.120> is<00:05:22.300> just<00:05:22.479> that's<00:05:22.960> this<00:05:23.289> is<00:05:23.349> an

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
this is just that's this is an

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.890 
this is just that's this is an
adjustment<00:05:23.979> that<00:05:24.129> you<00:05:24.909> do<00:05:25.090> after<00:05:25.330> it's<00:05:25.599> warmed

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
adjustment that you do after it's warmed

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.420 
adjustment that you do after it's warmed
up<00:05:26.080> and<00:05:26.289> you're<00:05:26.440> just<00:05:26.469> trying<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.949> tweak<00:05:27.219> the

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
up and you're just trying to tweak the

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.589 
up and you're just trying to tweak the
idle<00:05:27.669> mixture<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.990> know<00:05:29.139> it<00:05:29.380> kind<00:05:29.860> of<00:05:30.599> in

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
idle mixture you know it kind of in

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.390 
idle mixture you know it kind of in
essence<00:05:32.050> it<00:05:32.199> does<00:05:32.349> kind<00:05:32.620> of<00:05:32.680> affect<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:33.130> idle

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
essence it does kind of affect the idle

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.240 
essence it does kind of affect the idle
speed<00:05:33.490> but<00:05:33.909> you<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.719> know<00:05:34.900> you<00:05:35.349> do<00:05:35.500> base<00:05:35.740> idle

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
speed but you you know you do base idle

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.899 
speed but you you know you do base idle
and<00:05:36.520> make<00:05:37.090> sure<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.569> got<00:05:38.080> this<00:05:38.289> covered<00:05:38.650> also

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
and make sure you got this covered also

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.120 
and make sure you got this covered also
if<00:05:39.909> you're<00:05:40.120> wondering<00:05:40.569> how<00:05:40.779> can<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.229> get<00:05:42.099> a

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
if you're wondering how can you get a

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.309 
if you're wondering how can you get a
quarter<00:05:42.490> jet<00:05:42.880> that's<00:05:43.360> running<00:05:43.750> on<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:44.050> choke

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
quarter jet that's running on the choke

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.019 
quarter jet that's running on the choke
you<00:05:44.560> know<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.770> chokes<00:05:45.009> engage<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.639> can<00:05:45.789> see

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
you know the chokes engage you can see

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.589 
you know the chokes engage you can see
it<00:05:46.199> how<00:05:47.199> you<00:05:47.259> can<00:05:47.639> manually<00:05:48.639> pop<00:05:49.029> it<00:05:49.210> off<00:05:49.360> the

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
it how you can manually pop it off the

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.779 
it how you can manually pop it off the
choke<00:05:49.870> you<00:05:50.770> know<00:05:50.889> if<00:05:51.009> you<00:05:51.099> want<00:05:51.279> just<00:05:51.460> dial<00:05:51.639> it

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
choke you know if you want just dial it

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.040 
choke you know if you want just dial it
down<00:05:51.819> for<00:05:52.210> whatever<00:05:52.360> reason<00:05:52.750> I'm<00:05:52.840> going<00:05:52.960> to

pull down and instantly out and down to
its<00:06:16.360> base<00:06:16.599> idle<00:06:16.990> speed<00:06:17.199> so<00:06:17.969> that's<00:06:18.969> how<00:06:19.150> that

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
its base idle speed so that's how that

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.899 
its base idle speed so that's how that
works<00:06:19.389> guys<00:06:20.009> hope<00:06:21.009> this<00:06:21.219> kind<00:06:21.400> of<00:06:21.520> clears<00:06:21.729> this

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
idle is you know try to match them up so

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.660 
idle is you know try to match them up so
it<00:07:04.940> doesn't<00:07:04.970> how<00:07:05.300> fast<00:07:05.720> when<00:07:05.900> it's<00:07:06.020> cold<00:07:06.670> you

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:07.670 
it doesn't how fast when it's cold you

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.670 
it doesn't how fast when it's cold you
know<00:07:07.760> it'll<00:07:08.210> probably<00:07:08.300> work<00:07:08.570> but<00:07:09.020> you<00:07:09.530> know

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
know it'll probably work but you know

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.280 
know it'll probably work but you know
I'll<00:07:09.950> the<00:07:10.220> idea<00:07:10.790> of<00:07:10.970> fast<00:07:11.240> idle<00:07:11.510> is<00:07:11.750> to<00:07:11.900> warm<00:07:12.140> it

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
I'll the idea of fast idle is to warm it

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.130 
I'll the idea of fast idle is to warm it
up<00:07:12.380> a<00:07:12.530> little<00:07:12.620> bit<00:07:12.860> so<00:07:13.250> keep<00:07:14.090> it<00:07:14.270> you<00:07:14.480> know<00:07:14.540> keep

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
up a little bit so keep it you know keep

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.950 
up a little bit so keep it you know keep
it<00:07:15.320> at<00:07:15.560> a<00:07:15.680> normal<00:07:16.070> speed<00:07:16.450> you<00:07:17.450> don't<00:07:17.480> wind<00:07:17.900> up

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
it at a normal speed you don't wind up

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.600 
it at a normal speed you don't wind up
so<00:07:18.170> highly<00:07:18.530> when<00:07:18.650> you<00:07:18.740> drop<00:07:18.980> it<00:07:19.100> in<00:07:19.220> gear<00:07:19.430> it's

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 
so highly when you drop it in gear it's

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.430 
so highly when you drop it in gear it's
about<00:07:19.760> to<00:07:19.910> jerk<00:07:20.150> the<00:07:20.180> driveshaft<00:07:20.540> out<00:07:21.110> of<00:07:21.290> it

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
about to jerk the driveshaft out of it

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.490 
about to jerk the driveshaft out of it
but<00:07:21.890> you<00:07:22.040> don't<00:07:22.220> want<00:07:22.430> it<00:07:22.550> you<00:07:23.270> know

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
but you don't want it you know

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.580 
but you don't want it you know
