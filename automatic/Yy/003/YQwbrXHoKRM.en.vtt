00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.860 
would go over it again and press it in
and<00:04:53.230> then<00:04:53.500> do<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:54.100> downward<00:04:54.340> motions<00:04:55.060> now<00:04:55.750> if

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
and then do the downward motions now if

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.540 
and then do the downward motions now if
you<00:04:55.990> see<00:04:56.200> that<00:04:56.410> has<00:04:56.560> definitely<00:04:56.980> blended<00:04:57.430> it

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
you see that has definitely blended it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.640 
you see that has definitely blended it
in<00:04:57.820> more<00:04:58.150> which<00:04:58.510> is<00:04:58.780> why<00:04:58.930> they<00:04:59.170> say<00:04:59.380> it<00:04:59.500> makes

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
in more which is why they say it makes

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.980 
in more which is why they say it makes
it<00:04:59.800> adhere<00:05:00.280> better<00:05:00.780> because<00:05:01.780> you're<00:05:01.900> not

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
it adhere better because you're not

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.750 
it adhere better because you're not
having<00:05:02.260> it<00:05:02.440> just<00:05:02.620> sit<00:05:02.800> on<00:05:02.830> top<00:05:03.130> of<00:05:03.190> your<00:05:03.370> skin

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
having it just sit on top of your skin

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.470 
having it just sit on top of your skin
so<00:05:04.470> I<00:05:05.470> have<00:05:05.710> done<00:05:05.920> that<00:05:05.980> I<00:05:06.310> do<00:05:06.430> still<00:05:07.000> use<00:05:07.240> this

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
so I have done that I do still use this

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.860 
so I have done that I do still use this
every<00:05:07.840> once<00:05:08.110> in<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.410> while<00:05:09.420> when<00:05:10.420> I'm<00:05:10.570> out
