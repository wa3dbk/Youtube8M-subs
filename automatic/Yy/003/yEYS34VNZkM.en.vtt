00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
shoes you guys can see I haven't walk in

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.430 
shoes you guys can see I haven't walk in
these<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:30.770> there's<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:30.980> pretty<00:04:31.190> clean<00:04:31.490> snow<00:04:31.730> so

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
these so there's a pretty clean snow so

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.980 
these so there's a pretty clean snow so
you<00:04:33.440> guys<00:04:33.590> can<00:04:33.740> see<00:04:34.180> there's<00:04:35.180> orange<00:04:35.780> and

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.240 
you guys can see there's orange and
green<00:04:36.110> thus<00:04:36.380> two<00:04:36.530> different<00:04:36.800> color<00:04:36.920> schemes<00:04:37.160> I

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
green thus two different color schemes I

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.670 
green thus two different color schemes I
don't<00:04:37.400> know<00:04:37.460> why<00:04:37.610> but<00:04:38.170> sure<00:04:39.170> why<00:04:39.380> not

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.230
