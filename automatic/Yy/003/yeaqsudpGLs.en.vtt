00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.790
 hannover text age that knows this 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.809
 you already that's the htc whenever 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.670
 one more of the best 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.220
 android smartphones are currently on it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.890
 There are currently silver in the market 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.810
 as well as here and in black and that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.519
 will soon come out in red 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.990
 It will be exactly in two in the near future 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.300
 weeks on 21 July 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.650
 and at the moment when you have the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.290
 Price comparison services impression that is 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.670
 a bit more expensive than the two 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.020
 other models is certainly 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.890
 also because it simply is not 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.989
 is available 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.149
 that's it it looks like if I did 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 anyone would have said that before 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.719
 htc when comes in red, I would have said 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.890
 oh my god she shit out now 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.070
 I have his hand and honestly 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.760
 It does not look so bad 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.730
 is aluminum red anodized speak it 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.210
 it shines and it just got in the mirror 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.640
 sunlight a pretty interesting 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.710
 behavior between fades and fades 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.680
 not so it just makes something up 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.439
 the front we have up here and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.600
 Below is the red elements in between 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.130
 it 's actually always the display 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.990
 the glass pane that's why it's that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.820
 black somehow looks very interesting 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.950
 out and on the back we have too 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.930
 here these isolators among which the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.479
 Antennas sit with the antennae 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.310
 disconnect from the rest of the housing and also 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.680
 that makes for an interesting one 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 contrast 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.880
 I have to say quite honestly in comparison 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.710
 to the colorful plastic phones of others 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.700
 Manufacturer 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 and how it has now also here earlier 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.210
 That's what I could do 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.860
 I do not know if I can 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.619
 really run around with a red device 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.530
 but that would at least have something 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.659
 and it really looks live 1000 times 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.579
 better than I ever thought before 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.829
 has presented what remains 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.750
 is the same problem what the black 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.159
 had also or has 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.930
 all metal devices colored colorful 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.770
 painted anodized or whatever 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.509
 are 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.509
 because just crawls the box 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.700
 even if it is here in this case 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.280
 Anodized is the color can go off 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.989
 So when I gets this now needs 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.590
 not now if I'm somewhere 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.160
 I've got it wherever it happens 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.450
 a resistance hits as the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.519
 surface itself endures then is the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.349
 color reflects and behind it and 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.760
 shines is silver would have been seen 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.290
 Here is a tiny little katzer in it 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.630
 Anodized means remains relatively 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.769
 the situation is long but he can off 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.750
 go and when he leaves it is 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:51.209
 behind silver the only possibility 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.670
 which I have now the sow the 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.500
 only possibility I have around that 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.150
 to circumvent a problem speaks for it 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.950
 Mobile as long as possible 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.049
 looks like i'm buying it right in 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.000
 silver because if I have an edge on it 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.829
 Although the surface works the same way 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.379
 broken like the black or the 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.799
 red model but it just does not fall 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.260
 as otherwise stated 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.120
 priced 570 euros who until now 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.380
 Pre-ordered because it's two weeks 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.840
 Outside, I think the price will be 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.100
 relatively quickly again around the 20 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.049
 Euro fall looks good and pleasing 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.000
 I would like to know what you are 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.060
 of it you hold one such 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.100
 gadget would buy the htc man in red 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.959
 or any other mobile phone in 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.340
 bright colors until now do themselves 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.590
 most manufacturers yes there 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.609
 a bit difficult with this execution 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.609
 to bring to the german market
