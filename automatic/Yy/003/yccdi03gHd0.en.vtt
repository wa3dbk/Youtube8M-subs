passengers<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:41.920> should<00:01:42.100> say<00:01:42.280> will<00:01:42.550> also<00:01:42.940> notice

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
passengers I should say will also notice

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.300 
passengers I should say will also notice
that<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:44.229> don't<00:01:44.380> notice<00:01:44.500> two<00:01:44.680> power<00:01:44.830> changes

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
that you don't notice two power changes

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.669 
that you don't notice two power changes
so<00:01:45.820> pilot<00:01:46.149> can<00:01:46.330> be<00:01:46.450> there<00:01:46.660> changing<00:01:47.289> different

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
so pilot can be there changing different

so pilot can be there changing different
power<00:01:47.800> settings<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.490> it's<00:01:48.640> very<00:01:48.819> comfortable
