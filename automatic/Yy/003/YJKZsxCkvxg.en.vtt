00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.500
 so nothing in toronto will dream 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.920
 the law is everything for the generous son 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.050
 here and today as you are seeing 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.630
 bringing a video after a good time 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.239
 and after a certain time and the staff 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.240
 has asked quite right it is to speak 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.640
 enough about the absence of videos in the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.310
 channel that had these last two 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.590
 weeks I think the last week is in 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.410
 true, I'm bringing this video but 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.140
 to justify even this then why not 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.510
 had video last week and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.040
 also run some errands at the end 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.770
 some warnings and answer some 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.619
 questions and good to the point not 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.900
 24 had the whole last week because 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.979
 I 've been having connection problems 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.750
 Internet 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.660
 For those who do not know I have this 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.420
 and by the last I think six to eight 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.910
 months she was perfect working is 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.210
 usually a lot of boxing that has tava 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.830
 pressed until then and last week 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.920
 I think maybe they've had 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.830
 problems in the region where I live 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.229
 or even maintenance step 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.119
 practically impossible to play pf 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.179
 also possible to play any game 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.090
 because the problem besides this download is 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.520
 upload was pinging problem 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.190
 mainly for example a 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.670
 server that I should stick with on 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.610
 maximum of pinging I was with 200 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.950
 150 pinging what would be normal for a 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.870
 American server that nobody and for 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.240
 server crime then the normal would be 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.720
 150 hundred eighty with such 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.270
 almost 300 pine of 270 ping and 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.910
 and there's no idea 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.580
 I could not even live the pre-flex 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.030
 odailton or whatever live from 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.959
 I played the championship and only went back to normal 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.060
 Let's say at 11 o'clock in the morning and 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.100
 it got bad again in the morning and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.280
 play something really difficult 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.810
 this last week and only then at 11 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.180
 am as I said after the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.459
 my college is also really 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.530
 I 've lost my mind about making video 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.330
 This week I know I should have 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.540
 I made could have done some video 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.910
 tutorial talking theory is watching something 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.180
 the kind I did not need to record 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.400
 video or doing something is practical, but I 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.020
 I believe this week in a week that 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.350
 Come on , I'll be bringing some content. 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.150
 It's really cool for you in relation to 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.250
 future and event etc. 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.350
 enters and it is precisely for this reason that 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.350
 I'm bringing this video here , come on. 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.560
 that like most of them to bmw the team goes 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.990
 to be present is na bissoli in sÃ£o paulo 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.170
 place where you will roll the championship 5 x 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.300
 5 of b4 I 'll be there by the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.430
 less so far, everything indicates that yes and 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.620
 It will be easy to meet me there because 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.230
 vote together with the nw staff using the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.350
 shirt and also if you remember 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.910
 I still do the md fan event I guess 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.460
 which is basically this I think already 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.800
 I gave all the messages and also 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.590
 talking about what's the staff have 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.680
 asked about the slabs and such is 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.900
 because I'm not playing at is the x10 and 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.360
 Do you have any reasons for this? 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.960
 but one of the main reasons is that 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.970
 enter www the faces of the uel were 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.230
 locked you to who does not know 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.850
 basically align of the teams where so 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.310
 usually in championship you have this 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.940
 once the playoffs start the 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.040
 semifinals and such is they lock up the team 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.350
 calm the face as I said then 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.510
 you can not change any players 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.790
 mention any players and is basically 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.640
 for this and also has the fact that I am 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.710
 a new member is not yet w and yet 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.660
 I have to train a lot I still have 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.460
 that I get along with them and 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.310
 coupled to the fact I was not in 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.680
 face and it does not make much sense is me 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.560
 train with them got startup and the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.430
 tactics now and there is no event 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.650
 I also saw some comments to 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.320
 unnecessary and often necessary and 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.060
 all beni dice players are high 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.300
 level I do not think I would have done 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.030
 some difference or something of the line type 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.580
 a match or a round as I think 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.710
 I heard someone say I even think 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.669
 I still need a lot of training because 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.770
 I see my gameplay cx 10 75 and at 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.830
 Sometimes I see mistakes 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.289
 should not commit and is self-critical 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.750
 so strong that I have I think 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.150
 only 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.760
 I went and will tell you if you 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.280
 sufficient and the third and final map 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.860
 will be played tomorrow so stay tuned 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.380
 connected here in the building flex that will roll 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.330
 to live and only that and if there is data 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.100
 so you have enjoyed this video 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.250
 which I did a little different from normal 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.370
 there with music and father I do not know that there and 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.570
 dry uncle leaves that likes favors that 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.180
 helps a lot 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.500
 I always thank this force and it is 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.500
 close and went
