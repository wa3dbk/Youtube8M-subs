00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
slide the big button on the side forward

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.110 
slide the big button on the side forward
and<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.960> starts<00:02:29.290> recording<00:02:29.620> if<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.640> camera<00:02:30.970> is

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
and it starts recording if the camera is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
off sliding the button forward also

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.070 
off sliding the button forward also
turns<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.550> camera<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.360> then<00:02:34.510> starts<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
recording so it's really simple this is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.600

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
completely flat on the bottom so it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.760 
completely flat on the bottom so it
doesn't<00:03:14.210> really<00:03:14.600> fit<00:03:14.840> on<00:03:14.990> any<00:03:15.110> motorcycle
