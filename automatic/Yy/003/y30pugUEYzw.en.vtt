this<00:04:09.980> foundation<00:04:10.549> is<00:04:10.700> great<00:04:11.030> for<00:04:11.510> combination

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
this foundation is great for combination

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.949 
this foundation is great for combination
skin<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.650> wouldn't<00:04:13.310> personally<00:04:14.000> recommend<00:04:14.810> it

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
skin I wouldn't personally recommend it

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.900 
skin I wouldn't personally recommend it
for<00:04:15.170> oily<00:04:15.890> skin<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.310> think<00:04:16.340> you're<00:04:16.669> gonna<00:04:16.760> have

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
for oily skin I think you're gonna have

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.940 
for oily skin I think you're gonna have
to<00:04:17.060> be<00:04:17.180> retouching<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.720> lot<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.410> has<00:04:18.650> light

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
to be retouching a lot it has light

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.920 
to be retouching a lot it has light
medium<00:04:19.280> coverage<00:04:19.820> like<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.359> said<00:04:20.660> I<00:04:20.870> don't

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
medium coverage like I said I don't

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.930 
medium coverage like I said I don't
think<00:04:21.139> you<00:04:21.410> can<00:04:21.590> get<00:04:21.829> it<00:04:22.010> all<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.460> way<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.669> full

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
think you can get it all the way to full

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.170 
think you can get it all the way to full
coverage<00:04:23.210> but<00:04:23.990> if<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.800> doesn't<00:04:25.280> matter<00:04:26.030> to

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
coverage but if that doesn't matter to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.210 
coverage but if that doesn't matter to
you<00:04:26.450> like<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.750> doesn't<00:04:26.870> matter<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.350> me<00:04:27.380> then<00:04:27.919> it

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
you like it doesn't matter to me then it

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.000 
you like it doesn't matter to me then it
is<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.400> great<00:04:28.789> foundation<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.860> finish<00:04:30.860> off

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
is a great foundation and to finish off

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.670 
is a great foundation and to finish off
I<00:04:31.250> feel<00:04:31.639> like<00:04:31.820> this<00:04:31.970> foundation<00:04:32.410> blurt<00:04:33.410> out
