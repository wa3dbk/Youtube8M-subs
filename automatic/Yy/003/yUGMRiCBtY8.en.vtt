 follow their prey until it is 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.810

 lonely only at the time of

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.780
 you can see many others 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.849
 researchers have tried to decipher 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.840
 background behavior of the bear codia 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.430
 for its calm and peaceful appearance 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.280
 they contrast with their aggressiveness as 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.440
 proof of this are the 25 deaths of 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.660
 human being registered by attack of 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.390
 this animal in the last decade between 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.120
 those of the environmental activist and 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.370
 naturalist timothy treadwell and his girlfriend 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.739
 who were devoured by the exemplar 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.410
 of this species in the national park of 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.430
 North America 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.370
 the bear could have a huge meaning 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.379
 although the looks is the big bear of 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.329
 great bear was an evil ally of Libya 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.560
 in his fight against human beings 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.660
 for the lakers 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.690
 king of the animals that walk and very 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.620
 dreaded by the name of the up is 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.430
 also the lord of the animals 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.160
 unfortunately with the arrival of 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.319
 first colonizers started the hunt 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.840
 indiscriminate of this animal to 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.269
 get your skin or by considering it a 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.640
 threat to livestock despite being 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.340
 a protected species the house of this 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.220
 subspecies is allowed but regulated 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.450
 to avoid an excess in its population 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.450
 because of its small distribution area 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.450
 Y

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.420
 reproduction of endangered species is 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.420
 something quite illogical jolie you know 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.550
