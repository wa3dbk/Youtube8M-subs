their<00:01:06.140> conservation<00:01:06.610> we<00:01:07.610> started<00:01:07.940> monarch

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
their conservation we started monarch

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.650 
their conservation we started monarch
watch<00:01:08.360> in<00:01:08.630> 1992<00:01:09.440> at<00:01:09.979> that<00:01:10.220> time<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:11.180> appeared

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
watch in 1992 at that time it appeared

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.990 
watch in 1992 at that time it appeared
that<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.960> number<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.380> months<00:01:12.619> would<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.940> we

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
that the number of months would and we

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.910 
that the number of months would and we
have<00:01:14.119> a<00:01:14.180> big<00:01:14.390> tagging<00:01:14.780> program<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.530> tagging

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
have a big tagging program the tagging

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.990 
have a big tagging program the tagging
program<00:01:16.070> involves<00:01:16.790> issuing<00:01:17.420> up<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:19.000> 200,000

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
program involves issuing up to 200,000

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.359 
program involves issuing up to 200,000
tags<00:01:20.330> maybe<00:01:21.320> even<00:01:21.440> three<00:01:21.800> hundred<00:01:22.009> thousand

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
tags maybe even three hundred thousand

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.760 
tags maybe even three hundred thousand
eggs<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.640> think<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:22.880> did<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.180> twice<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.840> year<00:01:24.649> or

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
eggs I think we did that twice a year or

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.889 
eggs I think we did that twice a year or
two<00:01:24.950> people<00:01:25.190> who<00:01:25.430> are<00:01:25.520> willing<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.850> tag<00:01:26.180> they

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
two people who are willing to tag they

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.590 
two people who are willing to tag they
we<00:01:27.740> issue<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.100> tags<00:01:28.430> they're<00:01:28.729> sent<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.360> tags

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
we issue the tags they're sent the tags

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.320 
we issue the tags they're sent the tags
and<00:01:29.899> we<00:01:30.020> show<00:01:30.649> them<00:01:30.740> how<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.700> give<00:01:32.180> them

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
and we show them how and give them

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330 
and we show them how and give them
directions<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.840> how<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:33.020> tag<00:01:33.259> catch<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.190> tag

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
directions of how to tag catch and tag

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.840 
directions of how to tag catch and tag
the<00:01:34.490> butterflies<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.590> record<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.680> data<00:01:36.850> so

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
the butterflies and record the data so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.120 
the butterflies and record the data so
every<00:01:38.180> butterfly<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.899> a<00:01:38.960> coat<00:01:39.590> that's<00:01:39.830> tagged

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
every butterfly is a coat that's tagged

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.550 
every butterfly is a coat that's tagged
as<00:01:40.369> a<00:01:40.399> specific<00:01:41.060> code<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:41.930> we<00:01:42.080> can<00:01:42.259> trace<00:01:42.530> that

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
as a specific code so we can trace that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.039 
as a specific code so we can trace that
back<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.369> tagger<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.000> once<00:01:44.659> we<00:01:44.810> cherish

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
back to the tagger and once we cherish

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.899 
back to the tagger and once we cherish
it<00:01:45.200> back<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.710> tagger<00:01:45.979> then<00:01:46.400> we<00:01:46.580> try<00:01:46.850> to

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
it back to the tagger then we try to

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.240 
it back to the tagger then we try to
find<00:01:47.180> out<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:48.200> tagging<00:01:48.680> information

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
find out the the tagging information

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.960 
find out the the tagging information
from<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.520> data<00:01:49.729> sheet<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:51.010> in<00:01:52.010> some<00:01:52.400> cases<00:01:52.640> we

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
from the data sheet and in some cases we

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.200 
from the data sheet and in some cases we
notify<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.479> person<00:01:53.930> who<00:01:54.049> has<00:01:54.229> reported<00:01:55.210> the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
notify the person who has reported the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.750 
notify the person who has reported the
tag<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.659> us<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.200> people<00:01:57.500> who<00:01:57.590> find<00:01:57.860> tags<00:01:58.159> are

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
tag to us the people who find tags are

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.340 
tag to us the people who find tags are
not<00:01:58.939> associated<00:01:59.360> with<00:01:59.570> our<00:01:59.720> program<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.200> it's

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
not associated with our program so it's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.960 
not associated with our program so it's
another<00:02:00.500> way<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.770> reach<00:02:01.040> out<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.490> people<00:02:01.640> and

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
another way to reach out to people and

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.420 
another way to reach out to people and
we<00:02:02.119> go<00:02:02.240> down<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.479> Mexico<00:02:02.600> once<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.260> year<00:02:03.439> to<00:02:04.250> buy

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
we go down to Mexico once a year to buy

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.130 
we go down to Mexico once a year to buy
tags<00:02:04.729> from<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.180> people<00:02:05.450> down<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.630> Mexico

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
tags from the people down to Mexico

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.899 
tags from the people down to Mexico
there's<00:02:06.530> only<00:02:06.770> about<00:02:06.979> one<00:02:07.310> tag<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:07.760> every

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
there's only about one tag for every

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.270 
there's only about one tag for every
20,000<00:02:08.509> butterflies<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.140> again<00:02:09.470> then<00:02:09.979> we<00:02:10.100> pay

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
20,000 butterflies so again then we pay

flowers<00:03:22.049> started<00:03:22.620> growing<00:03:23.159> we<00:03:23.459> went<00:03:23.969> ahead

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
flowers started growing we went ahead

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.140 
flowers started growing we went ahead
and<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:25.159> constructed<00:03:26.159> a<00:03:26.280> greenhouse<00:03:26.700> around

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
and just constructed a greenhouse around

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.869 
and just constructed a greenhouse around
it<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.829> what<00:03:28.829> we<00:03:28.919> did<00:03:29.040> was<00:03:29.250> we<00:03:29.340> went<00:03:29.519> out<00:03:29.669> into

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
it and what we did was we went out into

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.119 
it and what we did was we went out into
our<00:03:30.090> fields<00:03:30.419> with<00:03:30.569> a<00:03:30.599> bunch<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.079> nets<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.620> we

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
our fields with a bunch of nets and we

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.009 
our fields with a bunch of nets and we
caught<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:32.579> many<00:03:32.939> butterflies<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.629> we<00:03:33.750> could

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
caught as many butterflies as we could

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.679 
caught as many butterflies as we could
and<00:03:34.319> we<00:03:34.459> just<00:03:35.459> stuck<00:03:35.879> them<00:03:36.000> all<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.299> there<00:03:36.480> and

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
and we just stuck them all in there and

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.929 
and we just stuck them all in there and
then<00:03:36.810> they<00:03:37.530> were<00:03:37.590> produced<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.579> where<00:03:38.699> there

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
then they were produced to where there

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.229 
then they were produced to where there
are<00:03:39.030> eggs<00:03:39.209> on<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:40.040> plants<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.310> caterpillars

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
are eggs on the plants and caterpillars

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.789 
are eggs on the plants and caterpillars
on<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.480> plants<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.049> we<00:03:43.169> also<00:03:43.319> went<00:03:43.560> out<00:03:43.650> into

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
on the plants and we also went out into

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.929 
on the plants and we also went out into
the<00:03:43.889> fields<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.340> found<00:03:44.579> as<00:03:44.760> many

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
the fields and found as many

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.490 
the fields and found as many
caterpillars<00:03:45.449> as<00:03:45.599> we<00:03:45.689> could<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:46.230> stick<00:03:46.409> them

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
caterpillars as we could just stick them

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.429 
caterpillars as we could just stick them
on<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.709> plants<00:03:47.099> kids<00:03:47.939> who<00:03:48.150> come<00:03:48.299> out<00:03:48.449> I<00:03:48.780> try

butterflies are doing but you know

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.539 
butterflies are doing but you know
they're<00:04:00.629> migrating<00:04:01.019> down<00:04:01.259> to<00:04:01.439> Mexico<00:04:01.949> and<00:04:02.280> I

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
understand what all is happening out

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.110 
understand what all is happening out
here<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.229> the<00:04:07.650> magnitude<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.400> what<00:04:08.669> these

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
here and the magnitude of what these

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.899 
here and the magnitude of what these
butterflies<00:04:09.479> do<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.199> lot<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.680> fun<00:04:10.919> it<00:04:11.159> was<00:04:11.250> hard

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
butterflies do a lot of fun it was hard

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.509 
butterflies do a lot of fun it was hard
work<00:04:12.120> but<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.720> say<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.590> was<00:04:13.769> worth<00:04:13.919> it<00:04:14.129> on<00:04:14.370> our

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
work but I say it was worth it on our

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.490 
work but I say it was worth it on our
butterflies<00:04:14.939> are<00:04:15.329> really<00:04:15.840> interesting<00:04:16.289> and
