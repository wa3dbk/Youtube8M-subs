00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.150
 halo has flavio simonetti here I have to 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.249
 say I have the video already for 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.529
 Tenth time made so much 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.820
 if you have such a 3 45 minutes of videos 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.470
 See how long then sometimes 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.359
 So even that may need just that 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.529
 tenth call because I have the message 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.060
 I really want to get across well 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.339
 I have a small example today 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.629
 it nutrition around the theme again something 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.489
 but deepened yesterday about the 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.109
 Talking vegan and having many people 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.449
 complaining that was my intention 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.710
 to enter a little bit of special topic and 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.670
 Today I want the theme again 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.190
 cut and generally on this 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.410
 topic of extreme nutritional forms 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.429
 and willingly give an example 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.260
 over ten years ago, psychologists gave me that 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.780
 at our home he stayed there 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.390
 for 12 days and when I with my bg 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.489
 colleagues because the dinner prepared 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.499
 if someone is closer to not having to 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.479
 doing his own food while doing ok 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.939
 He had his troop loose 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.079
 On the plates I think you fit 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.320
 Do it now for you 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.420
 no it was really for him he had 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.270
 dried leaves he used to 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.799
 dinner ate around the weird 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.259
 choice then slept in the outside 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.649
 winter because it was his philosophy and 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.430
 had also in the forest of 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.000
 Overnight stay without electricity 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.579
 i mean that was his story just that 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.969
 the stupid thing was that he was totally crazy 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.409
 has looked unhealthy and what I have 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.630
 want to say that is when you are with 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.640
 of a nutritional form so busy 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.549
 that now low carb is that now 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.689
 Vegetarian is that if now the food 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:51.320
 is raw food and and and there are many 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.020
 I will heike many formulas when I am 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.750
 me intensively with this one topic 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.070
 employ so many benefits 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.230
 that I say that is the absolute 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.050
 truth because 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.430
 yes, if you are very deeply involved 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.080
 then things always come out like 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.360
 it has been found out even better 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.310
 and studies will confirm that completely 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.140
 strangely, there are others 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.150
 themes in the other extreme forms 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.260
 they study the whole thing over and over again 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.030
 to confirm 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.800
 and what a pity is that the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.840
 People often find theirs extreme 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.810
 nutritional form 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.850
 firstly, other people often put it on the bread 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.230
 So not everyone has to lubricate 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.050
 People keep saying that here 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.950
 what you are doing is completely wrong 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.290
 I already had that yesterday 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.120
 bit denied where i said yes it 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.040
 There is a level above the diet 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.950
 when it comes to the topic of health 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.350
 and second, if that's not enough and 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.660
 the people are not entirely on the topic 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.470
 to respond to that one there 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:56.120
 with videos that are shocking 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.800
 and then the people even more in the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.440
 but they should actually steer direction 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.030
 On the contrary, what do I do 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.740
 important is that you have a 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.090
 balanced nutrition has that one 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.010
 i say fat and carbohydrates 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.970
 protein in the course of the day with pure and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.580
 in the long term so if I want to lose weight 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.900
 I'm personally where you say okay 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.760
 I reduce carbohydrates 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.140
 but you can just as well say hey what 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.400
 reduced to me the fats and 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.430
 carbohydrates 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.020
 There are so many ways but long term 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.340
 I always say everything should be as possible 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.030
 be distributed somewhere 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.890
 not because it's because of it 's body 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.750
 maybe accepted 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.260
 carbohydrates blog can say good 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.400
 so that the body can live and has long 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.750
 also no lack because it is the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.280
 possibly from the protein gets the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.290
 but I still say energy for the brain 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.410
 that it is a balanced diet 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.010
 should where possible everything with pure 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.650
 takes and makes extremely short term 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.670
 and then he will look that one 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.900
 So I say goodbye if I am full 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.489
 now no dairy products tolerated 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.790
 then that will be perfectly clear then 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.830
 I also do not eat dairy here 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.780
 products for me generally not 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.420
 bad and above all good because of 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.180
 body 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.980
 simply he can absorb better 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.930
 the better to the body's own protein 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.550
 and that's a lot 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.079
 important component not only for people 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.299
 want to build muscle and not 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.940
 just for people the muscles the fed 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.610
 want to lose weight but overall if 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.100
 The body can transform well then well 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.380
 this is a very good one in general 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.880
 sign what I last many 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.120
 millennia ago as fried 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.230
 and why should not I swell myself? 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.450
 prefer where the body actually says 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.850
 I really want that much more 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.130
 than the other so if that nevertheless already 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.690
 the sign of that is why should i 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.520
 So what to leave out of the diet 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.090
 unless, of course, if I do not 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.889
 contracts 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.590
 So I hope with this topic 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.680
 to have sensitized her extremely 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.160
 Every short-term I say is ok 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.590
 his 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.460
 In the long run, I would do it all a bit 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.660
 see more balanced and especially if 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.040
 I have a very long time with a topic 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.900
 to deal with is perfectly clear that 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.950
 i then become fanatical i have myself 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.010
 very long with conspiracy theories 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.320
 busy and I believe that he is very 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.640
 but there is a lot behind it 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.520
 sometime crazy and still looks 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.550
 the only truth but you have to 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.930
 the whole somewhat sprawling scene has to 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.080
 also say who benefits, for example 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.300
 why does it become so? 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.500
 seen unilaterally and and and and and 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.630
 I would all not too far 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.850
 but deepen in any case 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.979
 sensitive to the subject of nutrition and 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.289
 I find extreme nutritional forms 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.630
 not the most optimal solution in the long term 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.190
 So make it good if the video please
