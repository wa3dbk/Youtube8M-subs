00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you're gonna do with butterflying is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.550 
you're gonna do with butterflying is
opening<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.640> making<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.719> guess<00:01:58.409> an

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
opening it out and making it I guess an

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.280 
opening it out and making it I guess an
even<00:01:59.009> thickness<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.850> way<00:01:59.939> through<00:02:00.290> like

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
even thickness all the way through like

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.709 
even thickness all the way through like
so<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.060> nice<00:02:03.240> piece<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
so so now you get a nice piece to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.870 
so so now you get a nice piece to
actually<00:02:03.990> work<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.200> stuff<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.189> roll<00:02:05.399> it's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
actually work with stuff and roll it's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.459 
actually work with stuff and roll it's
that<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.600> important<00:02:06.899> thing<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.079> crackling

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
that the important thing with crackling

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.139 
that the important thing with crackling
I<00:02:07.590> suppose<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.099> got<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> rind<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.670> top<00:02:08.940> you

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
I suppose is you got the rind on top you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.729 
I suppose is you got the rind on top you
got<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> layer<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.690> fat<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.349> you've<00:02:10.530> got

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
got the layer of fat and then you've got

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.830 
got the layer of fat and then you've got
your<00:02:11.220> meat<00:02:11.400> meat<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> guess<00:02:12.540> what<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.720> want

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
your meat meat so I guess what you want

be the slow cooking component of this

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.330 
be the slow cooking component of this
dish<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.350> then<00:02:19.590> you'll<00:02:19.709> have<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.890> yummy<00:02:20.160> meat

dough-like consistency you don't have to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.020 
dough-like consistency you don't have to
be<00:02:43.920> too<00:02:44.100> wet<00:02:44.280> obviously<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:44.670> gonna<00:02:44.790> fall<00:02:45.000> out

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
be too wet obviously it's gonna fall out

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.780 
be too wet obviously it's gonna fall out
to<00:02:45.420> dry<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:46.260> not<00:02:46.380> gonna<00:02:46.470> work<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:46.790> okay

do start you can start at the center or

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.530 
do start you can start at the center or
you<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.670> start<00:04:05.850> on<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.030> ends<00:04:06.239> whatever<00:04:06.480> you

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
you can start on the ends whatever you

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.750 
you can start on the ends whatever you
like<00:04:06.859> easiest<00:04:07.859> thing<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.160> little<00:04:08.370> surgeon's

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
like easiest thing is little surgeon's

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.890 
like easiest thing is little surgeon's
knot<00:04:08.880> which<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.180> go<00:04:09.269> three<00:04:09.450> or<00:04:09.540> four<00:04:09.690> times

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
knot which you go three or four times

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.349 
knot which you go three or four times
around<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.620> that'll<00:04:11.070> sort<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.280> help<00:04:11.459> keep<00:04:12.209> it

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
around and that'll sort of help keep it

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.610 
around and that'll sort of help keep it
in<00:04:12.420> place<00:04:14.120> cut<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.299> okay<00:04:15.959> this<00:04:16.289> is<00:04:16.470> like<00:04:16.560> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
in place cut that okay this is like a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.979 
in place cut that okay this is like a
rolling<00:04:17.039> tie<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.489> all<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:17.789> do<00:04:17.970> it's<00:04:18.690> about<00:04:18.930> a

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
rolling tie so all I do it's about a

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.650 
rolling tie so all I do it's about a
thumb<00:04:19.850> width<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:21.150> suppose<00:04:21.560> going<00:04:22.560> around

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
thumb width I suppose going around

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.720 
thumb width I suppose going around
up<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.290> here<00:04:25.800> bring<00:04:26.400> your<00:04:26.490> string<00:04:26.730> through

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
up to here bring your string through

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.920 
up to here bring your string through
nice<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.760> long<00:04:30.090> piece<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.360> string<00:04:30.690> probably

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
nice a long piece of string probably
