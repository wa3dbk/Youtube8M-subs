00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889

smarter<00:00:17.710> now<00:00:18.099> I<00:00:18.130> just<00:00:18.340> realize<00:00:18.939> it's<00:00:19.150> better

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
smarter now I just realize it's better

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.830 
smarter now I just realize it's better
to<00:00:19.599> just<00:00:19.630> sit<00:00:20.200> and<00:00:20.380> wait<00:00:20.650> it<00:00:20.830> out<00:00:21.570> rather<00:00:22.570> than

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
to just sit and wait it out rather than

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.159 
to just sit and wait it out rather than
getting<00:00:23.169> wet<00:00:23.439> in<00:00:23.650> this<00:00:23.740> sort<00:00:24.009> of<00:00:24.099> cold<00:00:24.310> weather
