00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.949
 inhabitants of the planet gamer as it 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.600
 find in today's day 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.730
 welcome a new example of dragon 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.680
 ball 0 verse and in the video of the day of 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.900
 today at the request of a subscriber I am going 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.380
 to show how the following is achieved 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.380
 technique 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.530
 is the big-bang kamehameha multiplied 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.410
 per 100 that is a technique and use of 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.390
 more powerful than you're going to get in 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.000
 this game of creating a bowl xenon bears 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.539
 but also in turn as a whole technique 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.120
 powerful is difficult to achieve and still 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.040
 harder to hit because it's difficult 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.290
 to refine the technique I'm going to 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.600
 show below and the technique 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.430
 shoot exactly the first place at 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.280
 that you helped so if the character 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.260
 surrounds you or moves around the day or 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.500
 moves little to the right even if 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.350
 you're not going to throw away the technique anymore 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.120
 you're going to throw it apart is not that long 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.670
 reach like other techniques that 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.129
 so you should get the scoring 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.860
 a little more closely and with a 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.440
 character that is therefore static 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.330
 practically because if not if it moves 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.590
 Well, you will not miss the technique 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.390
 but if you can, if you follow the technique and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.520
 what are you going to download 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.530
 enough blood plus blood even me 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.390
 I dare say that you drop more blood than 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.820
 having the final attack of goku 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.710
 with your zeta weapon low more blood 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.930
 or at least I realized that 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.690
 he went down with this technique more blood than with 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.260
 any other technique you may have 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.880
 now where you get is this 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.330
 technique is achieved in the mission 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.580
 secondary number 54 that is unlocked 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.650
 at the end of the saga of fences book lic 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.600
 if you do not know how the saga is unlocked 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.350
 of bardem and brolin in the description of 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.140
 video I leave the link to the video I made 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.110
 where he explained how the saga is unlocked 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.690
 from bardem and brolin ok now in this 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.280
 mission the number 54 is where you get 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.860
 the big-bang kamehameha that actually 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.050
 it's the only thing worth of this 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.050
 mission the procedure to get it 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.810
 it is not complicated how complicated it is to pass 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.640
 the mission because this one is of high level and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.160
 apart you have to beat all there 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.470
 to jim everyone absolutely everyone 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.360
 weakest 10 radios to the most 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.360
 powerful that is pro lee is the last one that 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.989
 you appear in the mission and you have to 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.700
 defeat everyone in less than 10 minutes 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.220
 if you finish the mission in less than 10 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.360
 minutes and you are very lucky you are going to 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.190
 release the event 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.530
 the secondary event of the mission or the 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.330
 eye mission hidden event the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.460
 finish in less than 10 minutes do not 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.950
 guarantees the fact that they are going to 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.050
 release the hidden event but if you have 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.060
 you're going to release it, this is for 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.710
 that those who finish it in less than 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.150
 10 minutes and do not release the event 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.890
 then you just have to return it to 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.350
 try until the event is released 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.910
 secondary since the event was released 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.550
 is that he will revive brol and go to 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.170
 Bellito revive this bug and will revive 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.209
 cotes 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.250
 and you have to defeat the three 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.440
 again and if the three defeats 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.050
 that I make the warning that they are is 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.230
 for less to more can not in fact from 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.849
 that you arrive with before broli before 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.760
 Broli, you're going to miss her like that 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.340
 that you take a huge armament of 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.200
 health capsules and take company if 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.970
 you do not have enough level to 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.120
 pass the mission is my recommendation 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.069
 because if it's a bit complicated if 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.680
 you manage to defeat them all three once 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.900
 they resurrected as lucky you 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.040
 they will attack big-bang kamehameha 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.140
 which, as I said before, is a technique 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.660
 very powerful if you manage to hit it so 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.390
 you should use it in online at 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.080
 side of someone who has a technique the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.239
 taste technique that paralyzes the a 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.980
 the adversaries would be good is a 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.540
 time for me would be one of the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.299
 perfect combinations have a 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.549
 partner to have a partner that had 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.340
 that technique that paralyzes them for a good 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.350
 time and as soon as it paralyzes you 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.480
 launch the big-bang kamehameha one in 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.680
 serious that almost the killing killing of a 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.569
 just hit I hope 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.519
