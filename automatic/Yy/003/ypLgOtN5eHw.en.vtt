00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it's my nail polish and I use this

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.990 
it's my nail polish and I use this
usually<00:00:39.629> when<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> take<00:00:40.559> my<00:00:40.590> acrylic<00:00:41.309> nails<00:00:41.610> off

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
usually when I take my acrylic nails off

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.500 
usually when I take my acrylic nails off
because<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.469> they<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:43.920> like

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
because you know that they actually like

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.119 
because you know that they actually like
file<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.809> nails<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
file your nails and like they take the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.010 
file your nails and like they take the
shine<00:00:47.340> off<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.789> everything<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.930> really

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
shine off and everything so it's really

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.760 
shine off and everything so it's really
not<00:00:49.500> cool<00:00:49.860> how<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.280> nails<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.700> end<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.770> I

not cool how your nails I end up so I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.580 
not cool how your nails I end up so I
use<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.079> guys<00:00:55.110> who<00:00:55.469> would

I<00:01:05.010> made<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:06.080> usually<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.320> people<00:01:07.650> buy<00:01:07.799> it

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I made this usually some people buy it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
I made this usually some people buy it
but<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.270> some<00:01:09.920> it's<00:01:10.920> easier<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
but really for some it's easier if you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.289 
but really for some it's easier if you
make<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.680> easier<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:14.640> cheaper<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.270> you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
make it easier and way cheaper if you

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:23.440 
make it easier and way cheaper if you
make<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.930> was<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.840> crystal<00:01:21.840> clear<00:01:22.350> um

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450

make it this was just a crystal clear um
nail<00:01:24.450> polish<00:01:25.189> just<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.400> could<00:01:26.640> give<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
into like little thin layers and you

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.680
