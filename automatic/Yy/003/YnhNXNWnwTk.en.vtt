jumping straight into it this time that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.180 
jumping straight into it this time that
we<00:00:39.900> have<00:00:40.050> got<00:00:40.230> five<00:00:40.500> designs<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.070> this

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
we have got five designs for this

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.280 
we have got five designs for this
episode<00:00:41.490> and<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.420> first<00:00:42.630> one<00:00:42.810> that<00:00:42.840> we've<00:00:43.110> got

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
episode and the first one that we've got

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.020 
episode and the first one that we've got
is<00:00:43.470> the<00:00:43.620> same<00:00:43.830> staircase<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.430> we've<00:00:44.610> used<00:00:44.850> in

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
is the same staircase that we've used in

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.600 
is the same staircase that we've used in
our<00:00:45.420> mansion<00:00:45.630> tutorial<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:47.070> same<00:00:47.340> as<00:00:47.490> our

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
our mansion tutorial so same as our

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
our mansion tutorial so same as our
mansion<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:48.150> I'd<00:00:48.360> recommend<00:00:48.750> using<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
mansion then I'd recommend using this

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
mansion then I'd recommend using this
one<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.590> sandstone<00:00:50.070> build<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.820> any<00:00:51.000> other

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
one for sandstone build or any other

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.690 
one for sandstone build or any other
larger<00:00:51.570> builds<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.080> matter<00:00:52.580> apart<00:00:53.580> from

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
larger builds for that matter apart from

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.190 
larger builds for that matter apart from
that<00:00:53.790> though<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.420> only<00:00:54.630> materials<00:00:54.990> that<00:00:55.110> we

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
that though the only materials that we

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.930 
that though the only materials that we
have<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.650> used<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.040> is<00:00:56.250> our<00:00:56.730> birch

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
have actually used for this is our birch

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.230 
have actually used for this is our birch
wood<00:00:57.120> stairs<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.660> also<00:00:58.140> our<00:00:58.410> ports<00:00:58.770> blocks

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.430 

we're<00:01:03.240> taking<00:01:03.390> us<00:01:03.630> on<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:04.020> second<00:01:04.350> one

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
we're taking us on to the second one

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.840 
we're taking us on to the second one
though<00:01:04.589> I'd<00:01:04.860> save<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.100> best<00:01:05.430> shoes<00:01:05.640> for

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
though I'd save you best shoes for

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.430 
though I'd save you best shoes for
modern<00:01:06.090> builds<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.020> could<00:01:07.170> also<00:01:07.290> use

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
modern builds but you could also use

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.530 
modern builds but you could also use
this<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.160> a<00:01:08.220> larger<00:01:08.430> scale<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.060> well<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
this one on a larger scale as well as a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780 
this one on a larger scale as well as a
smaller<00:01:09.870> one<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.430> see<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
smaller one but as you can see the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.820 
smaller one but as you can see the
staircase<00:01:12.210> does<00:01:12.420> only<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:12.840> gradually<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
staircase does only go up gradually so

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.080 
staircase does only go up gradually so
you<00:01:13.890> will<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.340> quite<00:01:14.550> smart<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.970> how

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
you will have to be quite smart and how

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.590 
you will have to be quite smart and how
you<00:01:15.150> actually<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> staircase<00:01:20.420> now<00:01:21.420> for

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
you actually do the staircase now for

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.060 
you actually do the staircase now for
the<00:01:21.660> third<00:01:21.690> one<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.200> same<00:01:22.410> as<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> first<00:01:22.800> one

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the third one that same as the first one

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.290 
the third one that same as the first one
that<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.460> only<00:01:23.580> used<00:01:23.760> two<00:01:23.970> materials

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
that we have only used two materials

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.990 
that we have only used two materials
this<00:01:24.660> pod<00:01:25.350> said<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.740> best<00:01:25.950> used<00:01:26.160> in<00:01:26.430> jungle<00:01:26.820> or

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
this pod said be best used in jungle or

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
this pod said be best used in jungle or
cave<00:01:27.210> environments<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.140> even<00:01:28.440> abandoned

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
cave environments or even abandoned

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.070 
cave environments or even abandoned
builds<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.300> do<00:01:30.420> actually<00:01:30.630> mean<00:01:30.930> by

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
builds so what I do actually mean by

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.180 
builds so what I do actually mean by
abandoned<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> current

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
abandoned is like the current

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.700 
abandoned is like the current
environment<00:01:32.760> that<00:01:33.060> staircases<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.650> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
environment that staircases in so in a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.030 
environment that staircases in so in a
more<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> an<00:01:35.100> overgrown<00:01:35.520> area

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.180 

you

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.670 

next<00:01:43.940> we've<00:01:44.180> got<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.390> simplest<00:01:44.750> design<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.380> I

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
next we've got the simplest design and I

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.260 
next we've got the simplest design and I
said<00:01:45.890> it'd<00:01:45.950> be<00:01:45.980> best<00:01:46.250> used<00:01:46.490> in<00:01:46.700> modern<00:01:47.030> bills

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
said it'd be best used in modern bills

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.810 
said it'd be best used in modern bills
so<00:01:48.140> as<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.320> can<00:01:48.530> see<00:01:48.710> on<00:01:48.920> every<00:01:49.160> half<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.640> block

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
so as you can see on every half a block

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.470 
so as you can see on every half a block
we've<00:01:50.150> just<00:01:50.180> added<00:01:50.480> a<00:01:50.720> slab<00:01:50.960> one<00:01:51.350> block<00:01:51.530> away

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
we've just added a slab one block away

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.670 
we've just added a slab one block away
although<00:01:53.480> we<00:01:53.660> haven't<00:01:53.840> used<00:01:54.200> one<00:01:54.290> material

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
although we haven't used one material

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.410 
although we haven't used one material
for<00:01:54.950> this<00:01:55.040> I<00:01:55.250> would<00:01:55.790> say<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.060> worked<00:01:56.270> really

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
for this I would say it worked really

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.540 
for this I would say it worked really
well<00:01:56.540> within<00:01:56.930> simplistic<00:01:57.410> fields<00:01:57.920> or<00:01:58.190> you

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
well within simplistic fields or you

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.160 
well within simplistic fields or you
could<00:01:58.700> even<00:01:58.820> use<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.120> in<00:01:59.300> survival<00:01:59.420> builds<00:02:00.080> as

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
could even use it in survival builds as

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:08.080 
could even use it in survival builds as
again<00:02:00.800> do<00:02:01.190> any<00:02:01.430> need<00:02:01.580> one<00:02:01.790> material

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.270 

lastly<00:02:08.989> though<00:02:09.170> we've<00:02:09.530> got<00:02:09.649> another<00:02:09.860> similar

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
lastly though we've got another similar

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.250 
lastly though we've got another similar
design<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.759> first<00:02:11.090> one<00:02:11.300> but<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:12.019> time

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
design to the first one but this time

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.530 
design to the first one but this time
that<00:02:12.440> we've<00:02:12.590> used<00:02:12.800> our<00:02:12.950> cobblestone<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.879> also

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
that we've used our cobblestone and also

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.380 
that we've used our cobblestone and also
our<00:02:14.810> stone<00:02:15.110> brick<00:02:15.349> stairs<00:02:15.879> so<00:02:16.879> for<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.120> one

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
our stone brick stairs so for this one

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.570 
our stone brick stairs so for this one
I'd<00:02:17.629> say<00:02:17.840> be<00:02:17.989> best<00:02:18.230> used<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.560> women<00:02:18.860> build<00:02:19.040> but

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
I'd say be best used in women build but

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.800 
I'd say be best used in women build but
preferably<00:02:20.120> medieval<00:02:20.840> style<00:02:21.080> built

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.870 

that<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.860> five<00:02:29.010> designs<00:02:29.400> i'm<00:02:29.610> showing<00:02:29.819> you
