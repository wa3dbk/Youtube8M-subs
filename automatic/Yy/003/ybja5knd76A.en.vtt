just<00:02:39.220> tucked<00:02:39.490> away<00:02:39.640> into<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.030> closet<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.800> if<00:02:41.860> I

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
just tucked away into the closet so if I

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.280 
just tucked away into the closet so if I
don't<00:02:42.100> want<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.490> see<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.850> can<00:02:42.880> not<00:02:43.240> see<00:02:44.200> it

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
don't want to see it I can not see it

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.830 
don't want to see it I can not see it
but<00:02:44.830> if<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.010> want<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.460> can<00:02:45.580> use<00:02:45.610> it

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
but if I want you that I can use it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.730 
but if I want you that I can use it
right<00:02:46.840> there<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:47.260> actually<00:02:47.680> accidentally

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
right there I actually accidentally

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.430 
right there I actually accidentally
disconnected<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.010> power<00:02:51.250> cord<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.180> my

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
disconnected the power cord in my

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.700 
disconnected the power cord in my
previous<00:02:53.440> take<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.900> another<00:02:55.900> thing<00:02:56.020> about<00:02:56.260> it

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
previous take so another thing about it

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.580 
previous take so another thing about it
is<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.330> everything<00:02:58.330> in<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> half<00:02:58.750> X<00:02:59.080> seems<00:02:59.350> to

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
is the everything in the half X seems to

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.560 
is the everything in the half X seems to
be<00:02:59.710> perfect<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:01.530> look<00:03:02.530> here<00:03:02.980> like<00:03:03.850> my<00:03:04.240> power

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
be perfect but look here like my power

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.690 
be perfect but look here like my power
core<00:03:05.050> just<00:03:05.260> disconnected<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.190> can't<00:03:06.520> do

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
core just disconnected I can't do

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.090 
core just disconnected I can't do
anything<00:03:06.850> it's<00:03:07.330> it's<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:08.110> there<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.740> can<00:03:08.920> even

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
anything it's it's in there you can even

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.960 
anything it's it's in there you can even
see<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.770> see<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.220> don't<00:03:12.610> know<00:03:12.790> if<00:03:12.910> you

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
see it and you see I don't know if you

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.690 
see it and you see I don't know if you
can<00:03:13.120> see<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.360> alright<00:03:13.960> whatever<00:03:14.520> what's<00:03:15.520> in

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
can see it alright whatever what's in

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.310 
can see it alright whatever what's in
there<00:03:15.850> it's<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.180> there<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.450> get<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.140> get

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
there it's in there and I get to get

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.590 
there it's in there and I get to get
reach<00:03:17.920> through<00:03:18.370> why<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:18.850> can<00:03:19.150> reach<00:03:19.300> through

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
reach through why I can reach through

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.900 
reach through why I can reach through
but<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.930> can't<00:03:20.740> really<00:03:20.800> connect<00:03:21.160> out<00:03:21.310> without

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
but I can't really connect out without

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.060 
but I can't really connect out without
removing<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.480> back<00:03:22.750> panel<00:03:22.990> and<00:03:23.320> it's<00:03:23.440> pretty

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
removing the back panel and it's pretty

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.060 
removing the back panel and it's pretty
crowded<00:03:24.310> back<00:03:24.640> there<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:25.440> try<00:03:26.440> my<00:03:26.590> best<00:03:26.620> to

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
crowded back there I try my best to

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.530 
crowded back there I try my best to
cable<00:03:27.430> manage<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.910> my<00:03:28.090> system<00:03:28.450> as

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
cable manage that my system as

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.570 
cable manage that my system as
efficiently<00:03:29.020> as<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.290> can<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:29.800> it's<00:03:29.980> very<00:03:30.250> very

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
efficiently as I can but it's very very

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.510 
efficiently as I can but it's very very
hard<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.970> know<00:03:31.270> but<00:03:31.390> Windows<00:03:32.380> 7<00:03:32.680> XP<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:33.340> yeah

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
hard I know but Windows 7 XP so yeah

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.220 
hard I know but Windows 7 XP so yeah
this<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:34.140> dual<00:03:35.140> boot<00:03:35.830> system<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.870> reason<00:03:38.140> is

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
this is a dual boot system the reason is

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.160 
this is a dual boot system the reason is
because<00:03:38.380> I<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.980> lot<00:03:39.550> of<00:03:39.700> games<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.300> like<00:03:40.510> run<00:03:41.020> an

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
because I a lot of games I like run an

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.430 
because I a lot of games I like run an
XP<00:03:41.530> only<00:03:41.800> so<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:43.030> my<00:03:43.240> old<00:03:43.480> storage<00:03:43.960> Drive<00:03:44.290> my

for that's intake tube so I've it's my
air<00:04:27.360> flow<00:04:27.690> would<00:04:27.870> be<00:04:28.020> kind<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:28.350> like<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:28.860> I'll

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
air flow would be kind of like this I'll

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.350 
air flow would be kind of like this I'll
be<00:04:29.220> all<00:04:29.310> like<00:04:29.430> Shh<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.960> then<00:04:31.350> like<00:04:31.890> it's<00:04:32.160> like
