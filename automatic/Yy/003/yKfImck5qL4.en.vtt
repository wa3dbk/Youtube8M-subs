00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.450
 I think the life of weapons 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.070
 leave it to puerto rico you can 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.130
 work with her in puerto rico- 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.310
 any decent person can acquire 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.140
 the firearms permit in your 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.380
 shooting target permission to practice 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.379
 the sport of shooting white 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.120
 quite reasonable usually the first 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.940
 You can get licenses in less 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.040
 for $ 300 and then buy the souls 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 that you need the test here in port 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.100
 rich is not the law of arms 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.590
 the problem here in puerto rico in the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.140
 attitude that certain people have towards 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.400
 everything that has to do with soul and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.610
 attitude that sometimes has some 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.980
 senators and representatives regarding 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.310
 the laws that they want to add to the law of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.050
 Existing weapons I explain 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.320
 here port every time you leave 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.870
 soul does not matter how you do it be a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.370
 a course for young people is a course for 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.440
 adults whenever we are working 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.690
 with soul much of the population thinks 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.320
 that's bad or illegal shots on the air 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.330
 death and destruction and this is not the case 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 firearms for people who are 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.500
 decent and we follow the law is a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.970
 tool a tool that if you are 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.700
 security guard for things to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.570
 generate income for your family is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.150
 a tool yes yes 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.520
 in head of family and comes thieves 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.200
 to jump in your house because you use it as 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.500
 defense tool is a 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.880
 tool on the part of the people 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.760
 who make the laws here in puerto rico 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.619
 many of them, in my opinion, think 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.470
 that with making stricter laws on 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.110
 the arms control the criminals that 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.750
 are the ones who do the killing and 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.750
 massacres you pay the case those laws 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.490
 and as you who follow the law does not penalize 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.490
 the offender 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.569
 The less we have and the more 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:17.170
 let's think that plc souls are the 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.110
 problem we're not going to go anywhere 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.100
 hands kill people 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:27.390
 the criminals with soul kill people and 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.569
 unfortunately on many occasions 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.240
 to stop a bad person who is 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.400
 killing people need a person 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.410
 good and decent that is also evil 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.410
 armed and defend the prisoners
