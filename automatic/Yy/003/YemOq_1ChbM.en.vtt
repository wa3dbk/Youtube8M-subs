00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.150
 from everyone I am already in this video I will want 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.019
 talk about how it looked like a bump 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.259
 advanced warfare 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.400
 I tell you immediately with enough method 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.490
 limited because you can not move i 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.199
 botta and booth where they are and us all 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.939
 maps are good anyway let's say then 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.890
 let's start the procedure in question immediately 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:32.350
 not the map the mode is momentum 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:35.539
 let's get a map for example terrace 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.579
 options then momentum I did so 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.639
 unlimited time limit match options 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.409
 infinite time catch points put you 

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:45.589
 how much do you want even a minute of 30 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.690
 second flag is equal to a flag 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.309
 equal extra time and show how 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.049
 into a no then copied of these things 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.699
 ok then general settings fears three 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.589
 games okay ok, oh well oh well 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.959
 must die siri say an opinion of the 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:04.339
 map always active then they joined 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:06.740
 suicidal penalty do not wait before 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.930
 demand only for health damages dinners 30 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:16.159
 percent friendly fire you number them 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.109
 screw limited my ok then we go of 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.210
 opa the penalty placement on killed 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.740
 killing partner put no because 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.200
 after the west the companions if not there 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.469
 wait long seconds so here eh 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.829
 no yes no no no okay just put it on 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.479
 health 30 200 and fire friend yes then oh well 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.950
 personal classes I recommend you put 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.749
 maximum 20 accessories and then of 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.909
 disable all kill series 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:43.159
 because even if the boxes are in ally 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.079
 they stay all the time on a momentum 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.600
 to capture continuous moment moment 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.579
 create a moment moment continue to 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.350
 catch it and then do it continuously 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.630
 points then oh well sad enough of course 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.929
 of the 6 hit and allies equal difficulty 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.619
 and now nothing will show me some maps 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.560
 where the trick 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.960
 where is the cool location then we are up 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.759
 land spartend see that the bots run 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.249
 at the moment also the moment in 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.869
 this case is the i boc will continue to 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.310
 know all the time and all the time 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.080
 you are and will continue to capture it 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.670
 among the natural will always be irap i 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.750
 advice for example from the map of far 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.430
 this spot so decent a stuff of 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.440
 generally however I will leave you one in the end 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.080
 trick I think not two because there is no time 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.580
 this here and earth if and enough is 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.090
 one of the best I'll show you 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.310
 other 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.489
 here instead we are on solar the enemies are 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.019
 now on time but of course it's all 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.400
 done and stuff like that don't do that 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.120
 which I just did because it sucks 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.130
 god what made ok guys here we are alone 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.739
 there are so many pub spots of so high 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.170
 from there he jumps from here he went or he went 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.200
 even if in a commercial like that 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.970
 ok boy finally there is green band finally 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.440
 in the sense that the last map I will make you 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.750
 see and stop is for example this 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.700
 christmas of the genre and therefore boys 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.019
 video appeal has been helpful to you 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.370
 other maps I do n't show them to me 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.470
 they are really so many at the limit 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.940
 go and see then sorry but we know 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.140
 do 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.970
 an hour of life just to show everyone 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.440
 I don't like the maps I hope this 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.540
 video was helpful if you didn't have to 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.340
 give yourself two pendants fast you don't have it 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.350
 you have take the bros and you don't have it 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.350
 resume I 'm doing the same things 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.260
 anyway from joy it's all I leave you to one 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.260
 great clip from Jupiter is all in the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:39.150
 let's take the team flag all by 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.150
 manual
