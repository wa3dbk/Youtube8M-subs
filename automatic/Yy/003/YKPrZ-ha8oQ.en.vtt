00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.669
 So we have some racing cars. 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.439
 moving around here and has a 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.839
 interesting question for you 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.790
 account that these 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.940
 cars are making this curve well 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.029
 here and that they are all doing this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.140
 curve at a constant speed of 100 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.140
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.529
 My interesting question for you 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.189
 Are these cars accelerating while doing 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.189
 this curve 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.510
 then there is acceleration 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.640
 and you can say well our see 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.370
 my speed was not constant 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.890
 is assessing and facts and looking at the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.440
 speedometer of this car here he does not 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.130
 it will move 100 kilometers 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.960
 per hour 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.059
 I do not have any variation of this 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.120
 speed over time so you can 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.370
 say that it has no acceleration but 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.710
 then you would be thinking well because the 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.320
 teacher is producing this video and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.600
 Why would this question be interesting? 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.400
 and his second suspicion would be true 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.630
 because these cars are actually 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.460
 speeding up 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.190
 despite presenting at a speed 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.229
 constant and if you want you can 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.180
 stop and think about it for a 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.430
 but I wanted to highlight this 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.030
 question for you because in an example 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.920
 like this 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.500
 the difference between acceleration and 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.690
 speed is of great importance to 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.240
 if it is treated only as a 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.820
 a scalar magnitude has only one 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.369
 module in the case 100 kilometers per hour 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.399
 and scalar acceleration also 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.770
 only module in this case would do 0 however 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.990
 if we represent the acceleration and 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.020
 speed as vector quantities 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.210
 both will have not only module but also 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.490
 direction and direction we will analyze here 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.960
 and it will be a bit clearer to 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.330
 difference between acceleration and 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.500
 speed is because these bodies do not 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.570
 are accelerating 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.830
 so if we look at this racetrack 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.330
 up here 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.640
 Good, I'll try my best to 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.229
 risk drawing this so you can 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.229
 show up with something like that 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.150
 This is a perspective of how I can 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.430
 draw this in red and white to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.040
 You have an idea so this is 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.519
 red and some white parts on the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.500
 medium 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.390
 obviously i'm not drawing so many 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.290
 zebras like those that exist on a track 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.970
 of racing 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.519
 Good, but I'm giving you an idea of ​​what 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.340
 I'm really drawing and there 's a 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.010
 A little grass is a little grass that is 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.380
 Good now, let's focus on that. 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.040
 orange car and in that red car well 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.010
 on here 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.070
 so that's the view from above and that's fine 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.079
 here is the track so well here and this 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.480
 we are saying that it presents a 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.549
 constant speed of 100 kilometers 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.860
 for an hour so if we think about the 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.560
 velocity module is 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.440
 constant is 100 kilometers per hour 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.870
 but what is with 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.070
 being with the direction of the speed remember 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.320
 that speed is a magnitude 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.480
 vector has a direction and 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.670
 felt up here when it is 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.310
 starting to enter the curve is 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.830
 moving in that direction and you have to 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.720
 represent the vectors as certain as 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.210
 This is what you are going to draw on that 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.370
 case is the arrow pointing in the direction of 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.070
 Speed ​​The Speed ​​Module I 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.830
 I would say therefore the speed is constant 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.040
 then compliance with this arrow is always 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.080
 constant but how we see your direction 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.090
 changes when she's halfway around 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.890
 She is no longer being in that 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.380
 direction is now going in one direction 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.840
 different when the bottom of the curve arrives 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.180
 it goes in a very different direction 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.950
 direction continues to change as the 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.870
 car makes the curve I will not put the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.220
 mathematics in this subject we will leave the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.520
 math for later 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.280
 but remember that the acceleration and 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.780
 speed versus time 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.370
 acceleration is equal to the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.370
 speed over time 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.450
 or over a variation of time 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.670
 although the speed module is 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.670
 constant here your direction is changing 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.060
 if there was no acceleration on this 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.640
 its mode and its direction would be constant 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.040
 the car would simply continue 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.470
 move in that direction then from some 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.780
 shape the direction of the car is changing 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.780
 to the inside again and again 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.610
 so this is a bit of a question 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.419
 complicated something for you to think 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.819
 respect 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.520
 Let's discuss math in a way. 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.349
 more detailed in the next videos but the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.020
 what is happening here is that 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.569
 cars are effectively accelerating and 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.759
 accelerating towards the interior and 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.860
 variation when I say interior 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.389
 they are being accelerated towards 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.759
 to the center of the curve 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.470
 remember that to the center of the curve 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:57.509
 and this is what allows your 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.509
 speeds of varin fact
