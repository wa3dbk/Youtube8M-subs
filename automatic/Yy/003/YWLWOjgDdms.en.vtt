00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.760 
that one ha memories now i'm going to
set<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> house<00:02:16.800> on<00:02:16.980> fire<00:02:18.440> not<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.590> best

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
set the house on fire not the best

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.670 
set the house on fire not the best
homeowner<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.870> we<00:02:21.870> got<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.290> fire<00:02:22.650> thing

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
homeowner and we got this fire thing

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.830 
homeowner and we got this fire thing
here<00:02:23.250> now<00:02:23.460> let<00:02:23.670> me<00:02:23.700> explain<00:02:24.240> what<00:02:24.450> happens

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
here now let me explain what happens

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.990 
here now let me explain what happens
basically<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.920> way<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.100> works<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.850> every

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
basically the way it works is every

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.470 
basically the way it works is every
single<00:02:27.770> one<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.800> these<00:02:29.070> signs<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:30.560> put<00:02:31.560> on

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
single one of these signs is put on

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.020 
single one of these signs is put on
another<00:02:33.480> sign<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.400> try<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.850> be

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
another sign so you just try to be

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.199 
another sign so you just try to be
logical<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.750> game<00:02:39.959> will<00:02:40.170> remove<00:02:40.470> any<00:02:40.680> signs

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
logical the game will remove any signs

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.960 
logical the game will remove any signs
based<00:02:42.209> on<00:02:42.390> many<00:02:42.690> signs<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.560> any<00:02:44.430> sign<00:02:44.610> basis

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
based on many signs and any sign basis

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.060 
based on many signs and any sign basis
of<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.209> also<00:02:45.810> be<00:02:45.900> destroyed<00:02:46.350> due<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
of that also be destroyed due to the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.330 
of that also be destroyed due to the
same<00:02:47.280> principle<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.930> if<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.380> destroy<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.040> seed

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
same principle so if I destroy the seed

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.250 
same principle so if I destroy the seed
sign<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:51.180> will<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.480> course<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.870> story<00:02:52.050> this

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
sign it will of course the story this

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.810 
sign it will of course the story this
one<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:52.920> attached<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.490> sign

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
one because it's attached to the sign

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.060 
one because it's attached to the sign
but<00:02:54.600> also<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:55.140> one<00:02:55.380> because<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.800> attached

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
but also this one because it's attached

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.130 
but also this one because it's attached
to<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.400> sign<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:58.160> they're<00:02:59.160> all<00:02:59.280> gone<00:02:59.550> now<00:03:00.140> we

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
to that sign and they're all gone now we

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.590 
to that sign and they're all gone now we
can<00:03:01.680> also<00:03:01.860> place<00:03:02.250> them<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.270> top<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.750> and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
can also place them on top like this and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.340 
can also place them on top like this and
we<00:03:06.600> can<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:06.780> keep<00:03:07.050> on<00:03:07.230> going<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:08.250> going

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
we can just keep on going and going

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.800 
we can just keep on going and going
destroy<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.620> destroy<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:11.610> destroy<00:03:12.540> this

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
destroy this destroy this destroy this

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.710 
destroy this destroy this destroy this
destroy<00:03:13.739> this<00:03:13.980> destroy<00:03:14.580> this<00:03:17.090> now<00:03:18.090> if<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.540> go

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
destroy this destroy this now if you go

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.810 
destroy this destroy this now if you go
up<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.230> hundred<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.220> have<00:03:20.400> done

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
up to like a hundred like I have done

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.500 
up to like a hundred like I have done
certain<00:03:21.360> times<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:22.110> will<00:03:23.070> definitely<00:03:23.580> cause

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
certain times it will definitely cause

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.160 
certain times it will definitely cause
major<00:03:24.930> lag<00:03:25.320> especially<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.010> servers<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:27.540> you

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
major lag especially on servers and you

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.680 
major lag especially on servers and you
can<00:03:28.350> also<00:03:28.530> make<00:03:29.070> an<00:03:29.310> all<00:03:29.670> hope<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.060> lost<00:03:30.090> button

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
can also make an all hope is lost button

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.840 
can also make an all hope is lost button
that<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.590> self-destruct<00:03:32.280> button<00:03:32.370> also

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
that is the self-destruct button also

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.090 
that is the self-destruct button also
you<00:03:33.120> just<00:03:33.390> flip<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> switch<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.380> lava<00:03:34.709> comes

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
you just flip the switch and lava comes

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.060 
you just flip the switch and lava comes
down<00:03:35.420> which<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.690> quite<00:03:37.080> fun<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.620> just<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.950> to

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
down which is quite fun you just have to

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.030 
down which is quite fun you just have to
run<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.549> house<00:03:38.790> fast<00:03:39.330> as<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.660> can

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
run out of the house fast as you can

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.750 
run out of the house fast as you can
there<00:03:41.040> we<00:03:41.130> go<00:03:41.280> fire<00:03:41.840> light<00:03:43.430> light<00:03:46.489> make<00:03:47.489> sure

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
there we go fire light light make sure

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.020 
there we go fire light light make sure
before<00:03:48.049> all<00:03:49.049> hope<00:03:49.380> is<00:03:49.530> lost<00:03:49.670> doesn't<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:50.820> go

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
before all hope is lost doesn't just go

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.630 
before all hope is lost doesn't just go
away<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:52.410> see<00:03:52.620> they<00:03:52.769> all<00:03:52.920> destroy<00:03:53.310> as<00:03:53.549> a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
away you see they all destroy as a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.310 
away you see they all destroy as a
result<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.209> one<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.780> was<00:03:54.900> destroyed

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
result of that one that was destroyed

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.430 
result of that one that was destroyed
and<00:03:55.560> put<00:03:55.680> out<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.830> fire<00:03:56.720> now<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.780> hard<00:03:58.380> part

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
and put out the fire now the hard part

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.670 
and put out the fire now the hard part
out<00:03:58.769> this<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.220> you're<00:03:59.400> gonna<00:03:59.549> have<00:03:59.760> to<00:04:00.500> go<00:04:01.500> like

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
out this is you're gonna have to go like

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.250 
out this is you're gonna have to go like
that<00:04:01.920> much<00:04:02.310> too<00:04:02.700> much<00:04:02.940> larger<00:04:03.600> degree<00:04:03.780> in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
that much too much larger degree in

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.900 
that much too much larger degree in
order<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:05.010> get<00:04:05.220> all<00:04:05.820> of<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:07.190> water<00:04:08.190> source

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
order to get all of the water source

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.290 
order to get all of the water source
blocks<00:04:09.269> away<00:04:09.830> but<00:04:10.830> all<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.310> signs<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:11.940> appear

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
blocks away but all the signs you appear

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.180 
blocks away but all the signs you appear
in<00:04:12.330> this<00:04:12.540> nice<00:04:12.870> circle<00:04:13.170> which<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.650> really<00:04:13.830> like

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
in this nice circle which I really like

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.099 
in this nice circle which I really like
you<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.640> see<00:04:14.819> what<00:04:15.000> represented<00:04:15.900> by<00:04:16.049> the

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
you can see what represented by the

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.210 
you can see what represented by the
grass

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
grass

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.949 
grass
we<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:17.640> gone<00:04:17.820> away<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.060> circle<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.780> water

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
we just gone away the circle the water

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.240 
we just gone away the circle the water
goes<00:04:19.290> that<00:04:20.160> always<00:04:20.340> happens<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:22.410> yeah<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:23.100> hope

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
remember is to make it exactly go to the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.200 
remember is to make it exactly go to the
edges<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.750> your<00:04:30.750> house<00:04:31.140> and<00:04:32.060> also<00:04:33.060> another

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
thing you would think just be easy with
