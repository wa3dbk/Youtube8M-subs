if<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.730> follow<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.150> bottom<00:01:36.660> lash<00:01:37.080> line<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
if you follow your bottom lash line and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.080 
if you follow your bottom lash line and
you<00:01:38.160> see<00:01:38.190> where<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.550> ends

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you see where that ends

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.700 
you see where that ends
imagine<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.570> line<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.230> carry<00:01:40.440> on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
imagine that line was going to carry on

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.560 
imagine that line was going to carry on
another<00:01:41.580> trick<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.210> again<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.510> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
another trick you can do again if you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.060 
another trick you can do again if you
have<00:01:42.690> really<00:01:43.050> understudy<00:01:43.470> hands<00:01:43.830> you<00:01:43.920> can

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
have really understudy hands you can

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950 
have really understudy hands you can
take<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> bit<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.490> concealer<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.660> can<00:01:45.810> draw

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
take a bit of concealer and you can draw

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.660 
take a bit of concealer and you can draw
a<00:01:45.990> line<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.380> your<00:01:46.500> concealer<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:47.400> kind<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
a line with your concealer it's kind of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.820 
a line with your concealer it's kind of
a<00:01:47.760> map<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.540> bed<00:01:48.750> nothing<00:01:49.080> afterwards<00:01:49.410> or

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
a map and then bed nothing afterwards or

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.010 
a map and then bed nothing afterwards or
if<00:01:50.400> you're<00:01:50.550> really<00:01:50.910> really<00:01:51.090> shaky<00:01:51.510> hand<00:01:51.810> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
if you're really really shaky hand you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.660 
if you're really really shaky hand you
can<00:01:52.170> use<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.320> little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.650> of<00:01:52.740> masking<00:01:53.130> tape<00:01:53.190> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
can use a little bit of masking tape and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.810 
can use a little bit of masking tape and
you<00:01:54.030> could<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:54.240> place<00:01:54.510> it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
you could just place it

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.880 
you could just place it
bit<00:01:54.970> here<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.450> then<00:01:55.810> draw<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> line<00:01:56.260> along<00:01:56.440> over

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
bit here and then draw a line along over

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.410 
bit here and then draw a line along over
me<00:01:57.159> with<00:01:57.310> afterwards<00:01:57.670> that's<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.120> really

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
me with afterwards that's a really

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.210 
me with afterwards that's a really
failsafe<00:01:58.840> trick<00:01:59.140> if<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.740> have<00:01:59.860> really

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
failsafe trick if you have really

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.910 
failsafe trick if you have really
unsteady<00:02:00.550> hand<00:02:00.820> so<00:02:01.570> it's<00:02:02.470> just<00:02:02.620> it<00:02:02.860> takes

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
unsteady hand so it's just it takes

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.320 
unsteady hand so it's just it takes
practice<00:02:03.400> but<00:02:03.430> I'm<00:02:03.610> just<00:02:03.670> going<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.910> map<00:02:04.120> out

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
practice but I'm just going to map out

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.880 
practice but I'm just going to map out
so<00:02:04.510> I've<00:02:04.570> got<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.900> end<00:02:05.050> of<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.260> slashes

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
so I've got to the end of you slashes

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.530 
so I've got to the end of you slashes
and<00:02:06.100> if<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:06.670> look<00:02:06.850> straight<00:02:07.000> ahead<00:02:07.120> in<00:02:07.479> a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
and if you look straight ahead in a

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.540 
and if you look straight ahead in a
mirror<00:02:07.750> that's<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> best<00:02:08.860> way<00:02:09.009> just<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.310> start

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
mirror that's the best way just to start

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.199

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
hand so close so again starting I always

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.660 
hand so close so again starting I always
find<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.620> easy<00:03:11.739> one<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.100> people<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.459> start

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
find it easy one of the people to start

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.280 
find it easy one of the people to start
on<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.880> inside<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.570> then<00:03:13.750> go<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.079> certain

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
on the inside and then go to a certain

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.740 
on the inside and then go to a certain
point<00:03:14.560> stop<00:03:15.130> map<00:03:15.730> out<00:03:15.940> your<00:03:15.970> flick<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.630> then

point stop map out your flick and then
carry<00:03:16.959> on<00:03:17.140> thinking<00:03:17.290> it's<00:03:17.560> like<00:03:17.590> dr.<00:03:17.950> dot<00:03:18.100> I'm

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
carry on thinking it's like dr. dot I'm

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.360 
carry on thinking it's like dr. dot I'm
joining<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.610> dots<00:03:18.790> up<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:20.070> lot<00:03:21.070> thicker

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
joining the dots up so a lot thicker

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.319 
joining the dots up so a lot thicker
match<00:03:22.180> up<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.600> other<00:03:22.720> eye<00:03:22.810> now<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:25.209> it

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
match up to the other eye now and it

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.870 
match up to the other eye now and it
just<00:03:25.480> really<00:03:25.720> guides<00:03:26.019> if<00:03:26.260> you've<00:03:26.410> got<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> good

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
just really guides if you've got a good

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.360 
just really guides if you've got a good
gel<00:03:27.880> liner<00:03:28.590> which<00:03:29.590> should<00:03:29.769> literally<00:03:30.070> just

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
gel liner which should literally just

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.610 
gel liner which should literally just
and<00:03:30.660> look<00:03:31.660> at<00:03:31.750> things<00:03:31.900> at<00:03:32.079> all<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.410> thin

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
and look at things at all with a thin

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.020 
and look at things at all with a thin
line<00:03:32.799> you<00:03:32.950> can<00:03:33.070> always<00:03:33.280> go<00:03:33.489> thicker<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:33.970> you

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
line you can always go thicker so you

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.250 
line you can always go thicker so you
can<00:03:34.150> even<00:03:34.299> just<00:03:34.450> follow<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.900> line<00:03:35.079> you've

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
can even just follow the line you've

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.699 
can even just follow the line you've
already<00:03:35.410> made<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.989> then<00:03:37.989> check<00:03:38.230> both<00:03:38.410> legs

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
already made and then check both legs

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:39.780 
already made and then check both legs
together<00:03:38.860> because<00:03:39.250> what<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.430> want<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.640> check

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
together because what you want to check

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.610 
together because what you want to check
is<00:03:39.970> when<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.180> look<00:03:40.329> straight<00:03:40.450> ahead<00:03:40.630> both

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
is when you look straight ahead both

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.660 
is when you look straight ahead both
your<00:03:41.799> points<00:03:42.130> are<00:03:42.220> going<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.549> same

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
your points are going in the same

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.280 
your points are going in the same
direction<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.209> if<00:03:43.360> one<00:03:43.540> starts<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.959> go<00:03:44.079> lower

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
direction so if one starts to go lower

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.020 
direction so if one starts to go lower
down<00:03:44.590> that's<00:03:45.220> where<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.459> take<00:03:45.610> your<00:03:45.640> bottom

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
down that's where you take your bottom

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.370 
down that's where you take your bottom
part<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.299> just<00:03:46.360> tidy<00:03:46.630> up<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:46.870> little<00:03:47.049> bit<00:03:47.200> and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
part and just tidy up a little bit and

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.750 
part and just tidy up a little bit and
so<00:03:47.890> we're<00:03:47.980> gonna<00:03:48.070> go<00:03:48.190> right<00:03:48.370> thinner<00:03:48.549> brush

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
so we're gonna go right thinner brush

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.640 
so we're gonna go right thinner brush
just<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.180> work<00:03:49.360> on<00:03:49.510> our<00:03:49.780> angle<00:03:50.049> now<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.530> can

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
just to work on our angle now so I can

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.380 
just to work on our angle now so I can
get<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.799> lot<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:50.980> precision<00:03:51.310> with<00:03:51.970> my<00:03:52.150> small

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
get a lot of precision with my small

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.920 
get a lot of precision with my small
brush<00:03:52.630> just<00:03:52.900> flicking<00:03:54.420> look<00:03:55.420> out<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.660> little

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
brush just flicking look out a little

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.530 
brush just flicking look out a little
bit<00:03:56.140> more<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.579> then<00:03:57.579> kneading<00:03:58.120> up<00:03:58.239> again

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
bit more and then kneading up again

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.009 
bit more and then kneading up again
along<00:03:58.870> where<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.380> joins<00:03:59.680> the<00:04:00.160> eyelid<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.180> then

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
along where it joins the eyelid and then

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.000 
along where it joins the eyelid and then
I'm<00:04:02.110> going<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.290> take<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.440> little<00:04:02.590> bit<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.859> this
