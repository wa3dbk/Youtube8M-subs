lights on the front telling you the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.210 
lights on the front telling you the
battery<00:02:22.150> supply<00:02:22.570> if<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.440> connected<00:02:23.799> via

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
battery supply if it is connected via

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.949 
battery supply if it is connected via
the<00:02:25.090> hotspot<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.320> can<00:02:26.829> then<00:02:26.950> connect<00:02:27.310> via

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
the hotspot and it can then connect via

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.740 
the hotspot and it can then connect via
the<00:02:28.959> internet<00:02:29.410> as<00:02:29.920> well<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.090> on<00:02:31.329> this<00:02:31.480> side<00:02:31.720> we

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
the internet as well so on this side we

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.930 
the internet as well so on this side we
do<00:02:32.049> have<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.470> expandable<00:02:33.310> storage<00:02:33.459> slot

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
do have that expandable storage slot

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.980 
do have that expandable storage slot
like<00:02:34.150> i<00:02:34.269> talked<00:02:34.480> about<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:35.079> does<00:02:35.260> have<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
like i talked about it does have a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.780 
like i talked about it does have a
baiser<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.620> there<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.070> don't<00:02:37.280> think<00:02:37.520> maybe

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
baiser in there that I don't think maybe

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.000 
baiser in there that I don't think maybe
I<00:02:37.910> can<00:02:38.120> get<00:02:38.210> out<00:02:38.270> like<00:02:38.570> there<00:02:39.020> we<00:02:39.140> go<00:02:39.260> as<00:02:39.950> a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
I can get out like there we go as a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.310 
I can get out like there we go as a
spacer<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.820> there<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.240> can<00:02:41.390> insert<00:02:41.720> an<00:02:41.930> SD

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
spacer in there so you can insert an SD

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.620 
spacer in there so you can insert an SD
card<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.710> it<00:02:42.860> goes<00:02:43.070> flush<00:02:43.610> with<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.120> system

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
card and it goes flush with the system

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.600 
card and it goes flush with the system
so<00:02:44.870> it's<00:02:45.110> not<00:02:45.470> sticking<00:02:45.830> out<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.460> be

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
so it's not sticking out and can be

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.330 
so it's not sticking out and can be
broken<00:02:46.940> off<00:02:47.240> now<00:02:47.480> we<00:02:47.540> can<00:02:47.780> slide<00:02:48.380> all<00:02:48.650> directly

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
broken off now we can slide all directly

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.540 
broken off now we can slide all directly
in<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.940> be<00:02:50.360> just<00:02:50.930> right<00:02:51.350> there<00:02:51.800> on<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.070> back

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
in and be just right there on the back

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.820 
in and be just right there on the back
you<00:02:52.700> do<00:02:52.820> have<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.360> micro<00:02:53.870> USB<00:02:54.440> port<00:02:54.770> for

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
you do have that micro USB port for

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.250 
you do have that micro USB port for
charging<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.910> device<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.810> other<00:02:56.930> than<00:02:57.110> that

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
charging the device the other than that

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.290 
charging the device the other than that
is<00:02:57.410> just<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.740> simple<00:02:58.370> little<00:02:58.640> device<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.240> you
