some research we sent him to a GI person

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.340 
some research we sent him to a GI person
who<00:00:27.740> diagnosed<00:00:28.220> him<00:00:28.369> with<00:00:28.400> celiac<00:00:28.880> disease

who diagnosed him with celiac disease

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.900 
who diagnosed him with celiac disease
with<00:00:30.350> your<00:00:30.500> immune<00:00:30.710> system<00:00:30.920> constantly<00:00:31.490> being

with your immune system constantly being
stimulated<00:00:32.360> over<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.200> over<00:00:33.290> again

stimulated over and over again
throughout<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.160> years<00:00:34.370> in<00:00:34.550> case<00:00:34.730> of<00:00:34.879> my

throughout the years in case of my

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.090 
throughout the years in case of my
father<00:00:35.239> was<00:00:36.170> that<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:36.500> bit<00:00:36.710> ultimately

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
father was that it bit ultimately

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.369 
father was that it bit ultimately
resulted<00:00:37.640> in<00:00:37.879> this<00:00:38.390> form<00:00:38.720> of<00:00:38.870> aggressive

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
resulted in this form of aggressive

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.640 
resulted in this form of aggressive
cancer<00:00:39.830> and<00:00:40.129> ultimately<00:00:41.260> he<00:00:42.260> did<00:00:42.440> pass<00:00:42.620> away

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
cancer and ultimately he did pass away

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.130 
cancer and ultimately he did pass away
from<00:00:43.190> that<00:00:43.340> about<00:00:43.640> just<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.690> little<00:00:44.900> over<00:00:45.080> a

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
from that about just a little over a

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.049 
from that about just a little over a
year<00:00:45.199> after<00:00:45.680> he<00:00:45.830> was<00:00:45.980> initially<00:00:46.250> diagnosed

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
year after he was initially diagnosed

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.310 
year after he was initially diagnosed
with<00:00:47.659> the<00:00:47.750> disease<00:00:48.159> we<00:00:49.159> actually<00:00:49.370> went<00:00:49.730> and

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
with the disease we actually went and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.660 
with the disease we actually went and
talked<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.409> some<00:00:51.470> physicians<00:00:51.739> there<00:00:52.400> and

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
talked to some physicians there and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.229 
talked to some physicians there and
decided<00:00:53.330> to<00:00:53.479> get<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:53.900> entire<00:00:54.800> family<00:00:55.460> tested

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
decided to get the entire family tested

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.270 
decided to get the entire family tested
because<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.720> this<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:57.650> strong<00:00:58.010> genetic

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
because of this the strong genetic

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.670 
because of this the strong genetic
component<00:00:58.550> with<00:00:59.269> celiac<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.320> was<00:01:00.409> decided

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
component with celiac and it was decided

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.670 
component with celiac and it was decided
that<00:01:00.949> not<00:01:01.460> only<00:01:01.670> would<00:01:02.449> I<00:01:02.510> get<00:01:02.809> tested<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.320> my

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
that not only would I get tested and my

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.460 
that not only would I get tested and my
sister<00:01:04.040> my<00:01:04.280> other<00:01:04.430> sibling<00:01:04.909> but<00:01:05.570> our<00:01:06.229> other

kids are our kids as well and when all

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.930 
kids are our kids as well and when all
was<00:01:09.290> said<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:09.530> done<00:01:09.680> after<00:01:10.159> all<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.430> testing

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
was said and done after all the testing

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
was said and done after all the testing
I<00:01:11.180> came<00:01:11.930> out<00:01:12.140> as<00:01:12.799> being<00:01:13.010> positive<00:01:13.640> my<00:01:14.540> sister

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
I came out as being positive my sister

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.750 
I came out as being positive my sister
was<00:01:15.080> negative<00:01:15.560> but<00:01:15.590> her<00:01:16.130> two<00:01:16.340> sons<00:01:16.580> were

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
was negative but her two sons were

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.030 
was negative but her two sons were
positive<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:17.600> one<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.320> my<00:01:18.409> daughters<00:01:18.830> was

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
positive and one of my daughters was

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.179 
positive and one of my daughters was
also<00:01:19.750> strongly<00:01:20.750> positive<00:01:21.079> and<00:01:21.619> another<00:01:21.860> who

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
also strongly positive and another who

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.370 
also strongly positive and another who
was<00:01:22.369> somewhat<00:01:23.090> borderline<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.020> what<00:01:24.200> was

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
was somewhat borderline so what was

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.120 
was somewhat borderline so what was
really<00:01:24.740> interesting<00:01:24.979> about<00:01:25.789> that<00:01:25.850> was<00:01:26.570> just

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
really interesting about that was just

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.830 
really interesting about that was just
2003<00:01:28.130> probably<00:01:28.820> about<00:01:29.000> eight<00:01:29.270> years<00:01:29.570> later

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
2003 probably about eight years later

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.749 
2003 probably about eight years later
nine<00:01:30.320> years<00:01:30.530> later<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:30.920> were<00:01:31.009> fairly<00:01:31.219> recently

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
nine years later so were fairly recently

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.020 
nine years later so were fairly recently
my<00:01:32.479> mother<00:01:32.689> was<00:01:32.869> diagnosed<00:01:33.109> as<00:01:33.710> well<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:34.729> had

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
my mother was diagnosed as well so I had

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.830 
my mother was diagnosed as well so I had
actually<00:01:35.509> both<00:01:35.899> parents<00:01:37.659> diagnosed<00:01:38.659> with

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
actually both parents diagnosed with

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.899 
actually both parents diagnosed with
celiac<00:01:39.200> getting<00:01:39.560> at<00:01:39.649> different<00:01:40.039> times<00:01:40.280> this

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
celiac getting at different times this

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.910 
celiac getting at different times this
obviously<00:01:41.240> had<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.450> major<00:01:41.659> impact<00:01:41.930> on<00:01:42.439> my<00:01:42.890> life

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
obviously had a major impact on my life

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.690 
obviously had a major impact on my life
I<00:01:43.340> lost<00:01:43.549> my<00:01:44.420> best<00:01:44.659> friend<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:45.829> it<00:01:46.009> but<00:01:46.429> I<00:01:46.460> also

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
consider with my father's passing then

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.840 
consider with my father's passing then

and who knows what may have been too
late<00:02:08.030> for<00:02:08.450> us<00:02:08.479> by<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:08.869> time<00:02:09.320> as<00:02:09.500> well

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.650 

we<00:02:14.560> we've<00:02:15.190> actually<00:02:15.430> had<00:02:15.730> issues<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.630> think

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
we we've actually had issues I think

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.740 
we we've actually had issues I think
where<00:02:16.960> our<00:02:17.050> difficulties<00:02:17.860> have<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.750> laid

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
where our difficulties have have laid

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.020 
where our difficulties have have laid
really<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.410> not<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.190> much<00:02:21.250> with<00:02:21.460> our<00:02:21.610> media

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
really is not so much with our media

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.650 
really is not so much with our media
family<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:23.070> my<00:02:24.070> sister<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.610> her<00:02:24.880> children<00:02:25.030> and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
family so my sister and her children and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.320 
family so my sister and her children and
myself<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.920> my<00:02:27.040> children<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.880> been<00:02:28.060> more<00:02:28.270> of

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
myself and my children it's been more of

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.420 
myself and my children it's been more of
the<00:02:28.480> extended<00:02:28.840> family<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.650> we've<00:02:30.010> had<00:02:30.100> very

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the extended family that we've had very

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.110 
the extended family that we've had very
difficult<00:02:31.390> time<00:02:31.660> getting<00:02:32.880> tested<00:02:33.880> or

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
difficult time getting tested or

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.960 
difficult time getting tested or
convincing<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.050> get<00:02:35.170> tested<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:36.070> think<00:02:36.880> a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
convincing to get tested and I think a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.860 
convincing to get tested and I think a
lot<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:38.550> confusion<00:02:39.550> on<00:02:39.850> what<00:02:40.420> celiac

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
lot of it is confusion on what celiac

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.460 
lot of it is confusion on what celiac
disease<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.880> fact<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.260> fact

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
disease really is the fact that the fact

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.930 
disease really is the fact that the fact
that<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.770> couldn't<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.310> couldn't<00:02:45.610> happen<00:02:45.760> to

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
that it couldn't it couldn't happen to

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.309 
that it couldn't it couldn't happen to
me

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.600 

I<00:02:50.409> think<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.010> couple<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.819> mass

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
I think a couple of mass

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.190 
I think a couple of mass
one<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:54.610> really<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:55.940> ends<00:02:56.630> justify<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
one is really that the ends justify the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.710 
one is really that the ends justify the
means<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:58.010> get<00:02:58.160> tested<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:59.180> find<00:02:59.510> out

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
means to get tested to find out

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.330 
means to get tested to find out
definitively<00:03:00.110> whether<00:03:00.800> you<00:03:00.980> have<00:03:01.160> the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
definitively whether you have the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.240 
definitively whether you have the
disease<00:03:01.640> or<00:03:01.880> not<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.270> easy<00:03:03.250> very

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
disease or not is easy very

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.240 
disease or not is easy very
straightforward<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.270> think<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:06.100> people<00:03:07.100> who

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
straightforward I think that people who

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.170 
straightforward I think that people who
who<00:03:08.410> just<00:03:09.410> ignore<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.100> situation<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.850> pretend

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
who just ignore the situation to pretend

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.700 
who just ignore the situation to pretend
it<00:03:11.300> doesn't<00:03:11.480> exist<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:12.490> playing<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.610> very<00:03:13.640> very

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
it doesn't exist is playing a very very

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.520 
it doesn't exist is playing a very very
dangerous<00:03:15.710> game<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:17.290> considering<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.350> ease

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
dangerous game so considering the ease

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.020 
dangerous game so considering the ease
of<00:03:18.560> diagnosis<00:03:20.020> in<00:03:21.020> essence<00:03:21.380> why<00:03:21.709> not<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.280> think

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
of diagnosis in essence why not I think

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.470 
of diagnosis in essence why not I think
the<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:24.080> other<00:03:24.110> thing<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.740> would<00:03:24.890> stress

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
the the other thing that I would stress

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.520 
the the other thing that I would stress
to<00:03:26.480> people<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:27.320> really<00:03:28.190> also<00:03:28.640> need<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:29.530> be

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
to people is you really also need to be

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.070 
to people is you really also need to be
well<00:03:30.800> versed<00:03:31.160> on<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.820> disease<00:03:32.150> itself<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:33.050> to

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
well versed on the disease itself and to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.960 
well versed on the disease itself and to
know<00:03:33.590> what<00:03:33.830> to<00:03:33.950> look<00:03:34.100> for<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.610> be<00:03:34.730> able<00:03:34.790> to

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
know what to look for and to be able to

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.650 
know what to look for and to be able to
communicate<00:03:35.390> with<00:03:35.600> your<00:03:35.870> with<00:03:36.170> your<00:03:36.200> doctor
