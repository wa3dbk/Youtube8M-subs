solves<00:00:11.460> I've<00:00:11.759> only<00:00:11.880> done<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.420> these

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
solves I've only done one of these

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.299 
solves I've only done one of these
videos<00:00:12.929> before<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.559> got<00:00:13.679> some<00:00:13.920> pretty<00:00:14.190> good

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
videos before and I got some pretty good

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.340 
videos before and I got some pretty good
responses<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> only<00:00:15.540> thing<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:15.900> people

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
responses but the only thing that people

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.040 
responses but the only thing that people
wanted<00:00:16.680> me<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.859> change<00:00:17.390> was<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
wanted me to change was that I do it a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.870 
wanted me to change was that I do it a
little<00:00:19.199> bit<00:00:19.350> faster<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> don't<00:00:20.130> over<00:00:20.460> explain

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
little bit faster I don't over explain

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.609 
little bit faster I don't over explain
things<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.510> if<00:00:21.660> I'm<00:00:21.840> teaching<00:00:21.990> somebody<00:00:22.500> who's

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
things as if I'm teaching somebody who's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.259 
things as if I'm teaching somebody who's
never<00:00:22.800> solved<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> cube<00:00:23.850> before<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.180> that

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
never solved the cube before and that

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.000 
never solved the cube before and that
makes<00:00:24.420> sense<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:24.750> most<00:00:25.140> people<00:00:25.439> are<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
makes sense because most people are you

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.009 
makes sense because most people are you
know<00:00:26.039> they<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> basic<00:00:26.970> grip<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.480> f2l

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
know they have a basic grip on f2l

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.109 
know they have a basic grip on f2l
already<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.460> everybody<00:00:29.730> knows<00:00:29.789> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
already so just so everybody knows this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.269 
already so just so everybody knows this
is<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> cam<00:00:30.660> kuber's<00:00:31.109> ng<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> cam<00:00:31.980> cube

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
is the cam kuber's ng with the cam cube

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.920 
is the cam kuber's ng with the cam cube
or<00:00:32.369> sticker<00:00:32.669> set<00:00:33.030> no<00:00:33.270> matter<00:00:33.420> how<00:00:33.570> many<00:00:33.690> times

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
or sticker set no matter how many times

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.389 
or sticker set no matter how many times
I<00:00:34.079> show<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.410> cube<00:00:34.710> people<00:00:35.010> still<00:00:35.250> leave

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
I show this cube people still leave

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
I show this cube people still leave
comments<00:00:35.790> wanting<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:36.239> which<00:00:36.809> makes

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
comments wanting to know which makes

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.150 
comments wanting to know which makes
sense<00:00:37.170> because<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.620> always<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> new

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
sense because I always have a new

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680 
sense because I always have a new
subscriber<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.820> anyways<00:00:39.210> let's<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.450> ahead<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
subscriber so anyways let's go ahead and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.459 
subscriber so anyways let's go ahead and
scramble<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:41.300> okay<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
scramble this up okay so here we have a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.670 
scramble this up okay so here we have a
pretty<00:00:44.460> decent<00:00:44.820> scramble<00:00:46.850> okay<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> think

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
pretty decent scramble okay so I think

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.139 
pretty decent scramble okay so I think
what<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> would<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.160> first<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.820> would<00:00:50.969> move

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
what I would do first is I would move

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.930 
what I would do first is I would move
this<00:00:51.480> orange<00:00:51.930> over<00:00:52.170> top<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> match<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.879> up

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this orange over top and match it up

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.970 
this orange over top and match it up
with<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> red<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.680> would<00:00:55.800> move

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
with the red here and then I would move

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.479 
with the red here and then I would move
the<00:00:56.160> green<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the green in just like this and now I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.819 
the green in just like this and now I
would<00:00:59.850> put<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> blue<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.660> by<00:01:01.140> turning<00:01:01.590> this

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
would put the blue in by turning this

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
would put the blue in by turning this
there<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.820> putting<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> blue<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> then

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
there and putting the blue in and then

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.010 
there and putting the blue in and then
moving<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> first<00:01:06.540> pair<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
moving it like this so the first pair I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
moving it like this so the first pair I
see<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.439> back<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.070> there's<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.790> in

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
see is back here there's this one in

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
see is back here there's this one in
this<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.450> would<00:01:09.630> align<00:01:09.990> those<00:01:10.229> two

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
this one so I would align those two

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.140 
this one so I would align those two
solar<00:01:10.890> together<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.939> pair

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
solar together and I see this pair

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.330 
solar together and I see this pair
already<00:01:12.299> okay<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.590> gonna<00:01:13.710> keep<00:01:13.890> track<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
already okay so I'm gonna keep track of

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.910 
already okay so I'm gonna keep track of
this<00:01:14.490> pair<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.240> putting<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.869> pair<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.350> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
this pair as I'm putting that pair in so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
this pair as I'm putting that pair in so
now<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.970> green<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
now it's here I know the green is on the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.740 
now it's here I know the green is on the
backside<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> line

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
backside here as you can see so I line

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.820 
backside here as you can see so I line
that<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> next<00:01:25.110> pair<00:01:25.380> right

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that up and I see the next pair right

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.640 
that up and I see the next pair right
here<00:01:26.280> okay<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.210> I'll<00:01:27.390> turn<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> cube<00:01:27.990> I'll

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
here okay so I'll turn the cube I'll

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.350 
here okay so I'll turn the cube I'll
move<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.070> away<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.490> I'll<00:01:29.670> align<00:01:29.909> those<00:01:30.150> I

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
move it away and I'll align those I

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.789 
move it away and I'll align those I
already<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> corner<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.619> I'm<00:01:31.710> gonna

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
already see the corner here so I'm gonna

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.560 
already see the corner here so I'm gonna
spot<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> edge<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:33.000> moving<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.390> around

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
spot the edge as I'm moving this around

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.060 
spot the edge as I'm moving this around
I<00:01:33.900> bet<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.640> did<00:01:36.439> okay<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.040> are

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
I bet and I did okay so here they are

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.149 
I bet and I did okay so here they are
here<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.360> align<00:01:39.600> those<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.229> put<00:01:41.070> them

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
here so we can align those and put them

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.340 
here so we can align those and put them
in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> slot<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.759> back<00:01:41.990> messes<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
in the slot in the back messes of one of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
in the slot in the back messes of one of
the<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.430> oil<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.820> cases<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the one of the oil out cases that you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.090 
the one of the oil out cases that you
would<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.680> look<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:46.979> that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
would see in the to look so that's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.480 
would see in the to look so that's
really<00:01:47.490> easy<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.320> now<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.740> an<00:01:49.920> R<00:01:50.220> perm

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
really easy and now we have an R perm

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.980 
really easy and now we have an R perm
and<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.970> an<00:01:51.119> arm<00:01:51.299> perm<00:01:51.540> because<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and you know an arm perm because if you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.990 
and you know an arm perm because if you
look<00:01:52.140> at<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.380> from<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.619> angle<00:01:52.680> you'll<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
look at it from this angle you'll see a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.780 
look at it from this angle you'll see a
two<00:01:54.390> by<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.540> block<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.200> headlights<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.219> now

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
two by one block and headlights here now

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.060 
two by one block and headlights here now
that's<00:01:57.149> also<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.509> keeper<00:01:58.049> mattie<00:01:58.409> permit<00:01:58.770> also

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that's also a keeper mattie permit also

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.530 
that's also a keeper mattie permit also
looks<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.520> from<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.820> angle<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.210> in

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
looks like that from this angle but in

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.810 
looks like that from this angle but in
an<00:02:00.840> our<00:02:01.020> perm<00:02:01.320> these<00:02:01.740> two<00:02:01.979> single<00:02:02.340> blocks<00:02:02.579> here

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
an our perm these two single blocks here

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.859 
an our perm these two single blocks here
the<00:02:02.939> red<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> blue<00:02:03.390> are<00:02:03.540> different

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the red and the blue are different

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.569 
the red and the blue are different
colors<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.829> know<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.159> was<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> t

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
colors and you would know if it was a t

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.660 
colors and you would know if it was a t
perm<00:02:05.850> by<00:02:06.450> seeing<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.110> same<00:02:07.439> colors<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.580> I'll

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
perm by seeing the same colors so I'll

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.510 
perm by seeing the same colors so I'll
go<00:02:08.789> ahead<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.060> perform<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:10.220> all<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:11.370> so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
go ahead and perform that all right so

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.110 
go ahead and perform that all right so
scram<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.270> number<00:02:12.510> two

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
scram it up and get number two

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.060 
scram it up and get number two
okay<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.750> number<00:02:16.140> two<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:19.230> think

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
okay so here is number two and I think

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.730 
okay so here is number two and I think
what<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> would<00:02:20.430> do<00:02:20.700> here<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.300> move<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.410> orange

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
what I would do here is move the orange

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.190 
what I would do here is move the orange
down<00:02:22.980> put<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.490> blue<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:24.240> would<00:02:24.660> move<00:02:24.960> this

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
down put the blue in I would move this

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.540 
down put the blue in I would move this
over<00:02:25.550> okay<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.940> would<00:02:27.420> move<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.690> up<00:02:28.430> put<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
over okay I would move that up put the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.580 
over okay I would move that up put the
green<00:02:29.760> down<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.240> then<00:02:30.360> put<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.840> red<00:02:30.990> down<00:02:31.260> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
green down and then put the red down and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.290 
green down and then put the red down and
now<00:02:31.740> that<00:02:31.920> they're<00:02:32.040> all<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.310> opposites<00:02:32.940> I'll

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
now that they're all on opposites I'll

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.380 
now that they're all on opposites I'll
just<00:02:33.810> do<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> 180<00:02:34.500> degree<00:02:34.950> turn<00:02:34.980> my<00:02:35.880> first<00:02:36.120> pair

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
just do a 180 degree turn my first pair

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.070 
just do a 180 degree turn my first pair
is<00:02:36.510> here<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.530> I'll<00:02:37.850> take<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.000> apart<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.840> see

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
is here so I'll take it apart and I see

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.420 
is here so I'll take it apart and I see
this<00:02:40.230> corner<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.720> I'll<00:02:43.410> put<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.710> in<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:44.340> like

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
this corner and I'll put it in just like

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.220 
this corner and I'll put it in just like
that<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.640> didn't<00:02:45.000> spot<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> edge<00:02:45.630> but<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.990> can

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
that I didn't spot the edge but I can

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.500 
that I didn't spot the edge but I can
see<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:46.560> down<00:02:46.770> here<00:02:47.010> now<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.730> I'll<00:02:47.910> align

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
see it's down here now so I'll align

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.280 
see it's down here now so I'll align
those<00:02:49.080> okay<00:02:49.950> now<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.790> see<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.150> corner<00:02:51.840> here<00:02:52.140> I'm

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
those okay now I see the corner here I'm

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.510 
those okay now I see the corner here I'm
looking<00:02:52.650> for<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.890> edge<00:02:52.980> which<00:02:53.190> I'm<00:02:53.340> guessing

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
looking for the edge which I'm guessing

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.350 
looking for the edge which I'm guessing
is<00:02:53.790> back<00:02:54.000> here<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:55.830> will<00:02:56.040> align<00:02:56.430> these<00:02:56.970> and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
is back here and I will align these and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.300 
is back here and I will align these and
it's<00:02:57.840> already<00:02:58.230> aligned<00:02:58.530> itself<00:02:58.830> as<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> can

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
it's already aligned itself as you can

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.000 
it's already aligned itself as you can
see<00:02:59.520> which<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.790> can<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.120> put<00:03:00.650> inside<00:03:01.650> there

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
see which I can just put inside there

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.650 
see which I can just put inside there
now<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.180> what<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> call<00:03:03.720> an<00:03:03.840> L<00:03:04.940> L<00:03:05.940> algorithm

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
now this is what I call an L L algorithm

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.840 
now this is what I call an L L algorithm
and<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.080> don't<00:03:07.140> know<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.770> just<00:03:08.010> do<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.670> look

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
and I don't know it so I just do to look

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.810 
and I don't know it so I just do to look
and<00:03:09.120> now<00:03:09.330> we've<00:03:09.540> ended<00:03:09.840> up<00:03:09.960> with<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:11.100> one<00:03:11.550> I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
and now we've ended up with this one I

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.400 
and now we've ended up with this one I
don't<00:03:12.120> know<00:03:12.390> what<00:03:12.510> that's<00:03:12.690> called<00:03:12.780> either<00:03:13.170> but

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
don't know what that's called either but

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.440 
don't know what that's called either but
I<00:03:13.440> just<00:03:13.470> know<00:03:13.710> how<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:13.860> do<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.220> now<00:03:14.820> this<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.150> G

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
I just know how to do it now this is a G

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.140 
I just know how to do it now this is a G
perm<00:03:15.690> now<00:03:16.260> one<00:03:16.440> thing<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.620> keep<00:03:16.740> into<00:03:17.520> mine<00:03:17.970> was

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
perm now one thing to keep into mine was

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.120 
perm now one thing to keep into mine was
a<00:03:18.180> Jeep<00:03:18.420> Ram<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.810> only<00:03:19.110> parts<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.890> cube

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
a Jeep Ram the only parts of the cube

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.250 
a Jeep Ram the only parts of the cube
that<00:03:20.250> are<00:03:20.400> solved<00:03:20.880> on<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.090> top<00:03:21.300> layer<00:03:21.570> is<00:03:21.780> the

this one this one this one or this one

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.020 
this one this one this one or this one
so<00:03:28.050> I<00:03:28.110> know<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:29.160> if<00:03:29.250> I'm<00:03:29.370> performing<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.850> G

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
so I know that if I'm performing the G

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.610 
so I know that if I'm performing the G
perm<00:03:30.240> with<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.540> headlights<00:03:30.840> on<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.080> Left<00:03:31.320> I

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
perm with the headlights on the Left I

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.240 
perm with the headlights on the Left I
have<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.490> after<00:03:32.970> I'm<00:03:33.060> done<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.600> algorithm<00:03:34.250> do

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
have to after I'm done the algorithm do

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.060 
have to after I'm done the algorithm do
au<00:03:35.850> prime<00:03:36.330> in<00:03:36.750> order<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.020> put<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.260> solved<00:03:37.650> so

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
au prime in order to put it solved so

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.610 
au prime in order to put it solved so
let's<00:03:38.190> go<00:03:38.310> ahead<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.580> do<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:39.350> now<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.410> have<00:03:40.530> to

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
let's go ahead and do that now I have to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.800 
let's go ahead and do that now I have to
do<00:03:40.740> au<00:03:40.830> prime<00:03:41.300> alright<00:03:42.300> let's<00:03:42.510> go<00:03:42.630> number

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
do au prime alright let's go number

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.590 
do au prime alright let's go number
three<00:03:44.600> okay<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:45.750> here<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.440> number<00:03:46.920> three<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.600> I

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
three okay so here is number three and I

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.010 
three okay so here is number three and I
can<00:03:48.630> see<00:03:49.020> that<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.880> blue<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.690> green<00:03:51.870> are

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
can see that the blue and the green are

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.449 
can see that the blue and the green are
already<00:03:52.320> opposite<00:03:52.709> each<00:03:52.830> other<00:03:52.920> this<00:03:53.190> red

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
already opposite each other this red

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.090 
already opposite each other this red
actually<00:03:53.850> belongs<00:03:54.239> in<00:03:55.170> between<00:03:55.739> them<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.070> I

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
actually belongs in between them so I

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.770 
actually belongs in between them so I
would<00:03:56.310> actually<00:03:56.610> move<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.090> here<00:03:57.360> first<00:03:57.570> but

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
would actually move that here first but

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.880 
would actually move that here first but
I<00:03:57.840> want<00:03:58.020> to<00:03:58.080> see<00:03:58.230> where<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.500> oranges<00:03:58.830> and

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
I want to see where the oranges and

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.440 
I want to see where the oranges and
here's<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.250> orange<00:03:59.489> so<00:03:59.970> we'll<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.270> keep

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
here's the orange so we'll just keep

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.600 
here's the orange so we'll just keep
track<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:00.930> as<00:04:01.110> we're<00:04:01.290> going<00:04:01.500> so<00:04:02.070> we<00:04:02.430> move

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
track of that as we're going so we move

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.100 
track of that as we're going so we move
this<00:04:02.820> one<00:04:03.000> down<00:04:03.030> this<00:04:03.660> one

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
this one down this one

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.040 
this one down this one
this<00:04:04.739> one<00:04:04.920> goes<00:04:05.100> here<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.780> would<00:04:06.780> move<00:04:06.989> that

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
this one goes here I would move that

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.229 
this one goes here I would move that
over<00:04:07.410> before<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:07.890> finish<00:04:08.280> this<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.760> now<00:04:08.880> I<00:04:08.910> can

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
over before I finish this so now I can

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.420 
over before I finish this so now I can
as<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.630> can<00:04:09.780> see<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:10.050> can<00:04:10.320> put<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.830> place<00:04:11.100> and

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
as you can see I can put it in place and

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.199 
as you can see I can put it in place and
it's<00:04:11.880> just<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.180> quick<00:04:12.360> move<00:04:12.630> here<00:04:13.250> now<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.520> see<00:04:15.150> in

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
it's just a quick move here now I see in

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.909 
it's just a quick move here now I see in
this<00:04:15.360> corner<00:04:15.720> here<00:04:15.959> or<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.290> edge<00:04:16.500> piece<00:04:16.770> this

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
this corner here or this edge piece this

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.099 
this corner here or this edge piece this
is<00:04:16.980> an<00:04:17.220> orange<00:04:17.520> and<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.700> blue<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.239> know<00:04:18.540> it's<00:04:18.930> this

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
is an orange and a blue I know it's this

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.840 
is an orange and a blue I know it's this
one<00:04:19.350> here<00:04:19.650> because<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:20.040> only<00:04:20.070> other<00:04:20.340> corner

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
one here because the only other corner

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.430 
one here because the only other corner
piece<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.120> has<00:04:21.239> orange<00:04:21.450> on<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.900> orange<00:04:22.350> in

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
piece that has orange on it is orange in

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.930 
piece that has orange on it is orange in
green<00:04:22.590> which<00:04:22.919> is<00:04:23.070> right<00:04:23.250> here<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.610> already

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
green which is right here so I already

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.279 
green which is right here so I already
know<00:04:24.030> that<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.180> can<00:04:24.270> match<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.660> up<00:04:24.810> without

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
know that I can match this up without

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:25.930 
know that I can match this up without
looking<00:04:25.500> at<00:04:25.740> it

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
looking at it

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.910 
looking at it
I can<00:04:26.120> see<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.420> this<00:04:26.660> here<00:04:27.050> has<00:04:27.470> now<00:04:27.680> matched

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
I can see that this here has now matched

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.190 
I can see that this here has now matched
itself<00:04:28.370> up<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:29.300> I'm<00:04:29.510> not<00:04:29.660> going<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.900> disturb

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
itself up to so I'm not going to disturb

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.840 
itself up to so I'm not going to disturb
that<00:04:30.410> while<00:04:30.590> I'm<00:04:30.710> putting<00:04:30.980> this<00:04:31.070> in<00:04:31.340> as<00:04:31.550> you

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
that while I'm putting this in as you

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.180 
that while I'm putting this in as you
can<00:04:32.000> see<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.960> now<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.080> can<00:04:33.590> see<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:33.920> I'm<00:04:34.100> gonna

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
can see so now I can see this I'm gonna

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.700 
can see so now I can see this I'm gonna
put<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.520> in<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:34.850> back<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.420> I<00:04:35.930> see<00:04:36.140> this<00:04:36.320> corner

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
put it in the back and I see this corner

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.980 
put it in the back and I see this corner
here<00:04:36.950> which<00:04:37.730> I'm<00:04:37.880> guessing<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.300> edges<00:04:38.630> over

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
here which I'm guessing the edges over

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.820 
here which I'm guessing the edges over
here<00:04:39.350> because<00:04:39.650> it's<00:04:39.680> definitely<00:04:40.340> not<00:04:40.490> here

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
here because it's definitely not here

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.550 
here because it's definitely not here
hopefully<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.980> guys<00:04:43.130> can<00:04:43.880> follow<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:45.050> so

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
hopefully you guys can follow that so

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.230 
hopefully you guys can follow that so
now<00:04:45.650> these<00:04:45.890> two<00:04:46.130> pieces<00:04:46.340> are<00:04:46.640> here<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.120> this

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
now these two pieces are here and this

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.820 
now these two pieces are here and this
one<00:04:47.450> needs<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.690> go<00:04:47.810> here<00:04:48.140> so<00:04:48.290> I'll<00:04:48.410> hide<00:04:48.620> that

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
one needs to go here so I'll hide that

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.920 
one needs to go here so I'll hide that
and<00:04:49.040> move<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.340> over<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.210> put<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.570> there

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
and move it over and put it there

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.270 
and move it over and put it there
okay<00:04:51.800> so<00:04:52.310> here's<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:52.910> edge<00:04:53.080> four<00:04:54.080> right<00:04:54.950> here

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
okay so here's the edge four right here

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.770 
okay so here's the edge four right here
so<00:04:55.490> as<00:04:55.610> I'm<00:04:55.790> going<00:04:56.030> like<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.390> I'll<00:04:56.600> try<00:04:56.720> to

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
so as I'm going like this I'll try to

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.180 
so as I'm going like this I'll try to
spot<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.170> corner<00:04:57.470> which<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.710> didn't<00:04:57.920> see<00:04:58.070> which

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
spot the corner which I didn't see which

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.820 
spot the corner which I didn't see which
means<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.610> has<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:59.060> be<00:04:59.090> down<00:04:59.420> here<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.680> I'll

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
means it has to be down here so I'll

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.700 
means it has to be down here so I'll
align<00:05:01.370> those<00:05:01.670> and<00:05:02.030> for<00:05:02.420> sure<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:03.260> is<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.650> I

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
align those and for sure it is and I

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.890 
align those and for sure it is and I
well<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.280> put<00:05:04.580> that<00:05:04.700> one<00:05:04.880> in<00:05:05.000> wrong<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:05.600> let's<00:05:05.750> go

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
well I put that one in wrong so let's go

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.930 
well I put that one in wrong so let's go
ahead<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.200> do<00:05:06.770> that<00:05:06.950> I'm<00:05:07.100> not<00:05:07.130> perfect<00:05:07.490> yet

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
ahead and do that I'm not perfect yet

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.810 
ahead and do that I'm not perfect yet
now<00:05:08.660> we<00:05:08.720> can<00:05:08.930> put<00:05:09.080> that<00:05:09.200> one<00:05:09.380> in<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:10.340> here<00:05:10.700> we

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
now we can put that one in so here we

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.060 
now we can put that one in so here we
have<00:05:11.290> algorithm<00:05:12.290> that<00:05:12.350> I<00:05:12.410> don't<00:05:12.680> know<00:05:12.830> it's

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
have algorithm that I don't know it's

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.160 
have algorithm that I don't know it's
probably<00:05:13.400> really<00:05:13.520> easy<00:05:13.730> but<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:14.750> I'll<00:05:14.870> just<00:05:15.020> do

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
probably really easy but so I'll just do

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.130 
probably really easy but so I'll just do
two<00:05:15.410> look<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:15.890> then<00:05:16.490> here<00:05:16.640> we<00:05:16.730> have<00:05:16.760> soon<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.840> do

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
two look and then here we have soon I do

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.600 
two look and then here we have soon I do
it<00:05:18.260> backwards<00:05:18.620> from<00:05:19.160> this<00:05:19.250> angle

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
it backwards from this angle

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.250 
it backwards from this angle
now<00:05:19.940> here's<00:05:20.150> an<00:05:20.300> a<00:05:20.450> perm<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:20.930> reason<00:05:21.200> I

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
now here's an a perm and the reason I

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.220 
now here's an a perm and the reason I
know<00:05:21.320> that<00:05:21.470> is<00:05:21.800> because<00:05:22.310> there's<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.790> 2x1<00:05:23.660> block

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
know that is because there's a 2x1 block

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.510 
know that is because there's a 2x1 block
here<00:05:24.500> you<00:05:24.620> can<00:05:24.770> see<00:05:24.920> this<00:05:25.040> whole<00:05:25.250> corner

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
here you can see this whole corner

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.850 
here you can see this whole corner
solved<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.210> then<00:05:26.300> two<00:05:26.480> singles<00:05:26.990> here<00:05:27.260> now

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
solved and then two singles here now

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.650 
solved and then two singles here now
there's<00:05:28.040> two<00:05:28.190> different<00:05:28.220> a<00:05:28.520> perms<00:05:28.820> but<00:05:29.180> how<00:05:29.600> do

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
there's two different a perms but how do

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.140 
there's two different a perms but how do
I<00:05:29.780> know<00:05:29.810> if<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.140> headlights<00:05:30.440> are<00:05:30.620> here<00:05:30.980> or

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
I know if the headlights are here or

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.670 
I know if the headlights are here or
here<00:05:32.150> well<00:05:32.750> there's<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:32.960> really<00:05:33.140> easy<00:05:33.230> way<00:05:33.530> to

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
here well there's a really easy way to

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.280 
here well there's a really easy way to
tell<00:05:33.980> you<00:05:34.880> can<00:05:35.030> see<00:05:35.210> that<00:05:35.330> this<00:05:35.419> is<00:05:35.600> orange<00:05:36.050> and

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
tell you can see that this is orange and

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.850 
tell you can see that this is orange and
blue<00:05:36.740> if<00:05:37.010> these<00:05:37.460> here<00:05:38.000> are<00:05:38.150> opposite<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:39.080> the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
blue if these here are opposite of the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.680 
blue if these here are opposite of the
orange<00:05:40.370> on<00:05:40.580> this<00:05:40.970> side<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:41.450> if<00:05:41.510> you're<00:05:41.630> looking

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
orange on this side so if you're looking

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.030 
orange on this side so if you're looking
at<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:41.990> cube<00:05:42.169> from<00:05:42.230> this<00:05:42.410> angle<00:05:42.590> and<00:05:42.800> you<00:05:42.890> can

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
at the cube from this angle and you can

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.620 
at the cube from this angle and you can
see<00:05:43.160> that<00:05:43.250> these<00:05:43.460> two<00:05:43.520> are<00:05:43.760> opposite<00:05:44.270> of<00:05:44.360> this

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
see that these two are opposite of this

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.750 
see that these two are opposite of this
I<00:05:44.870> know<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.350> headlights<00:05:45.710> are<00:05:45.919> here<00:05:46.340> if

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
I know the headlights are here if

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.820 
I know the headlights are here if
they're<00:05:47.000> opposite<00:05:47.510> of<00:05:47.690> the<00:05:47.840> blue<00:05:48.169> on<00:05:48.500> this

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
they're opposite of the blue on this

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.920 
they're opposite of the blue on this
side<00:05:49.100> I<00:05:49.340> know<00:05:49.400> they're<00:05:49.610> here<00:05:49.880> so<00:05:50.330> as<00:05:50.630> you<00:05:50.840> can

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
side I know they're here so as you can

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.860 
side I know they're here so as you can
see<00:05:50.990> they're<00:05:51.290> there<00:05:51.530> perform<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.310> algorithm

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
see they're there perform the algorithm

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.690 
see they're there perform the algorithm
and<00:05:53.870> there<00:05:54.470> you<00:05:54.530> go<00:05:54.650> okay<00:05:55.310> let's<00:05:55.520> do<00:05:55.669> another

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
and there you go okay let's do another

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.420 
and there you go okay let's do another
one<00:05:57.310> all<00:05:58.310> right<00:05:58.760> so<00:05:59.000> let's<00:05:59.150> take<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.390> look<00:05:59.690> here

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
one all right so let's take a look here

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.370 
one all right so let's take a look here
this<00:06:01.430> one<00:06:01.700> isn't<00:06:02.180> too<00:06:02.540> bad

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
this one isn't too bad

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.080 
this one isn't too bad
so<00:06:03.620> I<00:06:03.650> can<00:06:03.950> see<00:06:04.100> the<00:06:04.220> orange<00:06:04.460> can<00:06:04.669> swing<00:06:04.940> up<00:06:05.060> to

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
so I can see the orange can swing up to

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.210 
so I can see the orange can swing up to
the<00:06:05.210> orange<00:06:05.630> we'll<00:06:06.470> see<00:06:06.650> if<00:06:06.740> we<00:06:06.860> can<00:06:06.980> do<00:06:07.070> that

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
the orange we'll see if we can do that

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.990 
the orange we'll see if we can do that
while<00:06:07.460> I<00:06:07.490> place<00:06:07.820> the<00:06:08.030> green<00:06:08.210> and<00:06:09.610> all<00:06:10.610> right<00:06:10.820> so

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
while I place the green and all right so

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.280 
while I place the green and all right so
what<00:06:11.150> I'm<00:06:11.210> gonna<00:06:11.330> do<00:06:11.540> is<00:06:11.720> I'm<00:06:11.840> gonna<00:06:11.960> move<00:06:12.140> the

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna move the

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.920 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna move the
red<00:06:12.470> down<00:06:12.770> or<00:06:13.160> sorry<00:06:13.460> the<00:06:13.580> blue<00:06:13.820> just<00:06:14.630> down<00:06:14.780> to

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
red down or sorry the blue just down to

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.720 
red down or sorry the blue just down to
here<00:06:15.169> move<00:06:15.350> the<00:06:15.530> red<00:06:15.710> over<00:06:15.950> top<00:06:16.160> of<00:06:16.190> it<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:16.610> the

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
here move the red over top of it so the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.790 
here move the red over top of it so the
red<00:06:16.880> will<00:06:17.030> align<00:06:17.360> when<00:06:18.020> I<00:06:18.050> do<00:06:18.169> this<00:06:18.440> now<00:06:18.740> you

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
red will align when I do this now you

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.500 
red will align when I do this now you
can<00:06:19.010> see<00:06:19.160> when<00:06:19.280> I<00:06:19.310> align<00:06:19.580> the<00:06:19.760> red<00:06:19.880> it<00:06:20.180> brings

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
can see when I align the red it brings

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.990 
can see when I align the red it brings
the<00:06:20.720> green<00:06:20.930> up<00:06:21.110> which<00:06:21.800> I<00:06:21.950> can<00:06:22.160> put<00:06:22.550> over<00:06:22.790> top<00:06:22.820> of

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
the green up which I can put over top of

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.050 
the green up which I can put over top of
the<00:06:23.180> green<00:06:23.390> and<00:06:23.800> when<00:06:24.800> I<00:06:24.830> move<00:06:25.130> this<00:06:25.430> down<00:06:25.669> with

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
the green and when I move this down with

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.659 
the green and when I move this down with
this<00:06:26.210> finger<00:06:26.570> back<00:06:26.750> here<00:06:27.169> I'm<00:06:27.440> going<00:06:28.070> to<00:06:28.250> align

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
this finger back here I'm going to align

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.960 
this finger back here I'm going to align
that<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:29.480> then<00:06:29.720> finish<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.560> rotation<00:06:30.970> okay

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
that and then finish the rotation okay

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.310 
that and then finish the rotation okay
so<00:06:32.030> my<00:06:32.240> first<00:06:32.419> pair<00:06:32.720> is<00:06:32.810> here<00:06:33.020> it's<00:06:33.169> already

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
so my first pair is here it's already

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.409 
so my first pair is here it's already
matched<00:06:33.590> up<00:06:33.860> so<00:06:34.430> let's<00:06:34.550> go<00:06:34.700> ahead<00:06:34.760> and<00:06:35.060> match

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
matched up so let's go ahead and match

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.779 
matched up so let's go ahead and match
it<00:06:35.660> up<00:06:35.750> now<00:06:36.440> I<00:06:36.470> didn't<00:06:36.800> see<00:06:37.010> another<00:06:37.280> pair<00:06:37.550> here

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
it up now I didn't see another pair here

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:39.530 
it up now I didn't see another pair here
okay<00:06:38.180> I'm<00:06:38.300> guessing<00:06:38.539> that<00:06:38.810> it's<00:06:38.990> down<00:06:39.200> here

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
okay I'm guessing that it's down here

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.600 
okay I'm guessing that it's down here
and<00:06:39.750> right<00:06:40.170> here<00:06:40.440> so<00:06:40.470> I'll<00:06:40.920> match<00:06:41.130> it<00:06:41.310> up<00:06:41.400> and

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
and right here so I'll match it up and

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.420 
and right here so I'll match it up and
it<00:06:41.670> is<00:06:41.820> you<00:06:42.540> know<00:06:42.660> a<00:06:42.840> lot<00:06:43.320> of<00:06:43.350> the<00:06:43.440> time<00:06:43.680> I<00:06:43.920> find

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
it is you know a lot of the time I find

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.480 
it is you know a lot of the time I find
that<00:06:44.640> when<00:06:44.880> I<00:06:45.120> am<00:06:45.330> I<00:06:45.600> don't<00:06:46.050> find<00:06:46.410> a<00:06:46.560> pair<00:06:46.800> but<00:06:47.430> I

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
that when I am I don't find a pair but I

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.310 
that when I am I don't find a pair but I
see<00:06:47.790> one<00:06:47.970> and<00:06:48.000> i<00:06:48.210> guessing<00:06:48.780> another<00:06:49.020> one<00:06:49.170> I'll

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
see one and i guessing another one I'll

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.690 
see one and i guessing another one I'll
try<00:06:49.470> to<00:06:49.530> match<00:06:49.740> them<00:06:50.010> up<00:06:50.070> anyways<00:06:50.430> and<00:06:50.610> the

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
try to match them up anyways and the

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.300 
try to match them up anyways and the
majority<00:06:51.060> of<00:06:51.090> the<00:06:51.180> time<00:06:51.390> I'm<00:06:51.570> right<00:06:52.010> and<00:06:53.010> then

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
majority of the time I'm right and then

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.340 
majority of the time I'm right and then
I<00:06:53.580> can<00:06:53.790> continue<00:06:53.940> like<00:06:54.420> I<00:06:54.600> am<00:06:54.690> now<00:06:54.840> but<00:06:55.050> if<00:06:55.200> I'm

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
I can continue like I am now but if I'm

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.910 
I can continue like I am now but if I'm
wrong

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
wrong

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.740 
wrong
I've<00:06:56.250> probably<00:06:56.550> spotted<00:06:57.060> some<00:06:57.330> other<00:06:57.450> stuff

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
I've probably spotted some other stuff

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.010 
I've probably spotted some other stuff
too<00:06:57.930> so<00:06:58.140> I<00:06:58.170> see<00:06:58.560> this<00:06:58.740> blue<00:06:59.250> and<00:06:59.490> red<00:06:59.670> here<00:07:00.020> go

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
too so I see this blue and red here go

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.630 
too so I see this blue and red here go
like<00:07:01.050> this<00:07:01.170> and<00:07:01.650> there's<00:07:02.070> the<00:07:02.250> blue<00:07:02.400> and<00:07:02.550> red

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.380 
like this and there's the blue and red
there<00:07:02.940> so<00:07:03.180> we<00:07:03.300> can<00:07:04.640> set<00:07:05.640> them<00:07:05.760> up<00:07:05.940> so<00:07:06.120> I<00:07:06.150> can

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390 
there so we can set them up so I can

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.240 
there so we can set them up so I can
insert<00:07:06.630> them<00:07:06.810> in<00:07:06.900> the<00:07:06.990> back<00:07:07.200> and<00:07:08.090> now<00:07:09.090> I've<00:07:09.420> got

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 
insert them in the back and now I've got

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.250 
insert them in the back and now I've got
the<00:07:11.250> corner<00:07:11.880> here<00:07:12.150> and<00:07:12.270> the<00:07:12.570> edge<00:07:12.720> here<00:07:13.110> so

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.260 
the corner here and the edge here so

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.950 
the corner here and the edge here so
I'll<00:07:13.890> put<00:07:14.070> it<00:07:14.160> here<00:07:14.190> I'll<00:07:15.150> align<00:07:15.450> them<00:07:15.720> just

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
I'll put it here I'll align them just
