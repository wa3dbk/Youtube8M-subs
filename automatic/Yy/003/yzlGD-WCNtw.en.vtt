00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
Facebook and they look at my videos I

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.859 
Facebook and they look at my videos I
don't<00:01:36.280> train<00:01:36.820> like<00:01:36.969> that<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.630> don't<00:01:37.780> like

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
don't train like that like I don't like

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.020 
don't train like that like I don't like
to<00:01:37.960> Train<00:01:38.170> like<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:38.590> all<00:01:39.340> my<00:01:39.579> workouts<00:01:39.880> are

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
to Train like so all my workouts are

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.490 
to Train like so all my workouts are
usually<00:01:40.240> heavy<00:01:40.360> workouts<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.960> guess<00:01:41.320> that's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
usually heavy workouts so I guess that's

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.830 
usually heavy workouts so I guess that's
what<00:01:41.619> makes<00:01:41.649> me<00:01:41.979> put<00:01:42.939> on<00:01:42.969> so<00:01:43.240> much<00:01:43.299> muscle<00:01:43.600> and

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
what makes me put on so much muscle and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.870 
what makes me put on so much muscle and
also<00:01:43.930> keep<00:01:44.170> my<00:01:44.290> ways<00:01:44.439> small<00:01:44.680> have<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.759> ever

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
also keep my ways small have you ever

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.550
