 bottles I'll take two tablespoons of salt 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:16.069
 I put on the fire and put on the fire's 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.290
 let the water boil if I am 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:26.019
 add vinegar then I will certainly take 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.019
 still add a tablespoon of sugar here 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.129
 boiled water for i added 2 tablespoons 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:38.510
 spoons of vinegar and this pickle 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:40.910
 pour 5 already hot pickle pour in 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.310
 got the bottle 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.030
 it's all hot when I'll boil 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.230
 I cover the top with a sterile cap 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.269
 it is desirable of course that the bottle too 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.879
 was sterile ie attitude towards you 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.900
 it is still sterilize and cap 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:04.879
 they cost five minutes in five minutes I 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:12.950
 neatly merge this time he again 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:14.930
 pan leaked everything carefully put 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:21.109
 again on fire the brine boiled again 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:26.720
 boiled and I poured it a second time in 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:28.750
 bottle started woods and pilot activity 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.310
 water should be like this too well 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.489
 I cover with a lid and roll the key 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.819
 OK 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.340
 then flip it the way I did 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.849
 you yourself showed cover warm 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.440
 a towel or blanket is lukewarm and 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.150
 so you have 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.079
 canned tomatoes instead of vinegar 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.819
 I sometimes not even very often 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.849
 add citric acid that means 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.579
 first time and boiled the brine then 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.940
 second time the vinegar there do not tom salt sugar 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.269
 and nothing else and water and when i'm second 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.180
 time I will fill 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:11.689
 I take on the tip 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.230
 knife or on the tip of a spoon I take lemon 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.230
 acid 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:22.340
 I take citric acid here tables so 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.590
 don't take much because but she just 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:30.430
 do not and fall asleep like this 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:34.400
 sprinkled and the lid closed and rolled up 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.940
 I like the taste of lemon more 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.060
 acid 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.100
 some still use aspirin i 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.440
 Spirin did not try at home with my friend 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.990
 according to my 5 and take aspirin and 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.030
 I know it is good or bad but in my opinion 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.280
 better still or vinegar or lemon 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.020
 acid here try with ionic purity i 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.000
 I think, too, and you'll enjoy it 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.000

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.910

 two-liter me you are a pilot 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.759
 usually rarely anyone takes a two-liter 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.560
 bottles 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.060
 and the 3-liter bottle is three 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.949
 liter bottles 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.669
