actually<00:04:44.490> one<00:04:44.639> of<00:04:44.669> two<00:04:44.940> things<00:04:45.050> one<00:04:46.050> are

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
actually one of two things one are

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.020 
actually one of two things one are
planning<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.620> attack<00:04:47.009> our<00:04:47.190> boat<00:04:47.400> or<00:04:47.610> two<00:04:47.820> they

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030

think it might be attacking if they to
attack<00:04:53.190> they<00:04:53.880> only<00:04:54.030> attack<00:04:54.360> from<00:04:54.509> our<00:04:54.660> right

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870
