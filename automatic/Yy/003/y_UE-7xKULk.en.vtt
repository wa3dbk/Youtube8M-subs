 of how things you should do the most 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.190
 the things that you are most afraid to do are 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.410
 the things that you most need to do in your 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.830

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.680
 afraid you fear to do it 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.030
 but also think that if you did them 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 if you really will face those 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.480

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.330
 so big that they would have in your life 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 think of conversations in appointments with 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.360
 doctors not in facing certain 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.700
 Situations in talking with your partner

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.050
 finally start your business doing 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.989
 what he fears so much is that he gives you so much 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.850
 fear that you are so afraid of 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.910
 are going to be things that also 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 it has a very big impact on your life 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.890
 analyze what things you need to face

 what things are you afraid to face you 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.350
 It's scary to stand in front of them and see 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.300
 how much impact could they have on 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.730
 your life 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.960
 when it is that way then you 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.119
 you're going to realize that he has no 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.830
 meaning continue to be afraid is fine 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.990
 Fear Fear is not bad to feel 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.150
 fear does not make you a bad person what 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.850
 that is not worth it is that that fear drives you away 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.380
 and keep you quiet and braking and 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.180
 stuck in your life if you want to change if 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.560

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.580
 things especially the things that they give you 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.050
 fear the things that generate fear and 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.850
 when you do it they are going to start happening 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.320

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.990
 but also for confidence and courage 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.350

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.090

 it's going to be a big difference in your life 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.899
 start with just one thing you do not have to 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.789
 start from overnight to 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.550
 face absolutely all your fears 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.950

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.470

 fear and face it and nothing happens anymore
