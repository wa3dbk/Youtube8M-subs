00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.400 
were also able to catch up with for a
few<00:04:42.750> sound<00:04:43.290> bites<00:04:44.479> when<00:04:45.479> they<00:04:46.020> told<00:04:46.229> me<00:04:46.380> that

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
few sound bites when they told me that

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.130 
few sound bites when they told me that
basically<00:04:47.010> their<00:04:47.700> position<00:04:48.690> now<00:04:48.840> with<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
basically their position now with the

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.780 
basically their position now with the
car<00:04:49.380> in<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.800> segment<00:04:50.280> was<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:51.360> they<00:04:52.080> would

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
car in that segment was that they would

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.719 
car in that segment was that they would
have<00:04:53.790> more<00:04:54.000> power<00:04:54.919> more<00:04:55.919> handling<00:04:56.460> more

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
have more power more handling more

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.260 
have more power more handling more
braking<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:58.280> that<00:04:59.280> sort<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.610> thing<00:04:59.820> right<00:05:00.060> so

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
braking and that sort of thing right so

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.900 
braking and that sort of thing right so
I<00:05:00.300> figured<00:05:00.870> that<00:05:01.740> row<00:05:02.010> that<00:05:02.220> we<00:05:02.370> drove<00:05:02.550> today

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
I figured that row that we drove today

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.500 
I figured that row that we drove today
would<00:05:03.630> be<00:05:03.660> ideal<00:05:04.050> for<00:05:04.140> it<00:05:04.380> because<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.830> has

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
would be ideal for it because it has

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.420 
would be ideal for it because it has
winding<00:05:06.510> roads<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.110> then<00:05:07.560> we<00:05:07.800> had<00:05:07.950> also<00:05:08.220> a

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
winding roads and then we had also a

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.550 
winding roads and then we had also a
hill<00:05:08.700> climb<00:05:08.910> on<00:05:09.419> those<00:05:09.840> winding<00:05:10.169> roads<00:05:10.350> on<00:05:10.530> the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
hill climb on those winding roads on the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.290 
hill climb on those winding roads on the
way<00:05:10.740> back<00:05:10.950> right<00:05:11.370> so<00:05:12.150> it's<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.140> quick<00:05:13.800> way<00:05:14.040> to<00:05:14.340> be

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
way back right so it's a quick way to be

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.839 
way back right so it's a quick way to be
able<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.540> show<00:05:15.870> all<00:05:16.410> those<00:05:16.650> attributes<00:05:16.890> in<00:05:17.460> a
