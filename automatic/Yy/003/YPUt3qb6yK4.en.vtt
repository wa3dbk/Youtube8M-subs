00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
nicely laminated insert and there is how

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.369 
nicely laminated insert and there is how
to<00:03:15.780> play<00:03:16.439> so<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.069> use<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.109> push<00:03:19.349> down

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
to play so you use this so you push down

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.509 
to play so you use this so you push down
on<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.949> back<00:03:20.159> of<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:21.419> figure<00:03:21.659> and<00:03:22.139> then<00:03:23.010> that

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
on the back of the figure and then that

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.899 
on the back of the figure and then that
should<00:03:24.319> flip<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.500> up<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.280> there<00:03:26.400> are<00:03:26.519> two<00:03:26.729> ways

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
should flip it up and there are two ways

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.259 
should flip it up and there are two ways
to<00:03:26.939> do<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.449> if<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.199> have<00:03:28.229> it<00:03:28.530> with<00:03:28.799> the

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
to do this if you have it with the

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.539 
to do this if you have it with the
larger<00:03:30.269> portion<00:03:31.109> of<00:03:31.199> the<00:03:31.379> base<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:31.979> the<00:03:32.310> floor

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
larger portion of the base on the floor

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.699 
larger portion of the base on the floor
like<00:03:32.729> that<00:03:32.759> it<00:03:33.090> will<00:03:33.269> push<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.199> forward<00:03:34.680> like

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
like that it will push it forward like

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.640 
like that it will push it forward like
that<00:03:34.909> well<00:03:35.909> sit<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.239> can<00:03:36.269> also<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.930> flip<00:03:37.409> them

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
that well sit you can also a flip them

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.599 
that well sit you can also a flip them
around<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:39.180> says<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.049> instructions<00:03:40.609> so

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
around it says in the instructions so

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.110 
around it says in the instructions so
for<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:41.970> flip<00:03:42.329> Astro<00:03:42.930> around<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:44.430> try<00:03:44.759> to<00:03:44.819> get

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
for you flip Astro around and try to get

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.539 
for you flip Astro around and try to get
a<00:03:45.359> stroke<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.870> there<00:03:46.049> there<00:03:46.229> you<00:03:46.319> go<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.859> little

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
a stroke in there there you go a little

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.689 
a stroke in there there you go a little
temperamental<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:49.139> flip<00:03:49.590> them<00:03:49.799> so<00:03:50.189> there

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
temperamental you can flip them so there

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.580 
temperamental you can flip them so there
you<00:03:50.790> go<00:03:50.939> you<00:03:50.970> can<00:03:51.419> push<00:03:51.659> them<00:03:51.870> forward<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.470> you

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.710 
you go you can push them forward and you
can<00:03:52.769> flip<00:03:52.949> them<00:03:53.129> depending<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.209> which<00:03:54.479> way

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720
