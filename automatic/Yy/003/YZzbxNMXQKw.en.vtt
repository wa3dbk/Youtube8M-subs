00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
car and start leaking out of the hole

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.380 
car and start leaking out of the hole
here<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.000> Boop

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
here like Boop

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.630

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.429 
won't run like I can run it for a little
while<00:01:15.740> on<00:01:16.549> it<00:01:16.729> you<00:01:16.850> know<00:01:16.969> it'll<00:01:17.179> go<00:01:17.390> spin<00:01:18.259> the

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
while on it you know it'll go spin the

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.260 
while on it you know it'll go spin the
thing<00:01:18.679> up<00:01:18.829> there<00:01:19.039> it'll<00:01:19.340> cut<00:01:19.640> some<00:01:19.850> grass<00:01:20.030> or

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270

whatever for a little while and then cut

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.120 
whatever for a little while and then cut
off<00:01:24.409> just<00:01:25.340> it'll<00:01:25.700> run<00:01:25.880> for<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.979> couple<00:01:27.979> minutes

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
off just it'll run for a couple minutes

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.590 
off just it'll run for a couple minutes
and<00:01:28.459> then<00:01:28.579> cut<00:01:28.759> off<00:01:28.909> I<00:01:29.179> mean<00:01:29.390> I'll<00:01:29.539> be

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
and then cut off I mean I'll be

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.690 
and then cut off I mean I'll be
accelerating<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.469> or<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.890> know<00:01:31.009> whatever<00:01:31.310> it

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
accelerating it or you know whatever it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.479 
accelerating it or you know whatever it
is<00:01:31.880> cut<00:01:32.090> off<00:01:32.209> so<00:01:32.899> I<00:01:33.759> clean<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.880> carb<00:01:36.189> our<00:01:37.189> Vice

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:42.789 
is cut off so I clean the carb our Vice
two<00:01:37.670> fuel<00:01:37.880> lines<00:01:38.149> and<00:01:39.429> it'll<00:01:40.429> run<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:42.409> just

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
two fuel lines and it'll run and I just

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.859 
two fuel lines and it'll run and I just
I'm<00:01:42.979> adjusting<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.700> carb<00:01:43.969> now<00:01:44.209> to<00:01:44.270> try<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:44.719> get

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
I'm adjusting the carb now to try to get

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.389 
I'm adjusting the carb now to try to get
it<00:01:45.020> runs<00:01:45.259> I<00:01:45.380> don't<00:01:45.619> think<00:01:45.799> that's<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> problem

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
it runs I don't think that's the problem

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.260 
it runs I don't think that's the problem
necessarily<00:01:48.159> if<00:01:49.159> there's<00:01:49.369> gas<00:01:49.610> pouring<00:01:50.149> out

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
necessarily if there's gas pouring out

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.510 
necessarily if there's gas pouring out
