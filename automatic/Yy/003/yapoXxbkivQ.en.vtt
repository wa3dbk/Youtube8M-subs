00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 now we look at the heart of the computer 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.870
 as I think you are the power supply 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.660
 because it provides energy for everything 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.790
 the rest of the computer begin with 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.559
 he has one of the box 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.230
 the best 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.170
 manufacturer to take care of transportation 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.930
 and the convenience of buyers on it we see 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.800
 manufacturer of hype 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.980
 we also see the m550 is a prefix to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.899
 models and for this middle generation 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.809
 these 2 550 watt power supplies are increasingly on 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.290
 there is nothing written in the box 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.399
 wires how long are they and by the way 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.300
 power cord is 50 centimeters 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.010
 motherboard power 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.070
 which is enough to install even the most 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.070
 big full power package let's 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.030
 open it what we see in the first thing 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:10.560
 us rushes self-education in a bag 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:14.280
 power from outlet 220 that's how it is 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.909
 he looks like a big 14 centimeter 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.330
 fan 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.610
 everyone has a weighty fan 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.770
 saved a sprig which is indicated on 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.799
 I got my box 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.009
 purple from the wires very 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.350
 high-quality braid and 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.610
 twin wires they are divided into 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.799
 the end is like this and now we 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 that's the way that is comfortable enough 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:47.310
 and does not let them mess around 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.740
 the main thing when laying in the case as I have 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.110
 say 50 centimeters power wire 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.520
 now he's wrapped up there we can 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.740
 deploy a little later 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.960
 as well as we find in picking 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.119
 mounting bolts too 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.630
 not all of them are important and that 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:10.450
 the best this manufacturer gives us 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.550
 such are beautiful braces or even 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.370
 I don't know how to say a few 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.569
 to fix the wires they 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.550
 reusable that is output a bunch of some 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.680
 have taken 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.630
 and pulled their prototypes bitter 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.790
 carbines yes they just are still reusable 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.840
 little black who do not understand it with Velcro 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.280
 other side marigolds so well on 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.280
 this about captain exhaust yourself
