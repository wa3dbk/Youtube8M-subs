 the practice of operating 2 trawlers 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.970
 confirmed their high economic

 three-year quota can be bought but its price 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.740
 comparable to the price of a new vessel these 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.659

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.140
 need to beat off the money invested fleet and in 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.880
 these conditions are much cheaper to conduct 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.340
 endless repairs of old pot 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.590
 rather than acquire a new patal and 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.420

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.090
 It turned out that the newest modern

 95 percent ready trawler 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.520

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.970
 the options among which are the most 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.230
 attractive was the acquisition of the ship 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.300
 foreign built 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.550
 however, the main role in choosing played 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.780
 high economic efficiency 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.410

 Nizin district of the Arkhangelsk region 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.300
 the contract was completed for the completion of the vessel 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.370
 in June 2013 the vessel was withdrawn from 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.050
 boathouse and floated to complete 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.960
 to complete construction works and 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.820
 mooring trials in November Krauler 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.650
 went to sea and as soon as possible 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.680
 completed the program of the factory chassis 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.020
 The tests showed excellent ie we 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.310
 all specifications are completely fulfilled 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.640
 its characteristics are laid 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.520
 the project showed excellent maneuverability 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.890
 a speed of 12 7 knots is even a little bit 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.840
 higher specificity translational last name 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.620
 the trawler did not put no system 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.740
 freezers 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.300
 no fish system fish commercial in this 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.650
 once this is all set by our 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.420
 now it's all like 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.840
 conflicting all this is experiencing in our 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.209
 shipyards 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.980
 Why the most established di2 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.270
 modern navigation and fish 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.370
 search equipment 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.740
 the vessel is equipped with advanced trawls 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.940
 complex soon trawler 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.459
 go to norway for 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.350
 autonomous equipment 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:10.510
 fish processing factory we get 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.040
 good decent ship proud that we 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.910
 after all truly 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.910
 Pomors built their ship up on our 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.530
 pomeranian land we have proven that we can 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.070
 build not worse than in Russia for 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.770
 abroad 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.240
 to id2 finally I found the owner whether 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.090
 say that this pattern 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.530
 no more likely a fluke 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.610
 position of the trawling fleet in our country 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.530
 since the year 2000 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.300
 remained the same core fund 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.259
 the boats are former 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.990
 use of court 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.580
 by hook or by crook 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.289
 prolong service life at the same time 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.060
 domestic shipyards possess 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.009
 diverse creative potential 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.259
 they can build the most modern 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.419
 ships meeting world fishing 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.090
 standards at a competitive price not 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.729
 it is clear only for whom in the meantime on 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.259
 asterisk which year stands nameless 4 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.120
 ship hull of this project 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.949
 will he repeat the fate of his elder brother 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.720
 Kaido trawler and will finally get 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.090
 master or waiting for him sad 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.370
 the fate of the fifth corps which in the end 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.599
 cut into this difficult question so far 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.599
 no one can answer
