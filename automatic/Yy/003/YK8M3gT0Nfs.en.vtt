00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.899
 unboxing this time for real one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.899
 plus one in the 64 gigabyte variant 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.580
 greetings to all friends of 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.600
 androidworld.it finally the packaging 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.720
 of one plus one 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.360
 the version that is sold in europe 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.130
 so the one with is already known is not 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.470
 the one with those they what 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.200
 you can buy as soon as you can 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.790
 get your hands on an invitation the variant 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.440
 from 64 gigabytes 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.590
 plus therefore not the one you have 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.820
 seen in preview that is still that 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.960
 which we reviewed the first time 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.180
 that is the 16 gigabyte white one yes 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.769
 in fact they differentiate for the colors that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.440
 place plus black one available at 64gb e 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.370
 the white one from 16 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.870
 if I can not destroy myself by looking 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.750
 in vain to open this case 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.149
 do to push this housing 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.960
 arrives apart for the simple fact that 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.560
 this is the European plug despite here 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.090
 it would seem the American one 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:18.960
 this is the one plus Italian outlet 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.470
 one of 2,100 milliamps then in one 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.930
 separate box this instead the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.570
 very nice one plus one pack 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.490
 this you see is carved into this 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.500
 form is written open 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.720
 there is this little red thread that now 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.440
 I'll shoot live so I did n't open it 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.380
 in advance and the cardboard will be torn 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.580
 let's not make an exposed massacre 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.420
 the android here is this refinement 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.820
 reminds me personally a lot 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.260
 that of op 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.630
 the device comes from the same 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.460
 finally make something like you have 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.700
 learned and follow us in common among the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.560
 two companies there is this is the packaging 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.890
 here it is black sense 64 gigabytes 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.080
 so global vision cyanogenmod not 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.380
 we are putting is really the version 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:18.550
 precisely we are in the world 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:21.980
 here it is, we challenge it from the packaging 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.050
 here we are really beautiful I must say 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.450
 studied then sit in an icon but then 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.420
 opens in the opposite direction 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.090
 so here we have our one plus 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.760
 we put it to one side for a moment 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.110
 below we find a little tried from 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.540
 travel the flat cable with this 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.800
 accessory you see to tighten it e 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.190
 block it flat cable here it is usb 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.730
 micro usb and we say this nice 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.250
 keychain that if we take it dallas 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.890
 tuccino is the pin to remove the sim 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.290
 this is a really nice file not 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.519
 only for one plus one but it is truly a 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.440
 a little touch of class then a 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.680
 really keeping a situation a lot 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.900
 beautiful I must say very accurate is not a 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.900
 surprise and we had already seen it damaged 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.730
 international unboxing then this 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.560
 I'm about to bring the phone under the 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:22.030
 camcorder so i take the film off 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:26.110
 brought it down here, here it is this one 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.990
 one plus one 64 gigabytes 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.500
 we approach a little and with him 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.800
 I want to field if I can 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.140
 to catch it here is also the model 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.350
 from 16 gigabytes 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.620
 so this is the one from 16 and this is it 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.730
 the one at 64 then changes enough 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.940
 because let's see if I can show you 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:56.680
 the finish you see is rough it almost looks 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.910
 I don't really know how to explain it 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.410
 I would say a carpet but not 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.420
 it has nothing to do with it anyway 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.670
 rough is very particular to the touch 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.470
 it seems perhaps a little more fragile 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.440
 this is the first impression here is 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.030
 always the cart you see of the sim 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.100
 budget of the volume not that of the 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.280
 micro sd because not expandable 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.760
 power button second and third 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.739
 microphone audio jack micro usb port ei 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.739
 dual lpg speakers 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.040
 obviously we will try so 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.610
 deepened this one plus one 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.229
 in the coming days just honestly 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.870
 I'm pretty convinced that 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.390
 there won't be many differences with this one 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.400
 16 gigabytes because why us anyway 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.050
 we felt good we didn't have 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.880
 particular problems with this model 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.919
 from 16 I doubt they will be big 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.380
 differences but we will test it anyway for 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.870
 you will see an opinion on this 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.229
 for this unboxing of one plus one a 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.960
 64gb all a greeting must neither cisotti 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.530
 However 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.530
 just
