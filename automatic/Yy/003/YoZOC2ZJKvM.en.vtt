00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.929 

all<00:00:01.079> right<00:00:01.260> here<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.650> gonna<00:00:01.709> do<00:00:01.949> look<00:00:02.820> at

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
all right here we're gonna do look at

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.880 
all right here we're gonna do look at
two<00:00:03.120> last<00:00:03.330> examples<00:00:03.510> of<00:00:04.110> multiplying<00:00:04.620> whole

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
two last examples of multiplying whole

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.970 
two last examples of multiplying whole
numbers<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.580> I'll<00:00:05.700> probably<00:00:06.500> do<00:00:07.500> this<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.830> two

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
numbers and I'll probably do this in two

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.640 
numbers and I'll probably do this in two
separate<00:00:08.370> examples<00:00:08.960> so<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.080> part<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.380> year

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
separate examples so in part a year

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.110 
separate examples so in part a year
we've<00:00:10.860> got<00:00:11.040> six<00:00:11.370> thousand<00:00:11.820> three<00:00:11.880> hundred

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
we've got six thousand three hundred

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.870 
we've got six thousand three hundred
twenty-five<00:00:12.660> times<00:00:13.610> 124<00:00:15.260> so<00:00:16.260> six<00:00:16.680> three<00:00:17.250> to

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
twenty-five times 124 so six three to

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.480 
twenty-five times 124 so six three to
five<00:00:18.630> times<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.850> four<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.740> what<00:00:26.369> I'm

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
five times one to four and what I'm

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.980 
five times one to four and what I'm
gonna<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:28.670> it's<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> same<00:00:30.269> process<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
gonna do it's just the same process that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.400 
gonna do it's just the same process that
we've<00:00:31.109> seen<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.890> let<00:00:32.820> me<00:00:32.940> get<00:00:33.930> another<00:00:34.020> little

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
we've seen so let me get another little

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.729 
we've seen so let me get another little
piece<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.710> paper<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.350> I'm<00:00:37.350> gonna<00:00:37.500> pretend

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
piece of paper here so I'm gonna pretend

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.100 
piece of paper here so I'm gonna pretend
like<00:00:38.219> there's<00:00:38.610> only<00:00:41.180> again<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.390> single<00:00:42.750> digit

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
like there's only again a single digit

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.440 
like there's only again a single digit
at<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> time<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.399> I'm<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> cover<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
at a time so I'm going to cover up the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.330 
at a time so I'm going to cover up the
one<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> two<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.980> I'm<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.219> gonna

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
one in the two and I'm just gonna

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.630 
one in the two and I'm just gonna
multiply<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.649> let's<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:49.800> four<00:00:50.070> times<00:00:50.340> five<00:00:50.579> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
multiply so let's see four times five is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.600 
multiply so let's see four times five is
20<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.989> keep<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.649> zero<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.460> carry<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.030> two

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
20 we keep the zero and carry the two

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.240 
20 we keep the zero and carry the two
four<00:00:56.610> times<00:00:56.879> two<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.210> eight<00:00:57.390> plus<00:00:58.070> two<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
four times two is eight plus two is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.130 
four times two is eight plus two is
going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.520> ten<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.600> I'm<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> keep<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
going to be ten so I'm going to keep the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.179 
going to be ten so I'm going to keep the
zero<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> carry<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> one

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
zero and carry the one

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.090 
zero and carry the one
four<00:01:06.000> times<00:01:06.240> three<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.630> twelve<00:01:07.170> plus<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
four times three is twelve plus one is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.520 
four times three is twelve plus one is
going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.400> 13<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.540> gonna<00:01:09.689> keep<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.140> three

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
going to be 13 I'm gonna keep the three

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.550 
going to be 13 I'm gonna keep the three
and<00:01:10.740> carry<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:12.360> 4<00:01:12.720> times<00:01:13.020> 6<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and carry the one and then 4 times 6 is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.609 
and carry the one and then 4 times 6 is
24<00:01:13.970> plus<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.540> gonna<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:16.189> 25<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:18.350> now<00:01:19.350> done

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
24 plus one is gonna be 25 so now done

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.880 
24 plus one is gonna be 25 so now done
with<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.189> first<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:21.240> first<00:01:21.479> step<00:01:21.890> so

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
with kind of my first my first step so

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.039 
with kind of my first my first step so
now<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:23.369> gonna<00:01:23.580> move<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.119> next<00:01:24.330> digit<00:01:24.600> so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
now I'm gonna move to the next digit so

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.170 
now I'm gonna move to the next digit so
I'm<00:01:25.140> gonna<00:01:25.320> pretend<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.220> four<00:01:26.549> isn't

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
I'm gonna pretend like the four isn't

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.020 
I'm gonna pretend like the four isn't
there<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.650> I'm<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.159> gonna<00:01:29.430> pretend<00:01:29.880> like

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
there and I'm also gonna pretend like

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.890 
there and I'm also gonna pretend like
the<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:32.000> isn't<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.720> gonna

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the one isn't there and I'm just gonna

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.280 
the one isn't there and I'm just gonna
do<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> multiplication<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:36.030> since<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.930> am<00:01:37.049> I've

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
do the multiplication so since I am I've

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
do the multiplication so since I am I've
moved<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:38.009> digit<00:01:38.400> over<00:01:38.520> I'm<00:01:38.880> gonna<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.479> one

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
moved one digit over I'm gonna put one

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.530 
moved one digit over I'm gonna put one
zero<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.070> now<00:01:41.909> I'm<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.119> gonna<00:01:42.210> start

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
zero there and now I'm just gonna start

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.350 
zero there and now I'm just gonna start
doing<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> multiplication<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.649> again<00:01:43.920> let<00:01:44.130> me

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
doing the multiplication so again let me

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.899 
doing the multiplication so again let me
let<00:01:45.360> me<00:01:45.390> cover<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:46.049> these<00:01:46.439> numbers<00:01:46.710> because<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
let me cover up these numbers because I

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.399 
let me cover up these numbers because I
don't<00:01:50.909> want<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> accidentally<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:52.200> them

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
don't want to accidentally use them

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.180 
don't want to accidentally use them
again

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.980 

all<00:01:56.190> right<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.580> I<00:01:56.610> think<00:01:56.940> we're<00:01:57.120> I<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.690> I'm

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
all right so I think we're I think I'm

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.510 
all right so I think we're I think I'm
ready<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.530> let's<00:01:58.800> do<00:01:58.950> our<00:01:58.980> multiplication

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.210 

so<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.640> says<00:02:02.880> two<00:02:03.300> times<00:02:03.570> five<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.080> 10<00:02:04.830> so<00:02:05.160> I'm

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
so it says two times five is 10 so I'm

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.610 
so it says two times five is 10 so I'm
going<00:02:05.370> to<00:02:05.400> keep<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.850> 0<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.450> carry<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:07.020> 1<00:02:07.410> this

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
going to keep the 0 and carry a 1 this

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.870 
going to keep the 0 and carry a 1 this
time<00:02:08.180> so<00:02:09.180> let's<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.509> 2<00:02:09.810> times<00:02:10.140> 2<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.560> 4<00:02:10.920> plus<00:02:11.280> 1

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
time so let's see 2 times 2 is 4 plus 1

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:20.620 
time so let's see 2 times 2 is 4 plus 1
is<00:02:12.300> 5<00:02:13.730> 2<00:02:14.730> times<00:02:14.970> 3<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.540> 6<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:17.270> 2<00:02:18.270> times<00:02:18.510> 6<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.020> 12

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
is 5 2 times 3 is 6 and 2 times 6 is 12

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.060 
is 5 2 times 3 is 6 and 2 times 6 is 12
all<00:02:21.630> right<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.110> I'm<00:02:22.350> gonna<00:02:22.500> get<00:02:22.710> rid<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.920> my

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
all right so I'm gonna get rid of my

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.560 
all right so I'm gonna get rid of my
digit<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.610> carry<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.360> don't

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
digit that I carry just so I don't

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.870 
digit that I carry just so I don't
accidentally<00:02:24.990> use<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.470> again<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.520> again<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
same thing I'm just gonna move to the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.890 
same thing I'm just gonna move to the
next<00:02:28.650> digit<00:02:29.120> well<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.300> means<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.630> can<00:02:30.780> now

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
next digit well that means we can now

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.980 
next digit well that means we can now
kind<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.260> forget<00:02:31.530> about<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.830> 2<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.250> 4<00:02:32.990> so

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
kind of forget about the 2 and the 4 so

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.430 
kind of forget about the 2 and the 4 so
I've<00:02:34.110> moved<00:02:34.350> over<00:02:34.860> one<00:02:35.340> two<00:02:36.270> digits<00:02:36.690> I'm<00:02:37.200> gonna

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
I've moved over one two digits I'm gonna

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.130 
I've moved over one two digits I'm gonna
add<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:38.540> two<00:02:39.540> zeros<00:02:40.170> okay<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.750> let's<00:02:42.900> see<00:02:43.020> we

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
add one two zeros okay so let's see we

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.620 
add one two zeros okay so let's see we
now<00:02:43.260> do<00:02:43.320> 1<00:02:43.740> times<00:02:43.980> 5<00:02:44.490> well<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:44.940> easy<00:02:45.060> 1

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
now do 1 times 5 well this is easy 1

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.280 
now do 1 times 5 well this is easy 1
times<00:02:45.840> 5<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.110> 5<00:02:46.380> 1<00:02:47.160> times<00:02:47.370> 2<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.670> 2<00:02:47.970> 1<00:02:48.660> times<00:02:48.840> 3<00:02:49.200> is

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
times 5 is 5 1 times 2 is 2 1 times 3 is

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.340 
times 5 is 5 1 times 2 is 2 1 times 3 is
3<00:02:49.470> 1<00:02:50.250> times<00:02:50.490> 6<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.330> 6

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
3 1 times 6 is 6

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.730 
3 1 times 6 is 6
I've<00:02:53.190> now<00:02:53.400> multiplied<00:02:54.030> by<00:02:54.209> every<00:02:54.630> digit<00:02:55.050> now

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
I've now multiplied by every digit now

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.070 
I've now multiplied by every digit now
we<00:02:55.800> just<00:02:56.220> add<00:02:56.430> all<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.330> these<00:02:57.660> numbers

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
we just add all of these numbers

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.580 
we just add all of these numbers
together

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
together

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.720 
together
ok<00:02:59.220> so<00:03:00.120> 0<00:03:00.390> plus<00:03:00.570> 0<00:03:00.720> plus<00:03:00.810> 0<00:03:00.989> hey<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.620> 0<00:03:01.980> 0<00:03:02.130> plus

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
ok so 0 plus 0 plus 0 hey that 0 0 plus

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.520 
ok so 0 plus 0 plus 0 hey that 0 0 plus
0<00:03:02.910> 0<00:03:03.540> hey<00:03:03.690> that's<00:03:03.930> 0<00:03:04.820> we've<00:03:05.820> got<00:03:06.090> let's<00:03:06.540> see<00:03:06.780> 5<00:03:07.320> &amp;

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
0 0 hey that's 0 we've got let's see 5 &amp;

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.630 
0 0 hey that's 0 we've got let's see 5 &amp;
5<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.980> 10<00:03:08.360> plus<00:03:09.360> 3<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.930> 13<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.040> I'm<00:03:11.160> gonna<00:03:11.280> keep

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
5 is 10 plus 3 is 13 so I'm gonna keep

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.979 
5 is 10 plus 3 is 13 so I'm gonna keep
the<00:03:11.820> 3<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.420> carry<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.350> 1<00:03:13.410> here<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.450> 1<00:03:15.450> plus<00:03:15.660> 5<00:03:15.959> is

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
the 3 and carry a 1 here so 1 plus 5 is

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.430 
the 3 and carry a 1 here so 1 plus 5 is
6<00:03:16.230> plus<00:03:16.980> 6<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.489> 12<00:03:17.810> 12<00:03:18.810> plus<00:03:19.019> 2<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.980> 14<00:03:21.290> I'm<00:03:22.290> gonna

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
6 plus 6 is 12 12 plus 2 is 14 I'm gonna

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.729 
6 plus 6 is 12 12 plus 2 is 14 I'm gonna
carry<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.860> 1<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.489> next<00:03:23.670> column<00:03:23.810> 1<00:03:24.810> plus<00:03:25.049> 2<00:03:25.380> is

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
carry a 1 to the next column 1 plus 2 is

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.340 
carry a 1 to the next column 1 plus 2 is
3<00:03:26.100> plus<00:03:27.060> 2<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.660> 5<00:03:27.799> plus<00:03:28.799> 3<00:03:28.830> is<00:03:29.459> 8<00:03:29.690> 1<00:03:30.690> plus<00:03:30.870> 6<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.320> 7

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
3 plus 2 is 5 plus 3 is 8 1 plus 6 is 7

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.180 
3 plus 2 is 5 plus 3 is 8 1 plus 6 is 7
so<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:33.090> says<00:03:33.390> if<00:03:33.750> we<00:03:33.959> multiply<00:03:36.019> 6325<00:03:37.019> by<00:03:37.500> 124

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
so it says if we multiply 6325 by 124

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.580 
so it says if we multiply 6325 by 124
we'll<00:03:39.150> get<00:03:39.269> seven<00:03:39.690> hundred<00:03:39.989> eighty<00:03:40.260> four

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
we'll get seven hundred eighty four

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.630 
we'll get seven hundred eighty four
thousand<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.630> three
