00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.300
 at first glance martin does not give 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.790
 the idea of a nice place to live in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.949
 dry and dusty practically does not have 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.010
 atmosphere, however, according to some scientists 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.650
 in the past things were different 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.170
 the less rarefied atmosphere there were 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 clouds in the sky and perhaps the water flowed 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.880
 liquid on the surface but how it is 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.869
 could have happened that if it is reduced like this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.730
 bad 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.649
 the answer could give us the probe 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.329
 of nasa but li li whose launch is in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.700
 program by the end of the year probably 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.070
 to cause the rarefaction of the atmosphere 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.440
 of mars have been more trials 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 one of these is the so-called sputtering 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.129
 or the expulsion from tommy 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.590
 from the atmosphere following the impact with 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.270
 energetic particles in the system 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.000
 solar the sun generates a constant flow 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.399
 of high-energy photons when these 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.230
 they enter the atmosphere of a planet 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.210
 sometimes they collide with some molecules 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.789
 tearing electrons from the atoms and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.710
 transforming them you ignore millions per se 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.869
 they would do nothing but if there is a field 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 magnetic nearby start at 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.549
 rotate around to follow its direction 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.830
 with spiraling orbits now the same 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.439
 sun generates a colossal magnetic field 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.369
 for carrying toe from the solar wind 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.530
 touching the field this field 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.590
 magnetic manages to snatch some of them 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.360
 ions and to take them away in space 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.130
 particular situation may even 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.350
 hurl ions through 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.920
 the atmosphere thousands of kilometers to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.500
 second 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.869
 these in turn go to crash 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 against other molecules scattering 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.400
 in the atoms everywhere as in a billiard 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 sending some into the hole, that is 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.259
 out of the atmosphere in space in the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.880
 over billions of years especially if 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.460
 in the past the solar wind blew with 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.649
 greater intensity than now 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.659
 process can have triggered large 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.030
 changes as they say 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.770
 scientists the transformation of mars from 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.560
 that world welcoming for life that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.049
 perhaps it was the arid desert that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.930
 today we know if things are 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.399
 go right this way is one in 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.180
 the main objectives of the mission 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.180
