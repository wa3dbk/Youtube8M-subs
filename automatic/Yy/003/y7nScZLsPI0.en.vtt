00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.619
 we are going to have everything well afraid to lose repeat it 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.929
 the string of acknowledgments 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.170
 na 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.470
 but in this case 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.029
 today they occur as of heart 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.559
 os alberto I think that not only because it is not a good omen but because 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.109
 the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.310
 stay in this guy as a hostage 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.650
 in this kind of activities that in the background for 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.770
 only the personal personal effort was left 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 Support these photos are from people who are not in this case wired 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.329
 what do you like about porzuna 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.610
 also the sponsors in state agencies that 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.920
 convinced me that in an adore gesture we have already started from 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.500
 based on good so that they compete for many years not 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 and the personal effort of the people who have to lose a dialogue of 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.870
 that if the pp believes the fund make the effort as we listen when 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.290
 surely we are going to go we are not seeing as little more 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.510
 with the streets and some cases for the respect to the investors of that 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.730
 see things that are going 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.860
 students is that these are here developing in the background either 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.890
 work 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.470
 It is a larger quota 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.180
 the same jordi p or not 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.190
 that case only has as painters 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.450
 percent 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.090
 almost the explanation 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.510
 or the reading that we offered in this case I'm going to do as a war of the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.510
 work 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.700
 quique has 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.170
 to the best only 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.140
 per cent the importance as the closeness of telling it to be of a 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.310
 way 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.010
 direct 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.340
 the kind of reflections on which we are thinking of opening that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.660
 think that a conference will become a moment like 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.540
 conversation I'm not going to 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.380
 here nothing Syria 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.170
 explain a series as it should 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.470
 projects because also good one offers has the Nazis point and is 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.130
 demonstrated 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.300
 in the statement 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 not as sumo 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 but all 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.349
 the strategy in this case has organized 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.319
 in tone 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.629
 some anecdote 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.439
 percent 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.439
 a whole anecdote p 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.659
 if they do not say everything as a fact that I did not know dad I'm slow of interests 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.109
 that we have not 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.219
 good with several friends of the opera abao obsession to read the pages of 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.239
 country newspapers 2 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.200
 apart from other train tracks but especially on Wednesdays that has some 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.499
 pages 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:42.989
 who talk about the future 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.649
 and so 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.959
 percent why the pages in front 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.359
 hallucinatory 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.079
 percent I do not recommend because 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.409
 of lard news is that one thinks that they are 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.189
 it is impossible to know they are false 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.040
 cited that the role of surprising and no other research are emerging 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.999
 this situation as collective knowledge 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.429
 that one feels pretty close to the headline 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:12.179
 that if the pages of architecture are topics we are percent the newspaper 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.529
 after and in the future 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.289
 and in this case some time ago 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.009
 haas opened 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.589
 a martí polo who talked about an investigation 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.199
 that they had paid him yet 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.199
 Biologist at the University of Exeter and in California 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.290
 in the referred to would be little science magazine 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.399
 for what 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:35.879
 define 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.619
 what life is 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:38.449
 not that flight 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.189
 the prize to this situation but it's pretty close 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.439
 they also teach 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.269
 an eta prisoner today I know that I had go badly spend of teachers appearance that he did not 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.709
 I knew what to say what architecture is 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.809
 xavi is and what is not architecture and because of that situation as negative can 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:54.859
 Explain 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.389
 here he had been paid a scientist for nothing 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.349
 and explains it as one of the big questions one of the great 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.339
 definitions 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.959
 that had never arrived that never 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.449
 had been achieved 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:07.599
 get to face it 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.719
 and is that I tell you I had not managed to reach a definition because 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.769
 hit them final nasir 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.099
 there has not been like 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.159
 yellows 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.030
 several definitions as of 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.940
 about 5,500 teachers words that the fine does not turn out to be descriptive of what 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.659
 I knew but nevertheless I had come down 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.779
 describe 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:28.520
 seven pillars seven factors 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.830
 and the culés 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.350
 Kissing could get to decide 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.199
 what 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.580
 there was life 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.409
 he made seven factors of his identities of which he swims like a broth of 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.729
 Lieutenant crop emerge 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.189
 even when one reads 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.349
 seven words realizes 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.889
 in this immediate action that occurs among architects who do not 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.400
 we include architecture in all places in all places who 

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:54.259
 words 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.309
 They are like magical magnets 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:00.319
 what do they catch us and who are we feeling very close to what is happening to us? 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.900
 little to what we are projecting 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.729
 this former scientist is bad at coslada 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.349
 defined seven pillars and conditions here on 7 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.099
 yes tehran 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.439
 Program 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.949
 improvisation 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.550
 limits energy regeneration adaptability 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.909
 and they are produced 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:20.870
 they are made in the making 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.030
 spectacular luck pamplona must be said the things of how he exposed before 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.529
 spectacular removes a scientist from paying a million fig tree say that the 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.120
 life 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.559
 program is improvisation 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.559
 they are limits that month 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:36.650
 Energy 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.139
 it's the generation 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.139
 the sat adaptability and is ex exclusion not 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.939
 and at this moment you are seeing how newspaper that is also the 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.939
 fascination witness of how to get this afternoon 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.559
 these seven words versus what defines 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:54.509
 is the architecture 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:55.969
 profile holder 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.149
 was more influential improvisations are limits is energy to that 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.970
 generation 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.919
 it's an institution loss 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.240
 the step we are going to take 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.270
 it is precisely through these seven for projects that I want you to 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.990
 it's story 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.800
 as 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.380
 if we scratch a little 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.230
 we will see what we handle or what we write through shaq conditioned 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.099
 Well, we started more easily 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:24.449
 the one where it looks like it's drawer
