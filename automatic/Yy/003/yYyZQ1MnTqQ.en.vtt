 1 e4 e5 2%% under-cheer 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.269
 Wanting water will be the winner in the broadcast tomorrow 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.410
 22 clock announced so needs all the questions but turn from 20 clock 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.380
 Below there will only be the winners or winners that he says

 Report on Elena Büchel areas too 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.270
 Max himself has been over sender and Michael Deister Union already 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.150
 we have 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.870
 Maxi here, the money is flowing but she was there while the areas announced 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.520
 Sanctuaries Tuesday but do not believe it will continue for Astrid 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.390
 Ackerl wanted to get started but that's why Open achieved a separate master 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.370
 FalconStor is as tall as he is 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.389
 percent 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.049
 so that's how much the ireland touches the device as well 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.019
 Kassen because we have to loose it now accept the joint January is after 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.390
 long break saved before his takeover of the Aachen holding share 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.090
 canceled we are with you will know we all have Universe today 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.619
 a formal for the ladies of the fashion of Sega in the paper sweeping me 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.250
 must always read the name Complete mobile s 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.410
 in Paris Prague it is put on the list 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.330
 Todd follow-up show alone so what if I'm very close to their version there 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.100
 continue where the corpses computer game Astner handsome look 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.740
 more meaningful we have it here also equal percent 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.360
 just the r-word this data center service image has gotten very good and me 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.649
 do not know what has since been on the first leg icon Audi s8 Murphy 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.130
 Never know what all the ladies are made of, including some clever tables 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.320
 now under the name Cat Bird for the rare on the graphic 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.740
 Ada can stand out of such first out there for the Xbox one more 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.110
 bit but I am exports fair as well as games are among the classic 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.430
 Rock over the Top Seed waited for a lot of export privately 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.450
 around 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.240
 that is completely under water before what the developers are still trying to 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.210
 So now explore the city's Komani Come Rain man games 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.770
 Tempted said 2000 visitors around in the on the consoles 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.500
 convert coins 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.119
 Otmar Eckermann but was very good because the models 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.750
 was actually okay okay again but well converted to stop 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.230
 worry about bankruptcies PC 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.780
 So boss is going to be technical as he takes the tech on the consoles 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.040
 x can expect Deng we need to fight back on the console FC admitted 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.390
 Somebody else can do it on EA Sports as a shooter 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.079
 not 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.189
 Arisdorf imagine play something totally different on the PC today yes 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.309
 that is an interplay of different other games can go well 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.889
 Galler he puts himself says he too many suitcases can spoil the porridge 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.419
 I have to say in the game 50 that's good Euro though her team is 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.489
 their assassination no longer so I shut up I have every one of them 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.829
 Week 3 4 percent for this and the bike Christiane Hütter after the 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.119
 So the Werner-senger-Straße game has to be done badly 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.049
 Play the downhill a piste certain thing just fine 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.659
 if it's nice, too 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.279
 or by use of the word 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.299
 is such a gathering of the average since now it does 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.100
 not any things super super great as Bo force 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.089
 Percent system our stories but it turns off 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.569
 Some things are not so bad so you can get Salem Border 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.249
 Leasing over both me the shitty RS 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:10.829
 be it always in the middle of it and that is why it is so 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.150
 good ratings we at the things Geneva ticks 7 given of ten that is 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.809
 percent 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:18.689
 yet our hard-hitting bids so sharp against us years of mighty 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.710
 Adele and that is of course good and has got 80 percent everywhere else 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.670
 that's why it's just a good thing because the gal fraction Passau 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.429
 because the live action ECD 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.829
 good because there is no compulsion is the band 3 faction is not that I say 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.879
 I want is such a case only we all are the same restless gives three 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.939
 various whatever problems at Lenzing there is good it's not good though 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.179
 Percent at least differences journals have overlooked them 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.359
 already pretty well solved 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.019
 and EUR because you can open with so much to the flat on the hippies messenger 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.650
 Moments from Sascha Moll resembles 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.540
 because of the three parties that are the raids the need big 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.530
 and the Macquarie which hopefully also the head the 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.520
 Hirschi Teuteberg ID of the day Perry revealed that cleanliness was also Carlas 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.290
 got in there so you have this St SGD off 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.880
 Evening three parties all very different and so it's Bakulin 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.419
 possible 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.819
 just to have a lot of Hela's problems they have such big ruffians 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:16.090
 and these men are quite honest between high tech yes he does 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.370
 So how can you get really worse, we'll show everything later 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.710
 Aden, I'll tell you what pictures are all safe 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.310
 i can not do it i have top one third through the double 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.780
 Globe trained there is plenty of diffuser should not be picked - one 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.470
 For example, Basel is that Camilla a Zurich hospital the nationalists and on 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.440
 The end is also makes the salary Michler lawn order 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.620
 No, but it's actually so percent Mazari and Novus Herti all three 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.940
 completely different you what 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.340
 completely different to the understanding of the grant may from the still 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.770
 others are Ursula Hellert's people a place for a restful summer 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 may Universe at Work on yes mean that of which are with it and 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.560
 the whole quasi hierarchy 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.919
 attacks the earth 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.310
 The Novus want to charge the ECJ a hierarchy for having the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.830
 Planets have the US and the Mashaal I'm just having fun 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.770
 Well, the absurdest thing about it 3 3 the Enz Raúl is what I change and was 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.900
 which is a penchant for fun for all singles even today, York survives 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.500
 to master Thomas for professional Eckhard Chance's yard together Wellington 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.860
 hoped to join 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.370
 but it is clear that a whole country in cattle Novus like you are masters if 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.999
 It is always a special Sacher Arn mining resources 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.710
 but that changes humbly from these three percent peoples 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.389
 I also have to mention briefly that they are consistent in updating 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.979
 that is yes as it can already read above it with the already on it 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.860
 very cool, Austria quite elegant in the handheld camera and Windows 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.410
 Live Games for Windows means Windows Live is supported 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.140
 that means that we have Windows Live as well as this mode that is quasi 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.810
 this picture is Tom Buhrow 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.839
 In addition, incredibly successful Xbox Live 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:54.909
 So I totally hate the val-de-travers box Silently missed 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.509
 Xbox Live in the super system that works on the console 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:58.960
 thought through it makes it look 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.560
 with the Killers the problem Microsoft tries what they eint dement 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.629
 Internet service to establish meadow play 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:09.330
 Thinking in the PC on the Internet thousand alternatives have the free picture 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.860
 Dennis knows for free 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.229
 All unfair is supposed to be stories or moreover, it's also free 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.490
 where the games of our players is so 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.280
 for the pure pleasure 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.559
 Play online 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:22.559
 Money had to be paid enough it usually costs 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.009
 but what costs nothing is yes solar gamble what to do when it's ten 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.409
 Starter preinstalled i say times game is now theme on diet by ski 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.209
 I may even have Opel in the short messages of 

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:36.300
 ActiveCare at the saar-uni insert holiday I have been on the States 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.490
 Bütt Braga but not 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.589
 the thing is 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:44.289
 now good as it for the stars comparing eye-catcher and success remember 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:46.969
 Anyone who wants to, even if it's damn small so I saw my first one 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:49.449
 Criticism of one can pull yourself up Overall No One can do this 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:49.940
 to be able to 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.680
 It's annoying that he's gassed them all for two reasons 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.119
 first units are actually quite large 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:56.969
 Secondly 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:00.479
 the camera is just damn damn close to happening so that's one 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.039
 In my opinion a bit already will be already in the 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.829
 Game under we catch first I am now only on the side of HEAG 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:13.020
 we are looking very smart a final round that is now as bonds 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.430
 so to speak, tree just likes 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.460
 We believe in us again, sometimes prove what he was on it and what it 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.940
 in content to exactly what we have to blame ourselves on one 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.400
 formal questions but then we can not even because there is not where 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.860
 we want to be, too 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.089
 but our weaknesses 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:35.499
 from the market but narrow again in the women has caused but why should on 

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:38.969
 End not again if it thereby had the preliminary work of staging 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:41.779
 Patients one or the other length of the lot do not get the problem 

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:42.819
 ready to play 

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:46.960
 Both get criticized for food because under Vista it is actually very common 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.149
 However, as these words have certainly been seen, it is very important 

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:53.740
 the two sports in the new election 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.210
 that can actually be that too 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.060
 Möller not stupid and therefore Mr. the last game I ever had in the 

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.430
 online and also Nico Biedermann 30 times 40 minutes four days before but also 

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.330
 Already against the people that actually play I get too 

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.389
 ever killed the Nazi minutes
