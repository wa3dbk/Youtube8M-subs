 a little to add the 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.969
 flour 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.109
 we try to spread the best 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.329
 we can flour to avoid from 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.690
 now that we begin to form the 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.399
 lumps since we are in the clear gold 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.900
 let's add milk but very 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.659
 slowly 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.070
 we will be beating all the time 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.110

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.329
 of walnut with this is going to have a big 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.090
 flavor and with this we can start already what 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.960
 which is the lasagna itself in which we are going 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.049
 to generate the layers of each of the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.049
 ingredients let's start with a little 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.159
 of our bechamel sauce now we are going to 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.159
 accommodate the pasta 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.750
 in the background to continue with our 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.070
 tuna coat 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.119
 remember that it has to be more tuna 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.119

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.229

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.630
 more to allow the cheese to gratine 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.140
