00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello friends I am a while ago 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.810
 talked about what he set himself 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.849
 new tape recorder from the company geyser and 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.679
 Now I continue to use this 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.889
 tape recorder and I talked to representatives 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.330
 geyser company they assured me that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.789
 a new one will be released soon 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.220
 firmware version and there will be interesting 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.050
 pieces and including eliminating those 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.680
 small flaws about which i 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.050
 told here in this review and 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.840
 today I'm going to the geyser workshop again 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.550
 because I want to further improve 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.870
 his 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.390
 audio-video system in the car and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.230
 thanks to this tape recorder, the geyser can 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.379
 say what's in your car 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.350
 There is no audio-audio system 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.390
 system since the car stereo has 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.600
 huge screen and you can display 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.600
 as there are videos like 9 from a flash drive 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.460
 play even with you if you have 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.980
 internet in the car but i want to go 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.320
 even further improvements of their 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.090
 audio video systems and the first thing I want 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.899
 put this rear view camera then 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.990
 The idea is that when I turn on 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.330
 Rear gear on the screen of the radio 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.409
 image is automatically displayed with 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.890
 rear view camera 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.250
 it is set above the license plate 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.350
 instead of the standard license plate illuminator 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.220
 sign that is, it turns out that she looks 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.740
 into the asphalt and sees exactly that place 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.869
 which is right behind your 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.600
 car and see it in no way 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.189
 rearview mirrors camera impossible 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.840
 also displays such 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.210
 special markup for which you can 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.670
 approximately orient which 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.530
 the distance to the obstacle can be left 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.229
 whether still to move or worth it already 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.320
 stop and the second thing i want 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.240
 install this video recorder but this one 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.750
 DVR special still such 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.700
 video recorders 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.830
 did not consider on his channel that is 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.170
 reviews of such registrars him this 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.240
 the recorder does not have a screen thanks to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.970
 what is it very compact installed 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.460
 compact and I want to install it 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.830
 once and for all and don't take it off 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.570
 when i leave the car on unguarded 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.810
 parking lots since the receptionist 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.720
 so small and he hides near 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.490
 rearview mirrors so notice 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.730
 its not very easy meaning it is attention 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.140
 will not attract but at the same time 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.270
 screen this registrar is not needed 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.910
 since the image will be displayed 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.920
 on the screen of my radio tape recorder that is 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.739
 it turns out that my tape recorder becomes 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.300
 such an audio-video center where will 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.880
 gather information from the camera 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.280
 which is installed above the license plate 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.380
 Rear view camera and with 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.400
 registrar to be installed on 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.070
 windshield 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.800
 Well, the third point that I want myself 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.600
 do as it turned out I already said in 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.030
 previous review of the radio that 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.940
 built-in microphone for communication 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.730
 bluetooth doesn't suit me very much 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.560
 Quite quiet and you have to either very 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.620
 loudly say that is not always comfortable 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.290
 let's say but the benefit of the package 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.060
 Recorder there is an external microphone and I want 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.090
 ask the masters from the geyser it 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.720
 install and review separately 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.430
 all this 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.940
 an innovation that I will install 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.430
 and wait for the news subscribe to the channel 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.310
 put likes leave comments 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.950
 be sure to share this video 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.150
 soon there will be reviews of my new 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.150
 acquisitions yet
