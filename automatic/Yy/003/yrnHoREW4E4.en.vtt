00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.489
 they updated by mistake to ios 8.3 but 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.620
 they want to download iOS 8.2 version and 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.409

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.159
 description once on the page 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:57.760
 you are going to select your model of 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.949
 iphone or ipod or ipad in in this case the 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.049
 device that they want to do the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.750

 iphone an iphone 5 gsm 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.880
 and I'm going to go down to the 8.2 point version 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.610
 zero ok 8.2 once you have already chosen these 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.190
 steps we are going to click on the button 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.960
 download and it will not start downloading 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:28.020
 the ips w of the version 8.2 years this 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.190
 usually it takes about an hour and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.440
 that weighs a gig 600 megabytes then 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.140
 it's a bit heavy but this is good 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.259
 will depend on your internet connection one 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.940
 once the ips w has been downloaded as 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.610
 you can see here we have it in the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.330
 desktop what we're going to do is going to be 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.060
