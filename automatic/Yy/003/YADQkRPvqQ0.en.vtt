00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
corner and hopefully there's many more

to come so as you guys may have already

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.290

figured<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:28.949> I'm<00:00:29.220> actually<00:00:29.429> from<00:00:29.789> Australia

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
figured out I'm actually from Australia

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.030 
figured out I'm actually from Australia
so<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> thought<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.019> first<00:00:31.349> loadout<00:00:31.740> video

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
so I thought in my first loadout video

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
so I thought in my first loadout video
we<00:00:32.250> should<00:00:32.399> probably<00:00:32.520> take<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> look<00:00:33.300> at<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
we should probably take a look at the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.900

I<00:02:18.000> actually<00:02:18.180> ended<00:02:18.600> up<00:02:18.750> switching<00:02:19.050> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
I actually ended up switching to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.620 
I actually ended up switching to
hardcore<00:02:19.800> mode<00:02:20.040> because<00:02:20.640> although<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.180> ACOG

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.210 
hardcore mode because although the ACOG
does<00:02:21.870> help<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.290> lineup<00:02:22.709> longer<00:02:23.040> range

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
does help you to lineup longer range

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.490 
does help you to lineup longer range

shots unlike in real life you need quite

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
shots unlike in real life you need quite
a<00:02:25.560> few<00:02:25.650> shots<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.310> take<00:02:26.490> down<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> target<00:02:27.090> with

an assault rifle in hardcore mode you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.490 
an assault rifle in hardcore mode you
can<00:02:30.150> sort<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.420> use<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.840> weapon<00:02:31.230> with<00:02:31.350> these

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
can sort of use this weapon with these

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.620 
can sort of use this weapon with these
attachments<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:32.190> little<00:02:32.489> bit<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> DMR<00:02:33.390> in

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
this round I was actually trying to stay

in<00:02:35.850> cover<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.209> fair<00:02:36.480> bit<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.870> take<00:02:37.260> out<00:02:37.440> guys

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
in cover a fair bit and take out guys

in cover a fair bit and take out guys
from<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.040> distance<00:02:38.430> which<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:38.850> probably<00:02:39.360> pretty

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
from a distance which is probably pretty

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.470 
from a distance which is probably pretty

realistic to real-life combat even

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.880 
realistic to real-life combat even
though<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.630> was<00:02:42.930> able<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.200> do<00:02:43.380> pretty<00:02:43.620> well<00:02:43.709> with

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
though I was able to do pretty well with

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.770 
though I was able to do pretty well with
it<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.489> match<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.030> org<00:02:45.239> definitely

it in this match the org definitely

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.750 
it in this match the org definitely
isn't<00:02:46.170> better<00:02:46.320> than<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.620> DMR<00:02:47.010> by<00:02:47.220> any<00:02:47.459> means

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
isn't better than a DMR by any means

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.910 
isn't better than a DMR by any means

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
though for mid to long range targets so

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.800 
though for mid to long range targets so
I<00:02:49.950> can<00:02:50.190> safely<00:02:50.400> say<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.820> probably<00:02:51.209> won't<00:02:51.600> be

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
I can safely say I probably won't be
