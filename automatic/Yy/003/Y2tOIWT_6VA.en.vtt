00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:15.150
 he is a professor at da ufrj and our 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.619
 fighting companions is giving up space 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.140
 here to talk a little about the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.580
 mobilizations that were in the first 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.400
 teacher's presentation he speaks a 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.039
 bit of one of a germ of a new 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.189
 a new embryonic stage 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.840
 at this time is that you mobilize 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.880
 Follow in Brazil, we wanted to know. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.670
 more or less how is it happening? 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 process so you put that in this 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.710
 same process we can achieve a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.770
 new or we can resume and the old ones 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.930
 practices or get lost in that old 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.190
 So what we live in Brazil was 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.980
 a social explosion that is interesting 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.250
 her you looking at a minute before 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.239
 blast was fine, it's not people 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.649
 evaluates that it has a film layer 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.680
 holding a call option 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.630
 actions that already gave me food and this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.200
 explosion was makes it possible to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.030
 new is the site works with the idea of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.400
 practical field on average people are 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.350
 submitted to a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.900
 reality and that there is a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 impossibility can not change life is 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.520
 so do what? 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 the change takes place days the site when the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.080
 impossible is impossible not to give 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.290
 maintain this impossibility without threats 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.290
 to life and we're seeing it right home 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.210
 you can not be subjected to 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.939
 an order of domination with all 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.360
 contradictions that it comes and that it 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.940
 produces a series of dissatisfactions 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.400
 they needed to trigger something I was told 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.210
 these indignities in a movement of 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.340
 pastas 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.710
 the trigger was the fight against the increase 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.150
 of passages more quickly the people 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.220
 see how this set of 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.250
 contradictions and indignations finds the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.250
 its melting point in a collective being that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.500
 scares people because because life 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.380
 normal is the fragmentation of being 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.970
 collective is this collective in the form of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.510
 individuals in capsules in a series not 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.420
 a reality that calls for submission to the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.130
 awareness of each trend 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.860
 job taking gentlemen paying their 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.240
 Do not pick up the cops. 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.340
 having enough money to get there 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.450
 until the end of the month but still the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.000
 reality principle what x-rays 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.880
 when debating with the confreres he 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.290
 the principle of annuality 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.180
 abstract if you do not consider that in the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.880
 our conditions the principle of 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.240
 capitalism is what with what 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.460
 determines the normal is so normal is the life 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.370
 regular goods and the workforce 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.220
 being sold the normal is that who is not 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.060
 neither will this be deleted will be killed 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.610
 will stop in the chains then the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.700
 handling it allows all this 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.350
 come actor because he is problematized but 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.910
 here comes the trap that was talking 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.950
 with the case of Brazil 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.840
 with this social explosion, well, the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.459
 government does not listen to the voice of the polls 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.610
 but we will then make a reform 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.459
 politics the vote will be going district 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.230
 proportional but its name is not 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.450
 simplistic 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.350
 sometimes the order of capital can be 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.770
 reproduce 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.480
 my nominal vote and proportional list in 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.720
 district to snow 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.020
 the truly new was the population 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.360
 who broke this cascade controlled create 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.520
 the elements of your own organization 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.590
 of consistency this new contract 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.470
 was established, this is not why the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.720
 people bet on the possibility of energy 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.480
 which was released by society in 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.260
 driving the new will drop the profile 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.620
 from this hill 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.970
 good is first only broke the arrogance of the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.830
 that if it was not stored in some 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.990
 place and now only needs to be communicated 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.840
 people who did not know the new is 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.180
 certain way it is an old content 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.880
 looking for new ways too right is not 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.430
 It's true that this resistance 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.750
 started now is too long but not 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.450
 It's good for us to be reviewing the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.820
 old forms have new features in the present 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.130
 which will tell new forms 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.470
 now what is this old man that this 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.810
 tradition that comes from these struggles and 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.690
 of these resistances allows us to say 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.240
 that the new one in Brazil is not honey 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.910
 developmentalism as it was not 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.100
 neoliberalism what is common between 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.860
 neoliberalism nelson sold that none 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.960
 the two are even new right my liberal 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.420
 that the event falls at the entrance of that 40 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.330
 any surroundings than 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.290
 tries to get something that was easy to do 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:50.190
 direction by 50 fall farm of 40 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.340
 in the ECLAC debate is now staged 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.810
 as a sham right and incorporating all 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.320
 the elements of the so-called neoliberalism 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.300
 Only now with more stadium do not see 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.160
 this trap of neoliberal enel 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.830
 developmental and has a dynamic 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.750
 of we want more market more state 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.460
 we saw more market did not work 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.050
 Let's try for more status. 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.170
 why not think that the two 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.270
 elements of the market are characteristic of 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.630
 a member 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.480
 capital and then wanting more market - 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.090
 I'm more state and market, I'm super 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.790
 claiming that our rights 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.640
 are not health education goods 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.100
 housing financed by the fund 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.470
 to satisfy rights is that 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.200
 then they are not merchandise are out 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.740
 of the market what I was a power that 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.830
 rises above people is not above 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.110
 that supposedly of the own society 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.700
 presenting a neutral time by which the 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.650
 masses on the street said that she 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.180
 discovered the scam what is 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.190
 presented as neutral above the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.780
 society has a side to side in the 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.880
 your big side contractor 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.640
 conglomerates on one side of the 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.650
 this is how the state has nothing is time for 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.860
 society fundamentally 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.980
 workers take their side self 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.530
 organize and create instances that can 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.720
 say that it is necessary then who can 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.390
 to say that who can say this is who 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.070
 for example in health fight forum 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.620
 against the privatization of health 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.980
 Education Board in defense of education 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.190
 public in the favelas the residents of 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.720
 favelas on the land note 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.730
 social movements fighting for land 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.370
 of workers to their commitments 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:34.100
 that we can get the 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.800
 this new proposal which is the 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.200
 Our view, if it has to be effective, has 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.800
 to be of nephew capitalism 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.320
 anti-capitalist now he is a defense 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.780
 of life what the site said 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.850
 capitalism asks for the reproduction of life 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.950
 which will guarantee the protection of capital is 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:55.100
 therefore life under an anti 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:57.740
 capitalist is not that a socialist like 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.800
 This could be asked better if the 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.500
 life rises against capital 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.830
 let's shape this a society and a 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.830
 sociability against the commodity against 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.900
 the capital where it was this is a new one in 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.700
 our opinion this is structured a 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.860
 popular program 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.510
 five of these demands 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.060
 ways of performing 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.970
 it is not within the straits 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:28.030
 limits of bourgeois institutionality 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:28.030
 retired or not sure
