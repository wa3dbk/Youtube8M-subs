getting it from one continent to another

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
getting it from one continent to another
I<00:01:36.149> mean<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> big<00:01:37.259> ask<00:01:37.469> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
I mean this was this was a big ask to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.910 
I mean this was this was a big ask to
get<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:38.069> over<00:01:38.219> there<00:01:39.439> well<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.679> typical

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.590 
get them over there well on a typical
day<00:01:41.159> would<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.700> very<00:01:41.909> difficult<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.479> move

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
day would be very difficult to move

equipment<00:03:33.440> we<00:03:34.440> bought<00:03:34.620> them<00:03:34.829> back<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.340> made

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
equipment we bought them back and made

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.009 
equipment we bought them back and made
them<00:03:36.299> available<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.170> TEPCO<00:03:38.570> alright<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.750> you

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
them available to TEPCO alright and you

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.930 
them available to TEPCO alright and you
know<00:03:40.140> what<00:03:40.320> just<00:03:40.440> taking<00:03:40.799> this<00:03:40.890> full<00:03:41.519> circle

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
know what just taking this full circle

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.090 
know what just taking this full circle
for<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.209> second<00:03:42.630> um<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.530> interesting<00:03:43.890> thing<00:03:44.040> of

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
for a second um the interesting thing of

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.710 
for a second um the interesting thing of
course<00:03:44.250> about<00:03:44.459> these<00:03:44.609> pumps<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.030> they<00:03:45.540> are

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
course about these pumps is they are

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.330 
course about these pumps is they are
originally<00:03:46.200> concrete<00:03:46.709> pumps<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.190> in<00:03:47.250> this

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
originally concrete pumps and in this

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.220 
originally concrete pumps and in this
case<00:03:47.609> for<00:03:48.000> now<00:03:48.120> at<00:03:48.269> least<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:48.660> going<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.140> be

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
case for now at least it's going to be

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.509 
case for now at least it's going to be
water<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.620> they<00:03:49.799> pump<00:03:50.040> but<00:03:50.220> obviously

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
water that they pump but obviously

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.069 
water that they pump but obviously
there's<00:03:50.700> been<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.820> lot<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:51.120> talk<00:03:51.390> about<00:03:51.540> the

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
there's been a lot of talk about the

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.440 
there's been a lot of talk about the
situation<00:03:52.739> at<00:03:52.980> those<00:03:53.489> reactors<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.390> the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
situation at those reactors and the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.660 
situation at those reactors and the
possibility<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.109> actually<00:03:55.670> channeling

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
possibility of actually channeling

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.000 
possibility of actually channeling
cement<00:03:57.060> into<00:03:57.329> those<00:03:57.600> reactors<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.200> just<00:03:58.380> shut

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
cement into those reactors to just shut

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.280 
cement into those reactors to just shut
them<00:03:59.130> down<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.359> know<00:04:00.450> shut<00:04:00.810> off<00:04:00.959> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
them down and to you know shut off the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.960 
them down and to you know shut off the
radioactivity<00:04:01.799> is<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.549> plausible

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
radioactivity is that a plausible

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.039 
radioactivity is that a plausible
scenario<00:04:05.000> that's<00:04:06.000> absolutely<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.569> plausible

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049
