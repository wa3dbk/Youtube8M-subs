00:00:01.832 --> 00:00:03.869
 -Hello? "I see you're home, Kate. 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.263
 Please, leave me alone. 

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:16.164
 Not! 

00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:27.364
 Not! No, please! 

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:42.705
 More than 6 million people are persecuted each year in the United States. 

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:46.156
 One in six women. One in 19 men. 

00:00:46.157 --> 00:00:48.897
 Motivated by rejection, envy and revenge. 

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:50.898
 Social networking is the main reason 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.202
 of cases have tripled in the last decade. 

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:54.953
 Anyone can be a tracker, 

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.254
 anyone can fall victim. 

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.305
 That's where I come in. I command TAU. 

00:00:58.306 --> 00:01:00.136
 We take care of cases of persecution 

00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:01.669
 and threats to citizens, 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.990
 as well as politicians and civil servants. 

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:06.700
 Detective Larsen is here. -Who? 

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:08.151
 -The new guy. - From NY. 

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:09.752
 Homicide, great personality, 

00:01:09.753 --> 00:01:12.471
 It's not for anyone. Single, never married, 

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.222
 "Smell around. "Good for him." 

00:01:15.223 --> 00:01:17.903
 - Why this unit? -To meet Scarlet Johansson. 

00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:20.203
 "Read the manual?" "No, but I watched Fatal Attraction, 

00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:21.904
 Cape of Fear, Fixing. 

00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:27.705
 It was a joke. 

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:30.106
 She's been hiding from someone. 

00:01:30.107 --> 00:01:31.942
 The bathroom curtain is transparent, 

00:01:31.943 --> 00:01:33.298
 not to hide behind. 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.788
 She sleeps on the left side looking at the door 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.380
 to search for a spare. 

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:39.501
 He likes it and does not want it to end. 

00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:41.502
 "Why kill her?" -Still do not know... 

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:43.393
 But I did impress you, did not I? 

00:01:47.554 --> 00:01:48.954
 How did you get in here? 

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:52.105
 You were his roommate before. 

00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:55.126
 He left the notebook on and recorded me and Kristie. 

00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:57.327
 I would never record a sex video. 

00:01:58.208 --> 00:01:59.740
 I just want us to be friends. 

00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:01.991
 But we can not, Perry! No longer. 

00:02:01.992 --> 00:02:05.175
 I can not eat, sleep or do anything 

00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:07.076
 because this guy thinks he owns me! 

00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:10.297
 You need to stay calm. I know these feelings. 

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:13.598
 Believe me, I do. 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.912
 I've been through that. 

00:02:14.913 --> 00:02:16.613
 For something much worse than that. 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.930
 - You need to get out. "If I wanted revenge, 

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.031
 would have poisoned his beer or something. 

00:02:22.552 --> 00:02:25.182
 I know you're scared. -I'm not. I'm angry! 

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:27.203
 Why does not anyone help me? 

00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:32.204
 - Should we ... see how she is? - She can turn around. 

00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:33.505
 I will help you. 

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.006
 He's been harassing me for a year. 

00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:39.407
 - You did not call the police? -Do not process someone 

00:02:39.408 --> 00:02:41.848
 "To scare you." -We need to go to your house. 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.009
 -What is it? - Secret observation room. 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.380
 We have fingerprints, DNA, and lots of other disgusting things. 

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:49.381
 NESTA FALL SEASON 

00:02:49.522 --> 00:02:50.822
 What do you do here? 

00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:54.651
 Stay away from Erick. -I'll report... 

00:02:54.652 --> 00:02:56.802
 Whereby? Chasing a stalker? 

00:02:56.803 --> 00:02:58.803
 Do you think they will believe in someone like you? 

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:00.564
 I lie best and believe in me. 

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:01.985
 They always believe. 

00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:04.986
 Did you come to LA to be a better man? 

00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:06.807
 I made several mistakes in NY. 

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.108
 Some things I can not undo. 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.859
 He has had a psychotic outbreak and is playing. 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.560
 A NEW SUSPENSE 

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.991
 He will not kill her now, otherwise he would have killed. 

00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:23.200
 -I know everything about you! -Do not do it! 

00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:24.701
 THAT WILL NEVER LET YOU GO 

00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:29.202
 No, no, no! 

00:03:30.403 --> 00:03:33.403
