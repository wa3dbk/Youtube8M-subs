last<00:03:09.000> fight<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.570> course<00:03:09.960> but<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:11.040> know

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
last fight all of course but we know

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.920

at<00:03:43.860> doncaster<00:03:44.400> which<00:03:44.520> I<00:03:44.670> think<00:03:44.850> log<00:03:45.000> as<00:03:45.180> well

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
at doncaster which I think log as well

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.790 
at doncaster which I think log as well
for<00:03:45.510> his<00:03:45.600> chances<00:03:45.990> of<00:03:46.020> acting<00:03:46.380> on<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.590> ground

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
for his chances of acting on the ground

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.100 
for his chances of acting on the ground
at<00:03:46.950> Cheltenham<00:03:47.810> interesting<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.930> hear

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
at Cheltenham interesting to hear

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.020 
at Cheltenham interesting to hear
connections<00:03:49.890> say<00:03:50.040> they<00:03:50.190> wouldn't<00:03:50.580> want<00:03:50.880> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
connections say they wouldn't want the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.199 
connections say they wouldn't want the
ground<00:03:51.240> too<00:03:51.480> fast<00:03:51.780> for<00:03:51.990> this<00:03:52.110> horse<00:03:52.380> that

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
ground too fast for this horse that

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.640 
ground too fast for this horse that
would<00:03:54.209> be<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.420> concern<00:03:54.930> because<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.470> race

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
would be a concern because the race

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.010 
would be a concern because the race
comes<00:03:55.920> on<00:03:56.040> Friday<00:03:56.630> historically<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.840> will

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
comes on Friday historically that will

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.600 
comes on Friday historically that will
tend<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.470> be<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.800> fast<00:03:59.010> aground<00:03:59.310> on<00:03:59.490> the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
tend to be the fast aground on the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.190 
tend to be the fast aground on the
Friday<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.180> would<00:04:00.450> be<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.570> concern<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:01.080> it

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
Friday so that would be a concern but it

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.480 
Friday so that would be a concern but it
would<00:04:01.290> also<00:04:01.320> be<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.709> concern<00:04:02.100> for<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.370> Irish

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
would also be a concern for the Irish

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.070 
would also be a concern for the Irish
contenders<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.180> course

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
contenders of course

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.380 
contenders of course
and<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.740> know<00:04:04.860> if<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:05.310> horse<00:04:05.520> race<00:04:06.180> has<00:04:06.300> been

and you know if this horse race has been
on<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.630> Tuesday<00:04:07.050> it'd<00:04:07.170> be<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> lot<00:04:07.440> stronger<00:04:07.740> on

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
on the Tuesday it'd be a lot stronger on

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.220 
on the Tuesday it'd be a lot stronger on
one<00:04:08.790> or<00:04:08.880> two<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.150> these<00:04:09.270> whereas<00:04:09.690> Friday<00:04:10.050> you

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
one or two of these whereas Friday you

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.920 
one or two of these whereas Friday you
could<00:04:10.470> have<00:04:10.590> incredibly<00:04:11.130> quick<00:04:11.400> ground<00:04:11.930> you

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
could have incredibly quick ground you

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.170 
could have incredibly quick ground you
know<00:04:13.020> Rocky<00:04:13.350> Creek<00:04:13.620> have<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> chance<00:04:14.160> see<00:04:15.150> a

thunder<00:04:15.540> would<00:04:15.690> be<00:04:15.780> my<00:04:15.930> number<00:04:16.170> one<00:04:16.200> what

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
thunder would be my number one what

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.229 
thunder would be my number one what
about<00:04:16.680> you<00:04:16.799> well<00:04:17.340> i<00:04:17.370> think<00:04:17.459> that<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:18.030> horse

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
about you well i think that the horse

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.940 
about you well i think that the horse
there<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.690> he<00:04:18.870> certainly<00:04:19.049> suits<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.530> profile

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
there and he certainly suits the profile

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.490 
there and he certainly suits the profile
of<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.160> race<00:04:20.450> point-to-point<00:04:21.450> winner<00:04:21.810> second

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
of the race point-to-point winner second

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.900 
of the race point-to-point winner second
extra<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.950> horse<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.310> beating<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.640> day<00:04:23.790> has

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
extra the horse of beating that day has

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.370 
extra the horse of beating that day has
gone<00:04:24.000> on<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.210> win<00:04:24.300> since<00:04:24.510> but<00:04:24.720> i<00:04:24.870> just<00:04:25.290> don't

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
gone on to win since but i just don't

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.020 
gone on to win since but i just don't
think<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.620> beating<00:04:26.010> of<00:04:26.130> guellen--<00:04:26.370> bursty<00:04:26.820> is

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
think a beating of guellen-- bursty is

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.420 
think a beating of guellen-- bursty is
good<00:04:27.570> enough<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.810> win<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.110> no<00:04:28.770> top-level<00:04:29.160> race

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
good enough to win a no top-level race

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.470 
good enough to win a no top-level race
of<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.640> festival<00:04:29.940> says<00:04:30.030> well<00:04:30.180> i<00:04:30.210> have<00:04:30.360> to

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
of the festival says well i have to

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.390 
of the festival says well i have to

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
improve off the back of of those two

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.160 
improve off the back of of those two
runs<00:04:32.640> and<00:04:32.820> he<00:04:32.880> might<00:04:33.270> well<00:04:33.450> improve<00:04:33.780> but<00:04:34.080> you

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
runs and he might well improve but you

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.660 
runs and he might well improve but you
know<00:04:34.290> we're<00:04:34.650> talking<00:04:35.010> about<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.370> difference

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
know we're talking about the difference

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.490 
know we're talking about the difference

between a selection and abet perhaps and

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.860 
between a selection and abet perhaps and
you<00:04:37.770> know<00:04:37.890> you<00:04:37.950> want<00:04:38.520> proven<00:04:39.060> in<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.420> book<00:04:39.600> for

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
it for a bit i would say see if thunders
