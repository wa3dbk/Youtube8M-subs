all<00:00:00.719> right<00:00:01.260> that's<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.589> pretty<00:00:01.860> common<00:00:02.310> kind

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
all right that's the pretty common kind

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.840 
all right that's the pretty common kind
of<00:00:02.700> question<00:00:03.149> where<00:00:03.750> you<00:00:03.959> dissolve<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:05.250> certain

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
of question where you dissolve a certain

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.680 
of question where you dissolve a certain
mass<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:07.170> solid<00:00:07.529> into<00:00:08.160> water<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.700> then<00:00:09.120> see

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
mass of solid into water and then see

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.080 
mass of solid into water and then see
how<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:09.990> temperature<00:00:10.559> changes<00:00:10.820> now<00:00:11.820> I'm

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
how the temperature changes now I'm

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.180 
how the temperature changes now I'm
under<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.570> impression<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:13.320> when<00:00:14.070> you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
under the impression that when you

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.760 
under the impression that when you
dissolve<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.670> solid<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.389> water<00:00:15.690> generally<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
dissolve a solid in water generally the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.980 
dissolve a solid in water generally the
temperature<00:00:17.220> goes<00:00:17.400> down<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.270> bit<00:00:18.420> but

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
temperature goes down a little bit but

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.390 
temperature goes down a little bit but
it<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.380> happened<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.980> salt<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
it just so happened that the salt I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.150 
it just so happened that the salt I
picked<00:00:20.760> when<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.330> looked<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.779> up<00:00:22.039> makes<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
picked when I looked it up makes the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.830 
picked when I looked it up makes the
temperature<00:00:23.550> go<00:00:23.670> up<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.910> lot<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.449> actually

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
temperature go up a lot it's actually

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
temperature go up a lot it's actually
the<00:00:25.080> salt<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.859> use<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.250> hot<00:00:26.490> packs<00:00:26.820> when

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the salt that you use in hot packs when

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.120 
the salt that you use in hot packs when
you<00:00:27.420> break<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.840> open<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.470> mix<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you break it open in the to mix the

you break it open in the to mix the
temperature<00:00:29.550> goes<00:00:29.760> up<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.119> whole<00:00:30.630> bunch<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.170> any

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
temperature goes up a whole bunch in any

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.069 
temperature goes up a whole bunch in any
case<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.790> question<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> temperature

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
case the question is if the temperature

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.160 
case the question is if the temperature
goes<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.399> 17.5<00:00:35.399> degrees<00:00:35.790> Celsius<00:00:36.300> what's<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
goes up 17.5 degrees Celsius what's the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.190 
goes up 17.5 degrees Celsius what's the
heat<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.620> solution<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.270> asks<00:00:39.989> is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
heat of solution now what that asks is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.010 
heat of solution now what that asks is
how<00:00:40.410> much<00:00:40.890> heat<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:42.230> freed<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:45.020> becomes

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
how much heat is freed when this becomes

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.729 
how much heat is freed when this becomes
aqueous<00:00:46.350> or<00:00:46.920> dissolves<00:00:47.789> inside<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> water

now<00:00:49.739> heat<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.610> solution<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.329> Delta<00:00:51.960> H<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.530> also

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
now heat of solution or Delta H is also

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
now heat of solution or Delta H is also
called<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> heat<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.969> dissolution<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.989> also

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
called the heat of dissolution it's also

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.770 
called the heat of dissolution it's also
called<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> heat<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.980> dissolving<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.789> maybe

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
called the heat of dissolving and maybe

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.450 
called the heat of dissolving and maybe
your<00:00:57.960> teacher<00:00:58.170> used<00:00:58.500> some<00:00:58.770> other<00:00:58.920> word<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
your teacher used some other word for it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670 
your teacher used some other word for it
but<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.510> want<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> show<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> how<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> calculate

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
but I want to show you how to calculate

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.270 
but I want to show you how to calculate
it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

it
long<00:01:02.940> story<00:01:03.270> short<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:04.019> need<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.589> how

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
long story short you need to know how

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.910 
long story short you need to know how
much<00:01:05.369> heat<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.390> liberated<00:01:07.170> when<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
much heat was liberated when it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.090 
much heat was liberated when it
dissolved<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.990> using<00:01:10.470> M<00:01:10.799> Delta

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
dissolved you can do that using M Delta

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.420 
dissolved you can do that using M Delta

capacity<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:16.100> Delta<00:01:17.100> H<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.820> simply<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
capacity and Delta H is simply the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.050 
capacity and Delta H is simply the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
amount of heat that was released but

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.050 
amount of heat that was released but
usually<00:01:21.479> per<00:01:21.869> mole<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.880> solution<00:01:23.880> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
usually per mole of the solution so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.039 
usually per mole of the solution so
we're<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> need<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.570> convert<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
we're going to need to convert that to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.320 
we're going to need to convert that to
moles<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.590> some<00:01:25.770> point<00:01:26.040> let's<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.119> ahead

have recorded that let's just assume
it's<00:03:10.370> 110<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:12.500> it's<00:03:12.799> grams<00:03:13.130> per<00:03:13.430> mole<00:03:14.079> so<00:03:15.079> five

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
it's 110 and it's grams per mole so five

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.090 
it's 110 and it's grams per mole so five

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
all right this is where we enter the

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
final stage because to calculate Delta H

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.520 
final stage because to calculate Delta H
all<00:03:38.129> we<00:03:38.340> need<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.909> the<00:03:39.540> amount<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.959> heat<00:03:40.230> that

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
all we need is the amount of heat that

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.059 
all we need is the amount of heat that
was<00:03:41.250> released<00:03:43.969> 3661<00:03:44.969> joules<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.920> only

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
was released 3661 joules and it only

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.229 
was released 3661 joules and it only
took<00:03:47.340> point<00:03:47.730> for<00:03:48.150> five<00:03:48.540> moles<00:03:49.139> of<00:03:49.730> solid<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:51.090> do

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
took point for five moles of solid to do

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.280 
took point for five moles of solid to do
that<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:52.650> let's<00:03:52.889> try<00:03:53.129> this<00:03:53.299> let's<00:03:54.299> try<00:03:54.420> three

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
that so let's try this let's try three

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.459 
that so let's try this let's try three
six<00:03:55.680> six<00:03:55.920> one<00:03:56.069> divided<00:03:56.969> by<00:03:57.209> point<00:03:57.480> zero<00:03:57.689> four

six six one divided by point zero four
five<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:59.629> get<00:04:02.000> eighty<00:04:03.000> one<00:04:03.389> thousand<00:04:04.079> three

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500

hundred and fifty-six joules per mole
cool<00:04:09.510> that's<00:04:10.139> how<00:04:10.349> much<00:04:10.500> heat<00:04:10.739> was<00:04:11.010> released

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
cool that's how much heat was released

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.420 
cool that's how much heat was released
during<00:04:12.329> this<00:04:12.419> process<00:04:12.900> one<00:04:13.829> thing<00:04:14.099> I<00:04:14.159> want<00:04:14.340> to

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
during this process one thing I want to

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.569 
during this process one thing I want to
point<00:04:14.609> in<00:04:14.790> heat<00:04:15.299> was<00:04:15.599> released<00:04:16.500> when<00:04:17.340> this

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
point in heat was released when this

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.909 
point in heat was released when this
happened<00:04:18.030> which<00:04:18.599> makes<00:04:18.900> an<00:04:19.109> exothermic

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
happened which makes an exothermic

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.700 
happened which makes an exothermic
reaction<00:04:20.639> so<00:04:21.389> I'm<00:04:22.049> going<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.229> put<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.410> negative

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
reaction so I'm going to put a negative

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.100 
reaction so I'm going to put a negative
there<00:04:22.979> because<00:04:23.430> negative<00:04:23.729> Delta<00:04:24.389> HS<00:04:24.840> are

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
there because negative Delta HS are

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.210 
there because negative Delta HS are
exothermic<00:04:25.830> reactions<00:04:27.199> now<00:04:28.199> I'm<00:04:28.919> going<00:04:29.160> to

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
exothermic reactions now I'm going to

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.939 
exothermic reactions now I'm going to
just<00:04:29.639> convert<00:04:30.000> this<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.990> negative<00:04:31.380> eighty<00:04:31.650> one

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
just convert this to negative eighty one

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.810 
just convert this to negative eighty one

and<00:04:40.830> what<00:04:40.979> I<00:04:41.010> want<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.310> point<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.090> is

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
and what I want to point it to you is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.320 
and what I want to point it to you is
that<00:04:42.949> here's<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.159> website<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.610> stole<00:04:45.120> that

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
that here's the website I stole that

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.899 
that here's the website I stole that
number<00:04:45.659> off<00:04:45.780> of<00:04:46.010> calcium<00:04:47.010> chloride<00:04:47.220> and

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
number off of calcium chloride and

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.930 
number off of calcium chloride and
hydrous<00:04:48.860> negative<00:04:49.860> eighty<00:04:50.099> one<00:04:50.430> point<00:04:50.729> three

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
hydrous negative eighty one point three

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.300 
hydrous negative eighty one point three
kilojoules<00:04:51.599> per<00:04:51.720> mole<00:04:52.020> yeah<00:04:52.590> we<00:04:53.070> were<00:04:53.159> pretty

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
kilojoules per mole yeah we were pretty

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.430 
kilojoules per mole yeah we were pretty
close<00:04:53.669> so<00:04:55.759> the<00:04:56.759> answer<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.240> your<00:04:57.389> question<00:04:57.960> how

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
close so the answer to your question how

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.550 
close so the answer to your question how
do<00:04:58.500> I<00:04:58.650> figure<00:04:58.889> out<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.940> Delta<00:05:00.419> H<00:05:00.659> of<00:05:00.690> solution

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
do I figure out the Delta H of solution

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.649 
do I figure out the Delta H of solution
when<00:05:01.979> I'm<00:05:02.099> dissolving<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.669> solid<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.210> water<00:05:03.389> is

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
when I'm dissolving a solid and water is

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.409 
when I'm dissolving a solid and water is
use<00:05:04.349> Q<00:05:04.680> equals<00:05:04.919> M<00:05:05.070> Delta<00:05:05.430> TC<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.940> get<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.210> heat

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
use Q equals M Delta TC to get the heat

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.659 
use Q equals M Delta TC to get the heat
divide<00:05:07.349> that<00:05:07.530> by<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.740> number<00:05:07.889> of<00:05:08.130> moles<00:05:08.370> of

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
divide that by the number of moles of

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.029 
divide that by the number of moles of
stuff<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.120> have<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.659> for<00:05:09.690> good<00:05:10.620> measure

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
stuff you have and for good measure

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.260 
stuff you have and for good measure
put<00:05:11.909> it<00:05:11.970> in<00:05:12.060> kilojoules<00:05:12.570> per<00:05:12.690> mole<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:14.270> make

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
put it in kilojoules per mole and make

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.810 
put it in kilojoules per mole and make
sure<00:05:15.599> it's<00:05:15.900> negative<00:05:16.620> if<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.220> water<00:05:17.580> got

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
sure it's negative if the water got

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.330 
sure it's negative if the water got
warmer<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.620> positive<00:05:19.620> if<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.949> water<00:05:20.130> got

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
warmer and positive if the water got

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.370 
warmer and positive if the water got
colder<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:21.270> controls<00:05:21.780> for<00:05:22.020> whether<00:05:22.199> it's

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
colder that controls for whether it's

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.370 
colder that controls for whether it's
endothermic<00:05:23.009> or<00:05:23.099> exothermic<00:05:23.419> boom<00:05:24.419> best<00:05:25.199> of

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
endothermic or exothermic boom best of

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.590 
endothermic or exothermic boom best of
luck
