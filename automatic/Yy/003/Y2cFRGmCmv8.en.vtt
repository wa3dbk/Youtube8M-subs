unpleasant end game which is still equal

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.340

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
but not as pleasant for me to play I had

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.980 
but not as pleasant for me to play I had
very<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:16.830> sense<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> danger<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.700> let<00:01:18.600> my

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
very little sense of danger I let my

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.359 
very little sense of danger I let my
opponent<00:01:19.350> skinny<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.950> should<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.280> just

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
opponent skinny and I should have just

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.780 
opponent skinny and I should have just
played<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.850> move<00:01:21.090> h5<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:22.549> probably<00:01:23.549> should

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
played this move h5 then probably should

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.630 
played this move h5 then probably should
be<00:01:23.939> able<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.479> make<00:01:24.630> add<00:01:24.780> robot<00:01:25.200> after<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.130> let

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
be able to make add robot after I let

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.330 
the kingdom's
I<00:01:28.480> think<00:01:29.480> Molnar<00:01:30.290> Mackenzie<00:01:30.770> has<00:01:30.950> improved

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340

I think Molnar Mackenzie has improved
tremendously<00:01:31.520> not<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.480> areas<00:01:32.890> his<00:01:33.890> black

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
tremendously not of areas his black

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.160 
tremendously not of areas his black

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170

it was such a tough game I was I was

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.190 
it was such a tough game I was I was
like<00:01:58.970> probably<00:01:59.180> losing<00:01:59.510> out<00:01:59.720> of<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.840> opening

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
like probably losing out of the opening

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.030 
like probably losing out of the opening
or<00:02:00.440> very<00:02:00.980> very<00:02:01.490> worse<00:02:01.670> then<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:03.110> i<00:02:03.620> managed<00:02:03.980> to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
or very very worse then I i managed to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.290 
or very very worse then I i managed to
defend<00:02:04.310> really<00:02:04.520> well<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.670> had<00:02:04.880> all<00:02:05.000> my<00:02:05.030> pieces

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
defend really well I had all my pieces

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.930 
defend really well I had all my pieces
on<00:02:05.480> the<00:02:05.540> back<00:02:05.690> ranks<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.040> was<00:02:07.460> very<00:02:07.490> ugly

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
on the back ranks so it was very ugly

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.040 
on the back ranks so it was very ugly
but<00:02:08.090> then<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.240> turned<00:02:08.480> around<00:02:08.570> and<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.899> was

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
but then I turned around and I was

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.990 
but then I turned around and I was
pushing<00:02:09.260> for<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.530> win<00:02:09.740> but<00:02:09.980> eventually<00:02:10.760> was

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
pushing for a win but eventually was

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.120 
pushing for a win but eventually was
just<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.210> drawing<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.960> was<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.440> very<00:02:12.500> good<00:02:12.800> game<00:02:12.980> I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
just a drawing it was a very good game I

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.590 
just a drawing it was a very good game I
definitely<00:02:13.430> thought<00:02:13.850> about<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.360> US

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
definitely thought about the US

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.830 
definitely thought about the US
Championship<00:02:15.080> ticket<00:02:15.670> when<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.700> came<00:02:16.850> here<00:02:17.150> but

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
Championship ticket when I came here but

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.970 
Championship ticket when I came here but
at<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:17.990> same<00:02:18.200> time<00:02:18.410> when<00:02:18.590> you're<00:02:18.710> playing<00:02:18.860> a

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
at the same time when you're playing a

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.110 
at the same time when you're playing a
tournament<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.460> can't<00:02:19.670> really<00:02:19.820> have<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.030> in

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
tournament you can't really have that in

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
tournament you can't really have that in
the<00:02:20.210> back<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:20.360> your<00:02:20.570> mind<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.840> doesn't<00:02:20.990> make

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
the back of your mind it doesn't make

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.410 
the back of your mind it doesn't make
for<00:02:21.320> good<00:02:21.440> chess<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.220> knew<00:02:22.850> about<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.270> I

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
for good chess so I knew about it I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.880 
for good chess so I knew about it I
signed<00:02:23.810> up<00:02:23.930> for<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.140> tournament<00:02:24.170> partially

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
signed up for the tournament partially

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.140 
signed up for the tournament partially
because<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.520> then<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.700> forgot<00:02:25.970> about

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
because of that and then I forgot about

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.400 
because of that and then I forgot about
it<00:02:26.210> I've<00:02:26.420> watch<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.720> US<00:02:26.900> Championship<00:02:27.290> this

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
it I've watch the US Championship this

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.050 
it I've watch the US Championship this
last<00:02:27.620> year<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.340> was<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.610> really<00:02:28.790> strong

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
last year and it was a really strong

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.460

have<00:02:32.180> been<00:02:32.360> one<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> those<00:02:32.720> guys<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:34.010> I

have been one of those guys and I and I

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.010 
have been one of those guys and I and I
wanted<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.670> qualify<00:02:35.390> this<00:02:35.450> year<00:02:35.750> at<00:02:35.840> that's
