 including not only in the 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.820

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.520
 also in the menus since we are in 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.920
 the neighborhood quite varied but 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.500
 essentially focused on burger 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.760
 quality burgers of all sizes and 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.760
