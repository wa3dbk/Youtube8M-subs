00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.560
 as an obvious player who scored the goal 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.750
 it meant the championship for cougars in the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.750

 first that peace and love between 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.620
 america and pumas can happen and also 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:21.500
 that college-goers do not 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.479
 They know a lot about your team but look at me 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.419
 I'm here to make an emissary of the 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:29.659
