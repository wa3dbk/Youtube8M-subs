00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello to all you guys do today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.250
 see the unpacking of two orders 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.650
 which I have recently performed one from 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.070
 glamor cosmetics and the other from bio 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.780
 essence the first I show you 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.940
 and the cosmetic glamor order this 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.119
 site from which I have already purchased that has the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.330
 written just with the hearts is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.160
 really nice is a site from which I order 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.070
 really lots of products because 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.219
 they are of excellent quality and then even though 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.430
 some raw materials cost more than 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.690
 other sites such as vernile alla 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.149
 end I find myself better because the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.969
 shipping is very fast and then also the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.390
 site is very efficient as well as to the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.969
 packaging that I really like a lot 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.920
 that's really very nice then 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.460
 that I took from clamor cosmetics is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.500
 first the 3 flop and I took the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.020
 beauty of 200 grams 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.420
 because I have to make a beautiful recipe 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.730
 that you will soon see the drive 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.799
 I think by now you know a little 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.299
 all of you really can't live 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.670
 without then ordered the powder to make 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.920
 aloe vera gel and I took ten 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.530
 grams then I will leave you a link that 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.080
 you will find in the information box where there is 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.630
 I refer to the blog post to see how 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.330
 make the gel de olivera using the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.810
 powder then how to do it at home then 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.840
 ordered sodium hyaluronate and this is 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.180
 a truly magical powder through 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.970
 which creates hyaluronic acid which 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.860
 use in my many formulations 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.470
 still I have never tried that of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.049
 glamor cosmetics so we'll see how I do it 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.420
 I will find then I also got caffeine 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.820
 which I will use to make all my own 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.829
 anti-cellulite products including cream 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.290
 which I have already done together with you 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.899
 which I really find myself as god indeed 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.520
 he took another 50 grams because of it 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.409
 to do it all summer long 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.750
 then I always took it for the cream 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.820
 anti-cellulite two extracts the extract 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.399
 ivy glycolic and narrow 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.750
 centella glycolic I took these 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.509
 because the site had exclusively 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.459
 these though even if they are not echo 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.280
 organic because they are extracted 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.620
 inside of 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.040
 how can you read about propylene glycol 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.890
 it is written here and they are really strong 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.480
 because the extraction is greater then me 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.310
 I prefer them inside the clan 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.900
 because they must also be functional 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 obviously also the other types of 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.489
 fluid extract extracts it was me 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.380
 bridge is reborn will work fine 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.270
 but apart from the fact that it is found 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.010
 these I preferred to take them 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.870
 because I found myself really well 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.480
 with those I had already taken from 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.760
 camelis then I also took the elastin 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.709
 hydrolyzate which is an ingredient that does not 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.510
 I had never bought ed before 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.760
 I was curious to use then 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.950
 you can imagine these two 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.370
 ingredients in the future will go 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.400
 together in some recipe and then I have 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.670
 got my favorite products from the site 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.860
 that is the fragrances I love fragrances 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.959
 of glamor cosmetics I have tried 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.120
 really much and from many sites but 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.739
 no fragrance whatsoever 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.870
 fragrances to be matched the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.600
 quality of those of glamor cosmetics 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.989
 I really love them and got into 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.510
 especially the jasmine fragrance that 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.820
 I will use together with the fragrance a 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.610
 coconut these two fragrances 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.920
 apart from that they are of the highest quality 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.799
 indeed the gesture seems to me to be true and 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.799
 seems to breathe the scent of 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.280
 jasmine of your garden and together 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.420
 with coconut they smell very 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.100
 detail that recalls the products 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.290
 I will use solar in one 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.630
 recipe that I will shortly for the hair 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.150
 a product for coconut hair and 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.519
 jasmine another interesting thing of the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.459
 site is that they provide within the 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.930
 also the technical data sheet of the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.150
 product for example this and that 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.030
 of coconut fragrance and says how 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.280
 use it how to use it inside 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.410
 of the various formulations for example says 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.290
 the percentage to put inside 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.900
 creams inside the shampoos 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.540
 etc. and also remembers what are the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.459
 ingredients and fragrances as real to me 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.650
 arrived also for example for the three flo 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.289
 which I already had for the ivy extract 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.120
 for caffeine and so on 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.240
 the next order I show you 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.970
 that arrived to me is that of bio s se 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.360
 this new Italian site 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.890
 really cute that I didn't know 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.620
 so this is the first order that i 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.660
 effect their language of andy I must say 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.000
 first look I look good though 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.100
 now I have to try the packaging 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.020
 still it is not the best but I have 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.730
 reassured that I am still at the beginning 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.250
 so they are undertaking this 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.530
 activities and many others must arrive 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.380
 therefore also packs labels 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.140
 I think that soon it will still be 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.770
 improved what you ordered from this 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.960
 site is above all linseed oil which 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.750
 I will use together with the fragrances of 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.070
 first and to other oils to create a 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.870
 hair product 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.750
 I had never even taken an oil from 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.240
 linen so this is the first time then 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.920
 I took the nut dance oil that 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.600
 I will use together with the ritual oil of 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.640
 carrot we made together with the 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.950
 recipe if you want I leave the link in the 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.200
 Information box if you want to do it for 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.390
 make an oil for the sea 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.040
 then I also took cocoa oil 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.200
 always an oil that I never had 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.540
 ordered first is that it is very much 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.970
 heavy is known for its 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.320
 moisturizing characteristics and I do not see 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.750
 time to use it because already only a 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.850
 looking at it seems really good to me then 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.500
 I also took the nettle strait that 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.390
 I will need it to make another product 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.210
 for the hair then as you will see there 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:46.470
 will be many tutorials that will have to 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.750
 then carry out express instead not 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.520
 they had the extract as glamor cosmetics 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.910
 of focus always for the cream 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.979
 anti-cellulite and then I took the oil of 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.840
 musk rose that I had finished and that 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.510
 wanted to use for a mask that 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.120
 I will show you for the face also I have 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.100
 also taken yellow and red oxide do blue 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.040
 what I need to do my quantities 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.010
 foundation products in consumption 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.479
 really tons and then finally I have 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.610
 got the carre genina which is a 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.830
 thickener that I will always need for 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.690
 making another recipe for now is everything 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.500
 secret then I will reveal to you 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:26.160
 my recipes the potassium cloud you need 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.169
 to make the deodorant and finally I got it 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.240
 for the happiness of many of you the olive 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.220
 in a thousand this is a 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.470
 if nun you that works alone then 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.900
 together we will deepen the topic of 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.870
 emulsifiers ie it does not need to coem 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.319
 burns and will serve to make a beautiful one 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.509
 cronin a that I will show you soon 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.000
 very nice thing about this site and I think 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.860
 is the only one to be like this is that it sells 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.750
 the ingredients in very small quantities 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.020
 there were even ingredients that 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.729
 they started at 70 cents and 50 cents 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.410
 because they really sold a few grams 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.150
 of that ingredient 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.069
 so if maybe you need to do a first one 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.139
 order could be a site where there is 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.340
 it is worthwhile to buy because so avoided by 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.009
 going to spend a sea of ​​money 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.990
 so it could really help one 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:12.090
 something like that and then they were 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.650
 really very kind because I had 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.659
 had a problem i actually didn't 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.569
 I wanted to do this order though 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:20.669
 wrong clicked on the button 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:22.289
 order confirmation and then 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.330
 they even called me back 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.830
 I thank them so much by phone 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.259
 gen gen tv states i hope that 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.770
 keep it up and no guys this 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:30.599

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.030
 so he showed a little bit 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:35.699

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.560
 lots of tutorials that I will show you 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:40.050

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.800
