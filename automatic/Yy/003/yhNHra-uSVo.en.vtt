image up and we want to divide the image
dimensions<00:01:32.520> by<00:01:33.060> 2<00:01:34.430> in<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:37.380> case<00:01:37.619> we'll<00:01:37.860> make

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
dimensions by 2 in this case we'll make

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.730 
dimensions by 2 in this case we'll make
the<00:01:38.100> width<00:01:38.280> 320<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.990> will<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:40.350> 3<00:01:40.590> 20

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the width 320 this will take about 3 20

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.039 
the width 320 this will take about 3 20
and<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.909> shall<00:01:42.090> automatically<00:01:42.600> adjust<00:01:42.930> our

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and it shall automatically adjust our

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
and it shall automatically adjust our
height<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> smaller<00:01:44.490> version<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
height so in the smaller version of the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.660 
height so in the smaller version of the
image<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.780> dimensions<00:01:46.290> will<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.470> 320<00:01:46.860> x<00:01:47.220> 480

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
image the dimensions will be 320 x 480

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.660 
image the dimensions will be 320 x 480
again<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.409> landscape<00:01:49.890> image<00:01:50.159> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
again if it's a landscape image you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.999 
again if it's a landscape image you
simply<00:01:50.970> reverse<00:01:51.360> dimensions<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.710> isn't

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
simply reverse dimensions this isn't

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.289 
simply reverse dimensions this isn't
only<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.369> images<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.880> fill<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
only for images that fill up the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060 
only for images that fill up the
iphone's<00:01:54.659> entire<00:01:55.140> screen<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.920> for

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
iphone's entire screen this can be for

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.740 
iphone's entire screen this can be for
anything<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.149> an<00:01:57.240> image<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.540> is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
anything if you have an image that is

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.649 
anything if you have an image that is
100<00:01:58.229> by<00:01:58.350> 100<00:01:58.469> pixels<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.670> want<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.479> be

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
100 by 100 pixels you want that to be

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.810 
100 by 100 pixels you want that to be
the<00:02:01.020> larger<00:02:01.409> version<00:02:01.520> then<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> want<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the larger version then you want a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
the larger version then you want a
second<00:02:03.149> version<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.780> would<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:04.020> divided

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
second version that would be divided

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
second version that would be divided
into<00:02:04.680> two<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.490> want<00:02:05.820> an<00:02:05.909> inversion<00:02:06.149> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
into two so you want an inversion that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.040 
into two so you want an inversion that
would<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.600> 50<00:02:06.960> by<00:02:07.229> 50<00:02:07.290> pixels<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.810> we'll<00:02:09.929> go

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
would be 50 by 50 pixels so we'll go

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
would be 50 by 50 pixels so we'll go
ahead<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.289> click<00:02:10.500> OK<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.830> resize<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.489> image

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
ahead and click OK to resize the image

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.800 
ahead and click OK to resize the image
and<00:02:12.470> we'll<00:02:13.470> save<00:02:13.709> it

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and we'll save it

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.059 
and we'll save it
next<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:15.930> want<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.140> rename<00:02:16.469> our<00:02:16.709> smaller

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
next we want to rename our smaller

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.530 
next we want to rename our smaller
version<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.579> image<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.329> want<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
version of the image and we just want to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.479 
version of the image and we just want to
get<00:02:18.659> rid<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> 2x<00:02:19.319> at<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> end<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.129> xcode

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
get rid of the 2x at the end so xcode

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.660 
get rid of the 2x at the end so xcode
knows<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> smaller<00:02:21.510> version<00:02:22.549> so<00:02:23.549> we

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
knows this is a smaller version so we

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.459 
knows this is a smaller version so we
simply<00:02:24.000> import<00:02:24.329> both<00:02:24.569> versions<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.200> image

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
simply import both versions of the image

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.970 
simply import both versions of the image
just<00:02:25.739> like<00:02:25.950> before<00:02:27.290> we'll<00:02:28.290> select<00:02:28.560> both<00:02:28.739> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
just like before we'll select both the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.339 
just like before we'll select both the
images<00:02:29.370> drag<00:02:30.329> them<00:02:30.569> into<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.930> supporting

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
images drag them into the supporting

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.979 
images drag them into the supporting
files<00:02:31.560> folder<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.939> we'll<00:02:33.090> check<00:02:33.299> off<00:02:33.480> copy

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
files folder and we'll check off copy

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.170 
files folder and we'll check off copy
items<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.530> destination<00:02:35.069> groups<00:02:35.250> folder<00:02:35.489> click

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
items to destination groups folder click

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.050 
items to destination groups folder click
on<00:02:36.390> finish<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.989> we're<00:02:37.590> done<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:38.939> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
on finish and we're done so that's a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.429 
on finish and we're done so that's a
little<00:02:39.150> bit<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> basics<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:39.989> importing

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
little bit of the basics and importing

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.440 
little bit of the basics and importing
files<00:02:40.590> into<00:02:40.920> your<00:02:41.069> Xcode<00:02:41.370> project<00:02:41.400> thank<00:02:42.359> you
