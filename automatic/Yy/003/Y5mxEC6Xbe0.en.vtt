00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
is for but this is the iphone 4 case and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.999 
is for but this is the iphone 4 case and
it<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.060> pretty<00:01:51.569> cool<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.959> my<00:01:51.990> opinion<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
it is pretty cool in my opinion as a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.309 
it is pretty cool in my opinion as a
case<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.520> works<00:01:53.670> very<00:01:53.880> well<00:01:53.999> i'll<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:55.079> into

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
case it works very well i'll get into

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.160 
case it works very well i'll get into
these<00:01:55.409> things<00:01:55.469> in<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.889> moment<00:01:56.840> first<00:01:57.840> i'll<00:01:58.020> just

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
these things in a moment first i'll just

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.480 
these things in a moment first i'll just
show<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.289> these<00:01:58.469> rubber<00:01:58.740> bands<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.130> quick

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
show you these rubber bands really quick

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.209 
show you these rubber bands really quick
so<00:02:00.149> when<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> close<00:02:00.929> this<00:02:01.259> flip<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.770> portion

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
so when you close this flip out portion

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.809 
so when you close this flip out portion
of<00:02:02.429> the<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.999> the<00:02:03.240> case<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.779> you<00:02:04.170> close<00:02:04.499> it<00:02:04.819> it

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
of the of the case and you close it it

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.029 
of the of the case and you close it it
can<00:02:06.029> make<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.479> good<00:02:07.020> bit<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.200> noise<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.740> if

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
can make a good bit of noise and if

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.320 
can make a good bit of noise and if
you'd<00:02:08.159> like<00:02:08.189> to<00:02:08.310> reduce<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.909> amount<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.209> noise

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
you'd like to reduce the amount of noise

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.699 
you'd like to reduce the amount of noise
you<00:02:09.539> could<00:02:09.659> just<00:02:09.750> put<00:02:09.899> those<00:02:10.049> rubber<00:02:10.289> bands

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you could just put those rubber bands

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.010 
you could just put those rubber bands
over<00:02:11.180> here

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
over here

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.300 
over here
then<00:02:13.140> when<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.380> close<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.950> doesn't<00:02:14.100> make

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
then when you close it it doesn't make

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.630 
then when you close it it doesn't make
as<00:02:14.430> much<00:02:14.550> noise<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.460> nice

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
as much noise but you know it's nice

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.520 
as much noise but you know it's nice
that<00:02:17.700> they<00:02:17.940> included<00:02:18.300> these<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.170> anyway<00:02:19.440> I'm

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530

a big cut out for the camera and the LED

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.170 
a big cut out for the camera and the LED
flash<00:04:43.250> then<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:44.340> have<00:04:44.460> these<00:04:44.580> portions<00:04:44.909> at

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
flash then you have these portions at

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.520 
flash then you have these portions at
the<00:04:45.210> back<00:04:45.509> of<00:04:45.539> the<00:04:45.689> case<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.169> are<00:04:46.289> cut<00:04:46.500> out

the back of the case that are cut out

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.490 
the back of the case that are cut out
and<00:04:46.889> this<00:04:47.610> basically<00:04:47.789> helps<00:04:48.360> reduce<00:04:49.289> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
and this basically helps reduce the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.040 
and this basically helps reduce the
weight<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:49.949> case<00:04:50.159> and<00:04:50.539> it<00:04:51.539> also<00:04:51.659> gives<00:04:51.780> it

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
weight of the case and it also gives it

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.230 
weight of the case and it also gives it
a<00:04:52.110> pretty<00:04:52.259> cool<00:04:52.469> design<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.219> I<00:04:53.849> mean<00:04:54.030> if<00:04:54.150> you

anything like that the home button
cutout<00:05:31.889> is<00:05:32.039> perfect<00:05:32.460> it's<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.669> little<00:05:32.879> bit

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
cutout is perfect it's a little bit

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.149 
cutout is perfect it's a little bit
larger<00:05:33.300> than<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.479> actual<00:05:34.199> home<00:05:34.740> button<00:05:35.009> which

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
larger than the actual home button which

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.769 
larger than the actual home button which
is<00:05:35.279> good<00:05:35.490> so<00:05:35.729> you<00:05:35.819> could<00:05:35.940> easily<00:05:36.360> get<00:05:36.479> into

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
is good so you could easily get into

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.740 
is good so you could easily get into
without<00:05:36.960> having<00:05:37.349> to<00:05:37.879> you<00:05:38.879> know<00:05:38.909> shove<00:05:39.599> your

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.029 
whole finger finger into the hole right

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:46.100 
whole finger finger into the hole right
there<00:05:42.089> so<00:05:43.669> so<00:05:44.669> this<00:05:44.819> case<00:05:45.089> does<00:05:45.419> retail<00:05:45.900> from
