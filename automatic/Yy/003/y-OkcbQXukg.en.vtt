course sometimes I'll just stop and talk
about<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.910> mods<00:03:07.150> because<00:03:07.750> really<00:03:08.739> that's

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
about the mods because really that's

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.870 
about the mods because really that's
what<00:03:09.340> I'm<00:03:09.519> actually<00:03:09.850> aiming<00:03:10.000> for<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:12.549> I'm
