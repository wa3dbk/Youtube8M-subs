 Hi, this will be a short review for the new Chanel Les Beiges Powder. 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.880
 Chanel has released this powder recently with a £ 38 price (about £ 10), which is quite a lot. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.840
 Name is: Chanel Les Beiges, Healthy Glow Sheer Powder with SPF 15 (Sun Protection) 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.880
 The powder content is 12 grams, which is a lot of powder. 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:53.760
 The package includes a black bag and the package is beige. 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:06.240
 Beautiful packaging, looks luxurious, includes a large mirror, natural fiber brush and black protection between brush and powder. 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.480
 The collection contains 5 shades of color and the one I have is number 10, which is the brightest. 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 I'm very glad I bought it. High price of powder is also high. 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 Compared to Lancome Color Ideal Poudre, Chanel has 12grams, Lancome contains 9 grams (with £ 27 price) 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.200
 It is very handy to travel, because it already contains a large mirror and a brush. 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:22.200
 Powder is very pigmented on the skin and notice the color. It reflects light in the sun because it contains small glittering particles. 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:35.720
 With a mild gloss, the powder creates a healthy-looking skin on the face that glows. 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.720
 You can use it alone, but I would only recommend it to people with very good skin because the powder is not very covering. 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.000
 Another option to use with makeup. It is best to apply with a kabuki brush. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Chanel directly sells a white Kabuki brush for 33 pounds, but you just need something at home. 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:28.440
 It is better for separate use if you do not have any pimples on your face because it will not cover you. 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:46.440
 As it is written on the packaging, the powder really leaves the skin radiant. 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.200
 In summary, I am very happy to have bought Les Beiges because it is a very good product. 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:10.360
