what's up everybody as promised earlier
that<00:00:03.419> we<00:00:03.540> would<00:00:03.720> be<00:00:03.810> coming<00:00:04.020> back<00:00:04.259> with

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
that we would be coming back with

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.289 
that we would be coming back with
another<00:00:04.799> tutorial<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:05.910> time<00:00:06.120> we're

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
another tutorial and this time we're

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.179 
another tutorial and this time we're
gonna<00:00:06.359> be<00:00:06.480> helping<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.379> guys<00:00:07.470> out<00:00:07.740> on<00:00:07.799> how<00:00:08.130> to

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
gonna be helping you guys out on how to

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.030 
gonna be helping you guys out on how to
enable<00:00:08.510> GeForce<00:00:09.510> shadowplay<00:00:10.170> on<00:00:10.469> your<00:00:10.590> laptop

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
enable GeForce shadowplay on your laptop

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.629 
enable GeForce shadowplay on your laptop
the<00:00:11.280> graphics<00:00:11.730> cards<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.860> I'm<00:00:13.950> using<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.280> laptop

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the graphics cards so I'm using a laptop

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.010 
the graphics cards so I'm using a laptop
right<00:00:14.790> here<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.299> I'm<00:00:15.360> pretty<00:00:15.540> sure<00:00:15.630> many<00:00:15.870> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
right here and I'm pretty sure many of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.650 
right here and I'm pretty sure many of
us<00:00:16.139> are<00:00:16.440> also<00:00:16.770> using<00:00:17.070> laptops<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.240> Nvidia

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
us are also using laptops with Nvidia

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.870 
us are also using laptops with Nvidia
graphic<00:00:19.260> cards<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.770> these<00:00:20.250> graphic<00:00:20.640> cards

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
graphic cards and these graphic cards

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.849 
graphic cards and these graphic cards
need<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.180> something<00:00:21.660> higher<00:00:21.840> than<00:00:21.869> 600

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
need to be something higher than 600

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.000 
need to be something higher than 600
series<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.850> 600<00:00:24.300> series<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.439> 600<00:00:25.859> series

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
series so 600 series or up so 600 series

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.279 
series so 600 series or up so 600 series
or<00:00:26.340> $7<00:00:26.789> series<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.240> would<00:00:27.330> not<00:00:27.480> work<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.689> 500

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
or $7 series it would not work with 500

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.529 
or $7 series it would not work with 500
series<00:00:28.470> at<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.090> graphic<00:00:30.420> card

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
series at all because the graphic card

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.920 
series at all because the graphic card
does<00:00:30.750> not<00:00:30.779> support<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.910> as<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.239> GeForce

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
does not support that as this GeForce

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.959 
does not support that as this GeForce
shadowplay<00:00:34.350> would<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.649> using<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.489> graphics

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
shadowplay would be using the graphics

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.280 
shadowplay would be using the graphics
processing<00:00:36.809> unit<00:00:37.260> power<00:00:37.440> rather<00:00:38.160> than<00:00:38.250> CPU

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
processing unit power rather than CPU

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.819 
processing unit power rather than CPU
processing<00:00:40.290> unit<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> recording<00:00:42.870> in

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
processing unit to do the recording in

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.160 
processing unit to do the recording in
game<00:00:44.100> recording<00:00:44.579> off<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> footage<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
game recording off the footage so

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.260 
game recording off the footage so
therefore<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> needs<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> 600<00:00:47.640> series<00:00:47.850> or

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
therefore it needs to be a 600 series or

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.760 
therefore it needs to be a 600 series or
seven<00:00:48.570> or<00:00:48.719> series<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.230> those<00:00:49.410> graphic

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
seven or series because those graphic

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.650 
seven or series because those graphic
cards<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.190> made<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.879> capability<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
cards are made with this capability to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
cards are made with this capability to
be<00:00:51.750> able<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.020> run<00:00:52.320> GeForce<00:00:53.129> shadowplay

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
be able to run GeForce shadowplay

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.099 
be able to run GeForce shadowplay
now<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> reason<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.629> out<00:00:55.340> it's<00:00:56.340> not<00:00:56.550> out

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
now the reason it's not out it's not out

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.049

one<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.040> we<00:01:35.130> need<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.700> did

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
one is that what we need to do is we did
