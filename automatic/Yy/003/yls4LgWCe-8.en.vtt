tutorial in this video i'll be showing
you<00:00:05.430> how<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.640> make<00:00:05.850> realistic<00:00:06.299> renders<00:00:06.899> using

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
you how to make realistic renders using

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.520 
you how to make realistic renders using
the<00:00:07.529> default<00:00:08.220> render<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.849> blender<00:00:09.330> or

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
the default render and blender or

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.700 
the default render and blender or
improving<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.679> your<00:00:10.860> current<00:00:11.160> renders<00:00:12.710> here

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
improving on your current renders here

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.150 
improving on your current renders here
is<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.070> final<00:00:14.400> result<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.480> see<00:00:16.160> it's

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
is the final result as you can see it's

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.429 
is the final result as you can see it's
got<00:00:17.310> some<00:00:17.340> depth<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.820> field<00:00:18.060> some<00:00:18.869> glow

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
got some depth of field some glow

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.429 
got some depth of field some glow
effects<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.420> overall<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.689> looks<00:00:21.900> fairly

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
effects and overall it looks fairly

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.009 
effects and overall it looks fairly
realistic<00:00:23.029> obviously<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.510> still<00:00:24.750> tell

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
realistic obviously you can still tell

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.830 
realistic obviously you can still tell
it's<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.350> 3d<00:00:25.680> render<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.880> personally<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> think

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it's a 3d render but personally I think

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.860 
it's a 3d render but personally I think
it<00:00:28.109> looks<00:00:28.289> good<00:00:31.040> now<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.369> start<00:00:32.610> off<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:33.480> going

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it looks good now to start off I'm going

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.959 
it looks good now to start off I'm going
to<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:34.680> scene<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.579> show<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.820> what

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to go to my scene and just show you what

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.910 
to go to my scene and just show you what
the<00:00:36.329> layouts<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:36.870> I'm<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.890> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the layouts like I'm not going to do a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.639 
the layouts like I'm not going to do a
step-by-step<00:00:39.200> from<00:00:40.200> start<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.620> finish

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
step-by-step from start to finish

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.130 
step-by-step from start to finish
because<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.820> would<00:00:41.969> take<00:00:42.149> too<00:00:42.300> long<00:00:42.329> it's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
because that would take too long it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.139 
because that would take too long it's
going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.469> take<00:00:43.559> probably<00:00:44.219> five<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.000> ten

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
going to take probably five to ten

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.590 
going to take probably five to ten
minutes<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:47.120> basically<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> setup

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
minutes as it is basically the setup

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.560 
minutes as it is basically the setup
this<00:00:49.140> gun<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.739> these<00:00:50.070> bullets<00:00:50.399> both<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.449> those

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
this gun and these bullets both of those

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.619 
this gun and these bullets both of those
I<00:00:51.809> got<00:00:51.989> off<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.230> turbosquid<00:00:53.129> comm<00:00:53.730> including

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I got off of turbosquid comm including

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.750 
I got off of turbosquid comm including
the<00:00:54.719> textures<00:00:55.140> except<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> textures<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the textures except the textures on the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.580 
the textures except the textures on the
bullets<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.210> made<00:00:57.390> myself<00:00:57.570> while<00:00:58.230> there's<00:00:58.440> not

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
bullets I made myself while there's not

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.290 
bullets I made myself while there's not
really<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> texture<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> colors<00:01:02.300> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
really a texture but the colors the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
really a texture but the colors the
piece<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> wood<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.290> also<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.739> turbosquid

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
piece of wood is also from turbosquid

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.609 
piece of wood is also from turbosquid
make<00:01:05.790> sure<00:01:06.000> when<00:01:06.210> getting<00:01:06.479> textures<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.439> have

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
make sure when getting textures you have

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.950 
make sure when getting textures you have
them<00:01:07.770> high<00:01:07.950> resolution<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.600> show<00:01:09.840> up

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
them high resolution so they show up

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.780 
them high resolution so they show up
very<00:01:10.200> crisp<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.740> clear<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.189> renders<00:01:11.580> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
very crisp and clear in the renders that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.080 
very crisp and clear in the renders that
helps<00:01:12.119> add<00:01:12.299> into<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> realism<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:14.790> picture

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
helps add into the realism this picture

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.890 
helps add into the realism this picture
right<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.360> these<00:01:15.810> wooden<00:01:16.170> boards<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:18.119> was

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
right here these wooden boards it was

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.980 
right here these wooden boards it was
simply<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> diffuse<00:01:19.710> map<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.630> took<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> picture

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
simply a diffuse map I took this picture

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.429 
simply a diffuse map I took this picture
and<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:23.189> opened<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.640> crazy<00:01:24.030> bump<00:01:24.299> which<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and I opened up crazy bump which is a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
and I opened up crazy bump which is a
piece<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:25.979> software<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.759> turns<00:01:27.119> regular

you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.400> download<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.299> free<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
you can download it for free for the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.060 
you can download it for free for the
first<00:01:40.110> 30<00:01:40.380> days<00:01:41.240> sadly<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.360> only<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> trial

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
first 30 days sadly it's only a trial

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.370 
first 30 days sadly it's only a trial
the<00:01:44.070> full<00:01:44.430> retail<00:01:44.850> version<00:01:45.240> cost<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.659> $200

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the full retail version cost like $200

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.940 
the full retail version cost like $200
so<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.920> bit<00:01:47.310> pricey<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:49.350> really

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so it's a bit pricey it's really

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
so it's a bit pricey it's really
effective<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.060> you're<00:01:51.180> professional<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
effective and if you're professional it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.460 
effective and if you're professional it
might<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.619> worth<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.799> price<00:01:53.899> but<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.350> can

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
might be worth the price but as you can

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.190 
might be worth the price but as you can
see<00:01:55.530> normally<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.969> would<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.659> reflection

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
see normally this would the reflection

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.380 
see normally this would the reflection
on<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.469> would<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.860> plasticy<00:01:59.670> completely

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
on it would be like plasticy completely

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.020 
on it would be like plasticy completely
smooth<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.219> don't<00:02:02.219> know<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.640> tell<00:02:02.820> but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
smooth I don't know if you can tell but

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.520 
smooth I don't know if you can tell but
there<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> little<00:02:03.689> bit<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> bumps<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
there is a little bit of bumps and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.180 
there is a little bit of bumps and
grooves<00:02:04.880> where<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.060> wood<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.320> just

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
grooves where the wood is and it just

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.000 
grooves where the wood is and it just
gives<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.520> nice<00:02:08.819> realistic<00:02:09.239> look<00:02:09.890> also

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.000 

there's<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.580> SkyDome<00:02:14.330> here<00:02:14.709> some<00:02:15.709> call<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:15.920> a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
there's a SkyDome here some call it a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.300 
there's a SkyDome here some call it a
skybox<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:17.120> kind<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.840> dome<00:02:18.310> that's

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
skybox but this is kind of a dome that's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.710 
skybox but this is kind of a dome that's
something<00:02:19.640> else<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:20.090> want<00:02:20.269> I'll<00:02:20.420> put<00:02:20.599> an

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
something else you want I'll put an

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.360 
something else you want I'll put an
annotation<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.500> screen<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> tutorial

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
annotation on the screen to a tutorial

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.220 
annotation on the screen to a tutorial
how<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.760> make<00:02:23.000> one<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.239> these<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:23.569> will

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
how to make one of these it will

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.690 
how to make one of these it will
basically<00:02:24.440> give<00:02:24.920> your<00:02:25.040> reflections

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
basically give your reflections

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.080 
basically give your reflections
something<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.050> sky<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.620> reflect<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.940> it's

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
something in the sky to reflect so it's

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.780 
something in the sky to reflect so it's
not<00:02:29.209> just<00:02:29.269> one<00:02:29.780> pure<00:02:30.110> color<00:02:30.349> a<00:02:30.590> great<00:02:31.519> thing<00:02:31.700> to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
not just one pure color a great thing to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.140 
not just one pure color a great thing to
do<00:02:31.940> if<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.019> reflective<00:02:33.560> material

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
do if you have a reflective material

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.630 
do if you have a reflective material
like<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.330> bullet<00:02:35.690> casing<00:02:35.870> make<00:02:36.860> sure<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.430> go

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
like a bullet casing make sure you go

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.550 
like a bullet casing make sure you go
into<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.030> material<00:02:38.150> settings<00:02:38.810> click<00:02:39.440> on

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
into the material settings click on

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.699 
into the material settings click on
mirror<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.130> give<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.880> some<00:02:41.090> reflection

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
mirror and give it some reflection

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.850 
mirror and give it some reflection
because<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:43.790> looks<00:02:43.970> good<00:02:44.200> now<00:02:45.200> if<00:02:45.470> it's<00:02:45.650> kind

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
because it looks good now if it's kind

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.500 
because it looks good now if it's kind
of<00:02:45.890> like<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.069> brushed<00:02:46.430> metal<00:02:46.760> where<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
of like a brushed metal where the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.830 
of like a brushed metal where the
reflection<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:48.140> not<00:02:48.170> very<00:02:48.500> clear<00:02:49.569> lower<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
reflection is not very clear lower the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.710 
reflection is not very clear lower the
gloss<00:02:51.079> something<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.799> 0.8<00:02:52.670> or<00:02:53.390> more

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
gloss something like 0.8 or more

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.690 
gloss something like 0.8 or more
depending<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.230> how<00:02:54.440> much<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:55.190> want<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.579> be

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
depending on how much you want it to be

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.530 
depending on how much you want it to be
but<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.269> basically<00:02:56.480> blurs<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.200> reflection

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
but that basically blurs the reflection

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.870 
but that basically blurs the reflection
let's<00:02:59.540> say<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.780> material<00:03:00.200> was<00:03:00.500> glass<00:03:00.950> high

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
let's say the material was glass high

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.500 
let's say the material was glass high
quality<00:03:02.299> glass<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:03.319> reflection<00:03:04.299> would<00:03:05.299> be

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
quality glass the reflection would be

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.020 
quality glass the reflection would be
set<00:03:05.930> up<00:03:06.049> high<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.769> gloss<00:03:06.980> would<00:03:07.280> be<00:03:07.459> to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
set up high and the gloss would be to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.809 
set up high and the gloss would be to
one<00:03:08.239> which<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.720> no<00:03:09.140> gloss<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.739> make<00:03:10.459> sure<00:03:10.610> you

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
one which is no gloss and make sure you

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.880 
one which is no gloss and make sure you
also<00:03:10.970> increase<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.510> samples<00:03:11.900> it's<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.530> default

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
also increase the samples it's a default

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.400 
also increase the samples it's a default
at<00:03:13.130> 18<00:03:13.519> samples<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.390> looks<00:03:14.630> really<00:03:14.900> grainy<00:03:15.200> at

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
at 18 samples it looks really grainy at

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.870 
at 18 samples it looks really grainy at
that<00:03:15.560> point<00:03:15.799> so<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.040> want<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.340> push<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.610> up<00:03:16.670> to

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
that point so you want to push it up to

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.479 
that point so you want to push it up to
64<00:03:17.720> anywhere<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.920> 512<00:03:19.489> samples<00:03:21.340> that's<00:03:22.340> a

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
64 anywhere to 512 samples that's a

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.970 
64 anywhere to 512 samples that's a
really<00:03:22.940> intensive<00:03:23.930> thing<00:03:24.139> for<00:03:24.350> rendering<00:03:24.620> so

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
really intensive thing for rendering so

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.849 
really intensive thing for rendering so
it<00:03:25.280> really<00:03:25.609> increased<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.120> render<00:03:26.359> times<00:03:26.859> so

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
it really increased the render times so

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.870 
it really increased the render times so
if<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.190> can<00:03:28.489> avoid<00:03:28.760> doing<00:03:29.720> gloss<00:03:30.880> next

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
if you can avoid doing gloss next

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.910 
if you can avoid doing gloss next
ambient<00:03:32.569> occlusion<00:03:32.750> I've<00:03:33.200> done<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.470> tutorial

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
ambient occlusion I've done a tutorial

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.520 
ambient occlusion I've done a tutorial
for<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.340> before<00:03:34.519> but<00:03:35.269> make<00:03:35.600> sure<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:36.019> get

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
for this before but make sure you get

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.259 
for this before but make sure you get
ambient<00:03:36.980> occlusion<00:03:37.160> on<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.790> really<00:03:37.970> makes

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
ambient occlusion on it really makes

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.509 
ambient occlusion on it really makes
things<00:03:38.420> look<00:03:38.690> nice<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.230> personally<00:03:40.160> prefer<00:03:40.489> to

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
things look nice I personally prefer to

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.940 
things look nice I personally prefer to
have<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.389> scene<00:03:41.600> lit<00:03:41.870> normally<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.560> ambient

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
have the scene lit normally have ambient

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.949 
have the scene lit normally have ambient
occlusion<00:03:43.100> set<00:03:43.549> to<00:03:43.639> multiply<00:03:43.760> instead<00:03:44.600> of<00:03:44.720> add

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
occlusion set to multiply instead of add

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.559 
occlusion set to multiply instead of add
and<00:03:45.310> increase<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.459> samples<00:03:46.850> somewhere

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
and increase the samples somewhere

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.490 
and increase the samples somewhere
around<00:03:47.870> 15<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.739> 20<00:03:49.069> if<00:03:49.220> you're<00:03:49.819> doing<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.500> 3d

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
around 15 to 20 if you're doing a 3d

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.500 
around 15 to 20 if you're doing a 3d
movie<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.819> don't<00:03:52.970> want<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.150> spend<00:03:53.269> a<00:03:53.389> lot

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
movie and you don't want to spend a lot

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.120 
movie and you don't want to spend a lot
of<00:03:53.660> time<00:03:53.810> rendering<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.620> could<00:03:54.799> lower<00:03:54.950> that

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
of time rendering you could lower that

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.280 
of time rendering you could lower that
some<00:03:55.430> but<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.299> higher<00:03:56.420> samples<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.109> less

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
some but the higher samples the less

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.559 
some but the higher samples the less
grainy<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.920> more<00:03:58.400> realistic<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:59.150> will<00:03:59.299> look

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
grainy and more realistic it will look

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.930 
grainy and more realistic it will look
now<00:03:59.930> as<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.560> see<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:00.859> scene<00:04:01.489> is<00:04:01.639> kind<00:04:01.849> of

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
now as you can see this scene is kind of

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.879 
now as you can see this scene is kind of
dimly<00:04:02.299> lit<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.660> that's<00:04:03.349> what<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.530> was<00:04:03.739> going

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
dimly lit and that's what I was going

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.920 
dimly lit and that's what I was going
for<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:04.549> you<00:04:05.120> want<00:04:05.269> to<00:04:05.359> make<00:04:05.480> sure<00:04:05.510> your

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
for so you want to make sure your

add filter glare and same with the focus
now<00:06:04.199> how<00:06:04.409> these<00:06:04.560> should<00:06:04.740> be<00:06:04.800> set<00:06:05.099> up<00:06:05.219> quality

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
now how these should be set up quality

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.379 
now how these should be set up quality
medium<00:06:07.320> is<00:06:07.560> alright<00:06:08.009> high<00:06:08.610> obviously<00:06:08.909> better

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
medium is alright high obviously better

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.209 
medium is alright high obviously better
quality<00:06:09.840> but<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:10.229> increases<00:06:10.770> the<00:06:10.860> render<00:06:11.099> time

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
quality but it increases the render time

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.760 
quality but it increases the render time
of<00:06:11.400> it<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:12.060> alliteration<00:06:12.599> that's<00:06:13.469> how<00:06:13.620> many

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
of it the alliteration that's how many

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.740 
of it the alliteration that's how many
times<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.699> effect<00:06:14.969> is<00:06:15.180> like<00:06:17.419> streaks<00:06:18.419> that's

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
times the effect is like streaks that's

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.140 
times the effect is like streaks that's
how<00:06:19.229> many<00:06:19.440> light<00:06:19.770> streaks<00:06:20.099> you<00:06:20.370> can't<00:06:20.820> see<00:06:21.060> it

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
how many light streaks you can't see it

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.330 
how many light streaks you can't see it
now<00:06:21.180> because<00:06:21.719> the<00:06:22.560> whites<00:06:22.800> aren't<00:06:23.070> bright

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340
