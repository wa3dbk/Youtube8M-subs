00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
hello my friends so the last few days I

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.570 
hello my friends so the last few days I
have<00:00:03.659> been<00:00:03.689> working<00:00:04.049> on<00:00:04.170> getting<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.620> ceiling

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
have been working on getting the ceiling

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.799 
have been working on getting the ceiling
prepped<00:00:05.940> for<00:00:06.410> insulation<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.820> I<00:00:08.820> last<00:00:09.540> night

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
prepped for insulation and I last night

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.280 
prepped for insulation and I last night
put<00:00:10.080> up<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.440> first<00:00:11.660> section<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.840> insulation

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
put up the first section of insulation

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.109 
put up the first section of insulation
and<00:00:15.139> I'm<00:00:16.139> faced<00:00:16.379> with<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> progress<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:17.010> that

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
and I'm faced with the progress of that

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.590 
and I'm faced with the progress of that
just<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.180> second<00:00:18.570> what<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.380> decided<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> do<00:00:19.980> was

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
just a second what I decided to do was

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.620 
just a second what I decided to do was
put<00:00:21.600> some<00:00:21.630> spray<00:00:21.990> foam<00:00:22.230> into<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.210> beams<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
put some spray foam into the beams that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.099 
put some spray foam into the beams that
travel<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.260> top<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.220> trailer<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:27.359> couldn't

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
travel on top of the trailer I couldn't

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.589 
travel on top of the trailer I couldn't
find<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.529> good<00:00:29.010> solution<00:00:29.699> other<00:00:30.240> than<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
find a good solution other than that

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.269 
find a good solution other than that
that<00:00:30.990> wasn't<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:32.009> very

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
that wasn't going to be a very

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.569 
that wasn't going to be a very
time-consuming<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.320> also<00:00:34.550> after<00:00:35.550> I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
time-consuming so I also after I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.160 
time-consuming so I also after I
finished<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.030> which<00:00:36.360> took<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.630> couple<00:00:37.050> days

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
finished that which took a couple days

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.510 
finished that which took a couple days
to<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.489> properly<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.559> painted<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.040> wood

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
to do to do properly I painted the wood

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.270 
to do to do properly I painted the wood
with<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.510> walnut<00:00:43.379> proof<00:00:44.480> paint<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:46.770> seal<00:00:47.100> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
with a walnut proof paint to seal it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.010 
with a walnut proof paint to seal it
seal<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> end<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.270> case<00:00:48.450> there<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.719> any<00:00:48.870> kind

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
seal the end in case there was any kind

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
seal the end in case there was any kind
of<00:00:49.140> mold<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.680> water<00:00:50.070> damage<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.329> don't

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
of mold or water damage which I don't

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.180 
of mold or water damage which I don't
see<00:00:51.570> happening<00:00:52.050> given<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.620> roof<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.039> his

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
see happening given the roof is his

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.380 
see happening given the roof is his
single<00:00:53.640> layer<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.120> insulin<00:00:54.829> and<00:00:55.910> then<00:00:56.910> after

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
single layer of insulin and then after

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.060 
single layer of insulin and then after
that<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.539> put<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> first<00:00:58.140> layer<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.829> black

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that I put the first layer of this black

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.040 
that I put the first layer of this black
insulation<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> peek<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.020> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
insulation so I can do a peek at what I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.070 
insulation so I can do a peek at what I
have<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.379> far<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> whole<00:01:02.280> lot<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.390> let

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
have so far it's not a whole lot but let

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
have so far it's not a whole lot but let
me<00:01:04.140> show<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:06.080> right<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.939> see<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
me show you all right so you can see the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.640 
me show you all right so you can see the
ceiling<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.570> white<00:01:09.869> now<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.350> used<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> be

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
ceiling is white now and used to be

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.399 
ceiling is white now and used to be
brown<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.630> first<00:01:12.930> layer

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
brown and then I have this first layer

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.940 
brown and then I have this first layer
of<00:01:14.420> insulation<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.530> probably<00:01:16.799> looks

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
of insulation here so it probably looks

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.080 
of insulation here so it probably looks
really<00:01:17.100> familiar<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.640> what<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:17.820> doing<00:01:18.000> in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
really familiar it's what I'm doing in

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.740 
really familiar it's what I'm doing in
the<00:01:18.150> walls<00:01:19.130> surprisingly<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.610> fit<00:01:21.030> quite<00:01:21.299> well

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the walls surprisingly it fit quite well

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.310 
the walls surprisingly it fit quite well
as<00:01:22.049> far<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.950> black<00:01:23.939> foam<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.630> didn't<00:01:25.200> have

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
as far as the black foam I didn't have

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
as far as the black foam I didn't have
to<00:01:25.409> cut<00:01:25.560> them<00:01:25.680> very<00:01:25.710> much<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.369> did<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.119> cut

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to cut them very much I did have to cut

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.340 
to cut them very much I did have to cut
a<00:01:27.720> tiny<00:01:28.670> section<00:01:29.670> out<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.240> make<00:01:30.840> sure<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> fit

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
a tiny section out to make sure it fit

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.170 
a tiny section out to make sure it fit
in<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.950> groove<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> group<00:01:32.729> comes<00:01:32.970> off

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
in this groove here the group comes off

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.300 
in this groove here the group comes off
you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> fraction<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.500> an<00:01:34.590> inch<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> just

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you know a fraction of an inch so I just

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.560 
you know a fraction of an inch so I just
cut<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.670> groove<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> fit<00:01:36.420> nice

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
cut a little groove out so it fit nice

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.090 
cut a little groove out so it fit nice
and<00:01:36.600> snug<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:37.259> was<00:01:37.350> no<00:01:37.470> air<00:01:37.680> pocket

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
and snug and there was no air pocket

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.819 
and snug and there was no air pocket
there<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:40.259> don't<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.740> if

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
there as you can see I don't know if

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.539 
there as you can see I don't know if
it's<00:01:40.950> an<00:01:41.040> easy<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.759> right<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:43.110> I

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
it's an easy to see here right here I

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.270 
it's an easy to see here right here I
drilled<00:01:44.549> some<00:01:44.880> holes<00:01:44.909> into<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.040> frame<00:01:47.040> here

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
drilled some holes into the frame here

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.080 
drilled some holes into the frame here
and<00:01:47.659> filled<00:01:48.659> them<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.500> spray<00:01:49.740> foam

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
and filled them in with the spray foam

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.480 
and filled them in with the spray foam
for<00:01:51.090> big<00:01:51.270> gaps<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.960> inch<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.710> did<00:01:53.369> that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
for big gaps one inch or more I did that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.399 
for big gaps one inch or more I did that
on<00:01:53.520> all<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.810> trimmed<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
on all of these and then I trimmed it

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.740 
on all of these and then I trimmed it
back<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.460> nice<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.729> clean<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.600> can

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
back so it was nice and clean you can

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.899 
back so it was nice and clean you can
kind<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.960> see<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> little<00:01:58.229> bit<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> overflow

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
kind of see a little bit of the overflow

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.100 
kind of see a little bit of the overflow
on<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.920> hopefully<00:02:02.810> nothing<00:02:03.810> too

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
on this one hopefully nothing too

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
on this one hopefully nothing too
interesting<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.770> didn't<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.340> much<00:02:05.490> video<00:02:05.820> on

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
interesting I didn't do much video on

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.240 
interesting I didn't do much video on
that<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.630> was<00:02:06.860> frankly<00:02:07.860> boring<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that because it was frankly boring to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.300 
that because it was frankly boring to
watch<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:09.289> that's<00:02:10.289> what<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.679> far<00:02:10.709> it's

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
watch so that's what I have so far it's

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.809 
watch so that's what I have so far it's
coming<00:02:11.520> along<00:02:11.640> quite<00:02:11.879> nicely

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
coming along quite nicely

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.289 
coming along quite nicely
I<00:02:12.849> hope<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.510> finish<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:15.219> wall<00:02:15.489> which<00:02:16.090> I

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
I hope to finish this wall which I

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.819 
I hope to finish this wall which I
actually<00:02:16.510> uh<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.680> know<00:02:17.799> completed<00:02:18.519> as<00:02:18.790> far<00:02:19.090> as

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
actually uh you know completed as far as

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.670 
actually uh you know completed as far as
insulating<00:02:20.829> a<00:02:20.859> behind<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:22.349> inside<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.500> beams

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
insulating a behind it inside the beams

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.319 
insulating a behind it inside the beams
here<00:02:23.950> like<00:02:24.250> for<00:02:24.400> instance<00:02:24.489> in<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:25.090> section

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
here like for instance in this section

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.039 
here like for instance in this section
here<00:02:25.719> this<00:02:26.349> section<00:02:26.620> had<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> empty<00:02:28.049> square

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
here this section had a empty square

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.559 
here this section had a empty square
beam<00:02:29.349> that<00:02:29.859> I<00:02:29.920> couldn't<00:02:30.280> access<00:02:30.400> with<00:02:30.939> foam<00:02:31.269> I

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
beam that I couldn't access with foam I

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.849 
beam that I couldn't access with foam I
do<00:02:31.689> have<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.900> little<00:02:32.019> section<00:02:32.319> up<00:02:32.500> here<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.799> I

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
do have a little section up here that I

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.539 
do have a little section up here that I
got<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> tuck<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.900> where<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.959> can<00:02:35.019> see<00:02:35.549> that

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
got a tuck in where you can see that

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.780 
got a tuck in where you can see that
there<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.760> some<00:02:37.030> metal<00:02:37.299> back<00:02:37.480> here<00:02:37.810> here<00:02:38.790> right

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
there is some metal back here here right

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.050 
there is some metal back here here right
here<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.290> ice<00:02:41.409> you<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.129> drilled<00:02:42.639> holes<00:02:42.909> in

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
here so ice you know drilled holes in

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.399 
here so ice you know drilled holes in
there<00:02:43.180> like<00:02:43.329> I<00:02:43.389> did<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.599> ceiling<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:44.049> put<00:02:44.200> spray

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
there like I did the ceiling I put spray

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.229 
there like I did the ceiling I put spray
foam<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.739> there<00:02:44.889> I<00:02:45.129> also<00:02:46.000> did<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.840> around<00:02:47.139> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
foam in there I also did that around the

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.390 
foam in there I also did that around the
corners<00:02:49.239> here<00:02:49.919> behind<00:02:50.919> this<00:02:51.189> here<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.760> also

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
corners here behind this here and also

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.479 
corners here behind this here and also
behind<00:02:54.400> here<00:02:55.120> that's<00:02:55.629> the<00:02:55.780> door<00:02:55.989> frame

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
behind here that's the door frame

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.369 
behind here that's the door frame
finished<00:02:57.489> this<00:02:57.669> section<00:02:58.239> also<00:02:58.389> so<00:02:59.109> works

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
finished this section also so works

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.559 
finished this section also so works
coming<00:02:59.620> along<00:02:59.799> nice<00:03:00.329> installations<00:03:01.329> gonna<00:03:01.480> be

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
coming along nice installations gonna be

started<00:03:04.569> on<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.989> wall<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.439> the<00:03:05.500> interior

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
started on the wall and the interior

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.250 
started on the wall and the interior
which<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.760> imagine<00:03:07.120> won't<00:03:07.389> be<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.780> fun<00:03:07.989> part

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
which I imagine won't be the fun part

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.759 
which I imagine won't be the fun part
because<00:03:08.319> this<00:03:08.680> insulation<00:03:09.069> has<00:03:09.400> been<00:03:10.680> if<00:03:11.680> I

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
because this insulation has been if I

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.020 
because this insulation has been if I
didn't<00:03:11.950> love<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.430> would<00:03:12.609> have<00:03:12.700> given<00:03:12.819> up

installation as far as the first layer

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.490 
installation as far as the first layer
of<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.530> closed-cell<00:03:53.070> foam<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:54.360> had<00:03:55.320> some

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
of the closed-cell foam I had some

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.920 
of the closed-cell foam I had some
problems<00:03:55.830> with<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.160> foam<00:03:56.370> initially<00:03:56.930> I'll

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
problems with that foam initially I'll

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.360 
problems with that foam initially I'll
show<00:03:58.140> some<00:03:58.170> picture<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.740> of<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.190> in<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
show some picture that of that in the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.420 
show some picture that of that in the
minutes<00:03:59.670> basically<00:04:00.510> what<00:04:00.630> happened<00:04:00.990> is<00:04:01.050> I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
minutes basically what happened is I

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.620 
minutes basically what happened is I
made<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.700> installation<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.330> little<00:04:03.480> too<00:04:03.570> snug

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
made the installation a little too snug

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.110 
made the installation a little too snug
on<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.290> ceiling<00:04:04.650> when<00:04:05.460> I<00:04:05.520> fitted<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.850> together

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
on the ceiling when I fitted it together

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.530 
on the ceiling when I fitted it together
and<00:04:06.390> because<00:04:07.380> of<00:04:07.410> that<00:04:07.560> when<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:09.090> ceiling<00:04:09.420> got

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
and because of that when the ceiling got

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.630 
and because of that when the ceiling got
hot<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.080> expanded<00:04:10.650> slightly<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.400> bowed

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
hot it expanded slightly and bowed

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.960 
hot it expanded slightly and bowed
everything<00:04:12.030> out<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.510> show<00:04:13.080> picture<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.620> here

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.580 

and<00:04:20.730> so<00:04:21.730> I<00:04:21.790> had<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.940> tear<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.180> all<00:04:22.270> down<00:04:22.530> kind<00:04:23.530> of

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
and so I had to tear it all down kind of

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.680 
and so I had to tear it all down kind of
sucked<00:04:23.770> but<00:04:24.040> had<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.490> be<00:04:24.550> done<00:04:24.730> that<00:04:25.360> took<00:04:25.540> me

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
sucked but had to be done that took me

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.600 
sucked but had to be done that took me
twice<00:04:26.020> as<00:04:26.140> much<00:04:26.260> time<00:04:26.530> obviously<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.250> do<00:04:27.400> that

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
twice as much time obviously to do that

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.740 
twice as much time obviously to do that
then<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.510> initially<00:04:28.780> expected<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:30.720> now<00:04:31.720> I

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
then I initially expected and now I

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.360 
then I initially expected and now I
after<00:04:32.560> I'm<00:04:32.680> finished<00:04:32.920> with<00:04:32.950> this<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.160> had<00:04:33.340> to

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
after I'm finished with this I had to

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.760 
after I'm finished with this I had to
figure<00:04:33.580> out<00:04:33.730> a<00:04:33.880> solution<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:35.140> keeping<00:04:35.530> it<00:04:35.590> nice

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
figure out a solution to keeping it nice

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.090 
figure out a solution to keeping it nice
and<00:04:35.830> snug<00:04:36.160> against<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.790> top<00:04:37.030> of<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.480> trailer

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
and snug against the top of the trailer

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.440 
and snug against the top of the trailer
let<00:04:39.100> me<00:04:39.190> show<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.370> what<00:04:39.670> I<00:04:39.700> got<00:04:39.850> so<00:04:39.970> far<00:04:40.000> I

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
let me show you what I got so far I

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.050 
let me show you what I got so far I
already<00:04:40.720> showed<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.020> little<00:04:41.140> bit<00:04:42.060> all

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
already showed you a little bit all

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.050 
already showed you a little bit all
right<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.620> as<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.520> can<00:04:45.640> see<00:04:45.880> here<00:04:47.850> most<00:04:48.850> of<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
right so as you can see here most of the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.570 
right so as you can see here most of the
ceiling<00:04:49.420> is<00:04:49.540> finished<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.220> just<00:04:51.400> have<00:04:51.550> a

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
ceiling is finished and I just have a

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.910 
ceiling is finished and I just have a
couple<00:04:52.180> more<00:04:52.480> sections<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.560> have<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.770> finish

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
couple more sections I have to finish

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.340 
couple more sections I have to finish
there<00:04:54.250> you<00:04:54.430> can<00:04:54.580> see<00:04:54.760> some<00:04:55.630> of<00:04:55.750> my<00:04:55.780> failure

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
there you can see some of my failure

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.160 
there you can see some of my failure
right<00:04:56.650> there

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
right there

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.170 
right there
but<00:04:59.170> I<00:04:59.200> fixed<00:04:59.710> it<00:04:59.860> obviously<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.730> what<00:05:00.970> I<00:05:01.000> did

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
but I fixed it obviously and what I did

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.460 
but I fixed it obviously and what I did
a<00:05:01.210> little<00:05:01.450> differently<00:05:01.750> was<00:05:02.020> obviously

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
a little differently was obviously

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
a little differently was obviously
adjust<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:03.130> tension<00:05:04.200> between<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.650> foam<00:05:06.220> I

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
adjust the tension between the foam I

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.700 
adjust the tension between the foam I
cut<00:05:06.670> a<00:05:06.700> little<00:05:06.850> more<00:05:07.090> out<00:05:07.240> than<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.870> did<00:05:08.590> the

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
cut a little more out than I did the

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.810 
cut a little more out than I did the
first<00:05:08.740> time<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.880> I<00:05:09.970> also<00:05:10.120> added<00:05:10.630> some<00:05:11.730> if<00:05:12.730> you

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
first time and I also added some if you

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.090 
first time and I also added some if you
can<00:05:12.940> see<00:05:13.030> those<00:05:13.150> are<00:05:13.300> not<00:05:13.419> some<00:05:14.080> wire<00:05:14.290> for<00:05:14.860> some

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
can see those are not some wire for some

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.610 
can see those are not some wire for some
rigidity<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:17.050> want<00:05:17.230> to<00:05:17.290> kind<00:05:17.440> of<00:05:17.470> make<00:05:17.590> a

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
rigidity and I want to kind of make a

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.530 
rigidity and I want to kind of make a
skeleton<00:05:18.160> on<00:05:18.370> there<00:05:18.640> it<00:05:19.120> seems<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.390> be<00:05:19.450> helping

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
skeleton on there it seems to be helping

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.870 
skeleton on there it seems to be helping
pretty<00:05:19.840> well<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.260> also<00:05:20.380> holds<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:20.980> so<00:05:21.190> when<00:05:21.820> I

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
pretty well it also holds it so when I

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.540 
pretty well it also holds it so when I
go<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:22.030> install<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:22.570> it<00:05:22.630> stays<00:05:22.930> put<00:05:23.550> one

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
go to install it it stays put one

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.950 
go to install it it stays put one

different<00:05:31.120> options<00:05:31.210> on<00:05:32.340> keeping<00:05:33.340> this<00:05:33.430> foam

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
different options on keeping this foam

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.020 
different options on keeping this foam
nice<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:34.660> flush<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.650> ceiling<00:05:36.160> so<00:05:36.940> it

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
nice and flush to the ceiling so it

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.620 
nice and flush to the ceiling so it
doesn't<00:05:37.330> bowl<00:05:37.840> out<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.380> I<00:05:38.830> do<00:05:38.890> have<00:05:39.100> beams

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
doesn't bowl out and I do have beams

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
fastened to the top of here to keep it

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.250 
fastened to the top of here to keep it
nice<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.740> snug<00:05:51.419> I'd<00:05:52.419> wanted<00:05:52.810> to<00:05:52.870> do<00:05:52.960> something

something<00:05:57.550> that<00:05:57.700> would<00:05:57.910> be<00:05:58.060> sturdy<00:05:58.360> enough

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
something that would be sturdy enough

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.420 
something that would be sturdy enough
where<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:58.840> wouldn't<00:05:59.200> have<00:05:59.740> to<00:05:59.860> worry<00:06:00.010> about<00:06:00.160> it

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
where I wouldn't have to worry about it

ripping off the wall if there is a

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.130 
ripping off the wall if there is a
little<00:06:02.050> bit<00:06:02.169> of<00:06:02.229> tension<00:06:02.410> so<00:06:03.510> you<00:06:04.510> know<00:06:04.630> foam

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
little bit of tension so you know foam

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.420 
little bit of tension so you know foam
insulation<00:06:05.380> probably<00:06:05.950> want<00:06:06.070> to<00:06:06.100> work<00:06:06.220> either

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
insulation probably want to work either
