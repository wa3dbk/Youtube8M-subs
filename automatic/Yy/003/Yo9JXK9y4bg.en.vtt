dolly cameras where you view from that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.200 
dolly cameras where you view from that
track<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.800> pretty<00:00:41.070> much<00:00:41.160> script<00:00:41.969> out

a<00:00:42.590> camera<00:00:43.590> track<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.280> pretty<00:00:44.460> cool<00:00:45.050> once<00:00:46.050> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
a camera track it's pretty cool once you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.779 
a camera track it's pretty cool once you
put<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> camera<00:00:46.620> down<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.370> back<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
put a camera down you can go back and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.540 
put a camera down you can go back and
edit<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.750> change<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.200> speed<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> you

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
edit it you can change the speed and you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.420 
edit it you can change the speed and you
can<00:00:50.730> also<00:00:50.879> move<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.809> around<00:00:52.039> you<00:00:53.039> shouldn't

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
can also move it around you shouldn't

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760 
can also move it around you shouldn't
change<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.940> play<00:00:54.149> speed<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.840> camera<00:00:55.410> points

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
change to play speed on camera points

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.849 
change to play speed on camera points
that<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> don't<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:56.460> want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.510> change

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
that you don't actually want to change

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.200 
that you don't actually want to change
because<00:00:58.859> once<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> go<00:00:59.520> past<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.879> certain<00:01:00.059> point

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
because once you go past a certain point

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
because once you go past a certain point
you<00:01:00.600> won't<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.870> able<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> get<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you won't be able to get back to the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.280 
you won't be able to get back to the
regular<00:01:01.920> play<00:01:02.370> rate<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:04.049> bugged

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
regular play rate it's a little bugged

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.530 
regular play rate it's a little bugged
out<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:04.890> don't<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.880> they'll<00:01:06.060> fix

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
out right now don't know if they'll fix

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.460 
out right now don't know if they'll fix
that<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:06.810> not<00:01:07.700> anyway<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.930> speed<00:01:10.229> mode

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that or not anyway the speed mode

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.560 
that or not anyway the speed mode
controls<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> speed<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> camera<00:01:12.330> point

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
controls the speed for the camera point

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.380 
controls the speed for the camera point
you're<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:13.040> up<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.400> next<00:01:14.760> camera<00:01:15.030> point

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you're at up to the next camera point

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.710 
you're at up to the next camera point
when<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> use<00:01:16.590> linear<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.670> gradually<00:01:18.270> changes

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
when you use linear it gradually changes

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.370 
when you use linear it gradually changes
the<00:01:18.840> speed<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.250> after<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:22.049> camera

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the speed up to and after the camera

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.399 
the speed up to and after the camera
point<00:01:22.619> you're<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> set<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.049> point

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
point you're at so if you set one point

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.910 
point you're at so if you set one point
at<00:01:25.830> linear<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> slow<00:01:27.140> it'll<00:01:28.140> gradually<00:01:28.439> slow

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
at linear and slow it'll gradually slow

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.679 
at linear and slow it'll gradually slow
down<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.729> point<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> will

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
down up to that point and then it will

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.920 
down up to that point and then it will
gradually<00:01:30.810> speed<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.500> after<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.189> point

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
gradually speed up after that point

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.450 
gradually speed up after that point
fixed<00:01:33.930> doesn't<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.409> any<00:01:34.560> gradual<00:01:35.009> changes

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
fixed doesn't have any gradual changes

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.149 
fixed doesn't have any gradual changes
it<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.720> changes<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> playback

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
it just changes right to that playback

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.179 
it just changes right to that playback
speed<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.659> camera<00:01:39.930> point<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.920> stays

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
speed at that camera point and it stays

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.700 
speed at that camera point and it stays
until<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> next<00:01:42.060> camera<00:01:42.329> point<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> go

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
until the next camera point so if you go

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.219 
until the next camera point so if you go
from<00:01:43.860> slow<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.579> fast<00:01:45.149> motion<00:01:45.659> it'll<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
from slow to fast motion it'll be a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.380 
from slow to fast motion it'll be a
little<00:01:46.409> jumpy<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:48.000> too<00:01:48.210> bad

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
little jumpy but it's really not too bad

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.230 
little jumpy but it's really not too bad
and<00:01:49.350> show<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.710> how<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.979> works<00:01:50.009> I've<00:01:50.820> got<00:01:51.030> this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and show you how it works I've got this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.749 
and show you how it works I've got this
clip<00:01:51.570> loaded<00:01:52.110> up<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.409> mine<00:01:52.590> where<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> got<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
clip loaded up of mine where I got a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.660 
clip loaded up of mine where I got a
tomahawk<00:01:54.270> across<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> map<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:56.219> place<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
tomahawk across the map and place the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.280 
tomahawk across the map and place the
first<00:01:56.820> camera<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.450> when<00:01:57.630> people<00:01:57.930> started

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
first camera right when people started

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.130 
first camera right when people started
moving<00:01:58.820> just<00:01:59.820> kind<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.119> flows<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:01.020> bit

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
moving just kind of flows a little bit

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.730 
moving just kind of flows a little bit
better<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.090> then<00:02:03.090> let<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.079> play<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> little<00:02:04.530> bit

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
better and then let it play a little bit

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.380 
better and then let it play a little bit
until<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.159> walk<00:02:05.430> around<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.759> corner<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.119> pause

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
until I walk around the corner and pause

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.309 
until I walk around the corner and pause
it<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.290> then<00:02:07.619> place<00:02:07.860> another<00:02:07.890> camera<00:02:09.080> do<00:02:10.080> this

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
it and then place another camera do this

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.040 
it and then place another camera do this
because<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.459> camera<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.060> go<00:02:12.209> through<00:02:12.720> walls

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
because the camera can go through walls

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.880 
because the camera can go through walls
some

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
some

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.390 
some
times<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.250> looks<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.640> little<00:02:14.760> bit<00:02:14.970> weird

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
times it just looks a little bit weird

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.830 
times it just looks a little bit weird
then<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.730> next<00:02:17.880> camera<00:02:18.209> where<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.540> throw

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
then for the next camera where I throw

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.620 
then for the next camera where I throw
the<00:02:18.959> tomahawk<00:02:19.790> I'm<00:02:20.790> going<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> slow<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
the tomahawk I'm going to slow the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.780 
the tomahawk I'm going to slow the
playback<00:02:22.020> end<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.709> stop<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.220> right<00:02:23.610> when

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
playback end so I can stop it right when

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.360 
playback end so I can stop it right when
I<00:02:23.819> throw<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> tomahawk<00:02:24.770> got<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.890> pretty<00:02:26.100> close

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
I throw a tomahawk got it pretty close

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.030 
I throw a tomahawk got it pretty close
but<00:02:26.880> it'll<00:02:27.240> work<00:02:27.270> good<00:02:27.540> enough<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.050> then<00:02:29.010> I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
but it'll work good enough and then I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.560 
but it'll work good enough and then I
want<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.280> set<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.580> camera<00:02:29.910> up<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.240> I'm<00:02:30.300> looking

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
want to set the camera up so I'm looking

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.660 
want to set the camera up so I'm looking
in<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.380> same<00:02:31.560> direction<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.250> through<00:02:32.550> to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
in the same direction that I through to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.780 
in the same direction that I through to
tomahawk<00:02:33.950> now<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.100> don't<00:02:35.220> have<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.490> do<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
tomahawk now you don't have to do the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.820 
tomahawk now you don't have to do the
same<00:02:35.940> thing<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.780> explanation<00:02:37.620> for

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
same thing this is just explanation for

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.949 
same thing this is just explanation for
how<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> did<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:39.180> once<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.540> place<00:02:39.750> that

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
how I did this then once I place that

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.870 
how I did this then once I place that
camera<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:41.010> go<00:02:41.190> ahead<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.400> let<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.730> play

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
camera and go ahead and let it play

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.290 
camera and go ahead and let it play
slowly<00:02:43.280> put<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> tomahawk<00:02:44.819> move<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.150> little

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
slowly put the tomahawk move a little

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.960 
slowly put the tomahawk move a little
bit<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.930> can<00:02:46.050> pause<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.290> again<00:02:46.970> move

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
bit and then you can pause it again move

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.140 
bit and then you can pause it again move
the<00:02:48.150> camera<00:02:49.040> put<00:02:50.040> another<00:02:50.160> camera<00:02:50.670> point<00:02:50.910> down

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
the camera put another camera point down

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.199 
the camera put another camera point down
and<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:53.220> repeat<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.790> until<00:02:54.030> you

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
and you just repeat this until you

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.820 
and you just repeat this until you
follow<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.019> all<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.170> way<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.380> where<00:02:55.680> it's

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
follow it all the way to where it's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.300 
follow it all the way to where it's
going<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:01.200> want<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.440> try<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.709> not<00:03:01.980> move<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
going you want to try to not move the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.310 
going you want to try to not move the
camera<00:03:02.550> around<00:03:02.670> too<00:03:03.209> much<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.110> looks

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
camera around too much just so it looks

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.290 
camera around too much just so it looks
smooth<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:07.580> don't<00:03:08.580> know<00:03:08.640> what<00:03:08.820> this<00:03:08.910> guy<00:03:09.150> was

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
smooth I don't know what this guy was

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.360 
smooth I don't know what this guy was
doing<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:09.720> was<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> regular<00:03:10.320> game<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:11.250> not

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
doing this was a regular game it's not

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.490 
doing this was a regular game it's not
like<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:11.700> was<00:03:11.940> set<00:03:12.180> up<00:03:12.300> or<00:03:12.450> anything<00:03:12.540> he<00:03:13.350> was

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
like this was set up or anything he was

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.220 
like this was set up or anything he was
just<00:03:13.590> standing<00:03:13.769> there<00:03:14.010> shooting<00:03:14.280> his<00:03:14.519> gun<00:03:21.230> one

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
just standing there shooting his gun one

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.590 
just standing there shooting his gun one
thing<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.610> kind<00:03:23.610> of<00:03:23.700> sucks<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.299> can't

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
thing that kind of sucks is you can't

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.810 
thing that kind of sucks is you can't
have<00:03:24.840> two<00:03:25.170> cameras<00:03:26.130> very<00:03:26.340> close<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.760> each

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
have two cameras very close to each

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.180 
have two cameras very close to each
other<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.390> like<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.290> can't<00:03:28.320> have<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.860> camera

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
other so like you can't have the camera

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.370 
other so like you can't have the camera
pause<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.700> one<00:03:29.880> spot<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.480> turn<00:03:30.989> slowly

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
pause in one spot and turn slowly

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.009 
pause in one spot and turn slowly
because<00:03:31.890> they'll<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.430> overlapping<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.930> you

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
because they'll be overlapping so you

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.930 
because they'll be overlapping so you
have<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.320> move<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.530> camera<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:35.190> little<00:03:35.400> bit<00:03:35.820> to

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
have to move the camera a little bit to

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.280 
have to move the camera a little bit to
the<00:03:36.060> side<00:03:40.040> now<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.070> got<00:03:41.310> all<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:41.459> cameras<00:03:41.940> there

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
the side now I got all my cameras there

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.920 
the side now I got all my cameras there
you<00:03:43.290> can<00:03:43.440> actually<00:03:43.620> see<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.400> track<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
you can actually see the track that the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.380 
you can actually see the track that the
cameras<00:03:46.410> are<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.590> every<00:03:47.340> camera<00:03:47.880> that's<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.239> it

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
cameras are on every camera that's on it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.600 
cameras are on every camera that's on it
in<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.570> time<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.980> each<00:03:49.980> camera<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.519> at<00:03:52.610> when

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
in the time that each camera is at when

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.000 
in the time that each camera is at when
you<00:03:53.730> play<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.209> back<00:03:54.420> in<00:03:54.750> edit<00:03:55.410> camera<00:03:55.829> mode

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
you play that back in edit camera mode

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.580 
you play that back in edit camera mode
you<00:03:56.880> can<00:03:56.910> actually<00:03:57.209> see<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.870> camera<00:03:58.140> moving

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
you can actually see the camera moving

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.640 
you can actually see the camera moving
along<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.459> track<00:03:59.700> it's<00:03:59.910> kind<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.090> cool

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.920 

and<00:04:03.159> in<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.400> top<00:04:03.579> left<00:04:03.879> you<00:04:04.060> see<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.269> preview<00:04:04.599> of

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
and in the top left you see a preview of

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.530 
and in the top left you see a preview of
what<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.620> camera<00:04:05.980> actually<00:04:06.189> is<00:04:06.909> showing<00:04:06.939> on

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
what the camera actually is showing on

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:24.650 
what the camera actually is showing on
the<00:04:07.659> dolly<00:04:07.870> cam<00:04:10.950> now<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.730> dolly<00:04:13.180> can

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.350 

now<00:04:25.660> I'm<00:04:25.810> going<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.020> set<00:04:26.259> the<00:04:26.380> playback<00:04:26.800> speed

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
now I'm going to set the playback speed

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.379 
now I'm going to set the playback speed
so<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.389> goes<00:04:28.630> in<00:04:28.810> slow<00:04:29.020> motion<00:04:30.030> for<00:04:31.030> all<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
so it goes in slow motion for all the

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.010 
so it goes in slow motion for all the
cameras<00:04:31.860> except<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.150> last<00:04:34.150> one<00:04:34.389> in<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.780> first

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
cameras except the last one in the first

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.100 
cameras except the last one in the first
few<00:04:35.789> i'm<00:04:36.789> going<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.060> use<00:04:37.210> linear<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:37.960> it

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
few i'm going to use linear so it

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.590 
few i'm going to use linear so it
gradually<00:04:38.770> speeds<00:04:39.100> up<00:04:39.330> towards<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.360> last

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
gradually speeds up towards the last

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.010 
gradually speeds up towards the last
camera<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.820> i'm<00:04:43.060> going<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.270> put<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.750> same

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
camera and i'm going to put the same

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.560 
camera and i'm going to put the same
linear<00:04:44.770> speed<00:04:45.280> on<00:04:45.460> all<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.880> cameras<00:04:46.270> over<00:04:46.479> the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
linear speed on all the cameras over the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:05:11.309 
linear speed on all the cameras over the
top

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.320 

also<00:05:12.319> want<00:05:12.860> to<00:05:12.919> go<00:05:13.039> to<00:05:13.099> the<00:05:13.460> camera<00:05:13.819> after<00:05:14.030> the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
also want to go to the camera after the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.600 
also want to go to the camera after the
slow-motion<00:05:14.689> part<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.319> change<00:05:15.949> it<00:05:16.099> to<00:05:16.129> linear

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
slow-motion part and change it to linear

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.670 
slow-motion part and change it to linear
but<00:05:16.969> make<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.240> normal<00:05:17.810> speed<00:05:18.050> that<00:05:18.349> way<00:05:18.500> that

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
but make it normal speed that way that

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.730 
but make it normal speed that way that
it<00:05:18.770> will<00:05:18.860> actually<00:05:19.009> speed<00:05:19.520> up<00:05:20.530> now<00:05:21.530> this<00:05:21.680> is

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
it will actually speed up now this is

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.200 
it will actually speed up now this is
what<00:05:22.039> it's<00:05:22.189> going<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.370> look<00:05:22.430> like<00:05:22.580> after<00:05:22.939> our

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
what it's going to look like after our

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:32.230 
what it's going to look like after our
record<00:05:29.740> speeds<00:05:30.740> a<00:05:30.860> little<00:05:30.889> slow<00:05:31.310> maybe<00:05:32.000> could

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
record speeds a little slow maybe could

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.170 
record speeds a little slow maybe could
have<00:05:32.300> done<00:05:32.509> it<00:05:32.539> faster<00:05:32.960> but<00:05:33.849> work<00:05:34.849> for<00:05:35.090> the

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
have done it faster but work for the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:56.610 
have done it faster but work for the
video

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.920 

so<00:05:57.220> you<00:05:57.520> can<00:05:57.699> believe<00:06:00.419> that's<00:06:01.419> pretty<00:06:01.720> much<00:06:01.870> it

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
so you can believe that's pretty much it

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.180 
so you can believe that's pretty much it
if<00:06:02.770> you<00:06:02.919> look<00:06:03.130> at<00:06:03.280> the<00:06:03.310> actual<00:06:04.240> camera<00:06:04.720> track

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
if you look at the actual camera track

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.170 
if you look at the actual camera track
you'll<00:06:06.190> see<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:06.550> it<00:06:06.669> doesn't<00:06:06.850> go<00:06:07.060> in

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
you'll see that it doesn't go in

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.629 
you'll see that it doesn't go in
straight<00:06:07.210> lines<00:06:07.479> it<00:06:07.930> actually<00:06:08.639> curves

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
straight lines it actually curves

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.570 
straight lines it actually curves
everything<00:06:10.360> gradually<00:06:10.949> so<00:06:11.949> if<00:06:12.130> you<00:06:12.250> make<00:06:12.430> any

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
everything gradually so if you make any

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.490 
everything gradually so if you make any
real<00:06:12.910> sharp<00:06:13.360> angle<00:06:14.110> changes<00:06:16.050> sometimes<00:06:17.050> it

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
real sharp angle changes sometimes it

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.650 
real sharp angle changes sometimes it
doesn't<00:06:17.830> look<00:06:17.949> too<00:06:18.130> good<00:06:18.310> all<00:06:19.210> you<00:06:19.360> can<00:06:19.510> really

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
doesn't look too good all you can really

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.280 
doesn't look too good all you can really
do<00:06:19.900> is<00:06:20.639> play<00:06:21.639> around<00:06:21.880> with<00:06:22.060> it<00:06:22.090> see<00:06:22.960> what<00:06:23.080> works

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
do is play around with it see what works

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.830 
do is play around with it see what works
the<00:06:23.410> best<00:06:24.000> I'm<00:06:25.000> going<00:06:25.180> to<00:06:25.240> finish<00:06:25.389> this<00:06:25.630> up

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
the best I'm going to finish this up

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.659 
the best I'm going to finish this up
with<00:06:26.050> some<00:06:26.260> gameplay<00:06:26.680> that<00:06:26.919> I've<00:06:27.010> recorded

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
with some gameplay that I've recorded

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.659 
with some gameplay that I've recorded
and<00:06:28.030> edited<00:06:28.210> with<00:06:28.660> this<00:06:28.900> so<00:06:29.620> yeah<00:06:30.100> check<00:06:30.370> it

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
and edited with this so yeah check it

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:41.019 
and edited with this so yeah check it
out<00:06:30.880> have<00:06:31.180> fun

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:41.029 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.620 

mere<00:06:42.029> down
