00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
soggy actually it's a bit I'd say it's a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.990 
soggy actually it's a bit I'd say it's a
bit<00:02:59.840> firmer<00:03:00.680> than<00:03:00.799> it<00:03:01.010> was<00:03:01.160> during<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.970> last

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
bit firmer than it was during the last

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.120 
bit firmer than it was during the last
round<00:03:02.750> when<00:03:02.989> we<00:03:03.110> actually<00:03:03.230> had<00:03:03.500> lots<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.830> frost

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
round when we actually had lots of frost

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.090 
round when we actually had lots of frost
here<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.269> was<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.420> lot<00:03:05.690> colder<00:03:05.930> then<00:03:06.320> so<00:03:06.799> and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
here and it was a lot colder then so and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.310 
here and it was a lot colder then so and
it's<00:03:07.519> actually<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.390> not<00:03:08.570> looking<00:03:08.959> too<00:03:09.290> bad

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
it's actually it's not looking too bad

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.380 
it's actually it's not looking too bad
but<00:03:09.920> but<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.250> think<00:03:10.580> what<00:03:10.880> what<00:03:11.180> they'll<00:03:11.360> be

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
but but I think what what they'll be

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.110 
but but I think what what they'll be
hoping<00:03:11.959> for<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.380> more<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:13.790> quite

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
hoping for is this more this this quite

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.300 
hoping for is this more this this quite
claustrophobic<00:03:14.420> atmosphere<00:03:15.320> here<00:03:15.980> at<00:03:16.160> this

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
claustrophobic atmosphere here at this

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.340 
claustrophobic atmosphere here at this
scholars<00:03:16.730> ground<00:03:17.030> they<00:03:17.540> open<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.140> that

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
scholars ground they open that and that

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.650 
scholars ground they open that and that
will<00:03:18.590> give<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:19.040> Cardiff<00:03:19.489> City<00:03:19.700> players<00:03:20.120> and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
will give the Cardiff City players and

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.420 
will give the Cardiff City players and
not<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.989> think<00:03:21.200> about<00:03:21.380> them<00:03:21.860> because

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
not to think about them because

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.890 
not to think about them because
obviously<00:03:22.579> they<00:03:23.060> need<00:03:23.329> all<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.600> help<00:03:23.780> they

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
obviously they need all the help they

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.140 
obviously they need all the help they
can<00:03:23.989> get<00:03:24.350> they<00:03:24.680> are<00:03:24.829> are<00:03:25.130> six<00:03:25.519> levels<00:03:25.610> of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
can get they are are six levels of

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.120 
can get they are are six levels of
