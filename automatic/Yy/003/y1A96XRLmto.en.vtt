00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
builds on many of the folds that we've

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.429 
builds on many of the folds that we've
already<00:00:28.050> done<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.740> starts<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.900> as<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.260> had

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
origami paper we'll go ahead and get

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.580 
origami paper we'll go ahead and get
started<00:00:38.420> okay<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.050> first<00:00:40.079> thing<00:00:40.379> you're

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
going to do is do a nice guideline fold

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.160 
going to do is do a nice guideline fold
on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> diagonal<00:00:44.120> this<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.809> much<00:00:45.930> what

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
on the diagonal this is so much what

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470 
on the diagonal this is so much what
we've<00:00:46.320> done<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.649> week<00:00:46.860> long<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.700> take<00:00:48.329> your

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
we've done all week long so take your

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920 
we've done all week long so take your
paper<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.340> give<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.520> nice<00:00:50.700> crease<00:00:51.180> right

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
paper and give it a nice crease right

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.209 
paper and give it a nice crease right
across<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.500> diagonal<00:00:54.590> use<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:55.710> finger<00:00:56.039> good

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
across the diagonal use your finger good

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.160 
across the diagonal use your finger good
because<00:00:56.460> eventually<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.149> fold<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
because eventually this fold is going to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.439 
because eventually this fold is going to
come<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:58.890> play<00:00:59.100> and<00:01:01.309> start<00:01:02.309> out<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:02.820> with

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
come into play and start out then with

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.160 
come into play and start out then with
your<00:01:03.660> page<00:01:04.700> facing<00:01:05.700> white<00:01:06.240> side<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:08.900> okay<00:01:09.900> next

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
your page facing white side up okay next

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.550 
your page facing white side up okay next
you're<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.299> fold<00:01:12.689> into<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
you're going to do to fold into that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.780 
you're going to do to fold into that
guideline<00:01:14.000> guideline<00:01:15.110> just<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.500> did

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
guideline guideline just like we did

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.030 
guideline guideline just like we did
yesterday<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> fold<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.979> side<00:01:20.340> lining<00:01:21.270> up

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
yesterday so fold in one side lining up

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.450 
yesterday so fold in one side lining up
right<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.310> middle<00:01:23.880> line<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:25.430> then<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
right with that middle line and then the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.670 
right with that middle line and then the
next<00:01:27.030> side<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:29.939> end<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.450> something

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
next side so you end up with something

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.679 
next side so you end up with something
after<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.369> fold<00:01:32.640> those<00:01:32.790> two<00:01:33.060> flaps<00:01:33.360> into

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
after the you fold those two flaps into

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.880 
after the you fold those two flaps into
the<00:01:33.780> center<00:01:34.079> line<00:01:34.229> you're<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the center line you're going to do the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.060 
the center line you're going to do the
same<00:01:35.100> exact<00:01:35.460> thing<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:36.000> more<00:01:36.270> time<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:37.229> fold

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
same exact thing one more time so fold

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.990 
same exact thing one more time so fold
in<00:01:38.400> again<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> center<00:01:39.960> line

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.450 

so<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> end<00:01:45.900> up<00:01:46.050> with<00:01:46.110> something<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.890> looks

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
so you end up with something that looks

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.060 
so you end up with something that looks
like<00:01:47.550> this<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:50.450> then<00:01:51.450> before<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.620> start<00:01:52.980> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
like this and then before you start the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.960 
like this and then before you start the
the<00:01:53.970> next<00:01:54.540> fold<00:01:55.500> you're<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.370> just<00:01:56.520> flip

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
the next fold you're going to just flip

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.719 
the next fold you're going to just flip
it<00:01:57.090> around<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.440> solid<00:01:59.160> side<00:01:59.400> is

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it around so that the solid side is

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.820 
it around so that the solid side is
facing<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.570> next<00:02:04.050> thing<00:02:04.260> you<00:02:04.500> will<00:02:04.590> do

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
facing you the next thing you will do

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.890 
facing you the next thing you will do
once<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.550> at<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> place<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
once you're at a place like this is

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.310 
once you're at a place like this is
you're<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.130> fold<00:02:08.490> this<00:02:09.240> bottom<00:02:10.020> piece

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
you're going to fold this bottom piece

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.720 
you're going to fold this bottom piece
up<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.490> that<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.940> point<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.930> bottom<00:02:13.730> lines

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
up so that the point of the bottom lines

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.810 
up so that the point of the bottom lines
up<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.480> point<00:02:15.900> at<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> top<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.250> make<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
up with the point at the top so make a

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:32.340 
up with the point at the top so make a
fold<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.520> two<00:02:20.730> are<00:02:20.760> exactly<00:02:22.640> even

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.170 

and<00:02:32.440> your<00:02:33.070> piece<00:02:33.250> will<00:02:33.400> look<00:02:33.520> like<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:33.820> when

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
and your piece will look like this when

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.610 
and your piece will look like this when
you're<00:02:34.330> done<00:02:36.390> all<00:02:37.390> right<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:37.840> from<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.440> point

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
you're done all right so from this point

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.600 
you're done all right so from this point
you<00:02:39.580> are<00:02:39.610> going<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.540> then<00:02:40.750> fold<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.710> piece<00:02:42.220> in

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
you are going to then fold the piece in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.570 
you are going to then fold the piece in
on<00:02:43.390> itself<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.830> isn't<00:02:45.190> too<00:02:45.370> difficult

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
on itself and this isn't too difficult

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.660 
on itself and this isn't too difficult
at<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.470> at<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.530> point<00:02:48.040> because<00:02:48.280> you've

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
at this at this point because you've

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.490 
at this at this point because you've
already<00:02:49.060> got<00:02:49.210> that<00:02:49.420> guideline<00:02:49.720> fold<00:02:50.260> and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
already got that guideline fold and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.700 
already got that guideline fold and
there's<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.190> split<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.270> paper<00:02:52.540> right<00:02:53.440> there

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
there's a split in the paper right there

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.710 
there's a split in the paper right there
from<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.950> two<00:02:54.220> sides<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.000> come<00:02:55.360> in<00:02:55.570> to

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
from the two sides that have come in to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.300 
from the two sides that have come in to
meet<00:02:55.960> so<00:02:56.290> it's<00:02:56.500> your<00:02:57.220> really<00:02:57.490> folding<00:02:57.970> on<00:02:58.240> a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
meet so it's your really folding on a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.430 
meet so it's your really folding on a
less<00:03:00.310> paper<00:03:00.640> than<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.300> would<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.780> was<00:03:01.960> many

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
less paper than you would if it was many

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.120 
less paper than you would if it was many
many<00:03:02.620> layers<00:03:03.580> so<00:03:04.540> you've<00:03:05.140> gone<00:03:05.380> from<00:03:05.890> this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
many layers so you've gone from this

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.090 
many layers so you've gone from this
place<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.870> folded<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:08.110> on<00:03:08.260> itself<00:03:08.620> and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
place and folded it in on itself and

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.750 
place and folded it in on itself and
while<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.520> what<00:03:10.180> you'll<00:03:10.360> end<00:03:10.540> up<00:03:10.780> with<00:03:11.760> will

while you what you'll end up with will

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.140 
while you what you'll end up with will
look<00:03:12.970> like<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:14.010> where<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.190> white<00:03:15.430> part<00:03:15.970> of

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
look like this where the white part of

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.100 
look like this where the white part of
the<00:03:16.240> paper<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:17.130> visible<00:03:18.130> at<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:19.420> back<00:03:19.630> pointy

be pulling the pointed side up because

and<00:03:46.180> when<00:03:46.990> you<00:03:47.110> do<00:03:47.380> that<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.040> get<00:03:48.250> it<00:03:48.430> to

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
and when you do that and you get it to

and when you do that and you get it to
about<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.840> angle<00:03:50.470> here<00:03:51.090> you'll<00:03:52.090> see<00:03:52.180> it's

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
about this angle here you'll see it's

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.390 
about this angle here you'll see it's
it's<00:03:53.470> really<00:03:54.810> pushing<00:03:55.810> out<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.080> paper<00:03:56.620> right

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
it's really pushing out the paper right

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.700 
it's really pushing out the paper right
at<00:03:57.580> this<00:03:57.790> end<00:03:58.060> there's<00:03:58.600> no<00:03:58.840> fold<00:03:59.260> at<00:03:59.530> that

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
at this end there's no fold at that

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.070 
at this end there's no fold at that
point<00:04:00.100> um<00:04:02.190> already<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.430> you've<00:04:03.910> got<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.180> if

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
point um already and you've got to if

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.600 
point um already and you've got to if
you<00:04:05.230> look<00:04:05.380> at<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.680> way<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:05.890> can<00:04:06.070> kind<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.370> see

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
you look at this way you can kind of see

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.280 
you look at this way you can kind of see
when<00:04:06.820> I<00:04:06.850> when<00:04:07.270> I<00:04:07.300> pull<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:07.720> out<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:07.900> kind<00:04:08.230> of

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
when I when I pull it out it kind of

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.590 
when I when I pull it out it kind of
launches<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.190> out<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.550> then<00:04:09.940> you've<00:04:10.180> got<00:04:10.450> to

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
launches it out and then you've got to

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.560 
launches it out and then you've got to
push<00:04:10.930> down<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:12.130> get<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.270> that<00:04:13.420> it's

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
push down and and get it so that it's

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.270 
push down and and get it so that it's
nice<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:15.180> flat<00:04:16.180> again<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:17.440> we're<00:04:17.680> what<00:04:17.980> had

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
nice and flat again so we're what had

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.220 
nice and flat again so we're what had
been<00:04:18.549> folded<00:04:19.150> when<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.600> was<00:04:19.720> folded<00:04:20.080> all<00:04:20.200> the

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
been folded when it was folded all the

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.160 
been folded when it was folded all the
way<00:04:20.410> back<00:04:20.620> is<00:04:20.950> not<00:04:21.130> where<00:04:21.370> your<00:04:21.580> its<00:04:22.480> naturally

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
way back is not where your its naturally

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.080 
way back is not where your its naturally
going<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:23.590> end<00:04:23.770> up<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.370> need<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.730> create<00:04:25.000> a

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
going to end up so you need to create a

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.430 
going to end up so you need to create a
new<00:04:25.180> folder<00:04:26.910> but<00:04:27.910> then<00:04:28.090> you'll<00:04:28.240> have

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.670 

something<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.530> looks<00:04:32.560> like<00:04:32.740> this<00:04:34.680> okay

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
something that looks like this okay

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.460 
something that looks like this okay
we're<00:04:35.860> almost<00:04:35.980> there<00:04:36.250> uh<00:04:37.260> what<00:04:38.260> we're<00:04:38.380> going

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
we're almost there uh what we're going

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.120 
we're almost there uh what we're going
to<00:04:38.560> do<00:04:38.650> next<00:04:38.830> is<00:04:39.400> create<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.270> wings<00:04:40.540> of<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
to do next is create the wings of the

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.850 
to do next is create the wings of the
Pelican

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
Pelican

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.679 
Pelican
and<00:04:42.949> in<00:04:43.370> order<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.639> do<00:04:43.849> that<00:04:44.000> you're<00:04:44.300> going<00:04:44.449> to

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:44.689 
and in order to do that you're going to

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.059 
and in order to do that you're going to
take<00:04:44.930> this<00:04:45.770> flap<00:04:46.699> here<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:47.419> fold<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.379> up<00:04:48.560> you

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
take this flap here and fold it up you

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.600 
take this flap here and fold it up you
want<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.340> make<00:04:49.520> sure<00:04:49.550> that<00:04:50.150> it's<00:04:50.419> lined<00:04:50.900> up

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
want to make sure that it's lined up

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.300 
want to make sure that it's lined up
with<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.639> angle<00:04:53.270> here<00:04:53.689> so<00:04:54.560> you're<00:04:55.129> going<00:04:55.250> to

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
with the angle here so you're going to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.339 
with the angle here so you're going to
just<00:04:55.430> fold<00:04:55.759> it<00:04:56.000> up<00:04:56.150> and<00:04:56.330> your<00:04:56.479> and<00:04:56.659> then<00:04:56.990> fold

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
just fold it up and your and then fold

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.920 
just fold it up and your and then fold
it<00:04:57.469> back<00:04:57.620> down<00:04:57.860> just<00:04:58.669> to<00:04:58.789> create<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.330> the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
it back down just to create the the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.589 
it back down just to create the the
crease<00:05:00.229> flip<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.159> piece<00:05:01.370> around<00:05:01.729> and<00:05:02.090> do<00:05:02.479> the

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
crease flip the piece around and do the

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.929 
crease flip the piece around and do the
same<00:05:02.810> thing<00:05:03.199> on<00:05:03.439> this<00:05:04.099> side<00:05:04.159> and<00:05:04.340> remember

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:04.939 
same thing on this side and remember

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.020 
same thing on this side and remember
you're<00:05:05.120> you're<00:05:05.719> right<00:05:06.680> in<00:05:06.919> line<00:05:07.189> along<00:05:07.879> the

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
you're you're right in line along the

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:17.590 
you're you're right in line along the
top<00:05:08.240> end<00:05:08.449> here

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.820 

and<00:05:17.840> when<00:05:18.350> you're<00:05:18.470> done<00:05:18.620> they'll<00:05:19.580> be<00:05:20.830> sticking

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
and when you're done they'll be sticking

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.380 
and when you're done they'll be sticking
out<00:05:21.950> like<00:05:21.980> that<00:05:24.130> all<00:05:25.130> right<00:05:25.340> so<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:25.880> very<00:05:26.090> last

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
out like that all right so the very last

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.230 
out like that all right so the very last
thing<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:27.080> we<00:05:27.440> need<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.740> do<00:05:27.920> then<00:05:28.160> is<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.880> bend

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
thing that we need to do then is to bend

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.040 
thing that we need to do then is to bend
the<00:05:29.570> head<00:05:29.810> forward<00:05:30.410> of<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.710> Pelican<00:05:31.370> and<00:05:32.050> in

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
the head forward of the Pelican and in

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.350 
the head forward of the Pelican and in
order<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.950> make<00:05:34.340> that<00:05:34.400> happen<00:05:34.820> because<00:05:35.150> we're

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
order to make that happen because we're

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.100 
order to make that happen because we're
going<00:05:35.600> to<00:05:35.690> do<00:05:35.930> one<00:05:36.320> of<00:05:36.380> those<00:05:36.560> inside<00:05:37.280> reverse

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
going to do one of those inside reverse

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.570 
going to do one of those inside reverse
folds<00:05:39.110> or<00:05:39.260> you're<00:05:39.680> sort<00:05:39.860> of<00:05:39.890> pushing<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.400> in

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
folds or you're sort of pushing it in

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.110 
folds or you're sort of pushing it in
and<00:05:41.800> again<00:05:42.800> it<00:05:43.100> makes<00:05:43.250> it<00:05:43.430> easier<00:05:43.730> if<00:05:43.850> you<00:05:43.940> do<00:05:44.090> a

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
and again it makes it easier if you do a

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.920 
and again it makes it easier if you do a
little<00:05:44.270> bit<00:05:44.510> of<00:05:44.540> a<00:05:44.660> guideline<00:05:44.930> fold<00:05:45.530> first<00:05:45.920> so

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
little bit of a guideline fold first so

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:54.070 
little bit of a guideline fold first so
fold<00:05:47.930> it<00:05:48.110> first<00:05:48.380> in<00:05:48.620> one<00:05:48.800> direction<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:53.080> then

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
fold it first in one direction and then

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.730 
fold it first in one direction and then
in<00:05:54.440> the<00:05:55.100> other<00:05:55.250> direction<00:05:56.350> that<00:05:57.350> will<00:05:57.500> create

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
in the other direction that will create

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.930 
in the other direction that will create
your<00:05:57.920> fold<00:05:58.220> and<00:05:58.750> then<00:06:00.190> you<00:06:01.190> need<00:06:01.340> to<00:06:01.460> open<00:06:01.640> it

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
your fold and then you need to open it

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.450 
your fold and then you need to open it
up<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.180> bit<00:06:02.210> here<00:06:02.800> on<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:05.830> you<00:06:06.830> can<00:06:06.950> see<00:06:07.160> there

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
up a bit here on the you can see there

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:15.010 
up a bit here on the you can see there
you<00:06:07.610> go<00:06:11.440> push<00:06:12.440> it<00:06:12.590> in<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:13.090> it<00:06:14.090> should<00:06:14.390> catch

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
you go push it in and it should catch

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:25.410 
you go push it in and it should catch
right<00:06:15.500> on<00:06:15.680> those<00:06:15.860> bolts<00:06:16.250> that<00:06:16.370> you<00:06:16.490> just<00:06:16.730> did

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.180 

and<00:06:25.990> the<00:06:26.050> paper<00:06:26.290> is<00:06:26.440> kind<00:06:26.620> of<00:06:26.740> thick<00:06:26.950> right

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190
