00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.890
 Good afternoon, dear colleagues, I continue 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.150
 series of videos about wobblers from my fighting 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 boxes now I want to introduce you well 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.050
 probably the most loud wobbler 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.720
 which i have is damn it 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.239
 Balisong from company Yandex will but 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.260
 this is the floating version it means 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.160
 length 130 millimeters its weight is 21 barely 10 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.750
 grams test version 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.120
 Suspender 2480 gamers almost 20 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.559
 rattle can not immediately say 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.710
 absolutely huge meaning there is a kitchen 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.600
 I 2 activity pike this wobbler which 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.900
 able to call 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.170
 account to myself but with a large enough 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.869
 distances oozing water and even when you 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.270
 just scream and you hear it Does 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.890
 being on the surface is not enough 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.840
 knew that is this me two and not three 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.580
 Meters this already so ten meters 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.369
 very clear and definitely good 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.080
 pay attention to the body structure of this 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.720
 cities are not massive enough 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.479
 round it allows him to pause 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.270
 day of holes during the pause ascending yes he 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.729
 still continues to oscillate 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:51.050
 u had sunde still have younger brother but i 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.690
 I consider it a mistake of some kind for this 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.539
 firms are he firstly in size 100 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.700
 millimeters how much I tried it 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.940
 use even there on pressed 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.130
 ponds and so on 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.510
 not quite at this little one 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.640
 the size of the sotochka to the volume that 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.940
 There is but principle he as would 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.680
 still scare the fish 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.950
 so this is a wobbler for large 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.450
 reservoirs under a good active pike or 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.810
 cheek to lure out 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.400
 from afar means he has 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.000
 big enough shovel you well 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.000
 goes down 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.820
 but its working depth is clearly quite 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.590
 absolutely it is up to one and a half meters 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.190
 Suspender can naturally be driven and 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.750
 and more but even there up to two meters 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.190
 it hangs in the water column enough 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.330
 fine but i'm so small 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.250
 titanium leashes principle like yes 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.460
 without a leash usually does not seem to affect 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.410
 him as a suspender and he 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.530
 heavy enough here suspender 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.080
 especially up to 25 grams of weight flies well and 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 there is a long casting system that is 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.750
 it was in windy weather when noisy like 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.930
 when you need to attract fish when you eat 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.030
 wave and then I then quite clearly 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.670
 absolutely insert were bags 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.250
 these are wobblers which is really 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.690
 help lure pike out of the deep if you 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.440
 even catch on some pit there up to 5 thousand 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.540
 and meters absolutely uniquely is pike 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:29.390
 pike in this pit will come for 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.840
 this wobbler well what follows up 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.840
 all the best 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:04:18.650
 just perfect neutral subtract from 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:04:19.400
 Lady olenna and quality good wine 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:34.540
 settlements 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:38.169
 festival which would have gone the same chance as 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.169
 NATO hooked strongly 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.849
 there is 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:59.010
 it is at least decently
