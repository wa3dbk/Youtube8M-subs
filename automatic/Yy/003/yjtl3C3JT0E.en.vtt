00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
bad thing but first of all before we get

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.479 
bad thing but first of all before we get
into<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.750> let's<00:00:52.530> talk<00:00:52.710> about<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> iphone

besides skype in whatever and FaceTime

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
besides skype in whatever and FaceTime
and<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:07.290> doesn't<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.619> beautiful<00:01:07.890> specs

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and it doesn't have the beautiful specs

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.630 
and it doesn't have the beautiful specs
like<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.570> iphone<00:01:09.960> does<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.250> more<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
like the iphone does so that's more of a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.120 
like the iphone does so that's more of a
fair<00:01:12.510> comparison<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.409> way<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:13.950> very

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
fair comparison in a way there are very

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.789 
fair comparison in a way there are very
similar<00:01:14.430> devices<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.720> yeah<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.439> fancier

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
similar devices but yeah it's fancier

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.859
