00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.490
 here is the thermomix tm 5 in the back 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.080
 a new cooking robot 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.090
 multifunction we are going to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.009
 demonstrate some features that 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.210
 we rather enjoyed and also 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.180
 some functions that they have us 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.920
 left a little more doubtful then already 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.619
 what we liked is his big screen 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.980
 touch in color that presents a 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.689
 true comfort to use and its 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 recipe guide as we will see 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.960
 but we have a recipe guide that we 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.239
 allows us to be guided step by step 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 so here in this case it's about 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.440
 200 recipes from my kitchen everyday 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.350
 that can be classified by category 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.660
 in alphabetical order 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.309
 we can scroll through them then 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.820
 the advantage of the guide as we see 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.199
 we're going to start here it's going 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.160
 give us the list of ingredients 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.780
 we can prepare in advance is really 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.410
 left the user in the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.750
 ingredients to install the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.970
 manipulations and there in fact they settle 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.890
 automatically the temperature 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.439
 there in this case there is no 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.689
 heating on this recipe starting on 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.400
 time and just adjust with the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.420
 dial the rotation speed for 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.710
 start both the preparation and the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.439
 closing the lid as we go 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.750
 see 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.310
 and here he is launching alone 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 among the things that left us a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.880
 little more dubious we find the key 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.240
 recipes the key recipes cements on the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.890
 left side of the thermomix this is a 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.490
 proprietary key 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.810
 it is neither a sd card nor a usb key 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.140
 it's really a proprietary format 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.880
 thermomix this one my cooking at 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.420
 daily contains 200 recipes she is 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.640
 original livery with thermomix 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.229
 only what we regret is that if 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.590
 the key is not to install on the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.080
 thermomix what's going on 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.959
 we will have access to the recipes we 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.730
 have already realized in the form of 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.340
 historical 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.110
 but we do not have access to a guide 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.390
 step by step it just keeps the recipes 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.400
 but not the preparation it really takes 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.650
 the key is installed on the device 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.600
 there is a function that we appreciate 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.690
 of course the thermomix is the function 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.750
 late from where the pressure because she 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.700
 is not present on all robots 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.530
 far from it certainly it is not so 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.049
 specifies that a kitchen scale a little 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.269
 however developed for most 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.799
 preparations proposed in recipes 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.489
 Thermomix is more than enough 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.350
 and the little novelty on the tee 5 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.799
 it is also able to 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.299
 weigh even in small operation 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.070
 speed 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.079
 here is my thermomix application 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.160
 will be able to use in addition to 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.610
 recipe guide we have on 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.440
 the device 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.030
 to use it just in one 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.860
 first time to create an account 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.350
 since the application has to become a 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.100
 true personal space what is that 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.260
 I will find in 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.510
 already I once recorded all the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.579
 recipes that figure which appears on the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.280
 key recipes I have by 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.079
 example the key recipes my cooking at 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.870
 daily with its 200 recipes 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.760
 I will be able to transfer them on 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.760
 the application how simply 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.070
 registering the unique number that figures 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.959
 at the back of the key each key of 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.480
 each user to a number that does not 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.920
 which is not duplicate then I'm going 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.260
 find on the application of recipes 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.420
 some free others that I'm going 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.580
 able to buy note 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.220
 recipes that cost around 4 euros 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.200
 the pack of 10 which are classified by theme 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.780
 then all these recipes I'm going 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.950
 can use them to plan my 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:55.489
 menus over a week so I'm going 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.690
 able to move for example there for the 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.739
 Wednesday 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.020
 I had planned some quick pines and then 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.650
 finally that day I did not have dinner at 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.050
 the house so I'm going to move them I 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.489
 tell me I wanted to do Monday 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.090
 next 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.950
 here I am going to be able to put 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.140
 annotations also for example I 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.400
 noted that on Thursday night we were getting granny 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.340
 at home to think about doing some 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.350
 concerts accordingly and especially this 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.720
 which is convenient with this function 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.240
 is that the application will offer me 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.270
 automatic list preparation 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.310
 races that contain all the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.620
 ingredients I need to 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.990
 make the chosen recipes out of 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.220
 The menu of the week 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.930
 that's a very nice feature 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.600
 practice that can be used since 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.210
 anywhere you can prepare your menus 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.990
 returning from the office for example and 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.610
 make the shopping list 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.669
 automatically and it's really very 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.610
 practice we have a regret anyway 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.350
 that on each recipe there is a calculation 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.610
 nutritional values ​​that very 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.330
 practice for athletes for 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.350
 people on the diet 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.790
 we would have really liked the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.440
 Calculation of nutritional values 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.270
 can be done on every meal where 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.480
 every day what is not yet 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.480
 possible
