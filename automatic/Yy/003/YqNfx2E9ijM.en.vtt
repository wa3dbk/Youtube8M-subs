00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
this as I said the throat it is not

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.890 
this as I said the throat it is not
amazing<00:04:17.049> but<00:04:17.230> the<00:04:17.470> flavor<00:04:18.480> yeah<00:04:19.480> it<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.690> it's

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
amazing but the flavor yeah it is it's

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.360 
amazing but the flavor yeah it is it's
smooth<00:04:20.230> it's<00:04:21.010> something<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.730> just<00:04:23.280> when<00:04:24.280> you

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
smooth it's something that just when you

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.340 
smooth it's something that just when you
exhale<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.330> don't<00:04:25.690> get<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.080> really

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
exhale it you don't get that really

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.200 
exhale it you don't get that really
strong<00:04:26.650> berry<00:04:26.890> flavor<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.430> is<00:04:27.520> much<00:04:27.760> smoother

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
strong berry flavor it is much smoother

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.960 
strong berry flavor it is much smoother
on<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.480> exhale<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.770> aftertaste<00:04:30.550> in<00:04:30.820> my<00:04:30.850> mouth

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
on the exhale the aftertaste in my mouth

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.260 
on the exhale the aftertaste in my mouth
is<00:04:31.419> similar<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:32.020> eating<00:04:32.890> frozen<00:04:33.250> berries<00:04:34.090> that
