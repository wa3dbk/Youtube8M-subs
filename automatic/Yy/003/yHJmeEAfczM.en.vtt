thinking because in the Premier League

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.799 
thinking because in the Premier League
the<00:00:32.730> majority<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.210> people<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.540> watch<00:00:33.660> my

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the majority of people that watch my

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.420 
the majority of people that watch my
videos<00:00:34.079> would<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> big<00:00:34.680> premier<00:00:35.280> league

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
videos would have a big premier league

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.799 
videos would have a big premier league
club<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.730> they<00:00:35.820> support<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
club that they support and that was a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.910 
club that they support and that was a
reason<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.350> would<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:37.680> sensitive

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
reason that they would get all sensitive

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.740 
reason that they would get all sensitive
but<00:00:38.219> maybe<00:00:38.550> we'll<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.570> wait<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
but maybe we'll just have to wait and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.970 
but maybe we'll just have to wait and
see<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.170> does<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.500> wait<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.739> hopefully

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
see what does have to wait see hopefully

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.500 
see what does have to wait see hopefully

it<00:01:15.840> down<00:01:15.960> grade<00:01:16.200> more<00:01:16.380> than<00:01:16.530> likely<00:01:16.680> will

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it down grade more than likely will

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.200 
it down grade more than likely will
definitely<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:17.610> grade<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
definitely get it down grade is going to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.690 
definitely get it down grade is going to
be<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.509> fella<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.350> Dortmund<00:01:19.770> 83<00:01:20.280> rated<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
be one fella for Dortmund 83 rated a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.520 
be one fella for Dortmund 83 rated a
pretty<00:01:20.909> good<00:01:21.060> rating<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> starter<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:21.990> 14

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pretty good rating at the starter for 14

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
pretty good rating at the starter for 14
but<00:01:23.009> FIFA<00:01:23.310> 15<00:01:23.430> again<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.479> having<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
but FIFA 15 again not having a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
but FIFA 15 again not having a
tremendous<00:01:25.170> season<00:01:25.470> by<00:01:25.890> any<00:01:26.040> means<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
tremendous season by any means and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.219 
tremendous season by any means and
definitely<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.330> matching<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.720> standards<00:01:28.140> of

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
definitely not matching the standards of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230 
definitely not matching the standards of
his<00:01:28.350> previous<00:01:28.560> season<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> think<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.759> 81

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
his previous season so I think that 81

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
his previous season so I think that 81
rate<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.020> fair<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.229> him<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
rate is going to be fair for him and of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.080 
rate is going to be fair for him and of
course<00:01:32.009> he's<00:01:32.400> getting<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:32.790> bit<00:01:32.970> older

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
course he's getting a little bit older

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
course he's getting a little bit older
as<00:01:33.299> well<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.140> never<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.619> anyway<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
as well so you never know but anyway I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
as well so you never know but anyway I
took<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.490> rated<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.090> fella<00:01:36.329> another

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
took one rated for one fella another

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.999 
took one rated for one fella another
player<00:01:36.990> from<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.200> Bundesliga<00:01:37.710> getting<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
player from the Bundesliga getting a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.399 
player from the Bundesliga getting a
downgrade<00:01:38.430> will<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.790> Elia<00:01:39.240> he<00:01:39.509> was<00:01:39.659> only<00:01:39.869> 76

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
downgrade will be Elia he was only 76

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
downgrade will be Elia he was only 76
rated<00:01:40.770> at<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.070> starter<00:01:41.369> fifa<00:01:41.549> 14<00:01:41.759> which<00:01:42.090> is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
rated at the starter fifa 14 which is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.429 
rated at the starter fifa 14 which is
why<00:01:42.360> i<00:01:42.390> haven't<00:01:42.750> given<00:01:42.899> him<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.200> massive

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
why i haven't given him a massive

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.710 
why i haven't given him a massive
downgrade<00:01:43.950> by<00:01:44.130> any<00:01:44.280> means<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:44.759> yeah<00:01:45.420> he<00:01:45.570> did

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
downgrade by any means but yeah he did

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.060 
downgrade by any means but yeah he did
not<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.020> greatest<00:01:46.500> season<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.950> i

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
not have that greatest season and i

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.100 
not have that greatest season and i
don't<00:01:47.970> think<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.240> he<00:01:48.420> had<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> lobe<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
don't think that he had the lobe the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.899 
don't think that he had the lobe the
sort<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.409> season<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.770> should<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.189> him<00:01:50.399> go<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
sort of season that should see him go to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
sort of season that should see him go to
a<00:01:51.000> silver<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.840> I've<00:01:52.020> kept<00:01:52.290> him<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> gold<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
cup right now he's almost trash I mean I

cup right now he's almost trash I mean I
that's<00:02:06.600> pretty<00:02:06.869> no<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.200> pretty<00:02:07.320> harsh<00:02:07.560> but

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that's pretty no that's pretty harsh but

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
that's pretty no that's pretty harsh but
he<00:02:08.069> has<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.369> been<00:02:08.550> great<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.030> yeah<00:02:09.420> he

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
he has not been great and yeah he

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.800 
he has not been great and yeah he
definitely<00:02:09.720> shouldn't<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.140> an<00:02:10.229> 82

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
definitely shouldn't be an 82

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.930 
definitely shouldn't be an 82
I<00:02:10.869> predict<00:02:11.260> he<00:02:11.349> will<00:02:11.380> be<00:02:11.590> maybe<00:02:11.890> even<00:02:12.069> in<00:02:12.220> 1850

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
I predict he will be maybe even in 1850

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.630 
I predict he will be maybe even in 1850
14<00:02:13.330> or<00:02:13.480> fifa<00:02:13.780> 15<00:02:13.900> but<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.800> given<00:02:14.980> him<00:02:15.160> an<00:02:15.280> 81

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.040 
van der vaart of course the ex Tottenham
player<00:02:24.489> was<00:02:24.670> an<00:02:24.760> absolute<00:02:25.150> gun<00:02:25.420> for<00:02:25.660> them<00:02:25.780> but

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
player was an absolute gun for them but

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.390 
player was an absolute gun for them but
since<00:02:26.319> going<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.590> hamburgers<00:02:27.010> mean<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.280> know

since going to hamburgers mean you know
he<00:02:27.519> hasn't<00:02:27.819> been<00:02:27.940> tremendous<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.599> 83<00:02:29.200> rated

a player of his caliber so I reckon

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.460 
a player of his caliber so I reckon
maybe<00:04:23.940> just<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.330> one<00:04:24.510> overall<00:04:24.840> decrease<00:04:25.260> again

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
maybe just a one overall decrease again

maybe just a one overall decrease again
Dante<00:04:26.310> it's<00:04:26.640> not<00:04:26.760> like<00:04:26.880> he's<00:04:27.030> at<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.240> world

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.400 
cup so you know he hasn't been you know
two<00:04:29.400> outstanding<00:04:30.150> for<00:04:30.660> him<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.930> get<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.170> spot

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
two outstanding for him to get a spot

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.080 
two outstanding for him to get a spot
over<00:04:31.530> guys<00:04:31.770> like<00:04:31.800> dabbled<00:04:32.280> Louise<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.790> Thiago

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.060 
over guys like dabbled Louise and Thiago
Silva<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.810> do<00:04:33.990> think<00:04:34.230> one<00:04:34.470> overall<00:04:34.740> decrease

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
Silva so I do think one overall decrease

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.250 
very poor and just did not have that
great<00:05:19.950> an<00:05:20.850> end<00:05:21.060> of<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.240> season<00:05:21.390> in<00:05:21.690> comparison

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
great an end of a season in comparison

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.140 
great an end of a season in comparison
to<00:05:22.350> Robin<00:05:22.680> so<00:05:22.950> that's<00:05:23.190> why<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.400> think<00:05:23.580> you<00:05:23.730> can't

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
to Robin so that's why I think you can't

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.050 
to Robin so that's why I think you can't
you<00:05:24.720> just<00:05:24.900> can't<00:05:25.230> have<00:05:25.530> river<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:25.950> higher<00:05:26.520> rated

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
you just can't have river a higher rated

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.150 
you just can't have river a higher rated
than<00:05:27.210> Robin<00:05:27.540> in<00:05:27.720> fifa15<00:05:28.410> it<00:05:28.740> just<00:05:28.890> wouldn't

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
than Robin in fifa15 it just wouldn't

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.520 
than Robin in fifa15 it just wouldn't
make<00:05:29.190> sense<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:29.880> would<00:05:30.000> absolutely

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
make sense you would absolutely

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.930 
make sense you would absolutely
definitely<00:05:31.530> say<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:31.830> Robin<00:05:32.280> was<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.730> better

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
definitely say that Robin was the better

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.760 
definitely say that Robin was the better
of<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.300> two<00:05:33.480> going<00:05:33.930> into<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.380> end<00:05:34.530> of<00:05:34.620> last

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
of the two going into the end of last

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.560 
of the two going into the end of last
season<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.280> you<00:05:35.670> know<00:05:35.790> he<00:05:36.090> probably<00:05:36.240> should

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
season and you know he probably should

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.090 
season and you know he probably should
be<00:05:36.660> higher<00:05:36.810> rated<00:05:37.200> then<00:05:37.320> ribber<00:05:37.590> II<00:05:37.680> but<00:05:37.950> I've

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
be higher rated then ribber II but I've

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.190 
be higher rated then ribber II but I've
decided<00:05:38.490> against<00:05:39.000> that<00:05:39.060> I've<00:05:39.300> made<00:05:39.750> them<00:05:39.900> both

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
decided against that I've made them both

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.920 
decided against that I've made them both
89<00:05:41.100> rated<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:41.670> yes<00:05:41.880> reverie<00:05:42.480> will<00:05:42.720> get<00:05:42.900> a

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
89 rated so yes reverie will get a

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.930 
89 rated so yes reverie will get a
downgrade<00:05:43.410> Robin<00:05:44.010> will<00:05:44.130> get<00:05:44.250> an<00:05:44.340> upgrade<00:05:44.490> and

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
downgrade Robin will get an upgrade and

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.400 
downgrade Robin will get an upgrade and
that's<00:05:45.270> that<00:05:45.510> they're<00:05:45.720> both<00:05:45.990> be<00:05:46.170> adding

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
that's that they're both be adding

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.110 
that's that they're both be adding
unrated<00:05:46.890> and<00:05:47.040> I<00:05:47.100> think<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:47.460> that's<00:05:47.550> fair<00:05:47.850> but

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
unrated and I think that that's fair but

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.610 
unrated and I think that that's fair but
that<00:05:48.270> was<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:48.540> end<00:05:48.690> of<00:05:48.870> this<00:05:48.990> player<00:05:49.290> rating

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
that was the end of this player rating
