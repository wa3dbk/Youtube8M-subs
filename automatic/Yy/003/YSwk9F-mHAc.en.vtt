00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.439
 m 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.540
 hello to all and all these extremes 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.030
 origin so we end up for one 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.189
 little video on black ops 2 in zombies 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.550
 I present you today the new 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:22.539
 secret tears weapon of black ops 2 he 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.920
 must be mounted on the transit map 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.539
 so then you know it on this map 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.210
 can be mounted for example the turbine or 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.360
 things like that on species of 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.460
 table is so here for this weapon is 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.110
 morally well for example if we find 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.430
 the turbine all the parts of the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.129
 turbine are in the first room 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.530
 but for this weapon the pieces they 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.020
 are they are a bit throughout the map 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.420
 and even times at stops or wine 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.350
 in places where the bus does not stop 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.160
 so that's why it's a bit 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.690
 difficult to mount so then if there is 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.699
 who are not yet familiar with 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.079
 places if you want if you 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.379
 send me messages I could 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.690
 maybe a tutorial but otherwise what they 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.300
 see pretty much so this is between the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.490
 departure and the first stop so towards the 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.250
 m16 if there are some who see this is there 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.050
 there is a room after there is a room a 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.190
 art der untoten so that I will make you a 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.259
 tutor to go because I know 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.670
 that there are not many people who know 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.360
 there is one who is after 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.490
 electricity 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.470
 once you turn on electricity after 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.020
 the floor just not if you see there the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.599
 jump where we can die and well there we have 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.030
 one piece and after the last piece 

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:30.709
 she is in a small house 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.410
 so here I am in town and ben if we 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.550
 where the bus comes from and where 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.500
 turn right at a time we can 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.729
 fall on a little house and in 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.179
 this little house will find the 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.440
 counter we see on this weapon so 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.330
 then the counter is very important 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.360
 that's where we see a little bit our 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.270
 ammunition since ammunition tears 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 unlimited but made the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.140
 the driver will serve us 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.899
 of indicator when can we 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.750
 to use the train or not because we have a 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.850
 green zone is a red zone and as soon as 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.860
 the arm will fall in the red zone 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.560
 we can destroy it and lose everything 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.929
 the work we did so I'll 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.670
 advise to be really careful 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.410
 for the down Ã‰guille 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.970
 it is imperative that we have it in 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.569
 the soul so the pressure the frost in the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.860
 hand so the ewer goes down knowing 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.290
 we can not sprint once we 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.950
 alarm in the hands it really takes 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.280
 pay attention 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.380
 2 how we use it here so I 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.310
 am almost in the red so I have to 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.610
 I have to change weapons 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.930
 here I am using my late m alas the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.280
 guines does not go back since I'm not going 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.349
 not in the hand so it is absolutely necessary 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.310
 that I take it 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.130
 that's what's a bit of a hassle with 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.989
 this weapon so here he is obliged must the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.750
 take and after the ewer goes down again he 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.920
 go back down slowly so 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.470
 I do not know if you see well 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.480
 in the video so this is the counter of 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.260
 left I want the one I'm talking about 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.160
 there is a green zone is a red zone 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.380
 I hope these little tips you 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.120
