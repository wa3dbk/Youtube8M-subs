I'm gonna show you that the jet is
really<00:04:10.560> sensitive<00:04:10.950> but<00:04:11.190> I'm<00:04:11.280> going<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.489> show

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
really sensitive but I'm going to show

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.100 
really sensitive but I'm going to show
you<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.849> you<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.209> get<00:04:12.360> into<00:04:12.629> it<00:04:12.810> with<00:04:12.959> this

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
you that you can get into it with this

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.770 
you that you can get into it with this
thing<00:04:13.349> it's<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.819> not<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.090> easiest<00:04:15.569> way<00:04:15.750> to

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
thing it's it's not the easiest way to

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.420 
thing it's it's not the easiest way to
do<00:04:16.019> it

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
do it

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.240 
do it
but<00:04:18.049> whatever<00:04:19.049> we<00:04:19.199> got<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.350> deliverable<00:04:19.829> we<00:04:20.070> got

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
but whatever we got a deliverable we got

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.330 
but whatever we got a deliverable we got
so<00:04:20.519> just<00:04:21.049> once<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.139> get<00:04:22.260> this<00:04:22.380> thing<00:04:22.590> just<00:04:23.130> go

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
so just once you get this thing just go

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.250 
so just once you get this thing just go
tap<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.850> on<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.180> side<00:04:24.419> even<00:04:24.840> though<00:04:25.020> this

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
tap it on the side even though this

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.750 
tap it on the side even though this
thing<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.530> really<00:04:25.770> sensitive<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:26.580> don't

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
thing is really sensitive so just don't

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.340 
thing is really sensitive so just don't
get<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.030> run<00:04:27.210> at<00:04:27.419> it<00:04:27.449> or<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.870> will<00:04:27.990> definitely

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
get a run at it or it will definitely

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.590 
get a run at it or it will definitely
blow<00:04:28.500> up<00:04:28.729> which<00:04:29.729> is<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.060> only<00:04:30.180> out<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.510> only

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
blow up which is the only out you only

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.529 
blow up which is the only out you only
have<00:04:30.840> one<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.080> these<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.500> play<00:04:31.740> with<00:04:32.010> so<00:04:32.250> just

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
have one of these to play with so just

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.270 
have one of these to play with so just
suck<00:04:33.539> so<00:04:33.840> if<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.440> blows<00:04:34.590> up<00:04:34.650> yet<00:04:35.070> either

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
suck so if it blows up yet either

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.969 
suck so if it blows up yet either
restart<00:04:35.729> or<00:04:36.000> just<00:04:36.240> way<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.470> time<00:04:37.680> when<00:04:37.889> it

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
restart or just way to the time when it

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.480 
restart or just way to the time when it
runs<00:04:38.100> out<00:04:38.310> but<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.270> one<00:04:39.419> for<00:04:39.660> Xbox<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:41.220> I

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
runs out but the one for Xbox this I

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.150 
runs out but the one for Xbox this I
know<00:04:41.699> has<00:04:42.090> three<00:04:42.479> of<00:04:42.510> them<00:04:42.750> but<00:04:43.169> so<00:04:43.530> far<00:04:43.740> on<00:04:43.889> ps3

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
know has three of them but so far on ps3

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.469 
know has three of them but so far on ps3
they're<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.729> mission<00:04:45.150> with<00:04:45.530> one<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.650> them<00:04:46.800> so

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
they're just mission with one of them so

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.640 
they're just mission with one of them so
kind<00:04:48.479> of<00:04:48.600> sucks<00:04:48.810> but<00:04:49.020> as<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.229> can<00:04:49.289> see<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.500> get

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
kind of sucks but as you can see I get

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.770 
kind of sucks but as you can see I get
it<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.830> crack<00:04:50.099> right<00:04:50.130> there<00:04:50.419> now<00:04:51.419> if<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.630> just

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
it to crack right there now if you just

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.290 
it to crack right there now if you just
tap<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.139> again<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.530> goes<00:04:52.710> down<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.550> ground

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.779 

this<00:04:57.300> plane<00:04:57.569> is<00:04:57.599> fly<00:04:58.169> but<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.490> rather

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
this plane is fly but it is rather

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.520 
this plane is fly but it is rather
difficult<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.449> get<00:05:00.630> into<00:05:00.780> but<00:05:01.139> once<00:05:01.319> you<00:05:01.410> get

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
difficult to get into but once you get

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.200 
difficult to get into but once you get
the<00:05:01.620> hang<00:05:01.650> of<00:05:01.949> it<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:02.190> where<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.610> stand<00:05:02.880> and

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
the hang of it and where to stand and

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.180 
the hang of it and where to stand and
stuff<00:05:03.449> you<00:05:04.110> should<00:05:04.319> be<00:05:04.470> pretty<00:05:04.680> good<00:05:04.800> as<00:05:05.160> you

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
stuff you should be pretty good as you

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.339 
stuff you should be pretty good as you
can<00:05:05.400> see<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.550> get<00:05:05.789> it<00:05:05.819> open<00:05:06.180> here<00:05:06.389> so<00:05:06.539> I'm<00:05:07.259> gonna

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
for some reason the game was lagging out

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.620
