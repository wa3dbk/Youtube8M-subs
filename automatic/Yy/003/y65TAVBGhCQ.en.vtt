 the magnet is to get the long 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.450
 desired will always be better to file than 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.520
 cut as long as it's not so much 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.920
 that you have to lower so you're going to avoid 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.960

 do not forget to put a base before the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.610
 enamel when we skip this step 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.280
 the nails can be yellow and without 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.229
 life this base you get in any 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.330
 beauty shop for the care of the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.040
 cuticle instead of cutting it you can 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.640
 use almond oil to 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.640
 hydrate it 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.660
 and use an orange stick to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.660
 start it 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.630
 if that same oil heats it if a 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.760
 little bit you put it on your nails and you will see 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.800
