00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.890
 The recession the country is going through caused that only in the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.320
 first quarter of this year the Mexican economy will plummet in 8

 the manifestation let's say socioeconomic more immediately the pri 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.340
 the destruction of employment

 On one side 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.560

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.180
 only about five hundred thousand jobs were lost but statistics 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.020
 Unofficial assure that the figure is higher 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.670

 of the international economic recession 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.380
 but I'm convinced 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.970
