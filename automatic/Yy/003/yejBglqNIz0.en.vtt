00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.349
 this fashion introduces us this fashion there 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.240
 introduces a new dimension and a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.090
 lots of new items this new 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.289
 tropics then began to make you 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.180
 see some object this fashion 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.460
 introduces a truly diverse number of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.310
 objects including many weapons that will be 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.560
 possible to craft with item that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.780
 we will only find a lot of in that world 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.680
 masks masks because I really mean 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.329
 ie masks look at the aesthetics you see 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.390
 just the really pretty mask 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.239
 I recommend this fashion especially to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 who wants to do series or e 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.050
 maybe you want to have fun in a way 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.820
 alternative on minecraft introduces the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.090
 new items however we go to see them 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.940
 after then the item we say main of 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.609
 this mode is the encyclopedia of 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.379

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.549
 objects we found in the course 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.590
 of our adventure 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.390
 we'll see all the crafting we can do 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.130
 for example, as you can see, there really are 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 lots of pages and look at her 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.070

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.439
 there are lots of items we can 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.869

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.049

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.710

 our pina colada suddenly 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.160
 downloading terrain will succeed and create us 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.110
 a new dimension 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.960
 we have to wait a little and here we are 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.010
 here guys look where we are 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.320
 we are in the tropics beautiful boys here 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.780
 we find our first bamboo 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.490
 chest where nothing will be inside 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.080
 we say is our beginning is here the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.000
 portal to return to size 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.500
 normal 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.280
 look at how many and how many are beautiful 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.550
 tropics 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.560
 look look if you also enter 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.060
 fashion maybe the water shard everything 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.670
 it becomes even more beautiful 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.210
 I can assure you that this world 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.300
 it's great the animations are a lot 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:54.310
 well done, look, look at the leaves 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:57.040
 when you fall you see one of the best 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.640
 fashions that have never been introduced 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.950
 we will see many fashions but in my opinion this 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.160
 it is one of the most beautiful fashions there is 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.770
 in circulation because because in addition to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.470
 introduce a new world that really 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:16.000
 guys is really nice and we say so 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.530
 this world can be suggestive 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.180
 have fun in many ways and say 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.970
 introduces a nice variation to the gameplay 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.220
 usually of minecraft in more introduces a 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.240
 really exorbitant number of objects 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.860
 that we can craft say and oh well 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.010
 materials with which kraft hurley e 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.750
 logically of the environments right from 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.130
 breathtaking 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.930
 unfortunately, however, there is not a lot of kids 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.390
 say about this fashion you will have to find out 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.410
 you all look, I don't even know that 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.390
 nearby bug of the world generation 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.400
 however you will have to find out all this yourself 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.489
 which introduces this new fashion because 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.290
 really introduces so many materials 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.060
 let's say more minerals than materials with 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.630
 which we can craft so many 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.120
 objects 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.790
 if I had to show you crafting everything 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.450
 finish tomorrow morning because it really is 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.489
 so much from kraft areas I could even make you 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.370
 but seeing everything would be enough 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.459
 useless because it will mister and bore you too 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.200
 because maybe it 's usually a person 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.940
 watch the video to discover fashion and 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.530
 see its operation 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.519
 many have asked me to do this 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.430
 fashion 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.750
 I decided to do it because so many 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.150
 they didn't know how to enter the world 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.699
 of too many kraft because it is one thing 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.379
 usually you snub see also the 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.970
 Skeletal texture has changed 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.800
 look really kinky 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.330
 nice this fashion 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.340
 In the meantime, I decided to give them guys 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.580
 a new score for each review 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.180
 which I will give a score to each 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.610
 so that I will review the score of 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.169
 this fashion 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.449
 eight out of ten as you could see 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.090
 from now on I will assign as soon as I have 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.150
 said a score in any way I will do 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.610
 and for every fashions that I will be able to tell 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.770
 logically contest maybe say the 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.840
 yours by letting me know how 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.449
 comment what you think about this mode 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.330
 and if you think the score is more than 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:13.030
 deserved, we'll see you next time 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.889
 review will remind you to put me 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.509
 like to subscribe to the channel for 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.610
