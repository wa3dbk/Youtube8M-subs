from the upper extension shape you just
learned<00:00:36.600> I'll<00:00:37.600> play<00:00:37.870> it<00:00:37.990> from<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.290> root<00:00:44.910> in

the<00:00:46.030> notes<00:00:46.240> below<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.750> root<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:52.260> here's<00:00:53.260> a

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
the notes below the root and here's a

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.610 
the notes below the root and here's a
bluesy<00:00:53.800> lick<00:00:53.980> that<00:00:54.130> uses<00:00:54.520> this<00:00:54.640> form<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:56.110> two

three four don't neglect those quarter
step<00:01:04.299> bends<00:01:04.839> they<00:01:05.229> really<00:01:05.500> add<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.009> flavor

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
step bends they really add to the flavor

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:17.300 
step bends they really add to the flavor
of<00:01:06.490> licks<00:01:06.790> like<00:01:06.970> these<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:08.740> two<00:01:09.490> three<00:01:10.299> four

here's another kind of funky one that

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.179 
here's another kind of funky one that
works<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.990> lower<00:01:20.229> strings<00:01:20.649> of<00:01:20.799> this<00:01:20.920> shape

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
works the lower strings of this shape

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:29.620 
works the lower strings of this shape
one<00:01:21.880> two<00:01:22.569> three

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630

take a look at some licks the combined
form<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.580> 1<00:01:52.730> &amp;<00:01:52.910> 2<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:53.930> example<00:01:54.350> uses<00:01:54.770> both
