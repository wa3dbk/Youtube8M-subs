what's up slur holic here this is going

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.220 
what's up slur holic here this is going
to<00:00:02.580> be<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.700> loot<00:00:03.000> from<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.629> kingdom<00:00:03.899> this

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
to be a loot from the kingdom this

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.980 
to be a loot from the kingdom this
should<00:00:04.529> be<00:00:04.680> about<00:00:04.830> three<00:00:05.430> months<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:06.000> think

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
should be about three months I think

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.200 
should be about three months I think
altogether<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.799> call<00:00:08.540> 6.75<00:00:09.540> milk<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.110> then

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
altogether we call 6.75 milk and then

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.459 
altogether we call 6.75 milk and then
anything<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.480> top<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.380> be

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
anything on top of that is going to be

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.680 
anything on top of that is going to be
profit<00:00:14.009> from<00:00:14.219> then<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.730> do<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
profit from then I do have it on the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.240 
profit from then I do have it on the
logs<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:17.900> have<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.170> majority<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.710> logs<00:00:19.980> and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
logs and I have the majority on logs and

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.340 
logs and I have the majority on logs and
then<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.520> rest<00:00:20.730> on<00:00:21.119> herbs<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.960> think<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.289> is

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
then the rest on herbs I think this is

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.439 
then the rest on herbs I think this is
the<00:00:22.619> third<00:00:22.980> or<00:00:23.400> fourth<00:00:23.850> time<00:00:23.939> I've<00:00:24.300> actually

all<00:01:31.890> right<00:01:32.159> I'm<00:01:32.369> done<00:01:32.579> opening<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.689> nest

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
all right I'm done opening all the nest

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.609 
all right I'm done opening all the nest
and<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> did<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> rings<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> tree

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and on the I did the rings and the tree

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.280 
and on the I did the rings and the tree
seeds<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.220> who<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.290> compared

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
seeds to who it is right here compared

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.039 
seeds to who it is right here compared
to<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.500> think<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.950> costs<00:01:41.369> around<00:01:41.520> six<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to I think it costs around six the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
to I think it costs around six the
six-point<00:01:43.530> something<00:01:43.829> though<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.000> 90

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
six-point something though for the 90

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
six-point something though for the 90
days<00:01:45.600> hopefully<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.290> ended<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.740> being<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
days hopefully this ended up being the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.609 
days hopefully this ended up being the
90<00:01:47.520> days<00:01:47.750> right<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.409> how<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
90 days right here you can see how the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.100 
90 days right here you can see how the
loot<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> price<00:01:50.399> jacks<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.149> usually<00:01:51.869> don't

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
loot the price jacks I usually don't

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.590 
loot the price jacks I usually don't
check<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> price<00:01:52.860> checker<00:01:53.310> before<00:01:53.880> i<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
check the price checker before i do a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.560 
check the price checker before i do a
video<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.799> aloo<00:01:56.130> videos<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.729> way<00:01:56.880> i'm
