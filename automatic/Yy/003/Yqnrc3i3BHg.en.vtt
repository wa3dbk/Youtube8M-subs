microfiber<00:04:36.760> ok<00:04:37.760> so<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:38.030> also<00:04:38.390> asked<00:04:39.050> about<00:04:39.410> the

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
microfiber ok so I also asked about the

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.450 
microfiber ok so I also asked about the
micro<00:04:41.660> USB<00:04:42.230> port<00:04:42.560> that's<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.950> huge<00:04:43.340> change

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
micro USB port that's a huge change

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.850 
micro USB port that's a huge change
that's<00:04:44.060> not<00:04:44.240> a<00:04:44.270> proprietary<00:04:44.930> charging<00:04:45.620> port

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
that's not a proprietary charging port

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.180 
that's not a proprietary charging port
anymore<00:04:46.570> in<00:04:47.570> my<00:04:47.870> opinion<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.620> think<00:04:48.650> that's<00:04:49.040> a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
anymore in my opinion I think that's a

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.860 
anymore in my opinion I think that's a
great<00:04:49.220> shift<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.120> let's<00:04:50.300> hear<00:04:50.480> what<00:04:50.660> they<00:04:50.780> have

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
great shift so let's hear what they have

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.260 
great shift so let's hear what they have
to<00:04:50.930> say<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.920> magnetic<00:04:52.460> charges<00:04:52.820> are<00:04:53.000> great

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
to say the magnetic charges are great

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.440 
to say the magnetic charges are great
abyss<00:04:53.930> connect<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:54.680> never<00:04:54.950> creep<00:04:55.310> of<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.640> but

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
abyss connect you never creep of it but

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.570 
abyss connect you never creep of it but
then<00:04:56.630> that<00:04:56.810> there<00:04:57.350> is<00:04:57.500> sometimes<00:04:57.710> indeed<00:04:58.340> you
