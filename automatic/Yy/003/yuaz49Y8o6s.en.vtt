aluminium foil and after that we're
going<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.450> shape<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.050> just<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:59.070> it's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
going to shape it just like this it's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.390 
going to shape it just like this it's
easier<00:01:59.910> if<00:02:00.150> you<00:02:00.360> shape<00:02:00.660> it<00:02:00.840> um<00:02:01.050> while<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.160> has

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
easier if you shape it um while it has

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.690 
easier if you shape it um while it has
the<00:02:02.430> aluminum<00:02:03.180> foil<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:04.310> again<00:02:05.310> we're<00:02:05.550> going

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the aluminum foil and again we're going

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
the aluminum foil and again we're going
to<00:02:05.910> put<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.150> in<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.420> freezer<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> couple<00:02:07.350> of

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
to put it in the freezer for a couple of

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.230 
to put it in the freezer for a couple of
hours<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.340> meanwhile<00:02:08.759> we're<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.030> to

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
hours and meanwhile we're going to

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.210 
hours and meanwhile we're going to
prepare<00:02:09.540> our<00:02:09.570> better<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:10.320> for<00:02:10.800> our<00:02:10.950> batter

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
prepare our better and for our batter

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.850 
prepare our better and for our batter
we're<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> need<00:02:11.940> 3/4<00:02:12.900> cups<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.440> pancake

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
we're going to need 3/4 cups of pancake

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.310 
we're going to need 3/4 cups of pancake
mix<00:02:15.050> 1/4<00:02:16.050> cup<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.470> milk<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.430> 1<00:02:17.550> egg<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:19.050> very

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
mix 1/4 cup of milk and 1 egg it's very

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.740 
mix 1/4 cup of milk and 1 egg it's very
important<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.920> first<00:02:20.190> mix<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.030> egg<00:02:21.330> and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
important that you first mix the egg and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.660 
important that you first mix the egg and
the<00:02:21.959> milk<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.830> way<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> be

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the milk this way it's going to be

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.150 
the milk this way it's going to be
easier<00:02:24.269> for<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.900> mix<00:02:25.260> because<00:02:25.680> if<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.950> try

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
easier for you to mix because if you try

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.850 
easier for you to mix because if you try
to<00:02:26.220> mix<00:02:26.540> everything<00:02:27.540> just<00:02:27.810> together<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.680> won't

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
to mix everything just together it won't

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.400 
to mix everything just together it won't
work<00:02:29.130> we<00:02:29.519> then<00:02:29.700> add<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.330> mixture<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
work we then add this mixture to the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.190 
work we then add this mixture to the
pancake<00:02:32.220> mix<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:33.120> like<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.930> we're

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
pancake mix just like this and we're

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:44.380 
pancake mix just like this and we're
gonna<00:02:34.290> start<00:02:34.769> mixing<00:02:35.160> everything<00:02:35.640> together

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.089 

then<00:02:45.390> we're<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.900> add<00:02:46.050> some<00:02:46.319> oil<00:02:46.560> into<00:02:47.069> a

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
then we're going to add some oil into a

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.339 
then we're going to add some oil into a
pan<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.819> meanwhile<00:02:48.569> we're<00:02:48.870> going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.110> take

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
pan and meanwhile we're going to take

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.250 
pan and meanwhile we're going to take
out<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.220> little<00:02:50.730> rolls<00:02:51.030> from<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.750> freezer

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
out the little rolls from the freezer

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.020 
out the little rolls from the freezer
and<00:02:52.500> we're<00:02:52.800> going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.040> dip<00:02:53.310> them<00:02:53.520> into<00:02:54.000> our

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
and we're going to dip them into our

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.479 
and we're going to dip them into our
batter<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.200> this<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.950> after<00:03:02.099> they're

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
batter just like this and after they're

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.940 
batter just like this and after they're
all<00:03:02.700> covered<00:03:03.239> with<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.780> batter<00:03:04.019> we're<00:03:04.830> gonna

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
all covered with the batter we're gonna

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.580 
all covered with the batter we're gonna
put<00:03:05.280> them<00:03:05.459> into<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.849> oil<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:06.390> about<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:07.200> couple

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
put them into the oil for about a couple

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.860 
put them into the oil for about a couple
of<00:03:07.980> seconds<00:03:08.519> okay<00:03:08.790> because<00:03:09.030> these<00:03:09.480> need<00:03:09.840> to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
of seconds okay because these need to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.380 
of seconds okay because these need to
work<00:03:10.440> quickly<00:03:10.860> because<00:03:11.580> if<00:03:11.730> they<00:03:11.910> have<00:03:12.120> ice

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
work quickly because if they have ice

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.020 
work quickly because if they have ice
cream<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.989> we<00:03:13.140> don't<00:03:13.319> want<00:03:13.470> them<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.860> melt<00:03:14.099> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
cream and we don't want them to melt the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.770 
cream and we don't want them to melt the
oil<00:03:15.330> has<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.630> be<00:03:15.840> around<00:03:16.319> 350<00:03:17.220> okay<00:03:17.580> then<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:18.690> a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
oil has to be around 350 okay then in a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.390 
oil has to be around 350 okay then in a
separate<00:03:19.110> play<00:03:19.350> which<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.709> gonna<00:03:19.890> add<00:03:20.130> some
