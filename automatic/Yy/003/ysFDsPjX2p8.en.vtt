00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
the size difference on the screwdrivers

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.530 
the size difference on the screwdrivers
as<00:02:54.810> well<00:02:54.990> as<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:55.230> wire<00:02:55.440> strippers<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.070> the

as well as it's wire strippers on the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.030 
as well as it's wire strippers on the
curve<00:02:57.540> whereas<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> Victoria<00:02:58.560> Knox<00:02:58.650> has<00:02:58.860> it

curve whereas the Victoria Knox has it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.160 
curve whereas the Victoria Knox has it
behind<00:02:59.340> there<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.790> it's<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.150> there<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:01.020> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
behind there so it's like there on the

comparing<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.220> don't<00:03:05.430> know<00:03:07.910> but<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.840> also<00:03:10.019> have

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
comparing I don't know but you also have

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.300 
comparing I don't know but you also have
a<00:03:11.959> one-sided<00:03:12.959> reamer<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.739> think<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
a one-sided reamer I think it is a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.979 
a one-sided reamer I think it is a
reamer<00:03:14.610> or<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> leather<00:03:15.660> punch<00:03:16.050> one<00:03:16.530> or<00:03:16.709> two

focus<00:03:18.989> camera<00:03:19.230> come<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.400> go<00:03:20.519> one-sided

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
focus camera come on so go one-sided

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.270 
focus camera come on so go one-sided
grind<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.800> then<00:03:23.010> little<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.239> one<00:03:25.280> it's

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
grind and then little this one it's

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.550 
grind and then little this one it's
pretty<00:03:26.459> nice<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.360> when<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.600> use<00:03:27.900> now<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.380> then

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
pretty nice that when I use now and then

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.640 
pretty nice that when I use now and then
like<00:03:29.540> don't<00:03:30.540> have<00:03:30.810> anything<00:03:31.110> like<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> really

with me call a bottle lid I just push
and<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:39.989> just<00:03:40.290> digs<00:03:40.590> right<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:41.100> there<00:03:41.340> then

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
and that just digs right in there then

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.900 
and that just digs right in there then
if<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.300> turn

already<00:04:28.580> not<00:04:29.580> see<00:04:29.700> it<00:04:29.790> measures<00:04:30.090> so<00:04:30.480> I<00:04:31.220> dig<00:04:32.220> my

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
already not see it measures so I dig my

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.590 
already not see it measures so I dig my
tape<00:04:32.580> measure<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.910> might<00:04:33.180> be<00:04:33.270> able<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.450> measure

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
tape measure I might be able to measure

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.340 
tape measure I might be able to measure
how<00:04:33.750> many<00:04:34.080> millimeters<00:04:34.410> thick<00:04:34.950> thighs<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:36.350> on

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
how many millimeters thick thighs so on

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.840 
how many millimeters thick thighs so on
the<00:04:37.530> tape<00:04:37.710> measure<00:04:37.920> in<00:04:38.400> millimeters<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:41.730> would

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
the tape measure in millimeters it would

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.450 
the tape measure in millimeters it would
seem<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.120> be<00:04:44.840> I'd<00:04:45.840> say<00:04:46.110> three<00:04:47.010> point<00:04:47.280> five

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
seem to be I'd say three point five

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.000 
seem to be I'd say three point five
millimeters<00:04:48.210> I'm<00:04:48.930> just<00:04:49.560> gonna<00:04:49.740> take<00:04:49.950> a

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
millimeters I'm just gonna take a

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.310 
millimeters I'm just gonna take a
measurement<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.580> V<00:04:50.990> Victorinox<00:04:51.990> just<00:04:52.200> so

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
measurement on the V Victorinox just so

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.600 
measurement on the V Victorinox just so
you<00:04:52.380> know<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.680> thickness<00:04:52.860> difference<00:04:53.430> for

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
you know the thickness difference for

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.670 
you know the thickness difference for
now<00:04:53.730> so<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.690> was<00:04:54.870> like<00:04:54.990> three<00:04:55.230> point<00:04:55.470> five

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
now so that was like three point five

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.670 
now so that was like three point five
millimeters<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:58.200> Victorinox<00:04:58.919> it's<00:05:00.680> bang-on

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
millimeters the Victorinox it's bang-on

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.220 
millimeters the Victorinox it's bang-on
millimeters<00:05:02.610> thick<00:05:02.900> or<00:05:03.900> at<00:05:03.960> least<00:05:04.110> that's

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
millimeters thick or at least that's

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.330 
millimeters thick or at least that's
where<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.530> tape<00:05:04.650> measures<00:05:04.919> are<00:05:05.040> saying<00:05:05.250> I

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
where the tape measures are saying I

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.820 
where the tape measures are saying I
might<00:05:05.460> be<00:05:05.610> slightly<00:05:05.790> off<00:05:05.970> but<00:05:06.650> that's<00:05:07.650> where

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
might be slightly off but that's where

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.550 
might be slightly off but that's where
it's<00:05:07.950> reading<00:05:08.280> on<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.520> earth<00:05:08.669> is<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:09.810> couple<00:05:10.470> of

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
it's reading on the earth is a couple of

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.710 
it's reading on the earth is a couple of
millimeters<00:05:11.040> so<00:05:11.700> like<00:05:11.880> a<00:05:11.910> millimeter<00:05:12.240> or<00:05:12.540> so

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
millimeters so like a millimeter or so

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.140 
millimeters so like a millimeter or so
thinner<00:05:13.050> than<00:05:13.230> that<00:05:13.290> one<00:05:13.820> that's<00:05:14.820> pretty<00:05:15.030> good

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
thinner than that one that's pretty good

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.260 
thinner than that one that's pretty good
as<00:05:15.990> they<00:05:16.169> go<00:05:18.410> I<00:05:19.410> might<00:05:19.950> do<00:05:20.070> a<00:05:20.270> Victorinox

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
as they go I might do a Victorinox

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.409 
as they go I might do a Victorinox
comparison<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.110> Dutch<00:05:22.260> Army<00:05:22.590> knife<00:05:22.740> video

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
comparison to the Dutch Army knife video

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.610 
comparison to the Dutch Army knife video
depending<00:05:24.419> on<00:05:24.480> feedback<00:05:24.750> so<00:05:25.200> if<00:05:25.320> you<00:05:25.410> can<00:05:25.560> let

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
depending on feedback so if you can let

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.810 
depending on feedback so if you can let
me<00:05:25.740> know<00:05:25.770> about<00:05:25.950> the<00:05:26.100> feedback<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.640> what<00:05:26.730> you

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.180 
me know about the feedback and what you
think<00:05:26.970> of<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.210> Dutch<00:05:27.360> army<00:05:27.690> knife<00:05:27.950> I'll<00:05:28.950> do<00:05:29.160> a

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
think of the Dutch army knife I'll do a

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.330 
think of the Dutch army knife I'll do a
comparison<00:05:29.850> so<00:05:30.030> um<00:05:30.860> yeah<00:05:31.860> thanks<00:05:32.280> for
