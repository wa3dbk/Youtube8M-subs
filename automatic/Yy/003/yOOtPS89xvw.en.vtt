00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and like some of the terrain changes and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.390 
and like some of the terrain changes and
like<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.870> environment<00:02:18.870> environment<00:02:19.400> changes

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
like the environment environment changes

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.400 
like the environment environment changes
i'm<00:02:20.610> not<00:02:20.820> sure<00:02:21.090> what<00:02:21.270> that's<00:02:21.450> about<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.910> yeah

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
i'm not sure what that's about so yeah

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.860 
i'm not sure what that's about so yeah
at<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.680> moment<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.340> looking<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.820> bit<00:02:26.870> shaky

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
at the moment it's looking a bit shaky

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
at the moment it's looking a bit shaky
as<00:02:27.959> well<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.470> was<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> nice<00:02:28.800> curve<00:02:29.310> where<00:02:29.610> x

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
as well that was a nice curve where x

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.660 
as well that was a nice curve where x
max<00:02:30.000> by<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> way<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.160> all<00:02:32.310> pre-alpha

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
max by the way but this is all pre-alpha

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
max by the way but this is all pre-alpha
gameplay<00:02:32.880> see<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.989> was<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.200> bit<00:02:34.350> jumpy<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
gameplay see it was a bit jumpy then and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.330 
gameplay see it was a bit jumpy then and
I<00:02:35.400> don't<00:02:35.640> get<00:02:35.910> why<00:02:36.239> it's<00:02:36.480> doing<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:37.340> surely

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
I don't get why it's doing that surely

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.800 
I don't get why it's doing that surely
it<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.850> better<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.209> just<00:02:39.239> carry<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it just be better to just carry it on a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.120 
it just be better to just carry it on a
bit<00:02:39.989> natural<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> bit<00:02:40.800> more<00:02:40.950> natural<00:02:42.800> this<00:02:43.800> one

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
bit natural a bit more natural this one

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.740 
bit natural a bit more natural this one
with<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> environment<00:02:44.640> changes<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.510> color

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
with the environment changes the color

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.080 
with the environment changes the color
changes<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.440> all<00:02:46.560> well<00:02:47.250> since<00:02:47.400> I'm<00:02:47.550> not<00:02:47.670> super

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
changes and all well since I'm not super

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.680 
changes and all well since I'm not super
fixer<00:02:49.489> I'm<00:02:50.489> just<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.880> getting<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.239> wave<00:02:51.480> I

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
fixer I'm just not getting the wave I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.320 
fixer I'm just not getting the wave I
don't<00:02:51.900> get<00:02:52.049> why<00:02:52.260> there's<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.830> message<00:02:53.130> way<00:02:53.370> when

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
don't get why there's a message way when

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.870 
don't get why there's a message way when
you<00:02:54.450> land<00:02:54.690> some<00:02:55.080> tricks<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.709> hope<00:02:56.549> that's<00:02:56.730> not

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
you land some tricks I hope that's not
