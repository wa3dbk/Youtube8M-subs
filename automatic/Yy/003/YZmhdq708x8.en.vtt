helps<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.949> fine-tune<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.789> little<00:00:59.820> bit

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.929 

and<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> actually<00:01:06.420> threads<00:01:06.990> into<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> case

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939

that<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.770> little<00:01:11.280> case<00:01:11.610> therefore<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.119> 920

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that the little case therefore the 920

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.600 
that the little case therefore the 920
doesn't<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.740> any<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> mount<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> the

tripod the tripod actually mounts to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.760 
tripod the tripod actually mounts to
that<00:01:17.280> ring<00:01:17.580> which<00:01:18.060> hooks<00:01:18.270> onto<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> lens<00:01:18.869> so

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that ring which hooks onto the lens so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.070 
that ring which hooks onto the lens so
kind<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.130> gates<00:01:20.310> its<00:01:20.520> usefulness<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> can

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
kind of gates its usefulness now you can

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
kind of gates its usefulness now you can
only<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.560> use<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.400> camera<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> tripod
