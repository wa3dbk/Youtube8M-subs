00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
then it's flashing pretty neat

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.480 
then it's flashing pretty neat
now<00:01:14.329> there's<00:01:14.540> one<00:01:14.720> drawback<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:16.040> batteries

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
now there's one drawback the batteries

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.120 
now there's one drawback the batteries
that<00:01:16.520> come<00:01:16.820> with<00:01:16.969> it<00:01:17.000> aren't<00:01:17.810> very<00:01:18.140> good<00:01:18.290> you

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
helped but that sells button cell

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.319 
helped but that sells button cell
batteries<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.649> get<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:39.950> Energizer's<00:01:40.579> the
