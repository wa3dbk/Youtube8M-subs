00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
explosive shell is the exact opposite

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.789 
explosive shell is the exact opposite
this<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.930> only<00:02:50.959> difference<00:02:51.530> we<00:02:51.650> could

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
this is the only difference we could

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.710 
this is the only difference we could
find<00:02:52.040> between<00:02:52.190> these<00:02:52.579> two<00:02:52.730> perps<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.329> if<00:02:53.630> you

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
find between these two perps so if you

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.030 
find between these two perps so if you
are<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.049> they<00:02:54.170> have<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> different<00:02:54.620> blast

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
are that they have a different blast

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.910 
are that they have a different blast
radius<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.639> anything<00:02:55.910> like<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.680> yeah<00:02:57.680> that
