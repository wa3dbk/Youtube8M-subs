00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.780
 Cousin! Can I make you a sandwich with cheese? 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.780
 That goes, I'm not hungry. 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.220
 Never say no to the panda. 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.220
 good morning 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.840
 good morning 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.220
 I've got you panda cheese for breakfast 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.220
 No thanks, I do not feel good ... 

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:08.534
 Never say no to the panda 

00:01:11.414 --> 00:01:14.854
 I got some panda cheese 

00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:17.334
 This order is without cheese 

00:01:37.574 --> 00:01:41.094
 Never say no to the panda 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.500
 Dad, why do not we get some panda cheese? 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.880
 Enough! We already have enough 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.060
 Dad, why are we carrying some panda cheese? 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.920
 We carry one 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 Get one more 

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:45.174
 Never say no to the panda 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.840
 Have you got panda cheese for the kids? 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.760
 It is not necessary. 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.760
 We have a lot of food 

00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:21.774
 Are you going to want a cheese sandwich with the kids, Salah? 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.400
 No, not now.
