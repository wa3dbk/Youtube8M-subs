00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.549
Hey all, it’s Sam. This is my first tutorial.
I’m going to be doing it on making line

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.540
art with a mouse in Photoshop.
This particular version of Photoshop is CS6,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.389
but any version of 7 and up should work just
fine.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:22.820
I’m going to make a new file. It doesn’t
matter the size, but I’m just going to make

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.280
mine 700 x 700.
Now, I love layers. So, I’m going to ahead

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:37.079
and put everything on the new layer. And what
I’m talking about as far as this goes is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.690
pressure sensitivity. You can see this doodle
I’m doing right now with a mouse, it’s

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.890
just regular brush, nothing special. It doesn’t
look very pretty.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.609
But I I use a tablet (if you guys are familiar
with a tablet) to have the ability to be pressure-sensitive.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:01.579
That means that if I select shape dynamics
(and I can change the minimum diameter, that

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.780
means that the harder I press, the thicker
the line will be.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.570
And using shape dynamics, you can see how
it’s thickest in the middle and tapers off

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.310
at the end. Changing the diameter percentage
changes how much it tapers off. I usually

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.830
keep it at 0, but personal preference.
And if I doodle with a tablet, I have much

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.360
more control over the line. I can press harder,
go softer. You can see the advantage of a

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.150
tablet.
But this is about mouse.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.330
So I’m going to go ahead and show you how
to do something that’s similar to do that

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.480
with a mouse.
This is using the pen tool and the brush tool.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.050
Now, if you guys don’t know anything about
the pen tool, that’s okay. This is very

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.090
basic and very simple.
Just go ahead and start by clicking anywhere

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.560
(nowhere in particular really matters. We’re
just playing around). And this is just creating

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.140
a new work path.
Clicking somewhere else extends the path,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.770
and puts it to a new anchor point. You can
create more anchor points (if you don’t

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.290
want just a straight line) by clicking anywhere
on the work path.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.489
And you can move these anchor points by pressing
control and then clicking on these. And you

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.349
can move all of them anywhere.
These two parts that extend from this anchor

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.900
control how much it curves. So if I extend
this out, you can see the curve definitely

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.519
increases. I can move things around and I
can twist it.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.019
And the pen tool is a pretty big tool. It’s
got a lot of features and stuff to it. It

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.849
may really almost take an hour or so just
playing around with all of its features just

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.560
to get a hang of it. It takes a little bit
to get used to.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.819
You can make all sorts of crazy shapes. This
will be my shape.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.799
And what I’m going to do is I’m going
to go to my brush and then, pick any size.

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.430
It doesn’t really matter. I’m going to
go ahead and go with size 7.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.930
And you’re going to wait, make sure that
before you do anything else, you want to go

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.620
to your brush settings and make sure that
you have shape dynamics checked with your

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.900
minimum diameter set to 0%. It doesn’t have
to be 0%. But to put emphasis on this, you

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.120
would want 0%.
Now, go ahead and go back to your pen tool

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.700
and right click anywhere in your workspace,
then click on stroke path. This whole box

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.639
is going to come up. And then, you’re going
to see that you have the option to pick different

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.389
tools – pencil, brush, eraser. You have
all these tools. We’re going to use brush.

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.310
And you see this is already checked. But if
it’s not, go ahead and check it. This is

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.469
to stimulate pressure. And you’re going
to see what this will do.

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:51.180
If you notice, it’s brushed automatically
for you. You click and then it gets rid of

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.950
all those lines. And now, you can see it clearly.
The middle part is where it’s weighed the

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.129
thickest. And then at the ends, you can see
it just tapers off.

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.930
That’s what stroking the path does.
And that’s just one way of using the pen

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.529
tool that I do sometimes. But if you want
a different way, it gives it a little bit

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:17.669
more of that tablet feel. I’ll cover that
in a second. But you can go ahead and play

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:26.530
with the different sizes of brushes.
The thicker you go, the crazier it gets. You

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.550
can see it gets pretty thick and tapers off.
And that’s just one way of doing it.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.110
The second way is the way that I use the most.
It involves a few more steps, but it’s still

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.139
pretty easy.
So go ahead and make a path and just do whatever,

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:52.120
nothing specific. Play around, do whatever.
This is my path. And to get it to look like

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.650
this, just control click. If you ever want
to go back and edit, control click on your

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.949
path. That’s my path.
So, I’m going to do my brush. I’m going

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:06.930
to set a small brush size. To do this, you
might want to start with a pretty small one

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.169
compared to what you want the finished piece
to look like.

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.960
And then, you go back to your pen tool and
you right click stroke path. But this time,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.039
you’re not going to stimulate pressure.
Press okay. Enter. And now, you get this line.

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.539
You can tell that it looks pretty much exactly
the same as it would if you just used the

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.409
mouse except my lines are a little bit more
shaky with a mouse, but you get the point.

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.949
Now, what you’re going to do is control
a and x. And what this does is select the

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.550
canvass and cut the picture. And the picture
isn’t actually gone. It’s saved to your

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.300
clipboard. So if you were to paste it, control
v, or just go up to edit, paste, your picture

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.669
is still there. And that’s what we’d want.
And now, you want to go over to your history.

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.020
And you want to go back to the last use of
the pen tool. We don’t want to do the stroke

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.520
path, however, because this path is already
stroked and we don’t want that. We want

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.419
the one right before it, which for me, is
the dragging of the anchor point.

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.620
Now, you want to change the brush size to
something that’s larger than the one that

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.710
we’ve just used. And we go with 8. You want
to go at least two or three above the brush

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.289
size that you used to see the difference.
Going back to the pen tool, right click, stroke

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.659
path. And this time, with stimulate the pressure.
Press okay.

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:25.000
This is the same thing as what we saw before.
But this time, we’re going to paste our

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.460
previous one and then drag it over so they
line up. And now, you can really see this

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.289
looks more like a tablet (which I’m using
right now).

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:43.030
So that’s pretty much it. And I hope this
has helped maybe somebody. If you have any

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.770
questions or anything, go ahead and leave
a comment and I’ll do my best to answer

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.810
it. I’m not an expert at the pen tool or
Photoshop, but I’ll still try and answer

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.099
your questions.
So I hope you enjoyed watching. And see you

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:57.460
next time.
