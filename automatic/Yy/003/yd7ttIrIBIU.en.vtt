00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.960
 ban 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:13.190
 Although it is a position hooker, it is the position that fights in the front row most as a hooker 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.340
 But what it is or where 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:23.790
 Well how smell and you do brilliant I'd play and can not say 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.140
 It is his play say still Kuraitsuku in earthy mistress downward part of the tackle 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.270
 I think 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.590
 Well, I'm thinking of my best 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:34.500
 Well first 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:42.720
 And Do not want you to look at the figure which is fighting in there do you say that your selling points 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:43.110
 Hmmm, but I think it would be nice if I could do it myself 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.050
 I will 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.280
 After all 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:54.070
 There are places where you can not say anything, and there are places where you can not say anything . 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.040
 And Do When you are told to do something people 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.650
 There 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.560
 Elementary School sixth grade at the time of 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.510
 Which 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:10.200
 I remember the niche clearly but in a nearby park 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:16.770
 My friend gave me a fountain rag vibe and I did it there but I also taught that friend carefully 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.240
 Rakebizu District of not stretched to 9 Lien Chan and at the time of the arm elementary school have it by comfortably interesting to me 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.350
 It's in Osaka 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.780
 You've done all the way nanny from small 6 ask them Well Soregashi eh 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.040
 It is a child who never wanted to stop once a 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.040
 Skills and such stars 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.680

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.240
 Thank you for supporting Teikyo University Rugby Club 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.390
 The really hot support of everyone is our power 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.070
 There is a concrete thing called the water armor 4 consecutive victory 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.159
 Well, it's good to be the university Japan No.1 again without being conscious of 4 consecutive wins 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.930
 a Aim one day a day 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:00.750
 A single one of the play downward 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.470
 I would like to work with you, so please support me in the future 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.470
 Thank you very much 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.020
 I am a scrum half, but a powerful attack and a powerful tackle 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:22.830
 I think that is the strength of 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:29.610
 Asuka is a person who has the whole size maybe as a half, so body making is in the first grader 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:34.260
 From I Is not Where is it Well body itself Nde much are doing it expect from my daily life 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:38.110
 Being able to manage the game firmly in it being said that it is fishing 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.960
 I think I wanted you to see a calm decision 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.620
 Since there are many situations to among them in rugby 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.610
 The right decision in this 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.069
 I always play thinking about what I should say 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.769
 University Japan No. 1 as a team 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:00.080
 My goal is to have 4 consecutive college championships, in which I was in the final stage 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:04.660
 To be able to stand on the pitch and laugh 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:10.090
 I will do my best with that goal tomorrow 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:14.480
 Continue to rugby in top league teams in top leagues 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.230
 I think I want to play at the top so that I can be a representative of Japan 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.230
 Hmm 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.390
 It is the number of strings 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:31.840
 I 'm stuck at the opponent low but it's tackle 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:36.790
 That over the other little parts that have run out of people to the days of the Contracting 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.960
 I have not been able to train so much and I'm back now but my body is 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:45.300
 That in such a part in you small 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:48.020
 That it I'll be especially firmly defeated not body building and whether the those sections hit the opponent 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.840
 I think that gorgeous Miss the place 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.760
 This year 's university of maa 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.510
 First it is four consecutive rugby history 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.080
 Firmly in that amount by saying Challenge can Rutte 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.820
 In the process of aiming for the best in Japan 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.370
 I firmly in the ground on the stage of that last victory 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.420
 9 ends have been reached 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.420
 I think I will do my best every day 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.260
 For four years, all members of Teikyo University Rugby Club 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.730
 I will fight 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.690
 I would like you to visit more than rugs by all means 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.690
 d 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.630
 I am 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.230
 road 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:39.370
 There is also the pillar between the balls in the absence of field field 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.449
 Because I am good at running around 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.470
 I think that if Moraere watching was said firmly so 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.620
 Speed is 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.400
 Where the speed attack is attached to the moving numbers 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.680
 Because my specialty area 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.449
 I think it would be nice to have a combination 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.009
 There is a contact play where this stand is also intense 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:07.599
 Quick error 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:09.200
 After that doing strengths of the things that I want to do was get off or gentlemanly behavior in brand Board 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.380
 I think there is 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.480
 Even today, there are a lot of injured people today. 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.770
 I am a team 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:23.169
 Appeal yourself firmly there in the midst of this way and eat season 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:27.819
 If you become settled in yourself while deepening 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:29.050
 In particular, we should do what we should do well without giving much thought to that controversy 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.340
 do it 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.770
 I think it is a place that aims to win 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.490
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.490
 me
