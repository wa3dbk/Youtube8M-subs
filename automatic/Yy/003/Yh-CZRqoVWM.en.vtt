okay<00:00:04.400> here's<00:00:04.640> a<00:00:04.730> problem<00:00:05.120> that<00:00:05.270> we<00:00:05.390> all<00:00:05.630> run

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
okay here's a problem that we all run

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.619 
okay here's a problem that we all run
into<00:00:06.350> in<00:00:06.710> our<00:00:06.830> shops<00:00:07.190> and<00:00:07.580> that's<00:00:07.850> if<00:00:08.210> you<00:00:08.450> have

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:08.629 
into in our shops and that's if you have

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.570 
into in our shops and that's if you have
any<00:00:08.750> kind<00:00:08.960> of<00:00:09.020> magnets<00:00:09.590> if<00:00:10.190> you<00:00:10.280> do<00:00:10.400> any

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
any kind of magnets if you do any

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.089 
any kind of magnets if you do any
welding<00:00:10.870> you're<00:00:11.870> gonna<00:00:11.960> get<00:00:12.200> these<00:00:12.559> iron

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
welding you're gonna get these iron

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.620 
welding you're gonna get these iron
filings<00:00:13.610> on<00:00:13.760> your<00:00:13.910> magnet<00:00:14.300> and<00:00:14.450> they're

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
filings on your magnet and they're

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.249 
filings on your magnet and they're
really<00:00:14.929> a<00:00:15.080> pain<00:00:15.349> in<00:00:15.500> the<00:00:15.530> neck<00:00:15.769> to<00:00:15.799> get<00:00:16.040> rid<00:00:16.279> of

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
really a pain in the neck to get rid of

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.900 
really a pain in the neck to get rid of
everybody<00:00:18.259> tries<00:00:18.500> picking<00:00:19.160> them<00:00:19.250> off<00:00:19.430> and

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
everybody tries picking them off and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.150 
everybody tries picking them off and
then<00:00:20.180> you<00:00:20.300> wind<00:00:20.480> up<00:00:20.630> with<00:00:20.779> metal<00:00:21.590> filings<00:00:22.010> all

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
then you wind up with metal filings all

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.400 
then you wind up with metal filings all
over<00:00:22.430> on<00:00:22.580> your<00:00:22.789> fingers<00:00:23.300> which<00:00:23.900> eventually

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
over on your fingers which eventually

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.750 
over on your fingers which eventually
wind<00:00:24.590> up<00:00:24.710> in<00:00:24.859> your<00:00:25.010> eye<00:00:25.039> you<00:00:25.220> know<00:00:25.699> that<00:00:26.590> so<00:00:27.760> how

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
wind up in your eye you know that so how

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.490 
wind up in your eye you know that so how
do<00:00:28.820> we<00:00:28.910> get<00:00:29.119> rid<00:00:29.359> of<00:00:29.390> them<00:00:29.630> if<00:00:29.840> we<00:00:30.109> don't<00:00:30.289> have<00:00:30.470> a

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
do we get rid of them if we don't have a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.140 
do we get rid of them if we don't have a
magnet<00:00:30.949> some<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.250> nicer<00:00:31.609> magnets<00:00:32.000> have

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
magnet some of the nicer magnets have

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.290 
magnet some of the nicer magnets have
on/off<00:00:32.540> switches<00:00:33.080> and<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:33.860> helps<00:00:34.250> but<00:00:34.850> most

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
on/off switches and that helps but most

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.090 
on/off switches and that helps but most
of<00:00:35.450> us<00:00:35.540> don't<00:00:35.719> have<00:00:35.870> those<00:00:36.230> magnets<00:00:36.739> most<00:00:36.950> of

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
of us don't have those magnets most of

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.490 
of us don't have those magnets most of
us<00:00:37.190> have<00:00:37.340> regular<00:00:37.790> magnets<00:00:38.300> or<00:00:38.540> anything

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
us have regular magnets or anything

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.639 
us have regular magnets or anything
that's<00:00:39.770> magnetic<00:00:40.760> or<00:00:40.940> magnetized<00:00:41.570> that<00:00:42.200> picks

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
that's magnetic or magnetized that picks

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.650 
that's magnetic or magnetized that picks
up<00:00:42.770> these<00:00:42.980> filings<00:00:43.460> it's<00:00:43.910> really<00:00:44.239> a<00:00:44.270> pain<00:00:44.480> in

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
up these filings it's really a pain in

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.840 
up these filings it's really a pain in
the<00:00:44.690> neck<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:45.020> get<00:00:45.110> rid<00:00:45.290> of<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:46.250> solution

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
the neck to get rid of so the solution

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.970 
the neck to get rid of so the solution
that<00:00:46.969> we<00:00:47.120> found<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.899> really<00:00:48.260> pretty<00:00:48.410> simple

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
that we found is really pretty simple

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.590 
that we found is really pretty simple
and<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:49.610> you<00:00:49.789> get<00:00:49.879> a<00:00:49.940> little<00:00:50.180> stainless

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
and that you get a little stainless

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.900 
and that you get a little stainless
steel<00:00:50.870> scratch<00:00:51.469> brush<00:00:51.829> now<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:52.520> is<00:00:52.640> an<00:00:52.760> old

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
steel scratch brush now this is an old

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.360 
steel scratch brush now this is an old
use<00:00:53.149> one<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:53.600> no<00:00:53.930> one's<00:00:54.140> run<00:00:54.829> a<00:00:54.860> whole<00:00:55.070> dollar

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
use one and no one's run a whole dollar

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:08.080 
use one and no one's run a whole dollar
or<00:00:55.730> $2<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:58.760> seems<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.480> work<00:00:59.690> quite<00:00:59.960> well<00:01:07.090> it

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
or $2 and it seems to work quite well it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.630 
or $2 and it seems to work quite well it
just<00:01:08.150> takes<00:01:09.110> them<00:01:09.310> right<00:01:10.310> off<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.950> right<00:01:13.460> into

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
just takes them right off and right into

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.850 
just takes them right off and right into
the<00:01:13.760> garbage<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.420> go<00:01:16.390> no<00:01:17.390> muss<00:01:17.659> no<00:01:17.990> fuss<00:01:18.200> a

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the garbage you go no muss no fuss a

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.670 
the garbage you go no muss no fuss a
whole<00:01:19.610> lot<00:01:19.850> faster<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.930> whole<00:01:21.140> lot<00:01:21.320> quicker

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
whole lot faster and a whole lot quicker

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.170 
whole lot faster and a whole lot quicker
than<00:01:22.240> doing<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.570> other<00:01:24.350> way<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:28.670> nothing

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
than doing it the other way in nothing

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.870 
than doing it the other way in nothing
flat<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:30.710> have<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:31.220> filing<00:01:32.150> free<00:01:32.540> magnet<00:01:33.880> now

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
flat you have a filing free magnet now

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.929 
flat you have a filing free magnet now
this<00:01:35.090> was<00:01:35.299> really<00:01:35.689> really<00:01:35.720> loaded<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:36.939> and

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
this was really really loaded so and

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.830 
this was really really loaded so and
it's<00:01:38.150> got<00:01:38.659> 87<00:01:39.380> different<00:01:39.500> angles<00:01:40.040> but<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:41.659> can

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
it's got 87 different angles but you can

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.990 
it's got 87 different angles but you can
see<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.280> really<00:01:43.549> really<00:01:43.790> works<00:01:44.150> well<00:01:46.000> so

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
see that it really really works well so

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.710 
see that it really really works well so
there<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.329> go<00:01:48.250> that's<00:01:49.250> my<00:01:49.430> little<00:01:49.729> hint<00:01:50.450> for

there you go that's my little hint for
the<00:01:50.840> day<00:01:51.049> you'll<00:01:51.950> really<00:01:52.280> like<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:53.210> works

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
the day you'll really like it it works

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.080 
the day you'll really like it it works
really<00:01:53.810> really<00:01:53.990> quickly<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.790> can<00:01:55.820> have

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
really really quickly and you can have

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.260 
really really quickly and you can have
your<00:01:56.240> magnet<00:01:56.630> virtually<00:01:57.549> filing<00:01:58.549> free<00:01:58.909> in

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
your magnet virtually filing free in

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.020 
your magnet virtually filing free in
nothing<00:01:59.780> flat

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.390 

way<00:02:05.930> faster<00:02:06.230> than<00:02:06.500> doing<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.950> with<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.130> paper

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
way faster than doing it with a paper

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.030 
way faster than doing it with a paper
towel<00:02:07.820> or<00:02:08.119> any<00:02:08.270> other<00:02:08.479> method<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:09.110> we've

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
towel or any other method that we've

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.950 
towel or any other method that we've
used<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.550> past<00:02:12.310> there<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.460> go<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:16.810> had<00:02:17.810> to

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
used in the past there you go I had to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.490 
used in the past there you go I had to
touch<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.530> had<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.920> touch<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.340> right<00:02:23.500> it

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
touch it I had to touch it right it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.010 
touch it I had to touch it right it
takes<00:02:24.710> me<00:02:24.920> more<00:02:24.950> time<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.480> tell<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.600> how<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.810> do

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
takes me more time to tell you how to do

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.290 
takes me more time to tell you how to do
it<00:02:27.200> than<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.190> does<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.550> actually<00:02:28.580> do<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:30.280> but

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
it than it does to actually do it but

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.130 
it than it does to actually do it but
that's<00:02:32.300> pretty<00:02:32.690> good

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
that's pretty good

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.440 
that's pretty good
you<00:02:33.830> can't<00:02:34.130> beat<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:35.180> hope<00:02:35.330> you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450
