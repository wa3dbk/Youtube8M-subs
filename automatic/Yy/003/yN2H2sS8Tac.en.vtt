00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.170 
piece and I just wanted to share with
you<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.030> way<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.320> put<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.800> together

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
you the way that I I put this together

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.290 
you the way that I I put this together
there<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.660> aluminum<00:00:19.560> plate<00:00:20.270> about<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
there is a aluminum plate about a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.210 
there is a aluminum plate about a
quarter<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.660> an<00:00:21.779> inch<00:00:21.869> thick<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:23.010> has<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
quarter of an inch thick that has a

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.620 
quarter of an inch thick that has a
series<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.670> letters<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.990> one<00:00:25.380> side<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
series of letters on one side of it and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.859 
series of letters on one side of it and
it<00:00:27.630> also<00:00:27.779> says<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.570> what

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it also says up and so this is what

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.229 
it also says up and so this is what
holds<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.439> whole<00:00:31.710> piece<00:00:32.489> together<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:36.030> we

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
holds the whole piece together and so we

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.860 
holds the whole piece together and so we
want<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.630> place<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.450> on<00:00:39.450> each

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
want to place it up like this on each

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.510 
want to place it up like this on each
Channel<00:00:40.219> there<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.550> at<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.090> garden<00:00:43.520> I'm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the washer on and you tighten it up it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
the washer on and you tighten it up it
doesn't<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.430> tight<00:01:21.020> just<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
doesn't have to be that tight just you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.130 
doesn't have to be that tight just you
know<00:01:22.320> finger<00:01:22.770> tight<00:01:22.979> no<00:01:23.430> problem<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.140> then

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
know finger tight no problem and then

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.310 
know finger tight no problem and then
you<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> look<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.340> corresponding

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
you want to look for the corresponding

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.950 
you want to look for the corresponding
panel<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.740> other<00:01:28.890> side<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.180> plate<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
panel at the other side of the plate and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.499 
panel at the other side of the plate and
that<00:01:31.290> would<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:32.329> letter<00:01:33.329> e<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.560> there's<00:01:35.040> e<00:01:35.509> I

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that would be letter e so there's e I

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.590 
that would be letter e so there's e I
always<00:01:37.049> try<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> keep<00:01:37.560> these<00:01:38.130> paddles<00:01:38.670> on

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
always try to keep these paddles on

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.429 
always try to keep these paddles on
their<00:01:39.900> ex<00:01:40.200> sideways<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:42.439> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
their ex sideways because the the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.800 
their ex sideways because the the
outside<00:01:43.890> surface<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> painted<00:01:45.090> surface<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
outside surface is a painted surface and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.030 
outside surface is a painted surface and
it's<00:01:46.380> very<00:01:46.649> easy<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.420> scratch<00:01:48.420> them<00:01:49.040> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it's very easy to scratch them the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's very easy to scratch them the
inside<00:01:50.579> surface<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.240> actually<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> grip<00:01:52.200> tape

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
inside surface is actually a grip tape

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.569 
inside surface is actually a grip tape
and<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.180> quite<00:01:54.270> abrasive<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:56.159> if<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and so it's quite abrasive and if the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.569 
and so it's quite abrasive and if the
pieces<00:01:56.969> rub<00:01:57.210> together<00:01:57.420> at<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> find

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
pieces rub together at all you can find

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.179 
pieces rub together at all you can find
that<00:01:59.700> in<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.210> scratch<00:02:00.570> scratch<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.380> piece<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
that in a scratch scratch the piece so I

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.140 
that in a scratch scratch the piece so I
try<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.630> let<00:02:04.469> them

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
try not to let them

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.600 
try not to let them
touch<00:02:05.540> one<00:02:05.840> another<00:02:06.040> when<00:02:07.040> you're<00:02:07.190> when

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
touch one another when you're when

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.370 
touch one another when you're when
you're<00:02:07.730> assembling<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.420> or<00:02:08.960> when<00:02:09.200> you're

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
you're assembling it or when you're

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.140 
you're assembling it or when you're
packing<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.460> so<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.420> look<00:02:11.570> for<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.170> letter<00:02:12.530> e

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
packing it so we look for the letter e

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:26.050 
packing it so we look for the letter e
okay<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:17.410> little<00:02:18.410> bit<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:21.320> one<00:02:21.620> here<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:25.060> you

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
okay a little bit this one here and you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:34.750 
okay a little bit this one here and you
can<00:02:26.210> hold<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.630> up<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.760> forgetting

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
can hold it up that and forgetting

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.880 
can hold it up that and forgetting
lightly<00:02:35.060> tighten<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.450> up<00:02:35.570> then<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.560> can<00:02:36.680> grab

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
lightly tighten it up then you can grab

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.520 
lightly tighten it up then you can grab
the<00:02:37.040> two<00:02:37.190> pieces<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.790> lift<00:02:37.910> them<00:02:38.090> up<00:02:38.240> and<00:02:38.530> it

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
the two pieces and lift them up and it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.530 
the two pieces and lift them up and it
will<00:02:39.740> without<00:02:40.459> any<00:02:40.640> problem<00:02:41.060> scan<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:43.010> its<00:02:43.190> own

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
will without any problem scan on its own

put<00:02:54.350> number<00:02:55.130> g<00:02:55.370> on<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.120> again<00:02:57.110> reach<00:02:57.470> for<00:02:57.709> the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
put number g on so again reach for the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:07.000 
put number g on so again reach for the
plate<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.420> pedal<00:02:59.720> with<00:02:59.870> g<00:03:06.010> it's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
plate for the pedal with g it's

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.530 
plate for the pedal with g it's
important<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.490> put<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.760> little<00:03:07.940> washer<00:03:08.420> on

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
important to put the little washer on

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.180 
important to put the little washer on
because<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:10.989> nuts<00:03:11.989> are<00:03:12.230> catholics<00:03:12.950> and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
because the nuts are catholics and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.440 
because the nuts are catholics and
they're<00:03:13.519> not<00:03:13.670> quite<00:03:15.400> deep<00:03:16.400> enough<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:17.090> keep

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
they're not quite deep enough to keep

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.320 
they're not quite deep enough to keep
the<00:03:17.630> peace<00:03:17.810> tight<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.670> little<00:03:19.820> washer

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
the peace tight so the little washer

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.190 
the peace tight so the little washer
acts<00:03:20.540> as<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.840> spacer<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:23.209> set<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.690> down<00:03:23.930> like

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
acts as a spacer and set this down like

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.850 
acts as a spacer and set this down like
this<00:03:25.780> down<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:27.280> little<00:03:28.280> bit<00:03:28.640> rocky<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.860> you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
this down a little bit rocky and you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.750 
this down a little bit rocky and you
want<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.130> reach<00:03:31.310> up<00:03:31.550> and<00:03:31.670> underneath<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:34.070> face

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
want to reach up and underneath and face

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.390 
want to reach up and underneath and face
the<00:03:35.230> washer<00:03:36.230> on

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the washer on

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.479 
the washer on
is<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.760> tricky<00:03:39.030> part<00:03:41.720> probably<00:03:42.720> take<00:03:43.019> me<00:03:43.489> 15

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
is the tricky part probably take me 15

00:03:44.489 --> 00:04:11.280 
is the tricky part probably take me 15
minutes

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.170 

hicks<00:04:12.290> couple<00:04:12.770> minutes<00:04:13.070> on<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.280> little<00:04:13.640> bit<00:04:13.850> of

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
hicks couple minutes on a little bit of

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.479 
hicks couple minutes on a little bit of
getting<00:04:14.450> used<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:14.950> everything<00:04:15.950> feels

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
getting used to everything feels

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.340 
getting used to everything feels
backwards<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.459> assemble<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:19.940> like<00:04:20.120> that

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
backwards but you assemble it like that

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.780 
backwards but you assemble it like that
and<00:04:21.350> then<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.590> continue<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:22.160> put<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.460> rest<00:04:22.640> of

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
and then you continue to put the rest of

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.300 
and then you continue to put the rest of
the<00:04:22.850> pebbles<00:04:23.240> on<00:04:23.530> if<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:24.680> have<00:04:24.770> problems

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
the pebbles on if you have problems

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.760 
the pebbles on if you have problems
getting<00:04:25.400> your<00:04:25.700> fingers<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.420> to<00:04:27.380> tighten<00:04:27.710> up

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
getting your fingers in to tighten up

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.950 
getting your fingers in to tighten up
the<00:04:27.950> bolts<00:04:28.130> if<00:04:28.790> that<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.240> pretty<00:04:29.480> easy<00:04:29.690> to

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
the bolts if that is pretty easy to

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.620 
the bolts if that is pretty easy to
reach<00:04:30.140> into<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.680> middle<00:04:30.950> of<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:32.300> can<00:04:32.480> move

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
reach into the middle of it you can move

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.750 
reach into the middle of it you can move
them<00:04:32.870> around<00:04:33.020> back<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:33.830> forth<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.490> little<00:04:34.610> bit

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
them around back and forth a little bit

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.080 
them around back and forth a little bit
so<00:04:35.660> that<00:04:35.690> makes<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.230> easier<00:04:36.910> gives<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.030> a

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
so that makes it easier gives you a

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.750 
so that makes it easier gives you a
little<00:04:38.300> bit<00:04:38.420> more<00:04:38.570> space<00:04:39.400> once<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.580> whole

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
little bit more space once the whole

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
little bit more space once the whole
piece<00:04:41.030> is<00:04:41.240> assembled<00:04:41.840> what<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:42.860> do<00:04:43.010> is<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:44.300> make

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
piece is assembled what I do is I make

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.340 
piece is assembled what I do is I make
tagging<00:04:45.140> them<00:04:45.260> up<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.410> little<00:04:45.560> tiny<00:04:46.250> bit<00:04:46.580> more

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
tagging them up a little tiny bit more

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.310 
tagging them up a little tiny bit more
and<00:04:48.350> then<00:04:48.410> out<00:04:48.919> position<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.910> wheels<00:04:50.180> so<00:04:51.110> that

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
and then out position the wheels so that

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.860 
and then out position the wheels so that
they're<00:04:51.530> an<00:04:51.620> equal<00:04:52.070> distance<00:04:52.610> from<00:04:53.030> one

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
they're an equal distance from one

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.530 
they're an equal distance from one
another<00:04:53.930> all<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.890> way<00:04:55.040> around<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:56.300> that's

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
another all the way around and that's

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.700 
another all the way around and that's
basically<00:04:57.230> it<00:04:57.560> that's<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.310> assembly<00:04:58.850> and

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
basically it that's the assembly and

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.760 
basically it that's the assembly and
hope<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:00.860> enjoy<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.250> peace<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:02.620> take<00:05:03.620> care
