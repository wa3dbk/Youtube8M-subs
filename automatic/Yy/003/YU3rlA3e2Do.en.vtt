00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.880
 today we have something very spectacular 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.829
 we have a rollercoaster in the never to 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.599
 you're going to hallucinate or be amazing 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.579
 roller coaster that you sent me 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.810
 you guys have sent me a lot and 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.239
 did a lot that we did not see 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.739
 roller coasters I said why not 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.239
 guys today we're going to enjoy one of 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.620
 they first wanted to send a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.210
 saludito to the creator magical box 82 a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.430
 I salute you thank you very much as 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.040
 always by sharing your map with 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.540
 we have different rules that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.370
 we have to meet difficulties 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.530
 peaceful that we have done that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.410
 break blocks ok and do not forget 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.850
 the money in the other pants is worth 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.730
 an important detail to keep in mind 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.400
 because you have to pay the entrance to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.820
 the roller coaster guys costs one of 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.549
 diamond and serves him petrolí petro nilo 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.829
 a pos guy with a very common name and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.800
 it turns out that magically, I have a 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.290
 Diamond 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.010
 all the magic guys but but but 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.450
 wait, wait, you're going to get out before 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.210
 I have to comment one thing guys 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.270
 very very very important about the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.460
 sections turns out guys that is now 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.800
 a lot of people coming to the channel and there 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.380
 One thing that caught my attention 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.210
 in the last episode that we went up 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.130
 show us your house turns out that there was 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.080
 some people who were commenting then 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.490
 a couple of things and I wanted to clarify a couple 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.590
 of details about the sections before 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.090
 see the roller coaster with a shut up yo 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 I want to see the roller coaster leave me alone 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.780
 ok we're going guys but before I have 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.720
 to comment on this I swear that I do not 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.040
 I rolled up too much and just wanted to 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.570
 comment for people that maybe 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.830
 enters new channel and want to know 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.530
 what are these sections going on? 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.480
 they are sections that you yourselves 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.360
 send the maps so that we 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.620
 let's enjoy this are not the top of houses 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.600
 of 2013-2014 of December of January nor the 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.520
 top of roller coasters or anything like that 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.740
 that is to say there are surely many 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.660
 better roller coasters or better houses 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.460
 of which we show in other sections 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.380
 but that's not the important thing guys the 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.700
 objective of the sections is simply 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.260
 have fun and see things 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.420
 sent to you something that to me 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.950
 it seems quite entertaining and 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.810
 you know that I enjoy those little ones 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.970
 things because I do not know a detail in a 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.980
 roller coaster can be something fun or 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.260
 an idea in a decorative house 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.000
 I also like it, I say it because 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.120
 there were people who for example in the last 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.069
 episode said that it was not the best 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.410
 house that we had seen on the planet ni 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.390
 things like that and as I say guys that's something 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.310
 totally secondary I enjoy a lot 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.720
 seeing the things that you send me and how 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.489
 I'm obviously not going to show a 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.860
 wooden house two by two but 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.720
 within that there are many things are 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.120
 many ideas that I like about things 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.739
 you send and as I say guys I like it 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.739
 and I enjoy just watching those 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.360
 details now if you do not expect that the 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.310
 roller coaster that we're going to see today be a 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.959
 poop because obviously it's a piece of 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.120
 roller coaster and the lord petro lino 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.099

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.730
 I liked it and now we were going 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.350
 to see a mountain in the leader obviously 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.540
 we have to travel to duty so 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.040
 get ready for an epic and attentive trip 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.160
 the roller coaster has some details 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.510
 incredible guys that I liked 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.120
 They liked long since we've seen 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.770
 a great roller coaster we reached the area 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.020
 by a portal he quoted and now we do have 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.330
 to move forward a little and fix because 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.460
 It is decorated even as if it were a 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.230
 never miss the fortress 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.960
 that here has put some wands 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.940
 and such everything very well managed and now yes 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.430
 here starts the trip piece of the 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.810
 roller coaster and what I'm going to do guys 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.460
 as we have done many times to see the 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.670
 roller coasters is to get a little music 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.960
 very very sugarcane and let's enjoy what 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.390
 what is the trip then we talk a 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.720
 little bit more so now we'll see each other 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.720
 Boys 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.680
 Y 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.119
 Y 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.119
 very well 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.660
 I hope you guys liked it so much 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.760
 like me the roller coaster has 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.410
 impressed has had pretty flaws 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.930
 pretty cool as for example there was 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.640
 a room with black and white blocks in 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.800
 the one that has put fire discharges that 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.440
 a quite effect came out of the walls 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.840
 subtle but very cool even during the 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.360
 travel has been effects of falls 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.700
 we have seen a gas in pixel art 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.130
 a past I liked everything 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.420
 that is the path the roller coaster and 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.010
 it seems like it gets a little 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.330
 short but you know everything all the 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.310
 work that is behind a mountain 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.540
 Russian of this style is not much 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.669
 construction and then it goes by very fast 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.710
 but at the same time it is quite enough 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.480
 awesome has thanked us 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.730
 for playing and over he has wished us happy 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.740
 Christmas and the posters are flying in 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.970
 the soil is a pretty cool thing and 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.850
 like some kids now what we have to do 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.380
 is to go back to the beginning from this portal 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.669
 you access what is the area of ​​the 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.490
 entrance to the truth that is quite 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.480
 well structured and roller coaster me 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.880
 liked it is true that makes 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.010
 time we saw one that we were traveling to 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.560
 neider we traveled to the entity and all this but 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.790
 it was crazy and a roller coaster for 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.169
 complete in the leader I think not what 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.820
 we had seen the decoration that 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.200
 outside I also liked it and 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.460
