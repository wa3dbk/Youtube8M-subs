00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
clear that we would take the appropriate

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.500 
clear that we would take the appropriate
measures<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.370> make<00:01:01.730> sure<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.149> camera

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
measures to make sure that the camera

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.450 
measures to make sure that the camera
guys<00:01:02.809> that<00:01:03.140> we're<00:01:03.409> supposed<00:01:03.769> to<00:01:03.859> be<00:01:04.009> faster

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
guys that we're supposed to be faster

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.340 
guys that we're supposed to be faster
and<00:01:04.850> that<00:01:04.879> they're<00:01:05.299> not<00:01:05.509> only<00:01:05.570> were<00:01:05.899> faster

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
and that they're not only were faster

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.920 
and that they're not only were faster
but<00:01:06.470> also<00:01:06.619> secure

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.720 

and<00:01:12.110> that<00:01:12.770> was<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.980> emphasis<00:01:13.100> which<00:01:13.550> is<00:01:13.700> a

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
and that was the emphasis which is a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.580 
and that was the emphasis which is a
natural<00:01:14.120> emphasis<00:01:14.570> but<00:01:14.840> which<00:01:15.020> is<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.350> wrong

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
natural emphasis but which is the wrong

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.310 
natural emphasis but which is the wrong
emphasis<00:01:15.800> in<00:01:16.280> Patagonia<00:01:16.880> as<00:01:17.060> we<00:01:17.780> collective

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
emphasis in Patagonia as we collective

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:30.850 
emphasis in Patagonia as we collective
became<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:18.770> learn<00:01:18.950> I<00:01:29.110> had<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.320> rethink<00:01:30.710> my

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
became to learn I had to rethink my

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.890 
became to learn I had to rethink my
whole<00:01:31.010> approach<00:01:31.550> towards<00:01:32.000> climbing<00:01:32.480> towards

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
whole approach towards climbing towards

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.780 
whole approach towards climbing towards
alpinism<00:01:33.290> in<00:01:33.560> general<00:01:33.980> and<00:01:34.220> that<00:01:34.250> was<00:01:34.580> good

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
alpinism in general and that was good

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.690 
alpinism in general and that was good
I'm<00:01:35.000> really<00:01:35.660> happy<00:01:35.870> that<00:01:36.020> people<00:01:36.890> were<00:01:37.160> kind

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
I'm really happy that people were kind

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.780 
I'm really happy that people were kind
of<00:01:37.820> mad<00:01:38.030> at<00:01:38.240> me<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.710> told<00:01:39.710> me<00:01:39.860> that<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.460> was

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
of mad at me and told me that I was

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.670 
of mad at me and told me that I was
doing<00:01:41.060> things<00:01:41.210> wrong<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.870> should<00:01:42.200> reconsider

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
doing things wrong and should reconsider

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.490 
doing things wrong and should reconsider
the<00:01:43.280> second<00:01:43.670> year<00:01:43.880> David<00:01:44.720> kind<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.350> took

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
the second year David kind of took

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.370 
the second year David kind of took
charge<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.130> said<00:01:47.030> no<00:01:47.240> more<00:01:47.270> fixed<00:01:47.930> ropes<00:01:48.110> no

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
charge and said no more fixed ropes no

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.680 
charge and said no more fixed ropes no
more<00:01:48.560> fixed<00:01:48.770> lines<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.280> what<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.300> saw<00:01:50.510> in<00:01:50.600> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
more fixed lines and what you saw in the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.780 
more fixed lines and what you saw in the
film<00:01:50.930> is<00:01:51.229> basically<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.010> atmosphere<00:01:52.580> that

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
film is basically the atmosphere that

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.020 
film is basically the atmosphere that
came<00:01:52.970> about<00:01:53.180> in<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.510> third<00:01:53.660> expedition<00:01:55.030> we

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
came about in the third expedition we

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.859 
came about in the third expedition we
really<00:01:56.360> made<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:56.869> puree<00:01:57.800> occu<00:01:58.190> mentary<00:01:58.610> and

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
really made a puree occu mentary and

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.810 
really made a puree occu mentary and
didn't<00:01:59.869> fake<00:02:00.140> any<00:02:00.350> scenes<00:02:00.710> didn't<00:02:01.190> require

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
didn't fake any scenes didn't require

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.930 
didn't fake any scenes didn't require
any<00:02:02.119> pitch<00:02:05.440> so<00:02:06.440> it's<00:02:06.800> really<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.160> documentary

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
any pitch so it's really a documentary

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.880 
any pitch so it's really a documentary
in<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.840> most<00:02:09.050> natural<00:02:09.290> way<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:09.770> guess<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:11.890> found

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
in the most natural way I guess I found

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.660 
in the most natural way I guess I found
my<00:02:13.540> personal<00:02:14.540> way<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.870> climbing<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.890> found<00:02:16.459> in

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
my personal way of climbing and found in

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.630 
my personal way of climbing and found in
an<00:02:16.940> attitude<00:02:17.330> toward<00:02:17.930> impossible<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.769> if<00:02:19.400> you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
an attitude toward impossible and if you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.060 
an attitude toward impossible and if you
really<00:02:19.940> want<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.300> try<00:02:21.050> something<00:02:21.350> impossible

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
really want to try something impossible

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.920 
really want to try something impossible
you<00:02:22.160> also<00:02:22.310> have<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.850> give<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.180> impossible<00:02:23.840> a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
you also have to give the impossible a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.230 
you also have to give the impossible a
chance
