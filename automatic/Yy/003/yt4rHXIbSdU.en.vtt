yes<00:01:40.350> yes<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.460> good<00:01:41.759> reason<00:01:42.439> this<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.619> a

yes yes but with good reason this is a

yes yes but with good reason this is a
rare<00:01:44.009> opportunity<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:45.090> us<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
rare opportunity for us this is the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.669 
rare opportunity for us this is the
purest<00:01:46.740> sample<00:01:47.460> we've<00:01:47.729> seen<00:01:47.939> yet<00:01:48.119> and

purest sample we've seen yet and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.520 
purest sample we've seen yet and

procedures<00:01:55.310> everything<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.520> fine<00:01:56.640> I

don't<00:01:57.899> know<00:01:58.049> how<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.710> say<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:58.979> although

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
don't know how you can say that although

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.120 
don't know how you can say that although
I<00:02:00.179> will<00:02:00.509> admit<00:02:00.539> that<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.259> possibility<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
I will admit that the possibility of a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.550 
I will admit that the possibility of a
resonance<00:02:02.579> cascade<00:02:02.820> scenario<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.810> extremely

resonance cascade scenario is extremely

resonance cascade scenario is extremely
unlikely<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.360> just<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.659> go<00:02:06.929> on<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.170> doesn't
