it's just a lighter when my friends left
you<00:00:44.900> know<00:00:45.049> and<00:00:46.780> I<00:00:48.070> picked<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:49.159> up<00:00:49.280> today<00:00:49.460> and

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:50.619

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:53.109 
you know and I picked it up today and
turns<00:00:51.619> out<00:00:51.830> it's<00:00:52.010> not<00:00:52.159> a<00:00:52.220> ladder<00:00:52.430> at<00:00:52.610> all<00:00:52.729> it's

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:53.119 
turns out it's not a ladder at all it's

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.740 
turns out it's not a ladder at all it's
actually<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.600> camera<00:00:55.150> reason<00:00:56.150> I<00:00:56.269> know<00:00:56.449> this

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
actually a camera reason I know this

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.520 
actually a camera reason I know this
because<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:57.409> tried<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:58.390> light<00:00:59.390> it<00:00:59.570> nothing

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
because I tried to light it nothing

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.200 
because I tried to light it nothing
happens<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:04.400> actually<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.299> top<00:01:05.540> comes<00:01:05.869> off

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
happens and actually the top comes off

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.300 
happens and actually the top comes off
and<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.450> has<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.600> USB<00:01:10.480> now<00:01:11.480> honestly<00:01:12.190> I've<00:01:13.190> been

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
and it has a USB now honestly I've been

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.540 
and it has a USB now honestly I've been
pretty<00:01:14.470> reluctant<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:17.620> plug<00:01:18.620> anything<00:01:18.920> like

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
pretty reluctant to plug anything like

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.610 
pretty reluctant to plug anything like
this<00:01:19.730> into<00:01:19.910> my<00:01:20.030> computer<00:01:20.090> because<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:21.440> could

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
this into my computer because it could

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.170 
this into my computer because it could
have<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.770> bug<00:01:22.100> on<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:22.430> or<00:01:22.520> something<00:01:22.760> but

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.760 

honestly<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:26.240> think<00:01:26.270> they<00:01:26.510> have<00:01:26.630> something<00:01:27.410> on

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
honestly I think they have something on

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.620 
honestly I think they have something on
my<00:01:27.980> computer<00:01:28.010> anyway<00:01:28.730> so<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.060> just<00:01:29.120> plugged<00:01:29.510> it

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
my computer anyway so I just plugged it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.030 
my computer anyway so I just plugged it
in<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.960> see<00:01:30.530> what<00:01:30.650> was<00:01:30.800> on<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:32.770> there's<00:01:33.770> nothing

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
in to see what was on it there's nothing

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.950 
in to see what was on it there's nothing
strange<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.730> really<00:01:35.030> just<00:01:35.480> a<00:01:36.430> recording<00:01:37.430> of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
strange on it really just a recording of

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
sound or motion activated I'm not really

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.700 
sound or motion activated I'm not really
sure<00:01:45.980> I<00:01:46.930> was<00:01:47.930> looking<00:01:48.170> around<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.409> windows
