00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
be just a tad too dark for me currently

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.789 
be just a tad too dark for me currently
because<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.340> pale<00:01:29.790> as<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:31.530> apply<00:01:31.740> this

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
foundation I'm gonna be using my Sigma F
or<00:01:34.920> five<00:01:35.220> little<00:01:35.759> brush<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> reason<00:01:36.810> I

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
or five little brush and the reason I

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.330 
or five little brush and the reason I
like<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:37.979> small<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
like it is because it's so small and

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
usually my next step would have been

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.350 
usually my next step would have been
similar<00:01:51.830> but<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.340> actually<00:01:52.580> don't<00:01:53.030> own<00:01:53.300> a

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
that good that it actually covered my

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.430 
that good that it actually covered my
