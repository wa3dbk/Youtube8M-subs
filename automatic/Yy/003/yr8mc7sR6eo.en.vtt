00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello exuberant hello 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.459
 today we prepare a very easy cake 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.429
 recipe from my boyfriend's mother 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:13.709
 of with after 15 years luca signora maria 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.220
 teresa back this recipe hundred 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.660
 years it hurts stale sweet cake that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.920
 stale bread you can do pure sonata 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.800
 for today we prepare it sweet 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.900
 possibly even easy chocolate 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.349
 fast and then with the leftovers as well 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.790
 economic begins a thing I have to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.340
 cut the bread into large pieces we are in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.890
 second and rossettini I put it whole 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.610
 but I have to say that the practical to give 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.770
 this time at the beginning cut it 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:50.940
 rather than putting for the 78 and that is 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.420
 was all the bread and now towards 300 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.240
 you can also use grams of milk 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.650
 warm and let it rest for about 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.950
 two hours 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.620
 nevertheless the data from time to time from the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.110
 so mixed that you milk then 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.970
 two hours as abundant as have passed 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.970
 you can see it become a mush 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.350
 crush it all with this I have to for 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 noise 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.540
 first of all a fork or do as 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.250
 I do mipim air and frulli in my opinion 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 it's better with blender because these 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.380
 proposed becomes all homogeneous with the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.010
 fork and even more rustic we go 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.630
 so 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:38.580
 however I make the passage on 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:52.170
 at this point I add two 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:54.120
 spoons of cocoa an egg only 4 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.000
 spoons of sugar 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:02.369
 I like it bitterly if you can 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.900
 to interest or to reach an act of a 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.729
 this point I add some drops of 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.619
 chocolate that I have slightly soiled 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.929
 put some flour in the freezer for 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.209
 a short of gold fakes all this 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.040
 do not go to the bottom of his death and with 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.099
 dried fruit each if you have pine nuts 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.540
 hazelnuts almond nuts the first site 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:26.400
 end of the world 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:29.730
 add those well in the oven 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.680
 preheated to 180 degrees for about 30 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.439
 minutes also applies to this cake la 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.109
 toothpick test 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:39.419
 this is the real bread ready course 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:43.379
 it is enough has not reached in the 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:47.209
 vine in the flour this is the height la 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.209
 consistency and slightly stirred 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.459
 very good I could slightly bitter 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.260
 if you are interested in doing a little more 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.879
 dolce poste that comes a little for those who don't 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.419
 more than sugar but in my opinion it is so 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:04.999
 perfect and rude little words 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.999
 less is this says a beautiful next
