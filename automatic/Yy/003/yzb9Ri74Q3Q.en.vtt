get a little I don't know that bout that
much<00:00:21.710> you<00:00:22.710> squish<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.189> onto<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:24.210> half<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the edge if not a little bit over just

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.219 
the edge if not a little bit over just
because<00:00:34.820> when<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.970> cooks<00:00:36.239> it'll<00:00:36.540> shrink<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:37.229 
because when it cooks it'll shrink up a

the refrigerator but we make these we
make<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> whole<00:01:25.890> bunch<00:01:26.070> because<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.420> quick

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
make a whole bunch because they go quick

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.170 
make a whole bunch because they go quick
and<00:01:27.930> they're<00:01:28.380> even<00:01:28.680> better<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:29.640> next<00:01:29.670> day<00:01:30.120> for

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and they're even better the next day for

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.870 
and they're even better the next day for
leftover<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:32.040> back<00:01:32.190> when<00:01:32.460> we're<00:01:32.580> ready<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
leftover so way back when we're ready to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.530 
leftover so way back when we're ready to
fry<00:01:34.430> okay<00:01:35.430> now<00:01:35.610> we're<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> show<00:01:36.300> you<00:01:36.360> how

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
fry okay now we're going to show you how

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.060 
fry okay now we're going to show you how
to<00:01:37.430> easier<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.670> lift<00:01:38.909> down<00:01:39.120> to<00:01:39.300> deep-frying

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
to easier to a lift down to deep-frying

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.910 
to easier to a lift down to deep-frying
also<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> wanted<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.490> mention<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.920> for

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
also I wanted to mention this was for

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
also I wanted to mention this was for
this<00:01:44.510> 90/10<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.710> fattier<00:01:50.130> than<00:01:50.159> me<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
this 90/10 so the fattier than me the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.590 
this 90/10 so the fattier than me the
less<00:01:51.150> oil<00:01:51.479> you'll<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.500> use<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
less oil you'll have to use because the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.130 
less oil you'll have to use because the
fat<00:01:54.600> will<00:01:55.200> cook<00:01:55.440> off<00:01:55.650> and

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
fat will cook off and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
fat will cook off and
let's<00:01:58.140> either<00:01:58.440> way<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.800> just<00:01:58.830> put<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> powder<00:01:59.580> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
let's either way we just put a powder to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.880 
let's either way we just put a powder to
have<00:02:00.030> member<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.390> pad<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.690> will<00:02:00.840> shrink<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:03.890> so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
have member the pad is will shrink up so

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.200 
have member the pad is will shrink up so
the<00:02:05.040> leaner<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.490> means<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.850> won't<00:02:06.030> happen

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the leaner that means that won't happen

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.760 
the leaner that means that won't happen
I<00:02:06.480> have<00:02:11.150> my<00:02:12.150> husband<00:02:12.600> sighs<00:02:12.870> I'm<00:02:13.080> busy<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
I have my husband sighs I'm busy on the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:31.430 
I have my husband sighs I'm busy on the
one<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.250> don't<00:02:14.550> like<00:02:27.200> then<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:31.230> know<00:02:31.260> it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
one I don't like then and I know it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.580 
one I don't like then and I know it
sounds<00:02:31.950> weird<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:32.580> use<00:02:32.760> sandwich<00:02:33.270> cheese

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
sounds weird that we use sandwich cheese

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.670 
sounds weird that we use sandwich cheese
but<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:34.620> do<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.820> new<00:02:36.720> best<00:02:36.990> way<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.530> it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
but we do it is new best way to have it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.190 
but we do it is new best way to have it
and<00:02:37.800> this<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.430> common<00:02:38.880> for<00:02:39.060> our<00:02:39.120> area<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:40.170> just

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
and this is common for our area it just

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.550 
and this is common for our area it just
breaks<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.220> half<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.640> corner<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.030> corner

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
breaks it in half and corner to corner

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:58.600 
breaks it in half and corner to corner
