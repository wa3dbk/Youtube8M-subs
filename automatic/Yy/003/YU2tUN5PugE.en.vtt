incredible color look at that that has

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.499 
incredible color look at that that has
great<00:01:02.800> variation<00:01:03.640> too<00:01:03.850> especially<00:01:04.390> as<00:01:04.479> a

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
great variation too especially as a

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.330 
great variation too especially as a
breeding<00:01:04.899> project<00:01:05.470> because<00:01:05.950> you<00:01:06.070> really

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
breeding project because you really

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.680 
breeding project because you really
never<00:01:06.520> know<00:01:06.820> what<00:01:07.000> you're<00:01:07.119> gonna<00:01:07.210> get<00:01:07.479> now

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
never know what you're gonna get now

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.240 
never know what you're gonna get now
that's<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:07.930> nice<00:01:08.080> grab<00:01:08.320> at<00:01:08.500> female<00:01:08.830> she<00:01:08.979> doesn't

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
that's a nice grab at female she doesn't

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.930 
that's a nice grab at female she doesn't
look<00:01:09.369> fantastic<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.930> purple<00:01:11.380> tegus<00:01:11.890> are

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
look fantastic but purple tegus are

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.880 
look fantastic but purple tegus are
usually<00:01:12.940> generally<00:01:13.600> depending<00:01:14.140> whose<00:01:14.350> genus

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
usually generally depending whose genus

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.940 
usually generally depending whose genus
is<00:01:15.070> dominant<00:01:16.000> are<00:01:16.180> smaller<00:01:16.840> taking<00:01:17.500> much

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
is dominant are smaller taking much

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.740 
is dominant are smaller taking much
friendlier<00:01:18.549> as<00:01:18.790> well<00:01:19.000> because<00:01:19.299> it<00:01:19.420> has<00:01:19.450> that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
friendlier as well because it has that

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.260 
friendlier as well because it has that
blue<00:01:20.110> gene<00:01:20.409> which<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:21.040> jeans<00:01:21.400> blue<00:01:22.030> gene

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
blue gene which and jeans blue gene

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.240 
blue gene which and jeans blue gene
that's<00:01:22.479> pretty<00:01:22.690> fun<00:01:22.869> as<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.500> blue<00:01:23.710> gene<00:01:23.950> and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
that's pretty fun as the blue gene and

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.670 
that's pretty fun as the blue gene and
blue<00:01:25.119> tigers<00:01:25.510> tend<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.810> be<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:25.930> comer<00:01:26.200> animal

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
blue tigers tend to be a comer animal

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.050 
blue tigers tend to be a comer animal
because<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.130> higher<00:01:27.310> elevation<00:01:27.909> that

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
because of the higher elevation that

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.640 
because of the higher elevation that
they<00:01:28.180> occur<00:01:28.510> in<00:01:29.670> Argentina<00:01:31.260> we<00:01:32.260> could<00:01:32.439> also

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
they occur in Argentina we could also

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.679 
they occur in Argentina we could also
export<00:01:33.280> these<00:01:33.490> because<00:01:33.939> we<00:01:34.060> have<00:01:34.180> captive

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
export these because we have captive

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.060 
export these because we have captive
bred<00:01:34.869> paperwork<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:35.530> if<00:01:35.619> you're<00:01:35.740> watching

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
bred paperwork so if you're watching

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.170 
bred paperwork so if you're watching
this<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.280> you're<00:01:36.369> another<00:01:36.580> country<00:01:36.939> you<00:01:36.970> want

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
this and you're another country you want

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.760 
this and you're another country you want
to<00:01:37.240> get<00:01:37.360> one<00:01:37.540> no<00:01:37.960> problem<00:01:38.320> just<00:01:38.409> give<00:01:38.530> us<00:01:38.710> a

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
to get one no problem just give us a

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.250 
to get one no problem just give us a
call<00:01:38.979> we<00:01:39.159> can<00:01:39.280> export<00:01:39.729> them<00:01:39.970> now<00:01:40.479> purple<00:01:40.900> tegus

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
call we can export them now purple tegus

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.440 
call we can export them now purple tegus
happen<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.710> be<00:01:41.860> some<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.460> our<00:01:42.610> favorites<00:01:43.119> this

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
happen to be some of our favorites this

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.660 
happen to be some of our favorites this
whole<00:01:43.720> row<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.380> all<00:01:44.650> purple<00:01:45.189> Tigers<00:01:45.520> that

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
whole row is all purple Tigers that

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.700 
whole row is all purple Tigers that
we're<00:01:45.820> breeding<00:01:46.060> back<00:01:46.420> as<00:01:46.689> you<00:01:47.140> can<00:01:47.259> see<00:01:47.500> in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
we're breeding back as you can see in

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.160 
we're breeding back as you can see in
the<00:01:48.009> hopes<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.400> mass<00:01:48.850> producing<00:01:49.450> some<00:01:49.630> albinos

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
the hopes of mass producing some albinos

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.359 
the hopes of mass producing some albinos
although<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:50.500> don't<00:01:50.619> know<00:01:50.799> how<00:01:50.920> that's<00:01:51.250> going

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
although I don't know how that's going

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.130 
although I don't know how that's going
to<00:01:51.430> work<00:01:51.490> out<00:01:51.850> because<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.600> seems<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.900> be<00:01:53.020> the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
to work out because it seems to be the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.770 
to work out because it seems to be the
albino<00:01:53.470> gene<00:01:53.619> isn't<00:01:53.979> is<00:01:54.189> isn't<00:01:55.180> as<00:01:55.270> dominant

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
albino gene isn't is isn't as dominant

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.410 
albino gene isn't is isn't as dominant
as<00:01:55.869> we<00:01:56.470> had<00:01:56.560> hoped<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:56.920> might<00:01:56.979> be<00:01:57.430> however<00:01:58.060> keep

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
purple albino Tengu is an interesting

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.400 
purple albino Tengu is an interesting
subject<00:03:08.190> because<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.370> seems<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.410> purple

tiger what we originally called the

tiger what we originally called the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
paradox some are of the opinion that it

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.990 
paradox some are of the opinion that it
may<00:03:17.290> be<00:03:17.350> a<00:03:17.680> t-<00:03:18.520> t<00:03:19.510> positive<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.530> don't<00:03:21.520> know<00:03:21.790> what

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
may be a t- t positive I don't know what

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.300 
may be a t- t positive I don't know what
I'm<00:03:22.150> talking<00:03:22.450> about<00:03:22.750> at<00:03:23.110> all<00:03:23.260> but<00:03:23.770> I<00:03:23.800> do<00:03:23.950> know

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
I'm talking about at all but I do know

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.810 
I'm talking about at all but I do know
what<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.550> have<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:26.560> seems<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.250> be<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.670> the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
what I have it seems to be that the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.729 
what I have it seems to be that the
purple<00:03:28.209> tiger<00:03:28.660> might<00:03:29.080> be<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.290> T<00:03:29.500> positive

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
purple tiger might be a T positive

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.710 
purple tiger might be a T positive
they're<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> ones<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:30.760> have<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:31.120> darker

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
they're the ones that have that darker

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.289 
they're the ones that have that darker
skin<00:03:32.019> color<00:03:32.290> that's<00:03:32.610> darker<00:03:33.610> skin<00:03:33.880> pigment

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
skin color that's darker skin pigment

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.380 
skin color that's darker skin pigment
which<00:03:34.450> he<00:03:34.690> has<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.380> as<00:03:36.340> babies<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.060> could<00:03:37.209> see

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
which he has and as babies you could see

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.729 
which he has and as babies you could see
the<00:03:37.510> difference<00:03:37.870> I'll<00:03:38.019> have<00:03:38.200> them<00:03:38.410> put<00:03:38.590> that

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
the difference I'll have them put that

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:39.960 
the difference I'll have them put that
up<00:03:38.890> on<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.160> screen<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.549> difference<00:03:39.880> between

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
up on the screen the difference between

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.420 
up on the screen the difference between
a<00:03:40.180> purple<00:03:40.540> albino<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.230> purple<00:03:41.590> tiger<00:03:41.980> when

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
a purple albino on a purple tiger when

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.100 
a purple albino on a purple tiger when
they're<00:03:42.640> born<00:03:42.940> it's<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:43.420> it's<00:03:43.660> night<00:03:43.930> and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
they're born it's it's it's night and

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.720 
they're born it's it's it's night and
day<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:44.350> looks<00:03:44.560> like<00:03:44.739> two<00:03:44.890> separate<00:03:45.280> animals

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
day it looks like two separate animals

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.680 
day it looks like two separate animals
so<00:03:47.070> that's<00:03:48.070> why<00:03:48.340> also<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.880> purple<00:03:49.209> tiger<00:03:49.600> is

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
so that's why also the purple tiger is

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.630 
so that's why also the purple tiger is
so<00:03:49.840> much<00:03:49.989> more<00:03:50.170> expensive<00:03:50.410> it's<00:03:50.920> very<00:03:51.340> very

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
so much more expensive it's very very

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.340 
so much more expensive it's very very
hard<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.000> produce<00:03:52.180> gene<00:03:52.750> has<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.140> fall<00:03:53.320> just

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
hard to produce gene has to fall just

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.470 
hard to produce gene has to fall just
right<00:03:53.830> on<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.280> it

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480
