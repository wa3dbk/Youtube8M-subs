00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello, I'm simon maier muscle 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.290
 makers Today, the question is why 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 the gold standard way is so popular what 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.450
 Just put this product down 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.369
 the athletes the best-selling 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.779
 Of course there is protein powder 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.279
 this product already a certain time 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.630
 that means most people know that 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.609
 Most have already 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.170
 so cost alone from the design ago 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.119
 know it the vast majority and know 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.080
 Of course, the benefits of this 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.429
 to appreciate the product 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.689
 nonetheless, one wonders 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.700
 Of course how can it be that one 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.050
 Protein powder is so popular that it does so 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.460
 Many people just give it to them 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.469
 swear the say it is flavorful 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 the best of the composition first 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.190
 best it is simply the best overall 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.510
 Well, I'm not one of those 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.190
 People who say there is only one here 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 single egg white powder and this is the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.030
 Here 's one of the good ones on everyone 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.350
 if you look at the ingredient list 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.360
 we will see that one thing 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.920
 The very good protein powder is with 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.559
 a protein mixture that consists of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.870
 big part of isolate than on wake 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.960
 protein isolate then from lakewood den 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.800
 concentrate and from waging hydro has the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.629
 is already a very big one 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.700
 difference to other products of the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.650
 Share isolate light higher here than at 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.600
 concentrate so the mixture in the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.909
 balance is already a very favorable 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.740
 Of course the whole thing will be added 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.509
 by flavorings so by aroma 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.710
 also that it does not neglect 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.180
 because the tastes are yes, too 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.560
 I praised the sky I have here 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.640
 vanilla ice cream in hand that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.890
 tastes a bit like hedging 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.390
 details like this American ice cream 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.500
 It must be really tasty on everyone 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.909
 You can not say that there is 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.700
 still french vanilla that's more like that 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.380
 these born note that you also so familiar 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.030
 a little different from the one 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.560
 Of course, there is still a lot to do 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.900
 a lot of other flavors the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.100
 among other things also very popular are yes 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.630
 of course, we have very good here because 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.009
 above that is beyond question are to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.570
 this product does not taste good 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.240
 we also have sweetener here 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.220
 throw off and sucralose both very well 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.020
 and you can taste at the end even as sugar 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.759
 You can barely make the difference 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.439
 you have to figure out more 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.759
 really really focus on that 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.689
 to notice differences that you can 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.310
 actually were 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.899
 then there is an enzyme mixture here 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.649
 that's included too for digestion 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.390
 very interesting 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.979
 That's how it has become in the course of time 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.710
 a little bit changed here is just 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.479
 amylase the nose cellulose and under 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.740
 also lipase in it so that one 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.900
 All macro nutrients are very good 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.070
 These unpleasant protein swells and 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.810
 so on one or the other 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.310
 abdominal pain very rare 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.200
 we are not here any more 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.270
 that means there are already several here 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.490
 enzymes in each case the individual 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.390
 ingredients of the proteins are very good 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.010
 make available 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.770
 we look at the overall balance then 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.210
 we counted on the portion 24 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.260
 protein is here again even 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.340
 on it and calculated on 100 grams 81 6% 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.080
 protein content in any case a very 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.850
 high protein content is no question here 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.280
 also for the most part isolate in it 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.630
 that is why the high protein content is the gold 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.830
 Standard ventures are easy 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.050
 not bad that he is in very much 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.520
 good 1 even in the very good better 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.950
 but that is also very interesting 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.180
 this extremely high status you have to 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.010
 also with another thing in 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.470
 connection with the very bring 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.730
 skillful business marketing the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.560
 just got the dealers 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.910
 a few years ago on her side 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.470
 pull by the dealers so 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.180
 have said make it white is one 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.980
 great protein and you deserve great 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.390
 have money on it if you sell then 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.190
 the traders, of course, said it was one 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.810
 two factors that fit together well 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.040
 I earn good money and it is a 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.880
 good product the customer was at the end 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.890
 be satisfied 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.660
 then I just say that this is 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.580
 the number one protein and there is no 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.950
 other protein that is the best protein 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.720
 in the market nowadays sees the matter 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.550
 so different from the constant 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.870
 Increases in prices that has to big share 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.510
 swallowed the dealer it's really 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.460
 insignificant what the customer in the end for 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.140
 the original product paid more 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.790
 For the most part it was easy to load 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.110
 Of course, the dealers now also say 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.270
 some dealers no it is not anymore 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.160
 the best there are already better in the 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.330
 There are others who are just as good 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.320
 they may be in one or the other 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.270
 another point also a bit 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.160
 better but in the end must be the customer 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.050
 just see clearly that this is very 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.910
 zwiespÃ¤ltige tongue among others one 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.320
 other fact is owed namely 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.060
 according to the company policy 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.310
 that the dealers say so gladly 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.110
 buys it buys it is a great 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.820
 protein and now you noticed earned 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.770
 Euro come off that's just simply 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.300
 difficult but on the other side of the 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.890
 Customer decides at the end what to buy 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.450
 Will and it will be in ten years yet 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.190
 Many people give the buy and the 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.690
 are also ready where you yourself 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.760
 to accept a price increase 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.990
 my conclusion it is a good protein what 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.120
 probably because I am simply times 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.440
 so as a fortuneteller ahead in the next 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.940
 Years later a bit more expensive will be there 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.680
 you have to think then if you want the 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.000
 company remains faithful or whether one says 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.859
 I just try something different 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.900
 which is certainly a good option 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.489
 both culinary and him except 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.240
 quality view see you in the 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.380
 next video a lot 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.380
 greetings from your simon
