is<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.430> little<00:03:26.580> split<00:03:27.500> harvest<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.739> see

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
is that little split harvest you can see

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.850 
is that little split harvest you can see
that<00:03:29.190> stuffing<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.569> steps<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.319> finally

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
that stuffing the steps and finally

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.280 
that stuffing the steps and finally
figured<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.400> out<00:03:32.690> though<00:03:33.690> for<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.079> part

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
figured it out though for this part

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.330 
figured it out though for this part
you're<00:03:34.349> gonna<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.799> wait<00:03:34.950> for<00:03:34.980> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
you're gonna have to wait for the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.550 
you're gonna have to wait for the
dragon's<00:03:35.790> fire<00:03:36.150> breath<00:03:36.510> onto<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.200> pillars<00:03:37.530> to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
dragon's fire breath onto the pillars to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.860 
dragon's fire breath onto the pillars to
wear<00:03:38.010> off<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.489> try<00:03:39.209> not<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.450> go<00:03:39.660> too<00:03:39.690> early

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
wear off and try not to go too early

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.349 
wear off and try not to go too early
like<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.430> then<00:03:41.670> you'll<00:03:41.819> have<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.180> put

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
like that and then you'll have to put

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.150 
like that and then you'll have to put
this<00:03:42.450> water<00:03:42.750> barrel<00:03:43.109> over<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.530> fire<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.099> you

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
this water barrel over the fire so you

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.039 
this water barrel over the fire so you
can<00:03:44.400> jump<00:03:45.150> on<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.660> next<00:03:46.019> area<00:03:47.870> for<00:03:48.870> here

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
can jump on to the next area for here

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.640 
can jump on to the next area for here
that<00:03:49.290> shooting<00:03:49.739> star<00:03:49.769> comes<00:03:50.489> out<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:51.060> nowhere

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
that shooting star comes out of nowhere

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.900 
that shooting star comes out of nowhere
and<00:03:52.650> you're<00:03:52.890> gonna<00:03:53.010> have<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.340> get<00:03:53.609> rid<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.790> this

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
and you're gonna have to get rid of this

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.240 
and you're gonna have to get rid of this
red<00:03:54.180> block<00:03:54.390> this<00:03:54.840> blue<00:03:55.140> block<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:55.769> then<00:03:55.980> build

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
red block this blue block and then build

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.830 
red block this blue block and then build
the<00:03:56.629> green<00:03:57.629> or<00:03:57.930> yellow<00:03:58.440> block<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:59.750> if<00:04:00.750> you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
the green or yellow block and if you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.449 
the green or yellow block and if you
build<00:04:01.049> them<00:04:01.170> in<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.319> right<00:04:01.500> order<00:04:01.769> which<00:04:02.250> is

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
build them in the right order which is

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.949 
build them in the right order which is
what<00:04:02.819> we're<00:04:02.970> doing<00:04:03.269> then<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:03.629> a<00:04:03.660> house

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
what we're doing then you get a house

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.599 
what we're doing then you get a house
crosspiece<00:04:04.500> if<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:04.829> don't<00:04:05.010> then<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.579> don't

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
crosspiece if you don't then you don't

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.550 
crosspiece if you don't then you don't
get<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.000> house<00:04:06.120> crosspiece<00:04:06.599> but<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.379> isn't

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
get the house crosspiece but this isn't

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.080 
get the house crosspiece but this isn't
a<00:04:07.709> collectibles<00:04:08.160> guide<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.519> it's<00:04:08.639> not<00:04:08.760> like

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
a collectibles guide so it's not like

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:48.260 
a collectibles guide so it's not like
that<00:04:09.299> really<00:04:09.480> matters

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.870 

and<00:04:48.690> for<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.349> final<00:04:49.710> part<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.280> this<00:04:50.430> level<00:04:50.729> you

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
and for the final part of this level you

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.939 
and for the final part of this level you
need<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.060> run<00:04:51.479> away<00:04:51.660> from<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.349> dragon<00:04:52.770> which

need to run away from the dragon which
for<00:04:53.220> some<00:04:53.400> reason<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.849> always<00:04:54.000> one<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.270> my

in<00:05:00.330> general<00:05:00.479> just<00:05:00.900> because<00:05:01.199> of<00:05:02.130> how<00:05:02.310> fun<00:05:02.699> it<00:05:02.880> is

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
in general just because of how fun it is

running away from some crazed deranged
animal<00:05:05.940> behind<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.599> and<00:05:06.870> trying<00:05:07.440> not<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.650> die

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
animal behind you and trying not to die

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.749 
animal behind you and trying not to die
even<00:05:08.280> though<00:05:08.310> somehow<00:05:08.970> scar<00:05:09.539> did<00:05:09.900> die<00:05:10.199> and

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
even though somehow scar did die and

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.350 
even though somehow scar did die and
then<00:05:11.759> he<00:05:11.849> spawned<00:05:12.180> way<00:05:12.660> in<00:05:13.199> front<00:05:13.680> of<00:05:13.800> us<00:05:13.949> so<00:05:14.360> he

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
then he spawned way in front of us so he

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.020 
then he spawned way in front of us so he
waited<00:05:15.599> awhile<00:05:15.810> before<00:05:16.430> dropping<00:05:17.430> back<00:05:17.819> in

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
waited awhile before dropping back in

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.050 
waited awhile before dropping back in
and<00:05:18.330> I<00:05:18.810> don't<00:05:19.020> know<00:05:19.199> why<00:05:19.349> that<00:05:19.500> happens<00:05:19.919> but

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
and I don't know why that happens but

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.790 
and I don't know why that happens but
this<00:05:21.060> part<00:05:21.300> just<00:05:21.449> might<00:05:21.720> be<00:05:21.900> easier<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.440> do<00:05:22.590> it

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
this part just might be easier to do it

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.610 
this part just might be easier to do it
on<00:05:22.919> single-player<00:05:23.759> if<00:05:24.240> you<00:05:24.569> are<00:05:25.080> playing<00:05:25.380> with

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
on single-player if you are playing with

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.460 
on single-player if you are playing with
two<00:05:25.800> people<00:05:26.240> so<00:05:27.240> just<00:05:27.599> keep<00:05:27.840> that<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:28.139> mind<00:05:28.319> I

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
two people so just keep that in mind I

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.740 
two people so just keep that in mind I
guess<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:29.039> on<00:05:29.729> your<00:05:29.880> way<00:05:30.000> down<00:05:30.300> there<00:05:30.599> are<00:05:30.720> a

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
guess and on your way down there are a

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.409 
guess and on your way down there are a
ton<00:05:31.349> of<00:05:31.380> blue<00:05:32.039> studs<00:05:32.340> you<00:05:32.490> can<00:05:32.610> pick<00:05:32.759> up<00:05:32.940> if<00:05:33.180> you

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
ton of blue studs you can pick up if you

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:34.820 
ton of blue studs you can pick up if you
want<00:05:33.630> to<00:05:33.750> try<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.050> go<00:05:34.169> for<00:05:34.319> the<00:05:34.440> true<00:05:34.620> wizard

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
want to try and go for the true wizard

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.159 
want to try and go for the true wizard
and<00:05:35.490> more<00:05:35.849> importantly<00:05:36.240> there<00:05:36.449> are<00:05:36.659> a<00:05:36.690> couple

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
and more importantly there are a couple

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.649 
and more importantly there are a couple
of<00:05:37.409> collectibles<00:05:37.949> like<00:05:38.039> house<00:05:38.880> crest<00:05:39.240> pieces

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
of collectibles like house crest pieces

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.180 
of collectibles like house crest pieces
and<00:05:40.020> I<00:05:40.169> think<00:05:40.380> there's<00:05:40.500> one<00:05:40.680> house<00:05:40.889> crest

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
and I think there's one house crest

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.510 
and I think there's one house crest
piece<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:41.669> a<00:05:42.259> student<00:05:43.259> that<00:05:43.440> we<00:05:43.650> missed<00:05:43.919> I'm

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
piece and a student that we missed I'm

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.510 
piece and a student that we missed I'm
not<00:05:44.639> a<00:05:44.669> student<00:05:44.909> in<00:05:45.120> peril<00:05:45.419> but<00:05:45.539> the<00:05:45.750> student

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
not a student in peril but the student

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.460 
not a student in peril but the student
character<00:05:47.520> piece

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.170 

and<00:05:52.190> of<00:05:52.280> course<00:05:52.460> if<00:05:52.640> you're<00:05:52.760> miserable<00:05:52.940> I'm

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
and of course if you're miserable I'm

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.580
