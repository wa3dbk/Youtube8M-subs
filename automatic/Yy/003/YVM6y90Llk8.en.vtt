I<00:06:21.510> really<00:06:22.080> like<00:06:22.320> on<00:06:22.590> these<00:06:22.800> builds<00:06:23.220> but<00:06:23.580> I

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
I really like on these builds but I

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.860 
I really like on these builds but I
would<00:06:23.820> probably<00:06:23.970> do<00:06:24.180> with<00:06:24.270> it<00:06:24.390> if<00:06:24.480> I<00:06:24.570> was<00:06:24.720> to

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
would probably do with it if I was to

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.690 
would probably do with it if I was to
specifically<00:06:25.440> use<00:06:25.680> this<00:06:25.830> mod<00:06:26.040> it<00:06:26.250> would<00:06:26.340> be<00:06:26.520> to

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
specifically use this mod it would be to

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.220 
specifically use this mod it would be to
create<00:06:26.820> like<00:06:27.060> a<00:06:27.150> city<00:06:27.450> because<00:06:27.990> there's<00:06:28.110> like

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
create like a city because there's like

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.390 
create like a city because there's like
8<00:06:28.410> different<00:06:28.470> things<00:06:29.010> that<00:06:29.160> you<00:06:29.220> could<00:06:29.370> use

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
8 different things that you could use

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.770 
8 different things that you could use
you<00:06:29.820> can<00:06:29.940> create<00:06:30.090> like<00:06:30.240> some<00:06:30.450> kind<00:06:30.600> of<00:06:30.660> like

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
you can create like some kind of like

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.540 
you can create like some kind of like
town<00:06:31.020> or<00:06:31.230> city<00:06:31.350> it'd<00:06:31.830> be<00:06:31.950> like<00:06:32.070> a<00:06:32.160> nice<00:06:32.340> like

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
town or city it'd be like a nice like

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.100 
town or city it'd be like a nice like
piece<00:06:32.820> like<00:06:33.060> around<00:06:33.300> your<00:06:33.510> actual<00:06:33.780> house<00:06:33.960> you

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
piece like around your actual house you

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.540 
piece like around your actual house you
built<00:06:34.290> yourself<00:06:34.380> because<00:06:35.190> I<00:06:35.220> wouldn't<00:06:35.490> want

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
built yourself because I wouldn't want

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.480 
built yourself because I wouldn't want
to<00:06:35.730> just<00:06:35.910> use<00:06:36.060> this<00:06:36.210> stuff<00:06:36.450> for<00:06:36.510> like<00:06:36.810> my<00:06:36.960> own

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
to just use this stuff for like my own

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.260 
to just use this stuff for like my own
builds<00:06:38.490> cuz<00:06:38.610> you<00:06:38.700> know<00:06:38.790> it's<00:06:38.910> fun<00:06:39.060> to<00:06:39.150> build

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
builds cuz you know it's fun to build

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.550 
builds cuz you know it's fun to build
stuff<00:06:39.450> yourself<00:06:39.810> but<00:06:39.900> this<00:06:40.020> would<00:06:40.140> be<00:06:40.200> cool

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
stuff yourself but this would be cool

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.690 
stuff yourself but this would be cool
like<00:06:40.650> a<00:06:40.680> little<00:06:40.950> town<00:06:41.160> or<00:06:41.370> something<00:06:41.639> like

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700 
like a little town or something like

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.920 
like a little town or something like
that<00:06:41.880> I<00:06:41.910> think<00:06:42.060> it'd<00:06:42.270> be<00:06:42.330> pretty<00:06:42.450> cool<00:06:42.600> or<00:06:42.750> even

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
that I think it'd be pretty cool or even

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.450 
that I think it'd be pretty cool or even
for<00:06:43.080> like<00:06:43.200> a<00:06:43.230> server<00:06:43.620> you<00:06:43.889> could<00:06:44.010> probably<00:06:44.190> you

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
for like a server you could probably you

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.030 
for like a server you could probably you
know<00:06:44.580> use<00:06:44.850> it<00:06:45.470> for<00:06:46.470> something<00:06:46.620> like<00:06:46.770> that

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
know use it for something like that

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.470 
know use it for something like that
