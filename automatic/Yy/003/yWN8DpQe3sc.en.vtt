00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.170
 back to the local league 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.170

 the game the action of a dessert at 8 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.240
 of the bills with coffee 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:15.360
 they have to be vigilant look for another 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.360
 side 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.459
 we have the whites beaten with the 240 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.560
 grams of sugar we incorporate a 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.480
 spoonful of corn starch with little bomb 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.239
 of baking and the kilo so and if not also 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.099
 it is so good we are incorporating what 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.250
 is the idea try to not less lose the 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.989
 air because because you shake do not treat 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.390
 the green in the air because just the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.489
 grace of this is that it is well exposed 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.140
 quote is the fact the grace of the island 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.370
 floating eat someone who looks like he is 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.319
 how to eat a cloud was opening the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.239
 super lightweight stereo stopped to you 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.630
 melts in the mouth what is the grace 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.490
 also from the big donor besides 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.490
 [Music] 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.020
 as with the living room or the direct 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.970
 on the mold this one was in rosita 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.640
 sugar if you want to stir make it alone 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.830
 sugar without water please and you do 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.200
 stirring and if you're not going to stir it 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.030
 you can put sugar a little bit of water 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.860
 just to be worth it and what 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.230
 leave there on low heat until it leaves 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.640
 taking the caramel color and once 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.010
 take with the candy in the good pot 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.900
 you pass it here you distribute it well 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.480
 keep that you can burn a question 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.830
 of life question of seeing the color because 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.720
 yes of city if they are so many minutes 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.580
 matter of seeing the color you have to 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.590
 be attentive to the color that is color 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.870
 just candy of at least the most 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.550
 Exactly clear there is a little bit darker and 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.800
 there is already darker that is exposed more to 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.340
 hand then well blonde very good 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.610
 we have the preparation and this is key 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.500
 I accommodate in the patience of the blow because 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.640
 what usually happens with the islands 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.980
 floating ones that are like 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.330
 small air holes and that's what 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.420
 we want to avoid then you have to 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.850
 accommodate the good for 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.120
 do not stay in holes to go putting that 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.310
 hodgepodge of egg whites with sugar 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.290
 exact 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.630
 it's not worth so much to hit him because he does not 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.700
 we want it to lose in turn the air that 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.800
 they have incorporated the clear ones then 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.620
 we're not going to hit him, we're just going 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.120
 to distribute with the rubber spatula 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.310
 basically that before with the 8 full 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.990
 What you have left is that you keep them 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.300
 it 's just this cake 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.640
