00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.719
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.120
 from me 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.389
 Today I want one with you 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.800
 Turkish supreme try 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.690
 I'm curious if I am 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.289
 that succeeds the recipe I have from the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.320
 Internet 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.350
 and I a bit in recent times 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.180
 more try on meat and sausage too 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.519
 I do not have to do that with the sausage 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.399
 it really works well to say that works 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.980
 I'm sure I've been doing it for a good two 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.610
 years that I manage the meat 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.030
 I do not always succeed so but the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.059
 Will is there and that's why I need it 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.739
 again something for the bread 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.360
 and yes I hope you are interested 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.739
 also and let's start now 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.590
 use a garlic clove peeled 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.329
 then I have half an onion 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.739
 now just a little onion here 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.460
 that's why I have them all now 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.149
 took 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 they come in the mixed if you need it 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.780
 We 100 grams higher carrot in pieces 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.810
 cut and peeled naturally comes 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.080
 and it will be small for the first time 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.080
 made and a customer level 5 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:37.080
 she pushes down here all the time 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:39.980
 with a spatula the kno smells again 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.980
 really good 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.710
 something like that comes now our feta comes 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.850
 Cheese in addition and it is 100 grams 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.790
 I've got that one before 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:00.960
 we should now have a bit of crumbles 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:18.300
 also still and again five 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:20.400
 second level 50 grams 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.520
 but I have only now 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.489
 I 'm careful I sleep 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.280
 only half 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.940
 if you can have one normal one 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:38.160
 you certainly do 50 grams of pure 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.440
 but I am afraid that you know 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.510
 Fire 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.530
 so now come another 200 grams 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.530
 cream cheese 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.640
 that was already everything in it 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:11.840
 Ten seconds 3 lost so that 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.370
 is our Turkish supreme the must 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.060
 Of course, I will do the same again 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.060
 try 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.950
 I still have such a nice one here 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.550
 pretzel my children again not 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.060
 wanted to 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.100
 you probably know that 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:43.570
 eat mum 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:47.060
 Well , so if you take over the sheep 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.959
 The half is pretty funny though 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.459
 not too sharp in the normal information 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.140
 I would have to give it a try I can 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.140
 do not say it now but tastes delicious 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.320
 but 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.150
 you can still taste the carrots 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:18.820
 a bit so the markets on it 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:20.989
 does not show well I'm excited about it 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.820
 I would say where we just go now 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.169
 yourself and form your opinion 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.610
 against in turn drew us soon 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.380
 made a delicious spread here 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.550
 You can not complain about anything 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:38.360
 few ingredients and it is fresh so 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.180
 I think it's ok, I wish you now 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.259
 Have a nice day for the next time 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.259
 well, stay healthy
