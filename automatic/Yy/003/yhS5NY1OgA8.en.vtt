any<00:06:05.610> kind<00:06:05.820> of<00:06:06.050> Phoenix<00:06:07.050> or<00:06:07.230> void<00:06:07.440> ray<00:06:07.620> opening

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
any kind of Phoenix or void ray opening

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.130 
any kind of Phoenix or void ray opening
he<00:06:08.130> should<00:06:08.310> be<00:06:08.400> way<00:06:08.580> ahead<00:06:08.610> economically<00:06:09.270> yeah

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
he should be way ahead economically yeah

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.660 
he should be way ahead economically yeah
what's<00:06:10.410> important<00:06:10.860> to<00:06:10.950> notice<00:06:11.130> is<00:06:11.430> that<00:06:11.460> the

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
what's important to notice is that the

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.670 
what's important to notice is that the
Terran<00:06:12.000> has<00:06:12.180> not<00:06:12.570> yet<00:06:12.870> gotten<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.290> second

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
Terran has not yet gotten the second

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.950 
Terran has not yet gotten the second
guest<00:06:13.890> just<00:06:14.220> now<00:06:14.460> actually<00:06:14.970> but<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:15.720> gas

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
guest just now actually but the gas

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.230 
guest just now actually but the gas
being<00:06:16.290> late<00:06:16.650> is<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:16.890> huge<00:06:17.580> indication<00:06:18.090> that

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
being late is a huge indication that

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.690 
being late is a huge indication that
there<00:06:18.420> can<00:06:18.570> only<00:06:18.780> be<00:06:19.080> this<00:06:19.800> mass<00:06:20.160> marine

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
there can only be this mass marine

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.040 
there can only be this mass marine
there's<00:06:21.000> not<00:06:21.180> going<00:06:21.300> to<00:06:21.360> be<00:06:21.420> any<00:06:21.660> sort<00:06:21.840> that

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
there's not going to be any sort that

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.510 
there's not going to be any sort that
Steve<00:06:22.200> Jenks<00:06:22.470> of<00:06:22.560> course<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:22.950> factories<00:06:23.370> up

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
Steve Jenks of course the factories up

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.000 
Steve Jenks of course the factories up
also<00:06:24.090> no<00:06:24.240> Banshee<00:06:24.750> capacity<00:06:25.380> so<00:06:25.800> it<00:06:25.860> really

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
also no Banshee capacity so it really

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.820 
also no Banshee capacity so it really
limits<00:06:26.340> the<00:06:26.610> Terran<00:06:27.090> in<00:06:27.270> what<00:06:27.570> MC<00:06:28.290> has<00:06:28.530> to

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
limits the Terran in what MC has to

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.350 
limits the Terran in what MC has to
defend<00:06:29.160> against<00:06:29.490> and<00:06:29.700> that's<00:06:29.820> why<00:06:30.000> we<00:06:30.180> see

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
defend against and that's why we see

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.510 
defend against and that's why we see
just<00:06:30.900> a<00:06:30.990> very<00:06:31.200> fast<00:06:31.440> expansion<00:06:31.860> out<00:06:32.160> of<00:06:32.400> this

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
just a very fast expansion out of this

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.670 
just a very fast expansion out of this
he<00:06:32.670> knows<00:06:32.850> any<00:06:33.180> pressure<00:06:33.780> is<00:06:34.080> a<00:06:34.110> little<00:06:34.320> bit

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
he knows any pressure is a little bit

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.190 
he knows any pressure is a little bit
later<00:06:34.890> on<00:06:34.980> and<00:06:35.730> he<00:06:35.850> does<00:06:36.330> he<00:06:36.570> gets<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:37.020> mule

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
later on and he does he gets the mule

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.100 
later on and he does he gets the mule
mule<00:06:37.470> is<00:06:37.710> snipe<00:06:38.070> as<00:06:38.250> well<00:06:38.400> as<00:06:38.460> an<00:06:38.520> SCV<00:06:39.110> Puma

does go ahead and push those Phoenix off

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.760 
does go ahead and push those Phoenix off
the<00:06:42.780> mineral<00:06:43.050> line<00:06:43.140> but<00:06:43.290> they<00:06:43.380> are<00:06:43.440> retaining

attentive<00:06:56.220> to<00:06:56.400> the<00:06:56.520> Terran<00:06:56.790> base<00:06:57.000> he<00:06:57.780> should

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
attentive to the Terran base he should

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.090 
attentive to the Terran base he should
keep<00:06:58.290> a<00:06:58.560> constant<00:06:59.130> idea<00:06:59.700> of<00:06:59.820> what

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
keep a constant idea of what

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
going on and then right now he's always

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.590 
going on and then right now he's always
seen<00:07:01.270> Marines<00:07:01.540> as<00:07:01.750> well<00:07:02.290> as<00:07:02.380> a<00:07:02.440> single<00:07:03.600> Viking

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
seen Marines as well as a single Viking

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.990 
seen Marines as well as a single Viking
and<00:07:04.800> he<00:07:05.800> knows<00:07:06.010> that<00:07:06.040> that<00:07:06.430> orbit<00:07:06.700> plan<00:07:06.850> has

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
and he knows that that orbit plan has

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.490 
and he knows that that orbit plan has
not<00:07:07.180> land<00:07:07.450> the<00:07:07.570> expansion<00:07:07.990> just<00:07:08.110> yet<00:07:08.260> so<00:07:08.290> he's

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
not land the expansion just yet so he's

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500 
not land the expansion just yet so he's
actually<00:07:09.030> equalizing<00:07:10.030> their<00:07:10.150> economies

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
actually equalizing their economies

right now just with this wrasse yeah
it's<00:07:12.700> getting<00:07:13.090> so<00:07:13.270> helpful<00:07:13.720> a<00:07:13.840> lot<00:07:14.050> of<00:07:14.200> times

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:14.380 
it's getting so helpful a lot of times

it's getting so helpful a lot of times
you<00:07:14.470> get<00:07:14.560> that<00:07:14.710> early<00:07:15.250> command<00:07:15.580> center<00:07:15.820> out<00:07:16.000> so

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150 
you get that early command center out so

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.720 
you get that early command center out so
you<00:07:16.240> get<00:07:16.390> those<00:07:16.510> mules<00:07:16.840> but<00:07:17.530> MCS<00:07:17.980> having<00:07:18.310> none

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730 
you get those mules but MCS having none
