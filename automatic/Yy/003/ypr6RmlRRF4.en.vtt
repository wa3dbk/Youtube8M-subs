patient with a different take down side
view<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.430> can<00:04:10.790> be<00:04:10.909> more<00:04:11.060> aggressive<00:04:11.299> that's

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
range for the glide kick I'll just check

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.980 
range for the glide kick I'll just check
no<00:04:31.460> one<00:04:31.580> else<00:04:31.699> is<00:04:31.789> around<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.449> then<00:04:32.750> i<00:04:32.810> can

again grapple back up a now cuz that's a

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.610 
again grapple back up a now cuz that's a
very<00:04:44.210> noisy<00:04:44.419> take<00:04:44.840> down<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.169> glide<00:04:45.349> think

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
very noisy take down the glide think

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.779 
very noisy take down the glide think
it's<00:04:45.770> going<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.919> attract<00:04:46.220> people<00:04:46.550> very

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
it's going to attract people very

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.279 
it's going to attract people very
quickly<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.599> so<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.050> dangerous

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
quickly to it so it is a dangerous

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.839 
quickly to it so it is a dangerous
tactic<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.009> use<00:04:49.220> but<00:04:49.400> it's<00:04:49.550> also<00:04:49.669> a<00:04:49.820> very

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
tactic to use but it's also a very

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.450 
tactic to use but it's also a very
effective<00:04:50.389> tactic<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.080> use<00:04:54.160> so<00:04:55.160> now<00:04:55.310> we're

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
effective tactic to use so now we're

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.560 
effective tactic to use so now we're
down<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.639> just<00:04:55.789> a<00:04:56.030> couple<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.389> henchmen

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
you'll see their behavior starts to

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.140 
you'll see their behavior starts to
change<00:05:00.800> as<00:05:01.070> well<00:05:01.250> as<00:05:01.400> they<00:05:01.550> become<00:05:01.820> more<00:05:01.880> and

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
him and this again it's not something

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.890 
him and this again it's not something
that's<00:05:16.130> always<00:05:16.340> predictable<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.599> way<00:05:17.720> their

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
that's always predictable the way their

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.270 
that's always predictable the way their
behavior<00:05:18.380> changes<00:05:18.830> as<00:05:18.949> you<00:05:19.039> play<00:05:19.250> through

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
behavior changes as you play through

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.430 
behavior changes as you play through
means<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.210> constantly<00:05:20.690> have<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.900> adapt<00:05:21.289> your

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
means you constantly have to adapt your
