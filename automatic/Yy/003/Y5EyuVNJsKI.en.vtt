different variations so I want you guys
to<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.469> which<00:00:34.680> configuration<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.640> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to know which configuration this is this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.740 
to know which configuration this is this
config<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.320> 9:05<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.450> keep<00:00:39.600> that

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
config is the you 9:05 to so keep that

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.490 
config is the you 9:05 to so keep that
in<00:00:39.809> mind<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.320> what

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
in mind because that's what

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.740 
in mind because that's what
differentiates<00:00:40.829> these<00:00:41.309> from<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> others<00:00:42.570> all

of<00:00:45.090> all<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.239> far<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.480> processor<00:00:45.960> goes<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.379> have

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
of all as far as processor goes you have

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.540 
of all as far as processor goes you have
an<00:00:46.590> AMD<00:00:46.950> Athlon<00:00:47.700> 2<00:00:47.969> X<00:00:48.300> 2<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:49.980> actually

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
an AMD Athlon 2 X 2 and that is actually

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
an AMD Athlon 2 X 2 and that is actually
a<00:00:50.789> new<00:00:51.210> chip<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.140> had<00:00:52.289> never<00:00:52.469> heard<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.860> until

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
a new chip I had never heard of it until

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.569 
a new chip I had never heard of it until
today<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> 215<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> dual-core

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
today it is a 215 so that is a dual-core

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.090 
today it is a 215 so that is a dual-core

no<00:01:14.640> problem<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.110> course<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.350> can

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
no problem and then of course you can

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.840 
no problem and then of course you can
run<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.710> multi<00:01:17.070> two<00:01:17.159> programs<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.670> even

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
run a multi two programs you can even

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
run a multi two programs you can even
run<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.900> cs4<00:01:19.560> Photoshop<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.460> no

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
run you know cs4 Photoshop on here no

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.830 
run you know cs4 Photoshop on here no
problem<00:01:20.880> stuff<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.689> gonna

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
problem stuff like that is not gonna

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.870 
problem stuff like that is not gonna
primary<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.439> chip<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.490> four

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
primary on this chip you also have four

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390 
primary on this chip you also have four
gigabytes<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.590> ddr2<00:01:25.590> memory<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.220> that's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
gigabytes of ddr2 memory so that's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.950 
gigabytes of ddr2 memory so that's
enough<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> run<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.270> about<00:01:27.360> anything<00:01:27.780> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
enough to run just about anything that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
enough to run just about anything that
you<00:01:28.140> could<00:01:28.259> possibly<00:01:28.380> ever<00:01:28.590> want<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.490> also

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you could possibly ever want you also

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.910 
you could possibly ever want you also
have<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.060> huge<00:01:30.540> hard<00:01:30.780> drive<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.079> why<00:01:31.200> this

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
have a huge hard drive that's why this

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.499 
have a huge hard drive that's why this
thing<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.700> small<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> makes<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.270> really

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
thing it's so small it makes a really

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.980 
thing it's so small it makes a really
good<00:01:33.630> media<00:01:33.900> center<00:01:34.110> PC<00:01:34.170> cuz<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> huge

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
good media center PC cuz it's got a huge

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.960 
good media center PC cuz it's got a huge
750<00:01:36.990> gigabyte<00:01:37.200> hard<00:01:38.100> drive<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.640> very

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
750 gigabyte hard drive so it's very

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
750 gigabyte hard drive so it's very
very<00:01:39.450> impressive<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.110> also<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.130> far<00:01:41.280> as

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
very impressive and also as far as
