showing<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.460> my<00:00:08.670> base<00:00:09.179> design<00:00:09.769> now<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.130> am

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
showing you my base design now I am

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.280 
showing you my base design now I am
going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.759> put<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.059> out<00:00:12.210> right<00:00:12.450> now<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:13.019> is

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.700 
going to put this out right now this is
my<00:00:13.679> design<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.549> came<00:00:15.360> up<00:00:15.540> with<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.839> did<00:00:16.320> not<00:00:16.470> look

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
my design I came up with it did not look

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.620 
my design I came up with it did not look
it<00:00:16.859> up<00:00:16.920> on<00:00:17.100> any<00:00:17.250> websites<00:00:17.789> or<00:00:18.029> anything<00:00:18.270> and

this<00:00:21.990> video<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.850> living<00:00:23.850> evidence<00:00:24.170> that<00:00:25.170> this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
this video is living evidence that this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.400 
this video is living evidence that this
is<00:00:25.619> not<00:00:25.830> anyone<00:00:26.730> else's<00:00:27.150> I'm<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.750> first<00:00:28.019> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
is not anyone else's I'm the first to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.370 
is not anyone else's I'm the first to
upload<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.519> design<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.480> maybe<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:31.050> because

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
upload this design or maybe not because

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.020 
upload this design or maybe not because
there's<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.830> many<00:00:31.980> people<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.700> play<00:00:32.880> this

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
there's so many people that play this

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.060 
there's so many people that play this
game<00:00:33.300> maybe<00:00:33.780> there's<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.140> duplicate<00:00:34.649> out<00:00:34.829> there

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
game maybe there's a duplicate out there

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.970 
game maybe there's a duplicate out there
somewhere<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:35.880> know<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.870> anyway<00:00:37.260> this

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
somewhere I don't know but anyway this

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.729 
somewhere I don't know but anyway this
is<00:00:38.160> my<00:00:38.309> design<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.629> gonna<00:00:39.780> explain<00:00:39.989> why

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
is my design so I'm gonna explain why

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.600 
is my design so I'm gonna explain why
I'm<00:00:41.190> satisfied<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.260> been

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
I'm satisfied with it because it's been

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.069 
I'm satisfied with it because it's been
defending<00:00:44.610> itself<00:00:44.940> pretty<00:00:45.090> well<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.570> mean<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
defending itself pretty well I mean a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.880 
defending itself pretty well I mean a
lot<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.739> base<00:00:47.070> raids<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.539> they<00:00:49.469> usually

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
lot of the base raids I get they usually

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.490 
lot of the base raids I get they usually
fail<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.329> don't<00:00:51.719> destroy<00:00:52.140> everything

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
fail so they don't destroy everything

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.119 
fail so they don't destroy everything
they<00:00:53.340> actually<00:00:53.940> never<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.539> more<00:00:54.809> than<00:00:55.129> 70%

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
they actually never get more than 70%

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.369 
they actually never get more than 70%
most<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.539> when<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:57.960> win

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
most of the time but when they do win

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.430 
most of the time but when they do win
it's<00:00:58.590> by<00:00:58.770> very<00:00:59.250> very<00:00:59.609> very<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:01.050> anyway

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it's by very very very little so anyway

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.590 
it's by very very very little so anyway
let<00:01:01.800> me<00:01:01.949> show<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.550> reason<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.329> now

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
let me show you the reason for that now

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.030 
let me show you the reason for that now
let's<00:01:04.019> start<00:01:04.379> over<00:01:04.850> here<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.439> I've<00:01:07.439> got<00:01:07.799> all

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
let's start over here and I've got all

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.620 
let's start over here and I've got all
of<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> something<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.270> everybody

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
of this is something that everybody

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.030 
of this is something that everybody
should<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.200> their<00:01:10.320> base<00:01:10.500> design<00:01:10.860> by<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
should do at their base design by the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.320 
should do at their base design by the
way<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> pumps<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.520> oops

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
way this is how all the pumps and oops

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.499 
way this is how all the pumps and oops
all<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> pumps<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.920> mines<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
all of the pumps and mines are on the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.469 
all of the pumps and mines are on the
outside<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.380> base<00:01:19.820> now<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.030> someone<00:01:21.210> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
outside of the base now for someone that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
outside of the base now for someone that
checks<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.020> their<00:01:22.200> clash<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.590> clans<00:01:22.890> like

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
checks up on their clash of clans like

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.490 
checks up on their clash of clans like
every<00:01:23.520> day<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.869> especially<00:01:25.259> useful

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
every day this is especially useful

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.399 
every day this is especially useful
because<00:01:26.090> when<00:01:27.090> someone<00:01:27.450> raids<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.900> they'll

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
because when someone raids you they'll

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.219 
because when someone raids you they'll
destroy<00:01:28.890> these<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.180> you've<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.810> been<00:01:30.930> on

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
destroy these but if you've just been on

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770 
destroy these but if you've just been on
then<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.159> get<00:01:32.340> nothing<00:01:32.970> when<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.420> destroy

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
then they get nothing when they destroy

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.310 
then they get nothing when they destroy
I'd<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.170> three<00:01:34.530> gold<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.420> but<00:01:36.420> they<00:01:36.900> really

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
I'd see three gold there but they really

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
I'd see three gold there but they really
don't<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.100> much<00:01:38.280> resources<00:01:39.150> they<00:01:39.390> don't

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
don't get that much resources they don't

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.810 
don't get that much resources they don't
really<00:01:39.659> get<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.250> nothing<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.640> really

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
really get that nothing out of it really

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.060 
really get that nothing out of it really
they<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.479> 300<00:01:43.350> or<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:43.890> that's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
they get like 300 or so but that's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.649 
they get like 300 or so but that's
actually<00:01:44.280> after<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> couple<00:01:45.149> minutes<00:01:45.360> of

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
actually after a couple minutes of

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.719 
actually after a couple minutes of
waiting<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:47.159> you're<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.610> gonna

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
waiting but what you're really gonna

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.850 
waiting but what you're really gonna
want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> defend<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> middle<00:01:49.710> but

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
want to defend is here in the middle but

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.340 
want to defend is here in the middle but
the<00:01:49.890> storages<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.840> another<00:01:51.840> thing<00:01:52.110> that's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the storages and another thing that's

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.530 
the storages and another thing that's
not<00:01:52.500> really<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.040> benefit<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.790> any<00:01:53.909> way<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.329> far

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
not really a benefit in any way as far

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
not really a benefit in any way as far
as<00:01:54.659> defending<00:01:55.079> itself<00:01:55.320> goes<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.860> kind<00:01:56.159> of

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
as defending itself goes but I kind of

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
as defending itself goes but I kind of
like<00:01:56.430> how<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.850> symmetrical<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.170> see

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
like how it's symmetrical as you can see

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.639 
like how it's symmetrical as you can see
there's<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.310> pattern<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.750> that's

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
there's a pattern going on here that's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
there's a pattern going on here that's
another<00:02:02.070> thing<00:02:02.340> about<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.880> base<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.509> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
another thing about this base this is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.969 
another thing about this base this is
actually<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> negative<00:02:04.290> thing<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.740> there's<00:02:04.920> no

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
actually a negative thing is there's no

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.190 
actually a negative thing is there's no
empty<00:02:05.759> space<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.420> except<00:02:06.930> for<00:02:07.110> this

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
empty space in here except for this

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.139 
empty space in here except for this
little<00:02:07.409> compartment

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
little compartment

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.869 
little compartment
right<00:02:08.269> here<00:02:08.539> but<00:02:09.530> there's<00:02:10.129> really<00:02:10.369> no<00:02:10.610> space

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
right here but there's really no space

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.910 
right here but there's really no space
for<00:02:11.150> traps<00:02:11.450> except<00:02:11.900> for<00:02:11.989> on<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.110> outside<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
for traps except for on the outside and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.100 
for traps except for on the outside and
maybe<00:02:13.189> a<00:02:13.340> few<00:02:13.579> spots<00:02:13.939> like<00:02:14.239> he<00:02:14.510> or<00:02:14.629> I<00:02:14.780> didn't

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
maybe a few spots like he or I didn't

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.740 
maybe a few spots like he or I didn't
have<00:02:15.200> enough<00:02:15.379> walls<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.920> put<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:16.220> there<00:02:16.750> but

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
have enough walls to put it there but

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.039 
have enough walls to put it there but
yeah<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.069> now<00:02:19.340> here<00:02:19.879> comes<00:02:19.909> the<00:02:20.239> biggest

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
yeah so now here comes the biggest

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.369 
yeah so now here comes the biggest
reason<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.129> love<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.849> base<00:02:23.120> design<00:02:23.629> now

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
reason that I love this base design now

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.770 
reason that I love this base design now
just<00:02:25.040> imagine<00:02:25.939> that<00:02:25.970> you're<00:02:26.239> rating<00:02:26.659> this

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
just imagine that you're rating this

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.080 
just imagine that you're rating this
base<00:02:27.049> right<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.500> put<00:02:27.739> down<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.220> 20<00:02:28.609> Giants

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
base right you put down like 20 Giants

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.720 
base right you put down like 20 Giants
over<00:02:29.239> here<00:02:29.750> they<00:02:30.230> destroy<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.799> Tesla<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.519> put

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
over here they destroy the Tesla you put

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.280 
over here they destroy the Tesla you put
a<00:02:31.760> wall<00:02:32.000> breaker<00:02:32.329> goes<00:02:32.629> through<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.049> wall

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
a wall breaker goes through this wall

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.369 
a wall breaker goes through this wall
they<00:02:34.069> all<00:02:34.220> smash<00:02:34.640> through<00:02:34.939> this<00:02:35.030> wall<00:02:35.379> smash

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
they all smash through this wall smash

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.059 
they all smash through this wall smash
through<00:02:36.709> this<00:02:37.010> wall<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.109> then<00:02:39.109> oh<00:02:39.260> no<00:02:39.650> hidden

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
through this wall and then oh no hidden

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.360 
through this wall and then oh no hidden
Tesla<00:02:40.519> they<00:02:41.150> destroy<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.139> boom<00:02:42.470> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
Tesla they destroy that in that boom the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.349 
Tesla they destroy that in that boom the
whole<00:02:43.670> crowd<00:02:44.260> explodes<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.680> dies<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:47.209> what

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
whole crowd explodes and dies so what

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.089 
whole crowd explodes and dies so what
happens<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.959> when<00:02:48.139> you<00:02:48.230> come<00:02:48.440> up<00:02:48.590> against<00:02:48.980> a

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
happens is when you come up against a

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.550 
happens is when you come up against a
wall<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.359> ton<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.780> troops<00:02:51.319> like

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
wall and you have a ton of troops like

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.250 
wall and you have a ton of troops like
20<00:02:52.069> or<00:02:52.190> more<00:02:52.459> they're<00:02:53.269> all<00:02:53.420> gonna<00:02:53.599> be<00:02:53.810> smacking

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
20 or more they're all gonna be smacking

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.920 
20 or more they're all gonna be smacking
away<00:02:54.439> at<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:54.680> wall<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.400> when<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.389> space<00:02:56.720> is

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
away at this wall and when the space is

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.589 
away at this wall and when the space is
this<00:02:57.290> small<00:02:57.680> between<00:02:58.069> walls<00:02:58.370> like<00:02:59.180> the

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
this small between walls like the

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.300 
this small between walls like the
difference<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.230> speeds<00:03:00.590> when<00:03:00.920> they<00:03:01.069> run

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
difference in speeds when they run

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.160 
difference in speeds when they run
doesn't<00:03:01.670> even<00:03:01.760> matter<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.420> they're<00:03:02.569> still<00:03:02.959> in

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
doesn't even matter so they're still in

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.910 
doesn't even matter so they're still in
a<00:03:03.260> group<00:03:03.670> still<00:03:04.670> in<00:03:04.879> a<00:03:04.970> group<00:03:05.530> hits<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.739> bomb

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
a group still in a group hits the bomb

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.429 
a group still in a group hits the bomb
everything<00:03:07.639> dies<00:03:08.090> they're<00:03:08.420> all<00:03:08.569> compacting

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
everything dies they're all compacting

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.349 
everything dies they're all compacting
this<00:03:09.590> one<00:03:09.829> little<00:03:10.040> swarm<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:10.879> then<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> bomb

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
this one little swarm and then the bomb

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.259 
this one little swarm and then the bomb
destroys<00:03:11.810> everything<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:12.819> this<00:03:13.819> wizard

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
destroys everything and this wizard

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.000 
destroys everything and this wizard
tower<00:03:14.419> over<00:03:14.750> here<00:03:14.989> can<00:03:15.199> take<00:03:15.410> care<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.829> the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
tower over here can take care of the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.390 
tower over here can take care of the
rest<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.519> survived<00:03:17.030> which<00:03:17.419> is<00:03:17.599> not<00:03:17.900> many

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
rest that survived which is not many

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.400 
rest that survived which is not many
usually<00:03:19.400> Giants<00:03:19.940> die<00:03:20.150> instantly<00:03:20.750> but<00:03:20.959> that's

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
usually Giants die instantly but that's

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.869 
usually Giants die instantly but that's
the<00:03:21.680> one<00:03:21.859> thing<00:03:22.160> where<00:03:22.310> there's<00:03:22.519> like<00:03:22.669> maybe

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
the one thing where there's like maybe

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.080 
the one thing where there's like maybe
two<00:03:23.239> or<00:03:23.419> three<00:03:23.449> that<00:03:23.840> survived<00:03:24.370> but<00:03:25.370> yeah<00:03:25.609> so

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
two or three that survived but yeah so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.439 
two or three that survived but yeah so
that's<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:27.109> shining<00:03:28.010> gem<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.549> this<00:03:28.970> design<00:03:29.419> is

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:29.449 
that's the shining gem of this design is

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.020 
that's the shining gem of this design is
that<00:03:30.139> it<00:03:31.040> can<00:03:31.280> make<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.609> difference<00:03:31.639> between

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
that it can make the difference between

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.759 
that it can make the difference between
winning<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.780> losing<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:33.230> battle<00:03:33.379> actually

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
winning and losing a battle actually

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.069 
winning and losing a battle actually
that's<00:03:34.220> happened<00:03:34.609> multiple<00:03:34.730> times<00:03:35.079> where

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
that's happened multiple times where

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.830 
that's happened multiple times where
they<00:03:36.260> have<00:03:36.590> like<00:03:36.859> 30<00:03:37.639> Giants<00:03:38.180> one<00:03:38.329> guy<00:03:38.540> did

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
they have like 30 Giants one guy did

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.860 
they have like 30 Giants one guy did
comes<00:03:39.650> up<00:03:39.829> to<00:03:39.979> this<00:03:40.129> bomb<00:03:40.340> all<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.389> explodes

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
comes up to this bomb all of it explodes

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.500 
comes up to this bomb all of it explodes
they<00:03:42.379> get<00:03:42.650> they<00:03:43.370> didn't<00:03:43.609> even<00:03:43.699> get<00:03:43.940> they<00:03:44.389> got

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
they get they didn't even get they got

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.409 
they get they didn't even get they got
like<00:03:44.720> 40%<00:03:45.109> and<00:03:45.680> they<00:03:45.889> lost<00:03:46.400> trophies<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.180> they

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
like 40% and they lost trophies and they

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.670 
like 40% and they lost trophies and they
didn't<00:03:47.720> even<00:03:47.810> get<00:03:47.989> that<00:03:48.139> much<00:03:48.260> good<00:03:48.500> and
