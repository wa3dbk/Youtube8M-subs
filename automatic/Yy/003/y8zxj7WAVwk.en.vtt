00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.870
 Pascoe 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.170
 you put 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.260
 hello to all these young people 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.630
 found for episode 2 weapons 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.369
 of call of duty and the war 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.050
 do so today we're going 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.810
 take a special interest in 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.770
 mp with two elite types called 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.020
 Goliath 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.300
 so some have three advantages 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.489
 but also three disadvantages that are 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.620
 following the so she goes to +3 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.190
 damage which brought them back two 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.629
 damage sets to 10 of debates but the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.180
 three chords having suddenly 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.440
 handling features that make 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.100
 go down this characteristic from 12 to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.170
 9 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.559
 we will now go to the test of 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.040
 satam in the shooting stand on the stand 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.409
 number 4 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.530
 you can see that the armp and sada 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.259
 silver camouflage with some 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.460
 drawings on 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.460
 she is also awarded a 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.399
 growth of a dark green color but 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.770
 also his handle and is a color of 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.659
 type e wood so the viewfinder of this weapon 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.260
 do not change compare to the pingers that 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.750
 year 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.860
 origin because nothing changes put to 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.680
 share the canon of the news 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.550
 original was rather long and thin 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.140
 while this one is pretty short is 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.150
 beautiful my opinion concerning this weapon I 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.030
 finds it extremely powerful 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.330
 simple fact that she's over 3 in the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.640
 characteristic damage and to talk about 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.130
 these disadvantages that are - 3 in 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.590
 handling it is almost not felt 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.040
 so what leaves him a big 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.040
 potential 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.580
 his presentation video of the mp aux 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.640
 elite types is right now 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.750
 finished so I tell you next time 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.590
 for another video 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.590
 go ciao
