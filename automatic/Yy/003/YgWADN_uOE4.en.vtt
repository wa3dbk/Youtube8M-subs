 anyway many of you brought smit 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.020
 may never have something of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.310
 but you know this movie title 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.650

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.699

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.529
 Anyone can bring me blockbuster too 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.400
 yes no shit wait until the first time 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 14 14 3 shot so synonymous something completely 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.119
 crazy in the old tv format 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.199
 So you see a small box 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.719
 the canvas and it is the story 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.730
 laurent who tells them that he is 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.559
 is trapped in the body of a man and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.379
 actually wants to be a woman and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.460
 his life story is then told 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.590
 That's why I do not want to anymore 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 to content but first pictures 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.510
 let speak 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.910
 under this animal just everything here 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.960
 I hate so much about love, that's it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.540
 bistum said 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.070
 you love me because the only reason why the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.820
 means everything we have experienced because 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.200
 I really go 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:11.280
 Everything has a completely different meaning 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:17.730
 I'm not an idiot nor an idiot me 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:20.820
 that does not feel right now 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.480
 she listens to what we advise you as 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.480
 woman dressed up 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.299
 did you have a crush on no ? 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.800
 I do not feel my life I wait 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.330
 Of course you wait for me 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.680
 our life is not felt lorenz 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.290
 It is a wait and wait 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.270
 you so what the real life or on it 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.300
 that I realize you've been mixing for two 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.300
 I did not lie to you for years 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.500
 nothing said 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.220
 you already have in the pictures already 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.319
 seen this movie is something 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.850
 unlike other films and find that 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.709
 I am so fantastically good at this film 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.930
 was a bit skeptical at first 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.800
 film 43 what should that do that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.209
 even sense 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.069
 whether it makes sense does not play at all 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.470
 Roll because it just looks great from the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.840
 director smolders in pictures but brings 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.550
 at the same time great music with the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.980
 play it just completely crazy 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.230
 composition also brings the 80s 90s 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.120
 sound on the screen respectively 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.130
 in the ears and manages it too 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.940
 at the same time the actors really great 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.430
 to lead 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.630
 So the figure played by maven poland 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.850
 I do not want to say that one now 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.650
 he said a propos is french 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.989
 can not do anything about it but also just like that 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.750
 worry lima it's just two 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.880
 Actors who are incredibly happy and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.620
 they are just so to grab that 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.600
 goes into the mark that is authentic and 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.790
 you also suffer a bit with it 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.319
 but the film is now also missing 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.360
 kind of such a sorry number 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.190
 but actually sketches very much 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.890
 detailed and where are there problems in 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.560
 the society for transsexuals and 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.790
 brings that over very everyday 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.150
 that's what makes you special about this movie 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.320
 he likes to be in spite of this 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.790
 extravagant steals the movie has 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.500
 but somehow it would not look like that 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.510
 authentic and realistic loses 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.920
 but actually here on exactly 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.140
 meets the point and I found that on the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.000
 movie really fantastic shows the movie 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.620
 Not just in a short life moment 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.570
 but rather a complete phase 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.890
 also makes sense in any case because I 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.079
 Do not just want this short moment 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.640
 but know how to evolve 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.019
 the whole and not just the figure 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.340
 but also family and the people 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.350
 who are around him 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.090
 that's extremely well hit right now too 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.980
 I like the style of the narrative 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.780
 very good that sometimes with music 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.859
 to underscore the pictures easily 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.510
 speak much more 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.070
 as the story itself and also 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.320
 he turns back and vice versa 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.970
 I do not have to say that and hat off 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.590
 only full acting performance 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.269
 is phenomenal but also the 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.920
 director is young he is even younger 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.959
 when me and I see something for one 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.120
 mammoth work especially for a brave 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.290
 mammoth work can bring to the canvas 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.670
 I just pull the hat 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.319
 and that's pretty much too 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.390
 important movie because he shows synonymous if 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.590
 people are completely different is it 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.120
 not that one out of the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.280
 one should exclude society 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.080
 maybe just take a look 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.280
 and see he does not give a damn if that 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.380
 now a man is that one now 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.000
 woman kopp who transforms now or 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.410
 do not count the character and the 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.790
 human being himself behind it and 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.530
 also this statement creates the film 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.950
 just fantastic on the point too 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.960
 bring 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.580
 and well the movie title says yes synonymous 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.940
 already a bit out of what the movie 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.010
 lorenz wants to say shit 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.930
 it as it actually is now, he has 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.500
 breasts or quarrels penis on it 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.560
 shat 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.030
 it's a cool guy and that brings 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.560
 film just on the canvas because of it 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.210
 It is absolutely necessary to look at it 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.220
 become a tiny masterpiece 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.930
 who watch this movie now 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.610
 are definitely fans of arthouse 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.040
 cinema was that is here so kunstkino in 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.080
 purest form necessarily in the cinema looks 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.270
 also people who say i like it though 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.040
 Emotions arise but now so on 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.200
 is ridden around but somehow 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.580
 in such a very authentic way and 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.690
 wise he confesses to every one since he here 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.040
 case right 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.840
 Who should not watch this movie? 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.460
 are just people who say I say 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.780
 Do not go to the cinema around my horizon 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.860
 but because of me 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.120
 wants to be entertained 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.590
 because you are here in any case wrong 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.240
 Also people who say I want to go 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.800
 no case a story of 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.210
 I can look at transsexuals now 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.130
 Do not understand because this movie is easy 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.110
 is so good and I sometimes completely different 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.130
 Aspects of other people see the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.290
 just another way of life 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.550
 but if he does not 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.830
 bock on it should have this movie 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.110
 just do not look because it rides 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.580
 He just 158 ​​minutes around 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.750
 that is the theme of the film and who 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.610
 it should not be bothered 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.080
 just do not watch this movie 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.210
 my personal rating falls 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.590
 Accordingly, high from nine of 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.930
 ten points give the film the 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.950
 teeny tiny teeny has small lengths and 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.050
 some are also in the 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.210
 access it a bit hip it is 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.560
 but then I have but I like this 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.419
 style i like that found the movie 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.610
 Fantastic great statement looks at you 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.860
 film at nine out of ten points from me 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.479

 small art up the otherwise 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.190
 Thumb down here but you too
