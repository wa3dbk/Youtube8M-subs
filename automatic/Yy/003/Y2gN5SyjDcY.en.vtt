were on so for example I was on 7.1 and

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.140 
were on so for example I was on 7.1 and
this<00:04:01.290> should<00:04:01.530> only<00:04:01.680> find<00:04:01.950> one<00:04:02.280> as<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.880> can<00:04:03.000> see

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
this should only find one as you can see

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.129 
this should only find one as you can see
here<00:04:03.420> product<00:04:04.130> product<00:04:05.130> version<00:04:05.549> 7.1<00:04:06.359> so

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
here product product version 7.1 so

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.690 
here product product version 7.1 so
you're<00:04:07.260> gonna<00:04:07.349> go<00:04:07.560> ahead<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.829> delete<00:04:08.340> that

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
you're gonna go ahead and delete that

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.159 
you're gonna go ahead and delete that
and<00:04:08.970> change<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.389> to<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.630> version<00:04:09.840> you're

and change it to the version you're
currently<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.489> for<00:04:11.700> example<00:04:12.120> on<00:04:12.299> my<00:04:12.450> iPod

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
currently on so for example on my iPod
