00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello my name is Natasha and welcome

 to my channel today we 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.859
 a little bit in the field because 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.040
 I am in your hotel room 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.990
 and there somewhere in the background is my little brother 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.160
 Alek by the way can you notice that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.109
 the last time I somehow a lot 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.900
 travel so if you want 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.490
 travel with me online then 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.109

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.970
 we will follow you 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.540
 for each other's life so in my opinion 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.460
 that's cool well and we start off yes 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.129
 guys today we will have a call accepted 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.829
 and I traditionally wrote on my wall 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.440
 post supposedly waiting for new change let's kick 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.890
 cool body where i will execute it 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.350
 promises to be fun so let's go 1 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.210
 czech which did not throw it was to eat 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.860
 chocolate for a hundred steps and you know me 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.710
 it seemed like a pretty easy task 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.210
 well think a hundred steps floor dofigischa well 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.620
 In general, I decided to do it well 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.470
 guys it's time to start our 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.390
 I will tell the experiment right away I did exactly 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.400
 a hundred steps no more no less than exactly 100 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.080
 so can you believe me but i still want 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.180
 say actually I brought 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.810
 chocolate here from Kiev because there I 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.509
 bought it for 15 hryvnia is about 50 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.180
 cents and here it costs around 4 euros 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.119
 well, or 4 dollars that is very expensive 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.460
 another thing I do not want to say 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.790
 chocolate I don't eat it to me its bad and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.860
 I do not know why this test 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.130
 it was a real challenge for me but how 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.470
 Oddly I managed it and I want to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.840
 say it was difficult but a challenge 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.840
 adopted as 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.770
 I guys her chocolate for a hundred steps 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.570
 principle really but live it up 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.800
 the end but it's harder than i thought 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.560
 much here and then really want 3 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.080
 on in my case the call can be accepted 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.660
 assume that you accepted go further 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.310
 The next challenge I threw 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.830
 I found it very funny he 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.900
 called a wet robe and its meaning is that 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.030
 need a bathrobe to get into the shower or bath 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.209
 on because damn actually i'm d'amore 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.360
 and I can do it more epic yes you 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.660
 understand what I will do god see 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.660
 yourself 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.900
 well guys here is such a story and 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.350
 however strange it may be but the challenge 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.830
 accepted and yes I'm done and ladies slippers 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.520
 floats away because he is rubber and in general 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.520
 something like this 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.690
 I am now mounting the log so I think 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.950
 there i will show you how we really are 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.320
 all filmed so 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.490
 I assure you it will be epic and if you are up 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.650

 We went on we also have a third call 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.400
 which did not throw at all super super 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.500

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.630

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:49.900
