00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
I predict in the switch and he's gonna

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.980 
I predict in the switch and he's gonna
use<00:02:55.890> be<00:02:56.730> pretty<00:02:57.090> he's<00:02:57.270> picking<00:02:57.600> me<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.720> switch

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
use be pretty he's picking me a switch

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.600 
use be pretty he's picking me a switch
gonna<00:02:58.260> sleep<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.710> my<00:02:58.860> fam<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.220> right<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.520> my

old chestnut does he sleep see if he

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.110 
old chestnut does he sleep see if he

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
goes for anything else I can probably

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.750 
goes for anything else I can probably
reduce<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.450> anyway<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.650> he<00:03:05.160> actually<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.730> going

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
reduce it anyway so he actually is going

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
punch lad the advantage so i can raise

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.850 
punch lad the advantage so i can raise
my<00:03:14.880> tap<00:03:15.150> water<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.450> here<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.350> he<00:03:16.440> can't<00:03:16.740> move

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
my tap water in here and he can't move

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.740 
my tap water in here and he can't move
anything<00:03:17.070> about<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.520> means<00:03:18.060> i<00:03:18.210> got<00:03:18.390> spiky

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
anything about that means i got spiky

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.810 
anything about that means i got spiky
shield<00:03:19.020> but<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.500> time<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.250> didn't<00:03:20.490> think<00:03:20.580> that

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
shield but the time I didn't think that

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.640 
shield but the time I didn't think that
so<00:03:20.970> he's<00:03:21.060> got<00:03:21.180> bite<00:03:21.450> blessings<00:03:22.080> t<00:03:22.230> bomb<00:03:22.410> leech

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
going to go into now a dragon again

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.760

which<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.070> his<00:03:35.310> charizard<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.210> I<00:03:36.450> still<00:03:36.960> not<00:03:37.620> I

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
which is his charizard so I still not I

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.680 
which is his charizard so I still not I
didn't<00:03:38.190> see<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.370> go<00:03:38.490> mega<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.120> leads<00:03:39.570> me

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
didn't see you go mega so that leads me

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.140 
didn't see you go mega so that leads me
to<00:03:39.840> believe<00:03:40.100> his<00:03:41.100> luck<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.340> Megan<00:03:41.880> oh<00:03:41.970> I

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
to believe his luck because Megan oh I

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.240 
to believe his luck because Megan oh I
predicted<00:03:42.570> each<00:03:42.660> other<00:03:42.950> Charizard<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.070> come

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
predicted each other Charizard to come

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.010 
predicted each other Charizard to come
in<00:03:44.430> that's<00:03:44.610> why<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.760> use<00:03:44.910> bite<00:03:45.330> because<00:03:45.840> he

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
in that's why I use bite because he

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.420 
in that's why I use bite because he
would<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> quadrature<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.770> didn't<00:03:47.070> work<00:03:47.160> either

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
would a quadrature I didn't work either

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.100 
would a quadrature I didn't work either
one<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:47.940> my<00:03:48.060> other<00:03:48.240> moves<00:03:48.540> since<00:03:48.750> he<00:03:48.870> saw<00:03:49.080> a

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
one of my other moves since he saw a

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.110 
one of my other moves since he saw a
power<00:03:49.380> punch<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.920> predict<00:03:50.340> him<00:03:50.460> to<00:03:50.550> assume<00:03:50.850> I'm

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
power punch I predict him to assume I'm

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.880 
power punch I predict him to assume I'm
just<00:03:51.480> gonna<00:03:51.570> keep<00:03:51.750> using<00:03:52.020> power<00:03:52.350> punch<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.770> get

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
just gonna keep using power punch to get

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.740 
just gonna keep using power punch to get
up<00:03:52.980> there<00:03:53.130> but<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.820> thought<00:03:54.210> even<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.480> Charter

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
up there but I thought even the Charter

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.470 
up there but I thought even the Charter
but<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:55.050> switch<00:03:55.290> out<00:03:55.470> anyway<00:03:56.400> because<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.240> just

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
but I switch out anyway because I just

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.730 
but I switch out anyway because I just
can't<00:03:57.690> there's<00:03:57.900> no<00:03:57.930> way<00:03:58.020> I<00:03:58.110> can<00:03:58.140> deal<00:03:58.440> with<00:03:58.590> any

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
can't there's no way I can deal with any

which<00:04:20.980> is<00:04:21.130> nice<00:04:21.960> the<00:04:22.960> water<00:04:23.170> pulse<00:04:23.380> there<00:04:23.620> and

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
which is nice the water pulse there and

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.320 
which is nice the water pulse there and
that<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.190> going<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.520> go<00:04:24.640> down<00:04:24.670> so<00:04:25.210> that's

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
that is going to go down so that's

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.430 
that is going to go down so that's
awesome<00:04:25.570> glad<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.620> happened<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:29.050> cliff<00:04:29.260> you
