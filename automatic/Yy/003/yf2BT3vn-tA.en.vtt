interior door so that the cat can come

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.650 
interior door so that the cat can come
and<00:02:16.740> go<00:02:16.890> but<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.550> larger<00:02:17.940> dog<00:02:18.150> can't<00:02:18.450> get

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
and go but the larger dog can't get

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.390 
and go but the larger dog can't get
through<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.410> those<00:02:19.560> are<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.770> couple<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:20.220> tips

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.100 
through so those are a couple of tips
that<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.970> use<00:02:21.209> but<00:02:21.630> really<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.080> just

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
that you can use but really it just

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.190 
that you can use but really it just
comes<00:02:22.530> down<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.130> making<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.610> inaccessible<00:02:24.200> to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
comes down to making it inaccessible to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.710 
comes down to making it inaccessible to
the<00:02:25.319> dog<00:02:25.500> because<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.950> know<00:02:26.100> cats<00:02:27.060> get<00:02:27.569> their

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
tails in a twist over that and then you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.340 
tails in a twist over that and then you
really<00:02:30.300> don't<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.750> cat<00:02:30.959> going

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350
