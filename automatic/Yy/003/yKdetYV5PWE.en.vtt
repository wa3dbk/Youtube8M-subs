00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:13.830
 when tankers with you eustace and today I want 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.279
 show you t49 here this one 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.529
 wonderful tank and installed on it 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.539
 fugasier and try to play 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.420
 principle on it like a firefly then 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.750
 primary server can make sure niki 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.710
 unsigned and y and lira version 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.559
 that is, as it were, the foundation is all seriously 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.350
 fugashnit in vain for 5 cumulative 17 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.390
 Gold land mines but comfortable consumables 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.840
 cost no coke any 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.899
 gasoline of all seriously in general 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.270
 worth rammer stand drives aiming and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.180
 there is a stabilizer enlightened to and horns 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.820
 not installed because the gun 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.600
 reduced to more than three seconds almost 4 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.079
 seconds 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.420
 it feels even more in principle and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.600
 the wildest scatter 06 but how would I think 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.589
 what's a survey of 430 meters with pumped 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.369
 martial brotherhood 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.360
 more than 430 meters fighting brotherhood 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.490
 plus radio interception allows here s-400 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.030
 expand to 430 and it really 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.740
 the truth is and in general let's 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.140
 let's see what happens if 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.590
 work like a firefly you see what 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.479
 huge huge faceted circle 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.759
 scatter that's a ring that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.750
 everything seems to have merged 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.000
 she is standing forward on principle 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.399
 b-lines by squares 67 here here 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.220
 for sure always rivals we are passing 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.340
 we will meet him 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.159
 so far we wait here goes 50 120 again 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.590
 for damage see hit 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.689
 it seems to be on a land mine on 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.140
 Gold breakthrough 85 damage 910 a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.110
 French to armor is not there at all at the same time 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.239
 the direct hit of leaving we put 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.380
 324 damage, in principle, will have to accept 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.140
 damage really 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.570
 Alenka check with cumulative cumulative 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.310
 not gold on 152 so you can 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.500
 calmly punish most tanks 8 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.010
 level and above therefore here generally 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.800
 no need to steam 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.710
 keep playing like a firefly 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.960
 that is, I'm not going anywhere I try to hide 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.300
 do not glow and try to highlight 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.870
 well, if possible, cause damage while 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.560
 what's waiting again is nothing like that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.820
 happens our methodically methodically in 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.270
 Generally sneak 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.070
 the first and second line of the canyon 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.910
 the city seems to be not so kneaded 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.570
 strong 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.580
 behind me is somewhere hiding batchat and 263 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.430
 who left the base are also worth something 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.050
 I'm waiting here for the purpose of virginity 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.550
 I am aiming butcher and maybe somehow 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.620
 Well, in principle, will be here that I wanted to 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.530
 would say 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.690
 see baht he dumps from here to 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.940
 Sorry ponastavil stones and therefore 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.040
 shoot and could not and work 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.930
 this gun is fired from such 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.820
 distances generally with this gun with 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.280
 distances greater than 100 meters must 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.010
 shoot at all is not worth it because you 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.210
 very disappointed when awake 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.280
 miss another flash drive 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.920
 see a turkey somewhere there they are all for 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.530
 hiding houses I show let's 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.650
 Forward boys selling devyanostika 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.959
 still want to pick it up you can see that 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.770
 she shoots there you can see it there 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.959
 the edge is shown but well 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.890
 inconvenient not to put up a very long tank 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.600
 comes down let's see basically i'm 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.800
 I wait for a candle 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.240
 bang bang bang baby go to the hangar want 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.670
 note in general in this tank I want 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.540
 note very very loud sound 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.380
 shots at all what the chip this machine 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.720
 like a firefly 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.440
 it's normal but when you install 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.600
 This tower This gun Please note that the tank 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.580
 it becomes much harder that is 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.310
 engine load load 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.160
 chassis and therefore lost dynamics 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.010
 it is lost specifically the dynamics of the car she 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.660
 it becomes but how how st that is far 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.820
 not the most dynamic this tank becomes 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.060
 plus he is not the smallest not the most 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.450
 light that is it glows too god forbid 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.190
 again play it as i think 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.930
 to really feel yourself 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.390
 firefly need to put 90 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.400
 millimeter cannon on which 3 types 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.160
 ammunition are two types of mine bombs and 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.350
 cumulative in principle on land mines 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.450
 which breakthrough more than a hundred can be quite 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.770
 myself play and bend especially suffer 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:58.980
 waffles on cumulative can punch 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.380
 all because since there is a break through 250 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.020
 here's a fan can see my review 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.230
 this tank with a 90mm cannon 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.790
 here I will show exactly how to ride with 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.920
 Shaitan Kais Highland Plants 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.200
 from which everything seems to be right here 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.590
 rigidly trudge now look, I'll get back to 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.210
 was carried to the end 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:23.250
 392 well here it is 300 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.830
 280 for 350 this is the average damage for 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.770
 this car with this particular gun 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.470
 again if you want to play firefly 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.300
 put a 90 millimeter cannon dpm 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.600
 much higher there charging a little more than 5 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.250
 seconds of accuracy and information that is there 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.350
 comfortable to play plus the same with the 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.650
 cannon car gets much faster 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:47.850
 well look 148 complete information 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.680
 the distance there is literally I don't know 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.240
 fifty meters covered 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.090
 Well here I can not do anything good 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.040
 say about this gun sometimes yes sometimes 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.110
 with good luck when somebody 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.630
 for example some waffle 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.420
 especially waffle 9 crashes 1000 damage yes 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.270
 it's nice it's tasty but we have it 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.460
 charging 20 seconds do not forget 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.080
 now it was hit 348 just 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.720
 it seemed more than 700 because 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.850
 shot simultaneously 206 third well 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.240
 here that look i beat off base i us 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.580
 leads almost 2000 i'm quietly fighting 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.590
 base here i'm charging how to be 20 seconds 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.510
 code and again, keep in mind your absolute 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.670
 lack of armor and the very best dynamics 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.590
 and so so quietly I ride 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.810
 beat the bank 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:41.880
 I give work 390 here again, in principle 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:43.470
 ok but work baku 390 is me 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.270
 very disappointing at the very 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.890
 You can do quite a car 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.810
 use as a firefly but with 90 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.490
 millimeter cannon 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.270
 I think this video is quite suitable 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.520
 for review 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.700
 I understand how this car behaves 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.289
 there is not the most experienced but with the tank 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.779
 which the 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.969
 which is generally multifunctional he 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:05.399
 can replace st-shku suspender 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:07.710
 again work as main 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:09.869
 specialty that is shine that is to say 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.300
 on it you can stand on their lips and 

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:14.309
 shoot to drive that is interesting 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.680
 car and quite suitable for 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:20.189
 pumping especially then goes hamster 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.259
 heavyk these machines are more than worthwhile 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:24.029
 more if you want to download hevik then 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:26.550
 swing undoubtedly through this thread 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:29.939
 Bulldog is also a cool car 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.830
 there will be an overview so subscribe to 

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:36.020
 channel to new meetings 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.020
 put your finger on top and bye bye 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:56.100
 because i because i
