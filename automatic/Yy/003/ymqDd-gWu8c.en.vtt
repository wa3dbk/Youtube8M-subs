 this license to deepen a little 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.290
 my conditions this building alternating that 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.210
 also allows to touch a small 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.430
 remuneration that this boarding school 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.130
 other knowledge especially between 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.690
 the fact of studies so no longer anger 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.090
 and being a business at 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.010
 name the situation directly 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.080
 pace is a two week course 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.250
 with three weeks in business in 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.650
 France there are not many licenses 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.570
 pro by alternation and especially editing 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.120
 who are doing the information continuously what 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.350
 bring me this training it's more 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.090
 it does not benefit a deepening 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.370
 knowledge and other methods 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.930
 work I will not go my business 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.450
 roof cladding 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.980
 so it's in this business I'm doing 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.740
 site monitoring that is to say that I 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.960
 manages teams of pose and 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.790
 blankets next to that I realize 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.710
 also quotes that is to say that I 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.170
 respond to calls for tenders launched by 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.480
 architects like luis my post 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.800
 an architectural firm also issued 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.180
 three execution notices so I like that 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.910
 work since the consultation of the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.230
 companies on the reception at the end of 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.770
 my birth I hope to be hired in 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.040
 now 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.060
 and then be able to evolve to my own 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.830
 teams 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.260
 in the years to come I see 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.830
 work who 50 in the same 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.709
 business 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.849
