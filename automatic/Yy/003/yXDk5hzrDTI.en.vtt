00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
so I can show you what she says and what

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.580 
so I can show you what she says and what
she<00:01:35.759> does<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.840> we'll<00:01:36.990> wake<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
she does and then we'll wake you up and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.480

I<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.799> show<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> next<00:01:38.280> step

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.860 

so<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.550> this<00:01:45.670> case<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.060> just<00:01:46.090> making<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.720> lamb

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
so in this case is just making the lamb

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
so in this case is just making the lamb
nice<00:01:47.220> sometimes<00:01:48.220> she<00:01:48.430> will<00:01:48.520> say<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.740> getting

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
nice sometimes she will say it's getting

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.680 
nice sometimes she will say it's getting
louder

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
louder

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.070 
louder
so<00:01:52.690> go<00:01:52.810> round<00:01:53.080> snooze<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.390> can<00:01:58.510> see<00:01:58.720> she<00:01:59.050> is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
so go round snooze as you can see she is

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.650 
so go round snooze as you can see she is
not<00:01:59.350> happy<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.400> then<00:02:00.729> if<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:00.970> do<00:02:01.119> want<00:02:01.300> to<00:02:01.360> wake

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
not happy so then if you do want to wake

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:31.860 
not happy so then if you do want to wake
up<00:02:01.930> then<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:02.410> would<00:02:02.560> just<00:02:02.590> swipe<00:02:03.400> here<00:02:30.870> now

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
up then you would just swipe here now

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.410 
up then you would just swipe here now
that<00:02:32.140> if<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.130> went<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.489> what<00:02:33.730> hurt<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.209> just

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
that if you went in what hurt is just

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.000 
that if you went in what hurt is just
happened

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
happened

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.550 
happened
that<00:02:36.010> was<00:02:36.600> three<00:02:37.600> chars<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.170> have<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.410> do

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
that was three chars that you have to do

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.530 
that was three chars that you have to do
I<00:02:38.830> think<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.519> three<00:02:39.700> chars<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.450> have

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.300 
I think it's three chars that you have
to<00:02:40.660> do<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.959> when<00:02:41.380> your<00:02:41.500> alarm<00:02:41.650> goes<00:02:41.769> off<00:02:41.920> you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
to do and when your alarm goes off you

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.070 
to do and when your alarm goes off you
switch<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.970> wake<00:02:43.150> up<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.600> then<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.959> will

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
switch it to wake up and then you will

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.560 
switch it to wake up and then you will
get<00:02:44.230> some<00:02:44.530> magic<00:02:45.070> tasks<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.700> do<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.090> that

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
get some magic tasks to do and that

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.270 
get some magic tasks to do and that
