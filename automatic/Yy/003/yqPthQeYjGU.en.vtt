what is the rim joist the rim joist is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
what is the rim joist the rim joist is
the<00:00:29.400> perimeter<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.180> floor<00:00:30.600> framing

system so here's your foundation we're
going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> insulate<00:00:33.720> that<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:34.710> our<00:00:34.920> crawl

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
going to insulate that with our crawl

space encapsulation system we've talked

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.530 
space encapsulation system we've talked
about<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.160> other<00:00:38.250> videos<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.970> here's

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
about that in other videos and here's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
about that in other videos and here's
your<00:00:39.989> wall<00:00:40.290> starts<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:41.220> and<00:00:41.340> that's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
your wall starts here and that's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.060 
your wall starts here and that's
insulated<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.660> part<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.170> your<00:00:43.710> floor

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
insulated but this part is your floor

framing your floor joist and at the edge

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.750 
framing your floor joist and at the edge
of<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.380> it's<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.710> insulated<00:00:47.280> let<00:00:47.489> me<00:00:47.550> show<00:00:47.700> you

of it it's not insulated let me show you
so<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.300> we're<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:48.989> our<00:00:49.200> crawl<00:00:49.530> space<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
so here we're in our crawl space and

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.069 
so here we're in our crawl space and
we've<00:00:50.610> insulated<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.270> block<00:00:51.480> wall<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.050> our

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
we've insulated the block wall with our

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.650 
we've insulated the block wall with our
silver<00:00:52.710> glow<00:00:52.890> insulation<00:00:53.790> but<00:00:54.239> here's<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
rim joist it's right there it's in this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380 
rim joist it's right there it's in this
case<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> 2<00:00:58.050> by<00:00:58.230> 8<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.860> not<00:00:59.100> insulated<00:00:59.789> so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
case a 2 by 8 and it's not insulated so

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.690 
case a 2 by 8 and it's not insulated so
it's<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.110> one<00:01:01.410> piece<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.770> framing<00:01:02.190> plus

it's just a one piece of framing plus

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.369 
it's just a one piece of framing plus
some<00:01:02.910> siding<00:01:03.210> between<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> outside<00:01:04.140> air

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
some siding between the outside air

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.890 
some siding between the outside air
which<00:01:04.710> could<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.430> know<00:01:05.549> 20<00:01:05.610> degrees<00:01:06.390> 10

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
which could be you know 20 degrees 10

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200 
which could be you know 20 degrees 10
degrees<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.979> inside<00:01:08.490> which<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
degrees and the inside which we want to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.510 
degrees and the inside which we want to
be<00:01:09.299> 72<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.470> cold<00:01:10.710> inside<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.310> then

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
be 72 if it was cold inside here then

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.120 
be 72 if it was cold inside here then
right<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:13.080> 3/4<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.710> an<00:01:13.860> inch<00:01:13.920> above

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
right here about 3/4 of an inch above

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.940 
right here about 3/4 of an inch above
this<00:01:14.640> would<00:01:14.940> surface<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.600> our<00:01:15.780> feet<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.290> our

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
this would surface as our feet and our

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
this would surface as our feet and our
feet<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.700> cold<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.689> floor

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
feet are going to be cold if this floor

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.230 
feet are going to be cold if this floor
is<00:01:19.140> cold<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.010> rim<00:01:20.670> joist<00:01:20.909> being

is cold and this rim joist being

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.630 
is cold and this rim joist being
uninsulated<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.140> definitely<00:01:23.010> a<00:01:23.040> problem<00:01:23.310> in

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
uninsulated is definitely a problem in

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.810 
uninsulated is definitely a problem in
here<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.320> there's<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.650> silk<00:01:26.610> hawk

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
here we you can see there's a silk hawk

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.230 
here we you can see there's a silk hawk
out<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.330> where<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:29.250> attach<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.060> hose

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
out here where the you attach the hose

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.870 
out here where the you attach the hose
and<00:01:30.570> there's<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.110> hole<00:01:31.409> through<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> wood<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and there's a hole through the wood and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.730 
and there's a hole through the wood and
air<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.869> come<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.590> see

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
air can come right in we can see

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.469 
air can come right in we can see
daylight<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.280> here's<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> wire<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
daylight and here's a wire going to the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.870 
daylight and here's a wire going to the
outside<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:37.380> through<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> rim<00:01:37.830> joist<00:01:38.189> that

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
outside right through the rim joist that

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.960 
outside right through the rim joist that
has<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> hole<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.080> it<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.380> these<00:01:40.619> spaces

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
has a hole in it so these spaces

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.130 
has a hole in it so these spaces
definitely<00:01:41.970> need<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.330> sealed<00:01:42.750> up<00:01:42.960> with

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
definitely need to be sealed up with
