entrance to a trail let's say for

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.440 
entrance to a trail let's say for
example<00:00:13.709> that<00:00:13.889> no<00:00:14.459> one<00:00:14.639> knows<00:00:14.820> about<00:00:15.150> this

and the moment you start writing it will

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.389 
and the moment you start writing it will
broadcast<00:01:22.149> those<00:01:22.539> those<00:01:23.320> GPS<00:01:23.649> coordinates<00:01:24.250> to

broadcast those those GPS coordinates to

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.910 
broadcast those those GPS coordinates to
the<00:01:24.490> server<00:01:24.759> so<00:01:25.360> other<00:01:25.539> people<00:01:25.630> can<00:01:25.899> see<00:01:25.960> where

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
the server so other people can see where

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.100 
the server so other people can see where
other<00:01:27.310> writers<00:01:27.939> have<00:01:28.180> been<00:01:28.390> going<00:01:28.780> where<00:01:29.020> the

other writers have been going where the

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.950 
other writers have been going where the

just<00:01:40.840> wrote<00:01:41.380> up<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.830> down<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.280> trail<00:01:42.549> I<00:01:42.580> just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
just wrote up and down the trail I just

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.719 
just wrote up and down the trail I just
showed<00:01:43.209> you<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.450> few<00:01:43.659> seconds<00:01:44.590> ago<00:01:44.679> and<00:01:45.069> as<00:01:45.549> you

when other people load the application

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.910 
when other people load the application
to<00:01:56.810> find<00:01:57.050> trails<00:01:59.050> the<00:02:00.050> server<00:02:00.380> will<00:02:00.710> pick

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
to find trails the server will pick

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.180 
to find trails the server will pick
those<00:02:01.100> public<00:02:01.640> GPS<00:02:02.120> points<00:02:02.920> sorry<00:02:03.920> for<00:02:04.100> the

those public GPS points sorry for the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.970 
those public GPS points sorry for the
blur<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.870> it<00:02:05.870> will<00:02:05.990> load<00:02:06.170> them<00:02:06.440> so<00:02:06.590> people<00:02:06.830> can

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
blur and it will load them so people can

which<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.630> about<00:02:59.810> 98%<00:03:00.380> done<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.250> just<00:03:01.670> have<00:03:01.970> to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
which is about 98% done I just have to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.770 
which is about 98% done I just have to
work<00:03:03.019> one<00:03:03.640> load<00:03:04.640> handling<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.630> these

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
work one load handling so that these

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.330 
work one load handling so that these

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.120 
very job I'm not a very advent of
programmer<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.440> will<00:03:15.560> see<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.739> lot<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:15.920> if

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
programmer so you will see a lot of if

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.860 
programmer so you will see a lot of if
statements<00:03:16.700> deep<00:03:16.940> if<00:03:17.180> statements<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.810> go

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
statements deep if statements that go

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.100 
statements deep if statements that go
three<00:03:18.410> blocks<00:03:18.769> down<00:03:18.920> as<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:20.540> can<00:03:20.690> see<00:03:20.870> right

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
three blocks down as you can see right

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.890 
three blocks down as you can see right
here<00:03:21.940> here<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.299> here<00:03:25.120> but<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.180> fact<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
here here and here but the fact of the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.539 
here here and here but the fact of the
matter<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.380> scripting<00:03:27.890> or<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.310> code

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
matter is that the scripting or the code

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.330 
matter is that the scripting or the code
is<00:03:28.760> very<00:03:28.850> efficient<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.350> processes<00:03:30.560> very

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
is very efficient and it processes very

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.870 
is very efficient and it processes very
well<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:32.420> doesn't<00:03:32.690> do<00:03:32.870> any<00:03:33.019> extra<00:03:33.320> steps<00:03:36.880> this

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
well it doesn't do any extra steps this

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.280 
well it doesn't do any extra steps this
script<00:03:38.209> right<00:03:38.420> here<00:03:38.450> is<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.930> script<00:03:39.230> that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
script right here is the script that

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.590 
script right here is the script that

publicized so that other people using

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.530 
publicized so that other people using

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
the app can see where other people have

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.349 
the app can see where other people have
been<00:04:02.690> driving<00:04:03.019> or<00:04:03.380> riding<00:04:03.410> in<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.220> trails<00:04:04.519> so

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
been driving or riding in the trails so

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:06.199 
been driving or riding in the trails so
that<00:04:05.630> if<00:04:05.900> you

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
that if you

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.209 
that if you
to<00:04:06.329> find<00:04:06.629> other<00:04:06.900> trails<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.500> your<00:04:07.650> area<00:04:08.010> you

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:08.219 
to find other trails in your area you

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:10.789 
to find other trails in your area you
can<00:04:08.250> do<00:04:08.819> so<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:09.359> by<00:04:10.140> loading<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.530> app

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
can do so just by loading the app

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.160 
can do so just by loading the app
because<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.400> automatically<00:04:11.879> downloads<00:04:12.170> the

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
because it automatically downloads the

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.979 
because it automatically downloads the
GPS<00:04:13.829> coordinates<00:04:14.400> for<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.359> locations<00:04:15.870> what

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
GPS coordinates for the locations what

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.099 
GPS coordinates for the locations what
other<00:04:16.139> people<00:04:16.350> have<00:04:16.470> been<00:04:16.620> writing<00:04:16.829> also<00:04:18.109> the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
other people have been writing also the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.749 
other people have been writing also the
more<00:04:19.350> people<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.709> write<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:19.919> specific<00:04:20.459> trail

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
more people that write a specific trail

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.420 
more people that write a specific trail
the<00:04:21.660> more<00:04:21.989> popular<00:04:22.440> that<00:04:22.590> show<00:04:22.800> becomes<00:04:23.160> and

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
the more popular that show becomes and

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.460 
the more popular that show becomes and
therefore<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.389> different<00:04:24.750> color<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.259> will

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
therefore the different color it will

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.040 
therefore the different color it will
get<00:04:25.680> its<00:04:26.009> green<00:04:26.340> yellow<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.090> red<00:04:27.270> greenest

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
get its green yellow and red greenest

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.170 
get its green yellow and red greenest
low<00:04:28.830> usage<00:04:29.130> yellow<00:04:29.759> medium<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.509> red<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:30.810> high

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
low usage yellow medium and red is high

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.730 
low usage yellow medium and red is high
so<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.300> script<00:04:33.539> once<00:04:33.690> again<00:04:33.990> as<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:34.289> said<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.530> use

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
so the script once again as I said I use

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.550 
so the script once again as I said I use
a<00:04:34.770> lot<00:04:34.889> of<00:04:34.919> if<00:04:35.130> statements<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:37.320> use<00:04:37.530> that

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
a lot of if statements and I use that

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.980 
a lot of if statements and I use that
mainly<00:04:38.100> because<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.820> has<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.180> parse<00:04:39.449> each<00:04:39.780> and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
mainly because it has to parse each and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.200 
mainly because it has to parse each and
every<00:04:40.169> character<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.949> if<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.639> does<00:04:41.759> not<00:04:41.910> parse

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
every character and if it does not parse

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.629
