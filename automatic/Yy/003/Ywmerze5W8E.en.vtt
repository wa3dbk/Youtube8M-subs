 hi i am Octavius I am consultant i 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.619
 people consulting today 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.890
 I want to comment on a design technique 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.869
 web call responsive in very little 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.330
 time the number of mobile clients 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.830
 will be superior to computers 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.190
 desk 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.650
 You could lose millions of visits if you 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.670
 site is not prepared to receive 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.370
 this type of clients 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.310
 browsers adjust naturally 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.170
 the site to the screen if the site does not 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.290
 it was designed to be seen in a 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.210
 small screen the result will be that 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.989
 I will observe a thumbnail of the site in my 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.000
 phone to read the content 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.610
 I would have to amplify the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.879
 text the use of menu will be a true 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.400
 challenge and an achievement to be able to click on 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.040
 a specific link 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.989
 I will surely end up despairing and 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.290
 leave the site in search of a better 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.540
 option 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.820
 and that to show you now the behavior 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.210
 of a website that was developed in 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.400
 responsible way this technique allows 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.520
 have a unique design which will 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.950
 deploy optimally regardless of 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.550
 the size of the device from which 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.550
 is being visualized 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.729
 my window may be smaller 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.030
 browser with the aim of simulating 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.650
 smaller devices observe by 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.740
 please like the text the images are 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.390
 accommodate not to leave the window 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.390
 as I make it smaller and smaller 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.120
 this small size could be the size 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.120
 that he has a phone maybe an iphone 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.470
 and other design techniques choose 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.440
 generate different versions one for 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.880
 each device 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.040
 when it is necessary to update 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.590
 information will have to be done in each 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.090
 one of the versions that will be a pain 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.489
 of head 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.470
 the responsive design I have a single site 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.900
 that adapts to the needs of the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.690
 user which I think is very 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.840
 Intelligent responsive is talking about 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.239
 flexibility does not matter the resolution or 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.879
 the size of the device is always going to 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.500
 look good the site fits me not to 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.980
 reverse 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.349
 This is how an ipad would look like 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.299
 in conclusion encompass devices 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.700
 mobile will be indispensable in the short 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.190
 term the responsible design is the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.720
 solution to generate a single site that 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.299
 encompass a lot of 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.450
 devices get in touch with iu 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.370
 people we will give you a flexible solution 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.260
 technologically and adjusted to your 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.260
 budget until soon
