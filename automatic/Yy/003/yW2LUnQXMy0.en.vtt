00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.370
 do chopping board 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.030
 of a knife 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.030
 of a lemon 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.970
 of olive oil a small cup and 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.270
 of a township stems so you take a 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.350
 little olive oil that you pour 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.350
 directly in the cup 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:54.500
 and you take a site where you go there 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.500
 add directly to the 8th lyon 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.600
 mix well 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.940
 Oh 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.600
 I prepared you a care based 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.340
 of olive oil the lemons because 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.620
 olive oil has a nourishing effect 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:24.610
 and also hardening and lemon has 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.810
 an effect also hardener and at the same 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.780
 time it will whiten the English so 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.900
 you take a little bit everyday 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.430
 of this texture and you massage your 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.840
 nail with for a few seconds in 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.240
 same time the olive oil to feed 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.640
 also the outline of the nail so 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.430
 you will also have fewer small ones 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.590
 dry skins 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.230
 so even if you have a gel polish 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.250
 false nails to you can also 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.900
 do this because you go mass and that 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.030
 will pay very directly at the level of 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.830
 cuticles ie the root of 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.680
 the angle so it'll deal directly 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.170
 your fingernail underneath you can 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.680
 apply this oil with lemon 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.790
 every day it's going to feed 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.880
 gradually your tab the happy 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.459
 reinforced from day to day for an angle 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.760
 very brittle you can also 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.760
 just take olive oil that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.780
 you're warming up a little bit so 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.120
 to make a bath directly 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.709
