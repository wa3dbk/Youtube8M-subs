little bit a little bit better as

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.820 
little bit a little bit better as
opposed<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.580> eating<00:04:25.380> every<00:04:26.380> two<00:04:26.530> or<00:04:26.680> three

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
hours five to six times a day I just

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.110 
hours five to six times a day I just
find<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.680> be<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.800> hassle<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.640> it's

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
find that to be a hassle and it's

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.880 
find that to be a hassle and it's
working<00:04:31.360> out<00:04:31.420> fine<00:04:31.660> for<00:04:31.900> me<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.650> guess

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
working out fine for me so I guess

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.560
