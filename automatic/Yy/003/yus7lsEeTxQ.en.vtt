00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.110
 hello very good that as you are 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.090
 welcome everyone one more day to my channel 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.669
 and today I'm going to show you a look 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.950
 makeup for those days that we're going 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.219
 super fast that we do not have time to 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.150
 do us a lot and we want a look 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.850
 simple that it seems that we are not 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.030
 makeup but that leave us good 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.920
 expensive and good because this is the look that 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.330
 as you can see I did not even delineate 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.430
 the eye if for example you are of the 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.920
 people that costs you from linemen a lot 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.100
 the eye because this look is perfect for 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.890
 you are in shades as well as bronzes 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.010
 browns that I also think that these 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.019
 all you have at home and they are 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.980
 very well in any type of color of 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.899
 eyes you already have blue or green eyes or 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.300
 brown or black does not matter because you 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.729
 It's going to look very nice since we have not 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.079
 made eyes too strong or the 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.679
 lips, what I've wanted is 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.629
 accentuate a bit of the outline so there 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.520
 you can see the colors that I wear is 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.920
 super nice and you'll see what is good 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.449
 if you are interested, you need to know and I'll leave you 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.180
 with the good past let's start 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.460
 putting us a first in the eyes that is 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.120
 so that the shadows last longer 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.130
 do not get better and everything 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.200
 now I'm going to take this palette from here 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.570
 which is to face and I will take a tone 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.430
 Vanilla but good to any tone 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.600
 Vanilla is going to serve you and I'm going to 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.600
 apply by the center 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.590
 now I'm going to take the same palette and take 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.100
 of this tea tone and I'm going to apply it 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.409
 right in the basin 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.990
 very little amount and we are going to 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.560
 blur it very well with a brush 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.659
 clean blurs it 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.470
 with the same brush as it is 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.470
 umbrella from here 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 and again I take the pincelito 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.860
 clean to blur 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.080
 and well, I'm going to take this brown 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.080
 here that is like a bronze 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.209
 and I'm going to do an outline 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.010
 also flush with the eyelashes 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.390
 today I'm going to take 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.549
 this tone here that is like a bronze 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.599
 reddish and this one here the two points 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:43.790
 I'm going to give a little bit right up top 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.819
 of what it would be in the basin for just 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.159
 above the basin 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.469
 but as a touch it's worth only 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.300
 to give a little more warmth to the 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:56.630
 look and those things 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.550
 and also just a little bit below the 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.980
 eyelashes this is going to make the color of 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.710
 the eyes also make us in tone 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.540
 cream 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.640
 and mascara I'm going to use 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.640
 this one of avon that is the one in chan 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.050
 now I apply the corrector that is the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.050
 number one from here 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.670
 I 'll deposit it without dragging the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.670
 colour 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.880
 now with a skunk type skewer 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.640
 I'm going to apply these sunscreens or 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.530
 illuminators where the brand accessorize 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.530
 in the lagoon tone 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.549
 now I'm going to take this illuminator in 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.689
 cream in the lagoon tone and with this 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:17.560
 brochita and I will do a little bit the 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.560
 contour and tan 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.140
 now I'm going to take an illuminator this is 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.849
 to bake and it's a stick and I love 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.159
 to light up the lips 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.080
 we put it just above the lip and as 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.689
 You see makes the lip look more 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.080
 voluminous I will outline me with tone 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.080

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.889
 I'm going to wear the blusher that I have 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.560
 stopped applying with a brush that does not 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.100
 that do not apply a lot of color because this 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.790
 color is very strong could take the tone 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:12.860
 of mermaid is this one here rosita and I 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.860
