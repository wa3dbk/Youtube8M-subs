whole life what it is done and that is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.069 
whole life what it is done and that is
why<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.460> has<00:01:47.610> these<00:01:48.060> brackets<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
why it has these brackets here on the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.289 
why it has these brackets here on the
side<00:01:49.320> where<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:49.979> rear<00:01:50.280> stabilizers<00:01:51.149> have

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.550 
folded on in case you're wondering and
that's<00:01:54.420> why<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> machine<00:01:54.930> has<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> new<00:01:55.259> bucket

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
