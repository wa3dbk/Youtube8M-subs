well<00:00:05.990> obviously<00:00:06.740> you<00:00:07.700> don't<00:00:07.820> have<00:00:07.940> to<00:00:08.149> have<00:00:08.360> a

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
well obviously you don't have to have a

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.329 
well obviously you don't have to have a
brand<00:00:08.809> on<00:00:09.049> there<00:00:09.230> but<00:00:09.410> you<00:00:09.499> do<00:00:09.650> have<00:00:09.829> a<00:00:09.889> brand<00:00:10.190> I

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:10.339 
brand on there but you do have a brand I

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.709 
brand on there but you do have a brand I
mean<00:00:10.490> it's<00:00:10.610> silly<00:00:10.759> if<00:00:10.910> you<00:00:11.030> don't<00:00:11.209> you<00:00:11.599> have

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
mean it's silly if you don't you have

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.720 
mean it's silly if you don't you have
the<00:00:11.839> area<00:00:12.019> you<00:00:12.499> have<00:00:12.650> to<00:00:12.799> have<00:00:12.950> wine<00:00:13.190> Australia

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
the area you have to have wine Australia

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.120 
the area you have to have wine Australia
has<00:00:14.240> said<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.599> alcohol<00:00:15.110> on<00:00:15.349> there<00:00:15.589> you<00:00:16.010> have

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
has said the alcohol on there you have

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.430 
has said the alcohol on there you have
to<00:00:16.340> you<00:00:17.270> don't<00:00:17.540> have<00:00:17.690> to<00:00:17.780> have<00:00:17.870> the<00:00:17.990> year<00:00:18.200> but<00:00:18.380> I

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
to you don't have to have the year but I

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.280 
to you don't have to have the year but I
think<00:00:18.560> it<00:00:18.860> adds<00:00:18.980> a<00:00:19.160> lot<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:19.370> the<00:00:20.080> selling<00:00:21.080> point

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
think it adds a lot to the selling point

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.260 
think it adds a lot to the selling point
and<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.980> region<00:00:22.340> McLaren<00:00:22.760> Vale<00:00:22.790> in<00:00:23.090> this

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
and the region McLaren Vale in this

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.570 
and the region McLaren Vale in this
particular<00:00:24.230> case<00:00:24.620> you<00:00:25.040> don't<00:00:25.250> have<00:00:25.370> to<00:00:25.490> have

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
particular case you don't have to have

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.520 
particular case you don't have to have
the<00:00:25.700> varieties<00:00:26.120> but<00:00:26.330> again<00:00:26.600> I<00:00:26.810> think<00:00:27.020> people

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
the varieties but again I think people

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.630 
the varieties but again I think people
want<00:00:27.620> to<00:00:27.740> know<00:00:27.890> what's<00:00:28.190> in<00:00:28.340> there<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.550> that

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
want to know what's in there and that

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.220 
want to know what's in there and that
fact<00:00:28.820> that's<00:00:29.000> what<00:00:29.210> Australia<00:00:29.720> gave<00:00:29.930> to<00:00:30.140> the

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
fact that's what Australia gave to the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.319 
fact that's what Australia gave to the
world<00:00:30.260> really<00:00:30.800> was<00:00:31.160> varietal<00:00:31.700> labeling<00:00:32.150> it

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
world really was varietal labeling it

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.270 
world really was varietal labeling it
was<00:00:32.450> really<00:00:32.780> not<00:00:33.260> very<00:00:33.530> common<00:00:33.860> in<00:00:33.950> Europe

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
was really not very common in Europe

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.280 
was really not very common in Europe
just<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.640> few<00:00:34.820> areas<00:00:34.970> in<00:00:35.300> it<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:35.570> Australia

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
just a few areas in it and Australia

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.900 
just a few areas in it and Australia
really<00:00:36.470> went<00:00:36.740> out<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.070> says<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:37.430> know<00:00:37.550> look

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
really went out and says you know look

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.569 
really went out and says you know look
Shiraz<00:00:38.329> is<00:00:38.690> what<00:00:38.930> say<00:00:39.110> so<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.860> introduced<00:00:40.460> a

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
Shiraz is what say so it introduced a

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:41.950 
Shiraz is what say so it introduced a
lot<00:00:40.700> of<00:00:40.790> people<00:00:41.060> to<00:00:41.239> wine<00:00:41.450> because<00:00:41.840> they

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
lot of people to wine because they

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.650 
lot of people to wine because they
suddenly<00:00:42.170> went<00:00:42.320> oh<00:00:42.590> wow<00:00:43.190> Shiraz<00:00:44.000> say<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:44.420> that

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
suddenly went oh wow Shiraz say so that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.420 
suddenly went oh wow Shiraz say so that
and<00:00:45.020> that<00:00:45.170> grow<00:00:45.410> that<00:00:45.770> won't<00:00:45.950> let<00:00:46.100> Shiraz

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
and that grow that won't let Shiraz

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.889 
and that grow that won't let Shiraz
taste<00:00:46.730> like<00:00:46.910> that<00:00:47.120> that's<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.480> same<00:00:47.630> great

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
taste like that that's the same great

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.510 
taste like that that's the same great
but<00:00:48.050> it<00:00:48.170> did<00:00:48.290> she<00:00:48.440> tastes<00:00:48.710> different<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.250> they

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
but it did she tastes different and they

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.979 
but it did she tastes different and they
actually<00:00:49.640> got<00:00:49.940> really<00:00:50.120> excited<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:50.810> it's

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
actually got really excited and it's

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.389 
actually got really excited and it's

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
probably why straily really went a long

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.720 
probably why straily really went a long
way

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
little bit of minerality there it's from

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.060 
little bit of minerality there it's from
the<00:01:38.930> limestone<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.470> it's<00:01:39.710> probably<00:01:39.950> a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
the limestone and it's probably a

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.010

this calling them a stage name like this

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.429 
this calling them a stage name like this
is<00:01:46.400> adding<00:01:46.970> value<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.540> one<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:47.990> adding<00:01:48.350> a

what the knows about which often is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.949 
what the knows about which often is
after<00:02:07.460> several<00:02:07.820> bottles<00:02:07.970> there's<00:02:08.330> no<00:02:08.479> what<00:02:08.840> is

after several bottles there's no what is
this<00:02:09.140> bit<00:02:09.410> then<00:02:09.890> they<00:02:10.039> really<00:02:10.429> start<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.789> owner
