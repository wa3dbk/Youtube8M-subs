00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
now and let's we're aiming for a pickaxe

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.300 
now and let's we're aiming for a pickaxe
so<00:01:39.320> that's<00:01:40.179> 278<00:01:41.259> then<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.439> amount<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.159> we're

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so that's 278 then the amount and we're

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.669 
so that's 278 then the amount and we're
just<00:01:43.369> going<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.579> do<00:01:43.759> one<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.270> then<00:01:44.329> a<00:01:44.810> metadata

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
just going to do one and then a metadata

just going to do one and then a metadata
tag<00:01:46.039> and<00:01:46.399> default<00:01:47.179> is<00:01:47.329> zero<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:47.810> we're<00:01:47.960> just

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
tag and default is zero so we're just

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.709 
tag and default is zero so we're just
going<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.289> add<00:01:48.439> zero<00:01:48.829> now<00:01:49.310> here<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:49.909> where<00:01:50.240> we

come in with some crazy ninja hacking
skills<00:01:54.649> we're<00:01:55.460> gonna<00:01:55.549> add<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:55.789> curly<00:01:56.210> bracket

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390

and then the ID of the NBT tag that we

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.069 
and then the ID of the NBT tag that we
want<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.170> change<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.859> that<00:02:00.979> would<00:02:01.159> be

want to change and that would be
unbreaking<00:02:03.340> now<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.579> does<00:02:04.850> need<00:02:05.329> this<00:02:05.719> capital

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
you do not forget it and in fact

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.719 
you do not forget it and in fact
everything<00:02:08.750> needs<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.229> be<00:02:09.319> typed<00:02:09.649> exactly<00:02:10.490> how

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
everything needs to be typed exactly how

everything needs to be typed exactly how
it<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.270> shown<00:02:11.569> then<00:02:12.319> you're<00:02:12.440> gonna<00:02:12.560> do<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.800> colon

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
it is shown then you're gonna do a colon

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.730 
it is shown then you're gonna do a colon
not<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.880> semicolon<00:02:14.300> but<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.600> colon<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.170> one<00:02:15.470> and

not a semicolon but a colon and one and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.830 
not a semicolon but a colon and one and
then<00:02:15.860> close<00:02:16.220> those<00:02:16.610> curly<00:02:16.970> brackets<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.540> think

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
then close those curly brackets I think

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.390 
then close those curly brackets I think
that<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:17.990> noticed<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.890> did<00:02:19.190> actually

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
that I noticed is that I did actually

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.880 
that I noticed is that I did actually
mess<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.480> bit<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.140> unbreaking<00:02:21.770> it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
mess up a bit this is unbreaking it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.840 
mess up a bit this is unbreaking it

does not have any way to to tell what
you<00:02:29.180> meant

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
you meant

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.750 
you meant
you<00:02:30.500> need<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.860> have<00:02:31.040> everything<00:02:31.370> spelled

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
you need to have everything spelled

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.309 
you need to have everything spelled
absolutely<00:02:32.269> correctly<00:02:32.569> so<00:02:32.720> if<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:32.870> do<00:02:32.930> unbreak

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
absolutely correctly so if I do unbreak

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.920 
absolutely correctly so if I do unbreak
a<00:02:33.349> bowl<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:34.640> are<00:02:34.819> given<00:02:35.180> another<00:02:35.420> die

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
a bowl then we are given another die

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.069 
a bowl then we are given another die
in<00:02:36.019> pickaxe<00:02:36.409> and<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.310> here<00:02:37.640> we<00:02:37.790> go<00:02:38.079> we'll

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
in pickaxe and this one here we go we'll

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.309 
in pickaxe and this one here we go we'll
break<00:02:39.769> through<00:02:40.189> all<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.150> these<00:02:41.719> bucks<00:02:42.019> you<00:02:42.170> can

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
break through all of these bucks you can

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.649 
break through all of these bucks you can
see<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.799> durability<00:02:43.299> doesn't<00:02:44.299> change

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
see that the durability doesn't change

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.420 
see that the durability doesn't change
let's<00:02:44.989> say<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.620> did<00:02:45.829> something<00:02:46.189> wrong

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
let's say that I did something wrong

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.420 
let's say that I did something wrong
let's<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.480> remove<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.140> L<00:02:48.290> from<00:02:48.680> unbreakable

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
let's just remove the L from unbreakable

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.390 
let's just remove the L from unbreakable
it<00:02:49.819> will<00:02:50.000> still<00:02:50.269> give<00:02:50.569> me<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> pick<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.680> NBT

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
it will still give me a pick but the NBT

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.849 
it will still give me a pick but the NBT
tag<00:02:52.819> that<00:02:53.060> has<00:02:53.239> been<00:02:53.450> edited<00:02:53.810> was<00:02:54.409> something

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
tag that has been edited was something

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:56.679 
tag that has been edited was something
that<00:02:54.889> doesn't<00:02:55.579> make<00:02:55.670> any<00:02:55.819> sense<00:02:55.939> to<00:02:56.359> the<00:02:56.480> game

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
that doesn't make any sense to the game

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.979 
that doesn't make any sense to the game
and<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.469> it<00:02:57.769> will<00:02:58.040> have<00:02:58.879> this<00:02:59.120> durability<00:02:59.569> here

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
and so it will have this durability here

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.690 
and so it will have this durability here
as<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.349> can<00:03:00.379> see<00:03:00.530> but<00:03:00.980> this<00:03:01.159> one<00:03:01.370> no<00:03:01.549> matter

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
as you can see but this one no matter

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.250 
as you can see but this one no matter
how<00:03:01.879> many<00:03:02.030> times<00:03:02.299> we<00:03:02.480> use<00:03:02.510> it

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
how many times we use it

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.479 
how many times we use it
no<00:03:03.709> durability<00:03:04.670> will<00:03:05.540> affect<00:03:06.230> this<00:03:06.859> pickaxe

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
no durability will affect this pickaxe

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.240 
no durability will affect this pickaxe
you<00:03:08.180> can<00:03:08.329> do<00:03:08.569> some<00:03:08.840> other<00:03:09.019> things<00:03:09.500> with<00:03:09.980> this

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
you can do some other things with this

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.119 
you can do some other things with this
string<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.230> if<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.349> go<00:03:12.500> back<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.889> the<00:03:13.010> original

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
string so if I go back to the original

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.520 
string so if I go back to the original
one<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.790> was<00:03:13.939> unbreakable<00:03:14.239> we<00:03:15.049> could<00:03:15.230> add<00:03:15.500> a

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
one that was unbreakable we could add a

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.550 
one that was unbreakable we could add a
comma<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.280> here<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.909> and<00:03:17.540> do<00:03:18.109> something<00:03:18.439> like

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
comma in here and and do something like

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.069 
comma in here and and do something like
name<00:03:18.889> it<00:03:19.069> so<00:03:19.280> let's<00:03:19.489> let's<00:03:19.939> name<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.930> the

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
name it so let's let's name it and the

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.179 
name it so let's let's name it and the
the<00:03:21.349> command<00:03:21.739> for<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.599> display<00:03:23.919> and<00:03:24.919> then

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
the command for that is display and then

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.149 
the command for that is display and then
you<00:03:25.519> are<00:03:25.760> going<00:03:25.939> to<00:03:26.090> want<00:03:26.359> to<00:03:26.450> add<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.780> colon

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
you are going to want to add a colon

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.909 
you are going to want to add a colon
another<00:03:28.159> curly<00:03:28.489> braket<00:03:29.319> name<00:03:30.319> with<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:30.650> capital

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
another curly braket name with a capital

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.589 
another curly braket name with a capital
in<00:03:32.620> then<00:03:33.620> you're<00:03:33.950> going<00:03:34.129> to<00:03:34.189> do<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> colon<00:03:34.819> in

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
in then you're going to do a colon in

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.959 
in then you're going to do a colon in
parentheses<00:03:36.349> or<00:03:36.379> sorry<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.159> quotes<00:03:37.819> you're

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:37.969 
parentheses or sorry in quotes you're

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:39.459 
parentheses or sorry in quotes you're
going<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.150> put<00:03:38.329> whatever<00:03:38.569> you're<00:03:39.139> going<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.349> do

going to put whatever you're going to do

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.800 
going to put whatever you're going to do
so<00:03:39.620> let's<00:03:39.769> say<00:03:39.949> OMG<00:03:40.639> chad<00:03:41.889> is<00:03:42.889> pick<00:03:43.659> there<00:03:44.659> we

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
so let's say OMG chad is pick there we

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.189 
so let's say OMG chad is pick there we
go

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
go

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.180 
go
close<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:47.569> quotes<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.109> then<00:03:48.349> close<00:03:48.709> the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
close the the quotes and then close the

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.009 
close the the quotes and then close the
curly<00:03:49.639> bracket<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.299> now<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.569> are<00:03:50.810> going<00:03:50.959> to

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
curly bracket and now you are going to

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.500 
curly bracket and now you are going to
have<00:03:51.139> two<00:03:51.409> curly<00:03:51.919> brackets<00:03:52.099> back<00:03:52.909> here<00:03:53.209> at<00:03:53.359> the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
have two curly brackets back here at the

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.439 
have two curly brackets back here at the
end<00:03:53.659> and<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.019> if<00:03:54.199> we<00:03:54.349> give<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:55.069> us

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
end and so if we give that to us

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.479 
end and so if we give that to us
then<00:03:56.449> we<00:03:56.750> switch<00:03:56.900> over<00:03:57.109> you<00:03:57.319> can<00:03:57.470> see<00:03:57.709> over

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
then we switch over you can see over

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.119 
then we switch over you can see over
