because I always post updates on there
so<00:00:26.259> hopefully<00:00:26.470> that<00:00:26.890> should<00:00:27.039> compel<00:00:27.400> you<00:00:27.519> to

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
review in particular has taken so long

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.870 
review in particular has taken so long
for<00:00:32.110> me<00:00:32.200> to<00:00:32.320> do<00:00:32.560> is<00:00:32.800> because<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.460> Wolverine

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
for me to do is because the Wolverine

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.150 
for me to do is because the Wolverine
only<00:00:34.150> just<00:00:34.510> came<00:00:34.690> out<00:00:34.810> in<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.020> UK<00:00:35.380> and<00:00:35.620> for

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
only just came out in the UK and for

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.290 
only just came out in the UK and for
some<00:00:36.310> reason<00:00:36.550> I<00:00:36.610> thought<00:00:36.760> it<00:00:36.850> was<00:00:36.970> coming<00:00:37.180> out

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
some reason I thought it was coming out

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.570 
some reason I thought it was coming out
in<00:00:37.480> November<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:38.260> I've<00:00:38.890> been<00:00:39.070> so<00:00:39.250> distracted

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
in November and I've been so distracted

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.430 
in November and I've been so distracted
so<00:00:40.060> I<00:00:40.090> was<00:00:40.360> kind<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.630> caught<00:00:40.810> off<00:00:40.840> guard<00:00:40.990> when<00:00:41.290> I

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
so I was kind of caught off guard when I

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.230 
so I was kind of caught off guard when I
started<00:00:41.710> seeing<00:00:41.920> reviews<00:00:42.370> for<00:00:42.580> it<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:42.880> know

my thoughts on the Wolverine I thought
this<00:02:35.950> film<00:02:36.160> was<00:02:36.400> very<00:02:36.430> good<00:02:37.000> how<00:02:37.630> about<00:02:37.900> that

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
this film was very good how about that

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.320 
this film was very good how about that
I<00:02:38.380> actually<00:02:38.620> liked<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.130> new<00:02:39.280> superhero<00:02:39.670> movie<00:02:40.150> I

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
I actually liked a new superhero movie I

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.450 
I actually liked a new superhero movie I
was<00:02:40.990> amazed<00:02:41.290> at<00:02:41.470> just<00:02:41.500> how<00:02:41.770> refreshing<00:02:42.370> this

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
was amazed at just how refreshing this

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.550 
was amazed at just how refreshing this
entire<00:02:42.820> film<00:02:43.120> came<00:02:43.330> across<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.780> me<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.380> really

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
entire film came across to me it really

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.110 
entire film came across to me it really
doesn't<00:02:44.860> feel<00:02:45.010> like<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.220> superhero<00:02:45.670> film<00:02:45.940> I've

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
doesn't feel like a superhero film I've

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.580 
doesn't feel like a superhero film I've
seen<00:02:46.360> before<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.080> guess<00:02:47.260> one<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.530> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
seen before and I guess one of the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.080 
seen before and I guess one of the
reasons<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.100> probably<00:02:48.580> because<00:02:48.850> it's<00:02:49.000> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
reasons is probably because it's a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.060 
reasons is probably because it's a
brand-new<00:02:49.450> one-off<00:02:49.930> story<00:02:50.260> without<00:02:50.770> worrying

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
the source material and I gotta admit I

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.150 
the source material and I gotta admit I
never<00:04:33.690> read<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.020> Chris<00:04:34.230> Claremont<00:04:34.500> run<00:04:34.950> that

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
never read the Chris Claremont run that

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.860 
never read the Chris Claremont run that
focused<00:04:35.550> on<00:04:35.670> Wolverines<00:04:36.120> training<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.570> Japan

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
focused on Wolverines training in Japan

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.780 
focused on Wolverines training in Japan
but<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.560> film<00:04:37.770> took<00:04:37.890> a<00:04:38.010> different<00:04:38.250> approach

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
but the film took a different approach

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.640 
but the film took a different approach
he<00:04:38.940> had<00:04:39.090> an<00:04:39.210> intriguing<00:04:39.630> plot<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.080> story<00:04:40.200> and

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
he had an intriguing plot and story and

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.680 
he had an intriguing plot and story and
I<00:04:41.070> felt<00:04:41.340> whatever<00:04:41.520> deviated<00:04:42.210> from<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.480> source

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
I felt whatever deviated from the source

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.630 
I felt whatever deviated from the source
material<00:04:42.720> was<00:04:43.350> probably<00:04:43.860> justified<00:04:44.250> because

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
material was probably justified because

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.540 
material was probably justified because
of<00:04:44.910> my<00:04:45.060> end<00:04:45.240> everything<00:04:45.750> seemed<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.200> work

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
of my end everything seemed to work

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.790 
of my end everything seemed to work
overall<00:04:47.550> that's<00:04:48.180> my<00:04:48.420> main<00:04:48.630> thing<00:04:48.800> overall

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
overall that's my main thing overall

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.490 
overall that's my main thing overall
this<00:04:50.160> film<00:04:50.430> was<00:04:50.550> very<00:04:50.730> good<00:04:50.970> but<00:04:51.630> wow<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.380> know

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
this film was very good but wow I know

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.870 
this film was very good but wow I know
that<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.830> x-men<00:04:53.160> movie<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.550> a<00:04:53.580> kind<00:04:53.820> of

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
that the x-men movie is a kind of

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.790 
that the x-men movie is a kind of
infamous<00:04:54.300> for<00:04:54.510> continuity<00:04:55.110> errors<00:04:55.380> but<00:04:55.560> just

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
infamous for continuity errors but just

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.760 
infamous for continuity errors but just
wow<00:04:56.430> this<00:04:56.850> movie<00:04:57.180> pushes<00:04:57.480> his<00:04:57.630> lot<00:04:57.840> there<00:04:58.680> are

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
wow this movie pushes his lot there are

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.350 
wow this movie pushes his lot there are
so<00:04:58.950> many<00:04:59.040> things<00:04:59.370> that<00:04:59.610> simply<00:04:59.910> don't<00:05:00.150> make

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
so many things that simply don't make

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.480 
so many things that simply don't make
sense<00:05:00.600> in<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:00.960> already<00:05:01.320> established

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
sense in the already established

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.950 
sense in the already established
continuity<00:05:02.490> set<00:05:02.790> up<00:05:02.940> in<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.180> previous<00:05:03.510> films

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
continuity set up in the previous films

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.260 
continuity set up in the previous films
fYI<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.830> know<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.370> origins<00:05:05.760> is<00:05:05.910> no<00:05:06.060> longer

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
fYI I know the origins is no longer

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.270 
fYI I know the origins is no longer
considered<00:05:06.810> canon<00:05:07.170> but<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.770> reckon<00:05:08.130> that's

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
considered canon but I reckon that's

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.680 
considered canon but I reckon that's
probably<00:05:08.580> because<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:08.940> film<00:05:09.150> itself<00:05:09.450> doesn't

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
probably because the film itself doesn't

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.390 
probably because the film itself doesn't
know<00:05:09.900> there<00:05:10.380> are<00:05:10.470> even<00:05:10.710> one<00:05:10.860> or<00:05:10.890> two<00:05:11.040> things

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
know there are even one or two things

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.980 
know there are even one or two things
that<00:05:11.550> don't<00:05:11.700> make<00:05:11.880> sense<00:05:11.940> in<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.420> film<00:05:12.660> itself

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
that don't make sense in the film itself

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.870 
that don't make sense in the film itself
and<00:05:13.290> there<00:05:13.980> are<00:05:14.100> things<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:14.430> will<00:05:14.580> make<00:05:14.640> you

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
and there are things that will make you

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.910 
and there are things that will make you
ask<00:05:15.120> do<00:05:15.780> his<00:05:15.930> powers<00:05:16.230> really<00:05:16.380> work<00:05:16.650> like<00:05:16.680> that

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
ask do his powers really work like that

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.770 
ask do his powers really work like that
but<00:05:17.700> luckily<00:05:18.060> those<00:05:18.210> things<00:05:18.450> are<00:05:18.600> tiny

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
but luckily those things are tiny

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.450 
but luckily those things are tiny
fortunately<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.830> only<00:05:19.860> people<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.400> are

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
going to really notice these things are

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.570 
going to really notice these things are
fans<00:05:22.230> or<00:05:22.530> people<00:05:22.560> at<00:05:22.980> least<00:05:23.130> following<00:05:23.520> the

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
film it just focuses more on the overall

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.970 
film it just focuses more on the overall
important<00:05:27.990> stuff<00:05:28.200> like<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.560> characters<00:05:28.950> in

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
important stuff like the characters in

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.570 
important stuff like the characters in

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
the story

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
the day they don't damage the film if

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.560 
the day they don't damage the film if
there<00:05:35.370> are<00:05:35.490> any<00:05:35.670> down<00:05:35.850> points<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.330> film

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
there are any down points to the film

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.970 
there are any down points to the film
I'll<00:05:36.750> go<00:05:36.930> ahead<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.260> say<00:05:37.380> it's<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.620> second

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
I'll go ahead and say it's the second

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.860 
I'll go ahead and say it's the second
act<00:05:38.130> not<00:05:38.610> that<00:05:38.730> it<00:05:38.820> isn't<00:05:38.940> intriguing<00:05:39.420> because

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
act not that it isn't intriguing because

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.420 
act not that it isn't intriguing because
it<00:05:40.110> does<00:05:40.260> use<00:05:40.530> this<00:05:40.650> time<00:05:40.920> to<00:05:41.040> focus<00:05:41.190> on

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
it does use this time to focus on

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.070 
it does use this time to focus on
characters<00:05:41.970> but<00:05:42.420> you<00:05:42.480> go<00:05:42.630> through<00:05:42.840> about<00:05:42.930> a

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
characters but you go through about a

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.260 
characters but you go through about a
third<00:05:43.470> of<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.770> movie<00:05:43.950> with<00:05:44.340> almost<00:05:44.550> no<00:05:44.820> action

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
third of the movie with almost no action

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.970 
third of the movie with almost no action
that<00:05:45.480> didn't<00:05:45.930> really<00:05:46.110> bother<00:05:46.290> me<00:05:46.410> and<00:05:46.740> again

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
that didn't really bother me and again

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.680 
that didn't really bother me and again
it<00:05:47.130> was<00:05:47.250> refreshing<00:05:47.520> after<00:05:48.180> seeing<00:05:48.420> a<00:05:48.480> film

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
it was refreshing after seeing a film

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.180 
it was refreshing after seeing a film
that<00:05:48.900> had<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.230> action<00:05:49.650> running<00:05:49.920> for<00:05:50.070> what

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
that had the action running for what

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.310 
that had the action running for what
seemed<00:05:50.460> like<00:05:50.550> hours<00:05:50.820> on<00:05:51.090> end<00:05:51.300> but<00:05:51.960> if<00:05:52.050> you<00:05:52.140> just

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
seemed like hours on end but if you just

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.020 
seemed like hours on end but if you just
want<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.530> see<00:05:52.680> Wolverine<00:05:52.950> rage<00:05:53.310> for<00:05:53.580> two<00:05:53.730> hours

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
want to see Wolverine rage for two hours

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.700 
want to see Wolverine rage for two hours
bear<00:05:54.390> in<00:05:54.510> mind<00:05:54.660> that<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:54.930> middle<00:05:55.200> chunk<00:05:55.440> is<00:05:55.680> a

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
bear in mind that the middle chunk is a
