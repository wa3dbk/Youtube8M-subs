that's all full webkit browser and
that's<00:01:12.649> basically<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.130> same<00:01:13.460> browser<00:01:14.119> source

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600

the same large way it provides the
bridge<00:01:27.889> so<00:01:28.639> you<00:01:28.729> can<00:01:28.999> write<00:01:29.119> html5

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
bridge so you can write html5

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
book today this is all a big 11 so go

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.130 
book today this is all a big 11 so go
ahead<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.620> launch<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.069> application<00:02:12.190> and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
ahead and launch the application and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.130 
ahead and launch the application and
look<00:02:14.140> at<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.440> how<00:02:14.709> smooth<00:02:15.069> all<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
look at this how smooth all of the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.750 
look at this how smooth all of the
transitions<00:02:17.140> are<00:02:17.440> all<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.069> interaction

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
transitions are all of the interaction

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.790 
transitions are all of the interaction
it's<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.540> like<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> condition<00:02:20.440> genius

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
it's just like a condition genius

built<00:04:50.790> on<00:04:51.060> top<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.390> it<00:04:51.690> we've<00:04:52.169> added<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.620> kind

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
built on top of it we've added the kind

necessary to write really great native
applications<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:58.590> we're<00:04:58.680> going<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:58.890> talk<00:04:59.010> a

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
applications and we're going to talk a

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.590 
applications and we're going to talk a
little<00:04:59.250> bit<00:04:59.460> about<00:04:59.610> what<00:05:00.060> we've<00:05:00.210> done<00:05:00.390> to

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
little bit about what we've done to

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.900 
little bit about what we've done to
around<00:05:01.140> that<00:05:01.350> picture<00:05:01.680> up<00:05:01.800> with<00:05:01.950> graphics<00:05:02.430> the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
around that picture up with graphics the

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.450 
around that picture up with graphics the
3d<00:05:03.270> animations<00:05:03.720> right<00:05:04.050> but<00:05:04.380> with<00:05:04.500> html5<00:05:04.919> we're

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
3d animations right but with html5 we're

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.310 
3d animations right but with html5 we're
intercepting<00:05:05.729> the<00:05:06.090> future<00:05:06.450> because<00:05:07.020> we

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
intercepting the future because we

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.320 
intercepting the future because we
really<00:05:07.560> we<00:05:07.830> are<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:08.370> know<00:05:08.460> we're<00:05:08.910> sensitive

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
really we are you know we're sensitive

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.940 
really we are you know we're sensitive
to<00:05:09.510> what<00:05:09.840> are<00:05:09.930> dumped<00:05:10.110> into<00:05:10.169> overs<00:05:10.530> want<00:05:10.770> food

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
to what are dumped into overs want food

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.500 
to what are dumped into overs want food
we're<00:05:11.400> trying<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.729> understand<00:05:12.150> where<00:05:12.360> they

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
we're trying to understand where they

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.480 
we're trying to understand where they
want<00:05:12.720> us<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.930> go<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.410> you<00:05:13.950> know<00:05:14.070> it's<00:05:14.370> almost

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
want us to go and you know it's almost

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.100 
want us to go and you know it's almost
like<00:05:14.700> over<00:05:15.000> seventy-five<00:05:15.510> percent<00:05:15.720> are<00:05:16.020> all

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
like over seventy-five percent are all

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.659 
like over seventy-five percent are all
telling<00:05:16.320> us<00:05:16.530> they<00:05:16.890> intend<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.220> do<00:05:17.370> something

telling us they intend to do something
that<00:05:17.729> they<00:05:17.790> should<00:05:17.970> apply<00:05:18.240> for<00:05:18.270> if<00:05:18.479> you<00:05:18.570> notice

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
that they should apply for if you notice

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.660 
that they should apply for if you notice
they<00:05:18.870> see<00:05:18.930> them
