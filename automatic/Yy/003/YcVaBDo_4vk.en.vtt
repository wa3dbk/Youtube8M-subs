I don't know if that hood is the way
that<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.390> was

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.510 

all<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.120> cool<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.630> sharks<00:00:54.870> cool

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
all I know is cool in that sharks cool

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.710 
all I know is cool in that sharks cool
I<00:00:57.200> even<00:00:58.200> liked<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.620> those<00:00:58.860> are<00:00:59.010> wheels<00:00:59.720> you

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
I even liked it those are wheels you

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.910 
I even liked it those are wheels you
know<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:00.990> saying<00:01:01.230> they're<00:01:01.380> like<00:01:01.500> aluminum

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
know I'm saying they're like aluminum

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.490 
know I'm saying they're like aluminum
wheels<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.400> cut<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:03.000> way

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
wheels that are cut out that way

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.910 
wheels that are cut out that way
so<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:05.820> almost<00:01:06.000> looks<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.330> steel<00:01:06.630> wheel

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
so it almost looks like a steel wheel

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
so it almost looks like a steel wheel
but<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.340> that's<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.150> high<00:01:09.300> end<00:01:09.540> aluminum

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
but it's not that's a high end aluminum

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.310 
but it's not that's a high end aluminum
wheel

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.610
