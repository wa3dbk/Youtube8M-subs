00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.380
 hey people what 's up my name is and 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.930
 yes, we are in here today 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.400
 littlebigplanet carting something new 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.010
 the people are taking me now because of deeper 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.330
 subscribe or because of curve the and 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.750
 you are not so interested now 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.509
 then just click away and the others 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.630
 yes, it was good so first show 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.250
 I'm here for the first time yes the Danes 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.009
 modular mode so I already have one 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.360
 bit gambled my friend yesterday 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.239
 and there we have one or the other 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.240
 the one price bubble collected and 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.320
 that's why it's a bit crowded here 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.270
 start to play a lot then you have 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.960
 I believe only one or two 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.400
 choices so yes we build ourselves 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.630
 yes, just take a car together 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.040
 So we can do it here 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.460
 you have to choose a dragster 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.570
 lowrider monster truck standard then one 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.829
 spaceship floating things and the tank 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.420
 Basically, I do not think that changes anything 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.220
 on driving or now with alex 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.200
 I actually noticed in 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.140
 Directly this was actually my pool 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:16.369
 looks like a shipowner we want here 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:18.999
 times indeed something like a sponge 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.999
 not necessarily now 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:34.310
 but as good as sitting take out 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:36.649
 we can say that you can be quiet 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.209
 soft as a steering wheel we take someone 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.860
 still very cool out so far 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:47.090
 then he is still driving sounds 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.090
 listen to it like that 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.070
 I think this is the best way to do it 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.720
 you mégane rs you can on 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.970
 every fall on woodland again 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.979
 so i would not buy my game 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.100
 because it just does not buy for me 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.110
 I only have long-term motivation 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.700
 loaned 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.640
 and yes I am told my girlfriend 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.250
 to a point where we just met 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.360
 can not get on now 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.800
 maybe we sound a bit ridiculous 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.130
 the game actually for toddlers 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.600
 thought that but well 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.190
 therefore happens but you can 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.110
 here, of course, like the big band one and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.459
 two also his his sackboy one 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.459
 make a little bit of how to do that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.239
 eyes 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.410
 This time it's good and so drive 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.510
 we simply times some best 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.500
 round 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.420
 To do this, we press xcom into the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.410
 command center yes as we saw 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.140
 have completed 740 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.560
 Come on, let's take a look 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.350
 I think quite cool level there are 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.320
 of course, still so big games 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.850
 you have to start for example 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.080
 and then you have to keep it whoever it is 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.180
 longest keeps then there's just points 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.070
 for this 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.540
 and yes, the one who has won persistently 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.090
 So actually, here is a lot 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.709
 Variety offered 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.440
 but if you are not like me now 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.260
 The game also has an online pass 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.290
 then borrowed a few library nothing 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.519
 is really a bad thing alone makes 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.390
 Do not have fun together and mine 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.950
 Friends really fun but yes 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.770
 can you get to the level where 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:41.080
 mark more, then he is on it 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.500
 laid such a great start there, too 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.500
 somehow 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.730
 well I have now made it even then 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.810
 of course there are weapons but still 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.970
 You can collect a prize ball that you can collect 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.670
 and then it will stop in each case is therefore 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.630
 basically in the basics as with Mario Kart 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.850
 everyone should know are holding weapons 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.460
 or say to drop like mario kart the 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:17.430
 banana is just as funny red 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:21.590
 thick switches the opponents I have now 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:25.200
 already too complicated stage set 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.560
 So heavier than it actually is 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.560
 no more 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.929
 since the price bubble missed now 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.249
 I can do a green without that 

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:37.610
 actually just exclude 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:41.829
 it is not so the berner the thing am 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:45.409
 The most practical is a setcard 

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:47.169
 or as a film symbol for 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.309
 fast forward 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:54.409
 then you will get two three places 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:56.899
 put forward and that brings 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.149
 Definitely what poetry the 

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:00.610
 Rocket is also cool because you have to 

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:06.739
 take care that you meet the 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:09.499
 automatically drifting no there I am now 

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:11.389
 about the phrase already hopped in the 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:11.929
 Last round I have another one of 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.959
 the side with 

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:17.659
 Of course you can beat that, too 

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:20.019
 right analog stick as in lübeck men 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:23.610
 1 and 2 if you have all your players like that 

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:27.379
 one can give 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.379
 you get it now but I'm right 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.750
 of course again if you have a video 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.719
 power and that the demonstration effect knows 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.199
 yes yes there is such a for example 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.199
 drove box 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:51.509
 something always this green super 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:55.889
 So that's where you are new 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:57.029
 prices good thing is the have finished round 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.770
 her first time as a small suggestive 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.689
 to get 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.090
 Unfortunately, I only finished fourth 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:05.090
 but I was better last time 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.750
 if you liked the video then 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:10.560
 goes my thumbs up if I give 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.930
 my thumb down 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.279
 leave a rating there or an abo like 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.300
 also if you have questions then 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.189
 Just put that in the comments 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.250
 I will do it as well as I can 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:23.449
 answer 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.449
 and see you next time
