irrigation<00:00:10.400> system<00:00:10.790> and<00:00:10.940> Sid<00:00:11.179> is<00:00:11.299> this<00:00:11.420> how

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
irrigation system and Sid is this how

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.660 
irrigation system and Sid is this how
you<00:00:11.870> do<00:00:12.019> it<00:00:12.110> only<00:00:12.440> a<00:00:12.710> few<00:00:13.040> inches<00:00:13.190> deep

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
you do it only a few inches deep

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.330 
you do it only a few inches deep
yes<00:00:13.969> about<00:00:14.299> five<00:00:14.509> inches<00:00:14.809> deep<00:00:14.870> and<00:00:15.259> it's<00:00:16.219> a

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
yes about five inches deep and it's a

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.519 
yes about five inches deep and it's a
simple<00:00:16.670> matter<00:00:16.789> of<00:00:16.939> digging<00:00:17.689> this<00:00:17.840> trench<00:00:18.289> and

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
simple matter of digging this trench and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.099 
simple matter of digging this trench and
then<00:00:19.070> we<00:00:19.310> lay<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.150> pipe<00:00:20.359> and<00:00:20.570> attach<00:00:20.630> it<00:00:21.019> at

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
then we lay the pipe and attach it at

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.720 
then we lay the pipe and attach it at
both<00:00:21.260> ends<00:00:21.529> with<00:00:21.769> these<00:00:21.920> anchors<00:00:22.400> that<00:00:22.430> we've

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
both ends with these anchors that we've

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.790 
both ends with these anchors that we've
designed<00:00:22.970> in<00:00:23.630> order<00:00:23.930> to<00:00:24.019> hold<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:24.380> pipe<00:00:24.529> nice

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
designed in order to hold the pipe nice

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.960 
designed in order to hold the pipe nice
and<00:00:25.010> straight<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:25.310> get<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.519> straight<00:00:25.789> line

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
and straight and get a straight line

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.700 
and straight and get a straight line
okay<00:00:26.480> anything<00:00:26.869> else<00:00:27.080> you<00:00:27.260> do<00:00:27.380> here<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:27.650> make

what<00:00:29.630> we<00:00:29.750> need<00:00:29.990> to<00:00:30.109> do<00:00:30.259> is<00:00:30.470> is<00:00:30.740> take<00:00:31.130> this<00:00:31.340> and

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
what we need to do is is take this and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.340 
what we need to do is is take this and
tighten<00:00:31.880> it<00:00:31.910> up<00:00:32.029> good<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:32.480> be<00:00:32.690> sure<00:00:32.930> that<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
tighten it up good and be sure that the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.590 
tighten it up good and be sure that the
holes<00:00:33.620> in<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.460> pipe<00:00:34.640> which<00:00:35.150> are<00:00:35.300> located

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
holes in the pipe which are located

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.990 
holes in the pipe which are located
every<00:00:36.020> six<00:00:36.290> inches<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:36.950> about<00:00:37.310> sixteenth

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
every six inches and about sixteenth

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.410 
every six inches and about sixteenth
inch<00:00:38.360> in<00:00:39.170> diameter<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:40.070> attach<00:00:40.880> it<00:00:41.060> here<00:00:41.090> so

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
inch in diameter and attach it here so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.450 
inch in diameter and attach it here so
it's<00:00:41.570> good<00:00:41.810> and<00:00:41.900> tight<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.380> then<00:00:43.040> we<00:00:43.160> pull

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
it's good and tight and then we pull

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.040 
it's good and tight and then we pull
this<00:00:43.670> block<00:00:44.080> down<00:00:45.080> and<00:00:45.530> anchor<00:00:46.250> this<00:00:47.050> with

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
this block down and anchor this with

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.890 
this block down and anchor this with
with<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.100> rebar<00:00:49.490> and<00:00:49.910> of<00:00:50.330> course<00:00:50.540> if<00:00:50.660> we<00:00:50.780> have

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
with the rebar and of course if we have

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.160 
with the rebar and of course if we have
a<00:00:50.930> much<00:00:51.170> longer<00:00:51.820> line<00:00:52.820> up<00:00:53.090> to<00:00:53.240> 33<00:00:53.750> feet<00:00:53.780> long

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
a much longer line up to 33 feet long

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.290 
a much longer line up to 33 feet long
you<00:00:54.350> can<00:00:54.500> use<00:00:54.650> this<00:00:54.860> system<00:00:55.250> this<00:00:55.910> is<00:00:56.120> very

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
you can use this system this is very

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.480 
you can use this system this is very
important<00:00:56.780> because<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.350> hose<00:00:57.920> tends<00:00:58.280> to

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
important because the hose tends to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.270 
important because the hose tends to
snake<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.510> we<00:00:59.630> get<00:00:59.810> it<00:00:59.900> anchored<00:01:00.770> in<00:01:00.890> real<00:01:01.040> good

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
snake so we get it anchored in real good

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.810 
snake so we get it anchored in real good
and<00:01:01.550> then<00:01:02.120> we<00:01:02.240> take<00:01:02.420> our<00:01:02.570> water<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.699> run<00:01:04.699> our

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
and then we take our water and run our

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.930 
and then we take our water and run our
water<00:01:05.059> through<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.510> hose<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:06.070> test<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.670> see

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
water through the hose and test to see

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.080 
water through the hose and test to see
if<00:01:08.180> any<00:01:08.510> of<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.780> holes<00:01:09.020> are<00:01:09.260> clogged<00:01:09.590> now<00:01:10.460> the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
if any of the holes are clogged now the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.180 
if any of the holes are clogged now the
water<00:01:11.570> usually<00:01:12.020> comes<00:01:12.230> up<00:01:12.350> about<00:01:12.620> six<00:01:12.890> inches

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
water usually comes up about six inches

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.770 
water usually comes up about six inches
and<00:01:13.370> I'm<00:01:13.430> sure<00:01:13.610> as<00:01:13.790> soon<00:01:13.880> as<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.180> air<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.360> out

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
and I'm sure as soon as the air is out

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.750 
and I'm sure as soon as the air is out
of<00:01:14.900> our<00:01:15.290> hose<00:01:15.560> here<00:01:15.860> we'll<00:01:16.280> see<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.490> water

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
of our hose here we'll see the water

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.410 
of our hose here we'll see the water
coming<00:01:17.030> up

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
coming up

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.780 
coming up
then<00:01:18.050> we<00:01:18.170> take<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.410> deck<00:01:18.770> screw<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.370> if<00:01:19.460> any<00:01:19.610> of

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
then we take a deck screw and if any of

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.850 
then we take a deck screw and if any of
these<00:01:19.910> holes<00:01:20.660> are<00:01:20.960> plugged<00:01:21.260> up<00:01:21.470> which<00:01:21.680> they

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
these holes are plugged up which they

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.650 
these holes are plugged up which they
might<00:01:22.010> with<00:01:22.220> debris<00:01:22.490> we<00:01:22.790> take<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.240> put<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.510> in

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
might with debris we take and put it in

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.690 
might with debris we take and put it in
and<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:24.020> clean<00:01:24.650> out<00:01:24.830> that<00:01:25.040> little<00:01:25.280> hole<00:01:25.460> with

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
and and clean out that little hole with

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.120 
and and clean out that little hole with
our<00:01:25.850> with<00:01:26.420> our<00:01:26.450> deck<00:01:26.750> screw<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.230> unclog<00:01:28.100> it

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
our with our deck screw and unclog it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.250 
our with our deck screw and unclog it
after<00:01:29.090> everything<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.540> going<00:01:29.840> in<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.080> hole

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
after everything is going in the hole

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.280 
after everything is going in the hole
and<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.620> water's<00:01:31.030> running<00:01:32.030> fine<00:01:32.390> then<00:01:33.140> we

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
and the water's running fine then we

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.500 
and the water's running fine then we
cover<00:01:33.620> it<00:01:33.770> very<00:01:33.980> gently<00:01:34.250> while<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.090> water<00:01:35.300> is

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
cover it very gently while the water is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.810 
cover it very gently while the water is
running<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:36.710> again<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:37.280> don't<00:01:37.490> clog

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
running so that we again we don't clog

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.790 
running so that we again we don't clog
it<00:01:37.970> up<00:01:38.090> right<00:01:38.690> in<00:01:38.810> order<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.080> try<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.440> push<00:01:39.590> the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
it up right in order to try and push the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.890 
it up right in order to try and push the
soil<00:01:40.010> back<00:01:40.220> when<00:01:40.490> it's<00:01:40.640> not<00:01:41.480> running

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
soil back when it's not running

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.630 
soil back when it's not running
you<00:01:42.110> could<00:01:42.350> fill<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.620> holes<00:01:42.800> that's<00:01:43.220> right

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
you could fill the holes that's right

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.660 
you could fill the holes that's right
and<00:01:44.150> we<00:01:44.390> cover<00:01:44.870> that<00:01:45.110> up<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.560> leave<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.460> water

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
and we cover that up and leave the water

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.250 
and we cover that up and leave the water
running<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.270> then<00:01:47.540> as<00:01:47.690> soon<00:01:47.840> as<00:01:47.930> we<00:01:48.020> have<00:01:48.170> it

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
running and then as soon as we have it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.710 
running and then as soon as we have it
all<00:01:48.350> covered<00:01:48.380> we<00:01:49.310> go<00:01:50.030> ahead<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.270> turn<00:01:50.570> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
all covered we go ahead and turn the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.140 
all covered we go ahead and turn the
water<00:01:50.900> off<00:01:51.050> and<00:01:51.440> dig<00:01:52.250> our<00:01:52.400> trench<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.909> plant

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
water off and dig our trench and plant

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.210 
water off and dig our trench and plant
our<00:01:53.240> seeds<00:01:53.570> for<00:01:53.840> our<00:01:53.960> rural<00:01:54.440> well<00:01:55.070> that's

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
our seeds for our rural well that's

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.740 
our seeds for our rural well that's
pretty<00:01:55.340> fancy<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:55.790> notice<00:01:56.150> this<00:01:56.270> fancy

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
pretty fancy I notice this fancy

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.539 
pretty fancy I notice this fancy
manifold<00:01:57.320> system<00:01:57.770> here<00:01:57.979> this<00:01:58.130> looks<00:01:58.340> pretty

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
manifold system here this looks pretty

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.730 
manifold system here this looks pretty
complicated<00:01:58.760> it's<00:01:59.450> really<00:01:59.900> not<00:02:00.080> anybody<00:02:00.680> that

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
complicated it's really not anybody that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.490 
complicated it's really not anybody that
can<00:02:00.950> attach<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.460> hose<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.120> house<00:02:02.390> faucet<00:02:03.200> can

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
can attach a hose to a house faucet can

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.530 
can attach a hose to a house faucet can
run<00:02:04.130> one<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.400> these<00:02:04.520> systems<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.150> it's<00:02:05.330> very

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
run one of these systems and it's very

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.149 
run one of these systems and it's very
inexpensive<00:02:05.780> can<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.620> show<00:02:06.770> us<00:02:06.799> how<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.040> do

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
inexpensive can you show us how to do

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.070 
inexpensive can you show us how to do
that<00:02:07.340> be<00:02:07.670> glad<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.060> do<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.360> let's<00:02:08.780> go<00:02:08.899> take<00:02:09.050> a

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
that be glad to do that let's go take a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.339 
that be glad to do that let's go take a
look

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.500 

Syd<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.430> looks<00:02:12.700> like<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:12.849> very<00:02:13.090> interesting

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
Syd this looks like a very interesting

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.569 
Syd this looks like a very interesting
workbench<00:02:14.140> you've<00:02:14.319> got<00:02:14.500> here<00:02:14.769> yes<00:02:15.250> these<00:02:15.519> are

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
workbench you've got here yes these are

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.190 
workbench you've got here yes these are
all<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:16.000> elements<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:16.450> need<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.780> set<00:02:16.989> up<00:02:17.019> our

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
all the elements we need to set up our

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.860 
all the elements we need to set up our
system<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.099> relatively<00:02:18.610> simple<00:02:18.870> first

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
system and it's relatively simple first

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.830 
system and it's relatively simple first
we<00:02:20.049> start<00:02:20.290> with<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.439> 3/4<00:02:21.010> by<00:02:21.159> 1/2<00:02:21.610> inch<00:02:21.849> flip

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
we start with a 3/4 by 1/2 inch flip

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.160 
we start with a 3/4 by 1/2 inch flip
joint<00:02:23.200> with<00:02:23.439> a<00:02:23.470> half<00:02:23.739> inch<00:02:24.720> exit<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:25.780> one<00:02:25.959> end

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
joint with a half inch exit on one end

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.410 
joint with a half inch exit on one end
and<00:02:26.290> then<00:02:26.379> we<00:02:26.560> screw<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.099> this<00:02:27.310> short<00:02:27.819> plastic

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
and then we screw in this short plastic

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.190 
and then we screw in this short plastic
nipple<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.409> then<00:02:30.340> we<00:02:30.459> take<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.760> PC<00:02:31.269> valve<00:02:31.569> half

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
nipple and then we take a PC valve half

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.399 
nipple and then we take a PC valve half
HP<00:02:32.440> C<00:02:32.860> valve<00:02:33.159> and<00:02:33.940> that's<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.629> on<00:02:34.840> ball<00:02:35.110> valve

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
HP C valve and that's that on ball valve

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.559 
HP C valve and that's that on ball valve
so<00:02:35.739> although<00:02:35.950> that's<00:02:36.489> better<00:02:36.879> than<00:02:37.120> some<00:02:37.540> of

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
so although that's better than some of

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.839 
so although that's better than some of
the<00:02:37.659> gate<00:02:37.810> valves<00:02:38.170> which<00:02:38.349> do<00:02:38.500> dry<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:39.159> doesn't

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
the gate valves which do dry it doesn't

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.210 
the gate valves which do dry it doesn't
corrode<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.750> then<00:02:41.409> to<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.739> we<00:02:41.950> take<00:02:42.129> an

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
corrode and then to that we take an

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.099 
corrode and then to that we take an
adapter<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.730> we<00:02:42.939> can<00:02:43.090> hook<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.450> our<00:02:43.569> holes

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
adapter that we can hook to our holes

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.979 
adapter that we can hook to our holes
1/2<00:02:44.260> inch<00:02:44.470> again<00:02:45.120> whoops<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.540> jumped<00:02:46.870> out<00:02:46.959> of

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
1/2 inch again whoops that jumped out of

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.530 
1/2 inch again whoops that jumped out of
my<00:02:47.109> hand<00:02:47.409> and<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:47.799> we<00:02:47.950> can<00:02:48.159> screw<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.299> in

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
my hand and then we can screw that in

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.809 
my hand and then we can screw that in
yeah

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
yeah

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.339 
yeah
nothing<00:02:51.819> hard<00:02:51.940> yet<00:02:52.239> nothing<00:02:52.810> hard<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.170> that

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
nothing hard yet nothing hard to that

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.500 
nothing hard yet nothing hard to that
anybody<00:02:53.829> can<00:02:53.980> do<00:02:54.129> that<00:02:54.159> and<00:02:54.609> then<00:02:55.239> what<00:02:55.420> we

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
anybody can do that and then what we

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.119 
anybody can do that and then what we
need<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.720> do<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.230> hook<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.709> up<00:02:56.889> to<00:02:57.099> our

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
need to do is hook this up to our

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.520 
need to do is hook this up to our
mainline<00:02:57.579> to<00:02:58.569> do<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.900> we<00:02:59.049> take<00:02:59.230> out<00:02:59.379> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
mainline to do that we take out the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.240 
mainline to do that we take out the
gasket<00:03:00.069> we<00:03:00.730> take<00:03:00.970> our<00:03:01.180> 3/4<00:03:01.870> inch<00:03:02.049> which<00:03:03.010> means

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
gasket we take our 3/4 inch which means

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.860 
gasket we take our 3/4 inch which means
you'll<00:03:03.370> see<00:03:03.609> pipe<00:03:03.879> may<00:03:04.180> be<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.299> lot<00:03:04.450> longer<00:03:04.599> than

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
you'll see pipe may be a lot longer than

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.770 
you'll see pipe may be a lot longer than
that<00:03:04.930> but<00:03:05.290> yes<00:03:06.329> put<00:03:07.329> that<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:09.510> screw<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.720> on

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
that but yes put that in screw that on

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.710 
that but yes put that in screw that on
and<00:03:11.310> we've<00:03:12.310> tighten<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.090> up<00:03:13.150> with<00:03:13.389> our<00:03:13.420> hands

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
and we've tighten that up with our hands

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.830 
and we've tighten that up with our hands
we've<00:03:14.019> got<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.260> real<00:03:15.190> tight<00:03:15.549> connection<00:03:16.480> with<00:03:16.810> a

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
we've got a real tight connection with a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.170 
we've got a real tight connection with a
low<00:03:17.079> pressure<00:03:17.379> that<00:03:17.650> we<00:03:17.769> use<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.370> then<00:03:19.060> of

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
low pressure that we use and then of

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.849 
low pressure that we use and then of
course<00:03:19.359> we<00:03:19.510> do<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.870> other<00:03:20.139> end<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:20.709> has

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
course we do the other end and this has

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.259 
course we do the other end and this has
got<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.069> plug<00:03:21.400> on<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.669> end<00:03:21.790> if<00:03:21.879> you<00:03:21.940> want<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.180> use

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
got a plug on the end if you want to use

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.240 
got a plug on the end if you want to use
a<00:03:22.299> plug<00:03:22.599> but<00:03:23.169> if<00:03:23.260> not<00:03:23.440> we<00:03:23.739> can<00:03:23.919> just<00:03:24.099> go<00:03:24.220> ahead

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
a plug but if not we can just go ahead

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.059 
a plug but if not we can just go ahead
and<00:03:24.609> add<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.329> longer<00:03:26.290> piece<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.650> pipe<00:03:26.859> that

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
and add a longer piece of pipe that

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.879 
and add a longer piece of pipe that
would<00:03:27.190> hook<00:03:27.639> on<00:03:27.879> other<00:03:28.389> places<00:03:28.720> now<00:03:29.590> when<00:03:29.799> we

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
would hook on other places now when we

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.490 
would hook on other places now when we
come<00:03:30.129> off<00:03:30.280> here<00:03:30.790> we<00:03:31.599> want<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.900> hook<00:03:32.019> up<00:03:32.169> to<00:03:32.199> our

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
come off here we want to hook up to our

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.610 
come off here we want to hook up to our
Rose<00:03:33.000> Underground<00:03:34.000> Rose<00:03:34.269> so<00:03:35.049> we<00:03:35.169> take<00:03:35.349> a<00:03:35.379> piece

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
Rose Underground Rose so we take a piece

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.449 
Rose Underground Rose so we take a piece
of<00:03:35.650> black<00:03:36.389> holes<00:03:37.560> scrimped<00:03:38.560> out<00:03:38.680> all<00:03:38.919> up<00:03:39.250> real

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
of black holes scrimped out all up real

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.970 
of black holes scrimped out all up real
tight<00:03:39.790> up<00:03:40.060> there<00:03:40.329> against<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.139> then<00:03:41.829> we

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
tight up there against that and then we

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.890 
tight up there against that and then we
may<00:03:42.160> want<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.459> run<00:03:42.609> a<00:03:42.669> tee<00:03:43.000> off<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.389> so<00:03:43.599> we<00:03:43.750> could

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
may want to run a tee off it so we could

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.490 
may want to run a tee off it so we could
take<00:03:44.109> a<00:03:44.139> tee<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.940> also<00:03:45.940> insert<00:03:46.329> that<00:03:46.569> and<00:03:46.840> go

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
take a tee and also insert that and go

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.460 
take a tee and also insert that and go
off<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:47.859> there<00:03:48.010> four<00:03:48.519> or<00:03:48.760> five<00:03:49.060> rows<00:03:49.470> however

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
off in there four or five rows however

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.800 
off in there four or five rows however
we<00:03:50.680> can<00:03:50.829> also<00:03:51.010> take<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.699> half<00:03:52.329> inch<00:03:52.569> diameter

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
we can also take a half inch diameter

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.879 
we can also take a half inch diameter
green<00:03:53.440> hose<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.069> slide<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:55.209> in<00:03:55.889> the

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
green hose and slide that in the

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.250 
green hose and slide that in the
exterior<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:57.459> is<00:03:57.819> 1/2<00:03:58.060> inch<00:03:58.329> so<00:03:58.870> these<00:03:59.049> are

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
exterior that is 1/2 inch so these are

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.809 
exterior that is 1/2 inch so these are
all<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.650> different<00:03:59.949> kinds<00:04:00.129> of<00:04:00.370> combinations

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
all the different kinds of combinations

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.479 
all the different kinds of combinations
we<00:04:01.389> can<00:04:01.599> use<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:02.949> course<00:04:03.159> this<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:03.459> a

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
we can use and of course this is a

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.119 
we can use and of course this is a
corner<00:04:04.000> piece<00:04:04.209> that<00:04:04.480> we<00:04:04.569> could<00:04:04.780> put<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:05.859> here

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
corner piece that we could put on here

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.509 
corner piece that we could put on here
to<00:04:06.310> line<00:04:06.669> up<00:04:06.849> our<00:04:06.970> our<00:04:07.329> corners<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.079> all<00:04:09.069> kinds

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
to line up our our corners and all kinds

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.159 
to line up our our corners and all kinds
of<00:04:09.579> combinations<00:04:09.909> it<00:04:10.449> takes<00:04:10.659> a<00:04:10.750> little<00:04:10.900> push

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
of combinations it takes a little push

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.319 
of combinations it takes a little push
but<00:04:11.889> it<00:04:12.010> goes<00:04:12.190> in<00:04:12.370> quite<00:04:12.579> easily<00:04:12.819> now<00:04:13.090> some

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
but it goes in quite easily now some

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.849 
but it goes in quite easily now some
herbs<00:04:13.629> hold<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:13.900> pretty<00:04:14.019> well<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.470> sometimes

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
herbs hold it pretty well and sometimes

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.339 
herbs hold it pretty well and sometimes
it's<00:04:15.190> hard<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.579> pull<00:04:15.819> off<00:04:15.849> by<00:04:16.209> hand<00:04:16.510> but<00:04:17.139> if<00:04:17.260> you

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
it's hard to pull off by hand but if you

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.300 
it's hard to pull off by hand but if you
take<00:04:17.530> your<00:04:17.739> pliers<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.699> firm<00:04:19.659> grasp<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.349> pull

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
take your pliers a firm grasp and pull

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.760 
take your pliers a firm grasp and pull
it<00:04:21.430> off<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:22.150> comes<00:04:22.450> off<00:04:22.659> quite<00:04:23.020> easily<00:04:23.229> so<00:04:23.710> you

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
it off it comes off quite easily so you

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.990 
it off it comes off quite easily so you
can<00:04:24.010> fix<00:04:24.190> mistakes

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
can fix mistakes

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.760 
can fix mistakes
you<00:04:25.150> can<00:04:25.300> adapt<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.750> each<00:04:25.900> year<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.440> different

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
you can adapt it each year to different

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.220 
you can adapt it each year to different
different<00:04:27.310> hoses<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.060> might<00:04:28.240> need<00:04:28.450> okay

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
different hoses that you might need okay

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.290 
different hoses that you might need okay
and<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:29.800> then<00:04:30.010> how<00:04:30.250> hard<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.700> cut<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.090> -

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
and so then how hard is it to cut this -

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.660 
and so then how hard is it to cut this -
it's<00:04:31.840> not<00:04:32.020> hard<00:04:32.320> at<00:04:32.440> all<00:04:32.560> this<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.460> your

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
it's not hard at all this is your

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.990 
it's not hard at all this is your
standard<00:04:34.120> cutter<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.340> for<00:04:36.340> an<00:04:36.430> example<00:04:36.880> we

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
standard cutter and for an example we

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.990 
standard cutter and for an example we
can<00:04:37.030> you<00:04:37.630> cut<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.080> PVC<00:04:38.290> very<00:04:39.100> easily<00:04:39.490> with

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
can you cut the PVC very easily with

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.630 
can you cut the PVC very easily with
that<00:04:40.180> it's<00:04:40.690> sure<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.960> lot<00:04:41.170> better<00:04:41.470> than<00:04:41.740> using<00:04:42.550> a

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
that it's sure a lot better than using a

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.030 
that it's sure a lot better than using a
saw<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.180> see<00:04:43.720> how<00:04:43.870> easily<00:04:44.140> that<00:04:44.470> snips<00:04:44.830> off

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
saw and see how easily that snips off

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.130 
saw and see how easily that snips off
good<00:04:45.340> straight<00:04:45.640> cut<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.210> then<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.810> course<00:04:46.840> we

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
good straight cut and then of course we

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.620 
good straight cut and then of course we
can<00:04:47.260> do<00:04:47.440> with<00:04:47.590> our<00:04:47.680> black<00:04:47.980> holes<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:49.120> same<00:04:49.390> way

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
can do with our black holes the same way

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.440 
can do with our black holes the same way
and<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:51.280> same<00:04:51.460> way<00:04:51.640> with<00:04:51.760> our<00:04:51.910> green<00:04:52.180> holes

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
and the same way with our green holes

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.000 
and the same way with our green holes
that<00:04:52.600> it<00:04:52.750> cuts<00:04:52.930> very<00:04:53.230> easily<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.830> any

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
that it cuts very easily to any

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.800 
that it cuts very easily to any
dimensions<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.730> we<00:04:54.880> would<00:04:55.060> need<00:04:55.240> anyone

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810
