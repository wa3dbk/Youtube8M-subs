00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
I did the unboxing a couple hours ago I

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.379 
I did the unboxing a couple hours ago I
feel<00:00:11.010> like<00:00:11.190> I've<00:00:11.340> played<00:00:11.700> with<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> enough<00:00:12.179> to

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
feel like I've played with it enough to

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.650 
feel like I've played with it enough to
where<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.750> actually<00:00:13.410> review<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.660> judge

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
where I can actually review it and judge

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.939 
where I can actually review it and judge
it<00:00:15.839> because<00:00:15.929> it's<00:00:16.230> got<00:00:16.379> some<00:00:16.529> good<00:00:16.710> things

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
it because it's got some good things

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.990 
it because it's got some good things
it's<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:18.600> thing<00:00:18.900> that's<00:00:19.140> not<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.560> bad

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
it's got one thing that's not really bad

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.279 
it's got one thing that's not really bad
but<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:22.250> probably<00:00:23.689> you<00:00:24.689> should<00:00:24.869> probably<00:00:24.900> take

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
but it probably you should probably take

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.370 
but it probably you should probably take
it<00:00:25.320> into<00:00:25.560> consideration<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:26.279> buying<00:00:26.519> one

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
it into consideration or one buying one

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.500 
it into consideration or one buying one

correspondingly other than that the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.140 
correspondingly other than that the
things<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.430> make<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.670> different<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
things that make it different is that

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.160

it's got dome sticks instead of the
regular<00:01:31.350> ps4<00:01:31.950> sticks<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:33.689> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
regular ps4 sticks and one of them is

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.710 
regular ps4 sticks and one of them is
regular<00:01:34.590> sized<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.450> is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
regular sized and the right one is

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.069 
regular sized and the right one is
actually<00:01:37.619> medium<00:01:38.189> sized<00:01:38.600> because<00:01:39.600> for

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
actually medium sized because for

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.480 
actually medium sized because for
shooters<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:40.680> gonna<00:01:40.770> want<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> lot

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
shooters you're gonna want to have a lot

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.749 
shooters you're gonna want to have a lot
of<00:01:41.520> good<00:01:42.360> position<00:01:42.780> movement<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.430> my

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
of good position movement and I have my

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.190 
of good position movement and I have my
right<00:01:44.939> stick<00:01:45.180> taller<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.899> get<00:01:46.049> better

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
right stick taller so I can get better

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.899 
right stick taller so I can get better
movement<00:01:46.710> off<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.960> pretty<00:01:48.960> much<00:01:49.170> just

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
movement off of it and pretty much just

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.670 
movement off of it and pretty much just
aim<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> little<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.390> better<00:01:51.600> when<00:01:51.869> using<00:01:52.049> ARS

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
aim a little bit better when using ARS

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.920 
aim a little bit better when using ARS
which<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.130> what<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.310> use<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.540> also<00:01:54.659> gives

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
which is what I use it for it also gives

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.600 
which is what I use it for it also gives
you<00:01:55.020> better<00:01:55.140> movement<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.710> SMGs<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.399> stuff

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you better movement for SMGs and stuff

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340 
you better movement for SMGs and stuff
it<00:01:56.729> makes<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.149> lets<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> make<00:01:57.630> tiny

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
it makes you it lets you make tiny

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.859 
it makes you it lets you make tiny
adjustments<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.130> lot<00:01:59.280> better<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> don't

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
adjustments a lot better and now I don't

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.330 
adjustments a lot better and now I don't
have<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.140> use<00:02:01.259> my<00:02:01.380> control<00:02:01.560> freaks<00:02:01.950> which<00:02:02.189> is

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
have to use my control freaks which is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.399 
have to use my control freaks which is
awesome<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.930> didn't<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.259> my

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
awesome because I really didn't like my

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.050 
awesome because I really didn't like my
control<00:02:04.740> freaks<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.899> I'm<00:02:07.560> glad<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.129> put

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
control freaks so I'm glad I can put

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.490 
control freaks so I'm glad I can put
those<00:02:09.209> aside

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
those aside

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.800 
those aside
and<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:11.280> don't<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:11.910> use<00:02:12.030> my<00:02:12.150> ps3<00:02:12.420> thumb

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and I don't have to use my ps3 thumb

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.050 
and I don't have to use my ps3 thumb
stick<00:02:13.050> because<00:02:13.800> my<00:02:14.010> ps3<00:02:14.250> thumb<00:02:14.550> sticks<00:02:14.820> on<00:02:14.940> my

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
stick because my ps3 thumb sticks on my

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.860 
stick because my ps3 thumb sticks on my
ps4<00:02:15.330> controller<00:02:15.890> because<00:02:16.890> although<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.430> was

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
ps4 controller because although that was

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.840 
ps4 controller because although that was
better<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.590> wasn't<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.700> was

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
better it wasn't really what I was

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.980 
better it wasn't really what I was
looking<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.300> was<00:02:21.390> looking<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:21.810> something

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
looking for I was looking for something

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.980 
looking for I was looking for something
more<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.620> line<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.990> obviously

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
more in the line of this and obviously

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.540 
more in the line of this and obviously
you<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.560> looks<00:02:25.740> good<00:02:26.160> because<00:02:26.280> it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
you can see it looks good because it

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.020 
you can see it looks good because it
looks<00:02:26.730> unique<00:02:28.400> because<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> lot<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.820> people

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
looks unique because a lot of people

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.390 
looks unique because a lot of people
don't<00:02:30.270> have<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.690> controller<00:02:31.110> don't<00:02:31.740> have<00:02:31.890> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
don't have this controller don't have a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.210 
don't have this controller don't have a
ps4<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.630> ps4<00:02:33.990> controller<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.470> actually<00:02:34.590> yellow

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
ps4 a ps4 controller is actually yellow

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.910 
ps4 a ps4 controller is actually yellow
or<00:02:35.459> custom<00:02:35.820> colored<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.590> got<00:02:37.770> that

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
or custom colored so it's it's got that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.380 
or custom colored so it's it's got that
-<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.400> unique<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.880> those<00:02:39.060> are<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> good

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
- that it's unique so those are the good

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.210 
- that it's unique so those are the good
things<00:02:39.600> about<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.840> now<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.230> one<00:02:40.470> thing<00:02:40.680> that

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
things about it now the one thing that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.010 
things about it now the one thing that
isn't<00:02:41.820> really<00:02:42.150> bad<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.660> should<00:02:42.840> consider

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
isn't really bad but you should consider

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.870 
isn't really bad but you should consider
is<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> paddles<00:02:44.160> will<00:02:44.400> take<00:02:44.610> time<00:02:44.820> to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
is that the paddles will take time to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.270 
is that the paddles will take time to
get<00:02:45.150> used<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.510> I've<00:02:46.140> been<00:02:46.380> playing<00:02:46.620> with<00:02:47.070> it

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
get used to I've been playing with it

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.760 
get used to I've been playing with it
for<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.880> would<00:02:48.060> say<00:02:50.810> probably<00:02:51.810> seven<00:02:52.530> or<00:02:52.620> eight

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
for I would say probably seven or eight

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.860 
for I would say probably seven or eight
hours<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.520> I'm<00:02:54.000> still<00:02:54.300> not<00:02:54.420> used<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
hours and I'm still not used to the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.840 
hours and I'm still not used to the
paddles<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.410> still<00:02:55.680> keep<00:02:55.950> trying<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.340> jump<00:02:56.640> or

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
paddles I still keep trying to jump or

knife with circle and X on my controller

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.070 
knife with circle and X on my controller
instead<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.120> using<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.480> back<00:03:00.630> paddles

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
instead of using the back paddles

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.949 
instead of using the back paddles
sometimes<00:03:01.980> I'll<00:03:02.310> jump<00:03:02.550> with<00:03:02.910> X<00:03:03.150> by<00:03:03.360> accident

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
sometimes I'll jump with X by accident

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.229 
sometimes I'll jump with X by accident
I'll<00:03:04.110> click<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.440> by<00:03:04.560> accident<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:06.030> not

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
I'll click it by accident and it's not

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.490 
I'll click it by accident and it's not
that<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.390> loose<00:03:06.720> enough<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.020> where<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.350> can

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
that it's loose enough to where you can

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.199 
that it's loose enough to where you can
click<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.890> by<00:03:07.980> accident<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.030> way<00:03:09.180> I

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
click it by accident it's that the way I

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.610 
click it by accident it's that the way I
grabbed<00:03:09.540> my<00:03:09.690> controller<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.910> like<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.620> so

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
grabbed my controller is like this so

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.150 
grabbed my controller is like this so
sometimes<00:03:14.930> sometimes<00:03:15.930> I'll<00:03:16.260> click<00:03:16.650> right

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
sometimes sometimes I'll click right

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.690 
sometimes sometimes I'll click right
there<00:03:17.190> by<00:03:17.820> accident<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:19.500> takes<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:20.040> little<00:03:20.580> bit

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
there by accident it takes a little bit

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.120 
there by accident it takes a little bit
of<00:03:20.850> pressure<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.150> do<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:22.440> sometimes<00:03:22.769> I'll

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
of pressure to do it but sometimes I'll

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.259 
of pressure to do it but sometimes I'll
just<00:03:23.310> click<00:03:23.580> by<00:03:23.700> accident<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:25.970> my<00:03:26.970> controller

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
just click by accident and my controller

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.380 
just click by accident and my controller
will<00:03:27.570> just<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:29.250> paddle<00:03:29.580> will<00:03:29.730> just<00:03:29.940> click<00:03:30.180> and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
will just the paddle will just click and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.350 
will just the paddle will just click and
then<00:03:30.630> my<00:03:30.780> controller<00:03:31.700> does<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.970> jumping

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
then my controller does the jumping

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.800 
then my controller does the jumping
motion<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.110> game<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> jump<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.130> I

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
motion and on the game I jump and I

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.470 
motion and on the game I jump and I
don't<00:03:36.810> really<00:03:37.019> want<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.320> jump<00:03:37.560> but<00:03:38.299> it<00:03:39.299> takes

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
don't really want to jump but it takes

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.120 
don't really want to jump but it takes
time<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.720> get<00:03:39.930> used<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.590> I'm<00:03:40.769> pretty<00:03:40.950> sure

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
time to get used to and I'm pretty sure

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.400 
time to get used to and I'm pretty sure
I'll<00:03:41.310> get<00:03:41.459> used<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.820> it<00:03:41.910> too<00:03:42.269> I've<00:03:42.870> never<00:03:43.110> used

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
I'll get used to it too I've never used

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.100 
I'll get used to it too I've never used
a<00:03:43.590> scuf<00:03:43.799> controller<00:03:43.860> before<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.870> wouldn't

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
a scuf controller before and I wouldn't

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.750 
a scuf controller before and I wouldn't
say<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.410> improved<00:03:46.769> my<00:03:46.920> game<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.459> made<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.730> a

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
say it's improved my game it's made it a

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.009 
say it's improved my game it's made it a
lot<00:03:47.880> more<00:03:48.000> comfortable<00:03:48.600> because<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.900> don't

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
lot more comfortable because I don't

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.020 
lot more comfortable because I don't
have<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.350> at<00:03:49.829> least<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.160> knifing<00:03:50.549> I<00:03:50.730> don't<00:03:50.940> have

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
have to at least a knifing I don't have

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.090 
have to at least a knifing I don't have
to<00:03:51.150> go<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:52.140> circle<00:03:52.560> button<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.829> can<00:03:52.950> just

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
to go to the circle button I can just

tactical for about a year now and I

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.550 
tactical for about a year now and I
really<00:04:12.150> like<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.420> way<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:13.140> can<00:04:13.290> also<00:04:13.440> use

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
really like it that way you can also use

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.310 
really like it that way you can also use
this<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:13.980> drop<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:15.079> don't<00:04:16.079> know<00:04:16.140> why<00:04:16.260> you

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
this to drop but I don't know why you

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.860 
this to drop but I don't know why you
would<00:04:16.850> it's<00:04:17.850> really<00:04:18.060> just<00:04:18.180> easier<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.660> drop

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
would it's really just easier to drop

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.960 
would it's really just easier to drop
this<00:04:19.520> what

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
this what

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.070 
this what
thumbstick<00:04:22.970> because<00:04:23.360> you're<00:04:23.600> already<00:04:23.690> aiming

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.280 
thumbstick because you're already aiming
with<00:04:24.380> it<00:04:25.210> other<00:04:26.210> than<00:04:26.389> that<00:04:26.449> it's<00:04:26.750> got<00:04:26.870> nothing

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
with it other than that it's got nothing

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.040 
with it other than that it's got nothing
nothing<00:04:28.070> out<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.520> ordinary<00:04:28.690> but<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.720> would

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
nothing out of the ordinary but I would

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.230 
nothing out of the ordinary but I would
say<00:04:30.259> definitely<00:04:31.070> it's<00:04:31.220> worth<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.610> if<00:04:31.789> you<00:04:31.910> can

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
say definitely it's worth it if you can

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.150 
say definitely it's worth it if you can
buy<00:04:32.479> it<00:04:32.509> if<00:04:33.080> you're<00:04:33.470> looking<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:33.800> replace<00:04:34.039> your

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
buy it if you're looking to replace your

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.779 
buy it if you're looking to replace your
controller

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
controller

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.710 
controller
I<00:04:34.880> wouldn't<00:04:35.180> recommend<00:04:35.300> getting<00:04:35.750> an<00:04:35.960> actual

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
I wouldn't recommend getting an actual

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.460 
I wouldn't recommend getting an actual
DualShock<00:04:38.720> for<00:04:39.100> if<00:04:40.180> if<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.479> have<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:42.110> get<00:04:42.229> one

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
DualShock for if if you have to get one

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.120 
DualShock for if if you have to get one
I<00:04:42.740> would<00:04:43.220> say<00:04:43.460> get<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.300> but<00:04:45.259> if<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.800> have<00:04:45.979> an

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
I would say get it but if you have an

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.080 
I would say get it but if you have an
extra<00:04:46.400> money<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.669> would<00:04:46.820> just<00:04:46.940> recommend

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
extra money I would just recommend

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.409 
extra money I would just recommend
buying<00:04:47.539> a<00:04:47.690> scuf<00:04:47.990> controller<00:04:48.020> or<00:04:48.910> any<00:04:49.910> other

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
buying a scuf controller or any other

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.400 
buying a scuf controller or any other
sort<00:04:50.750> of<00:04:50.840> custom<00:04:51.229> controller<00:04:51.639> so<00:04:52.960> yeah<00:04:53.960> that's

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
sort of custom controller so yeah that's

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.320 
sort of custom controller so yeah that's
pretty<00:04:54.680> much<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:55.160> if<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.760> can<00:04:55.910> buy<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.060> custom

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
pretty much it if you can buy a custom

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.510 
pretty much it if you can buy a custom
controller<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:57.020> would<00:04:57.169> recommend<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:58.310> is

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
controller I would recommend it this is

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.219 
controller I would recommend it this is
mine<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:59.090> got<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.539> scuf<00:04:59.840> Hornet<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.770> match<00:05:00.949> my

removed if it does cost a little bit

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.330 
removed if it does cost a little bit
more<00:05:22.840> but<00:05:23.840> if<00:05:24.199> you<00:05:24.289> can<00:05:24.590> do<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:25.099> if<00:05:25.190> you

more but if you can do it and if you

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.490 
more but if you can do it and if you
don't<00:05:25.460> play<00:05:25.789> with<00:05:26.060> Rumble<00:05:26.870> you're<00:05:27.080> not<00:05:27.199> gonna

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
don't play with Rumble you're not gonna

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.230 
don't play with Rumble you're not gonna
play<00:05:27.740> with<00:05:27.860> Rumble<00:05:28.250> which<00:05:28.880> I<00:05:29.000> don't<00:05:29.060> recommend

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
play with Rumble which I don't recommend

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.240 
play with Rumble which I don't recommend
in<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.690> first<00:05:29.930> place<00:05:30.169> because<00:05:30.349> it<00:05:30.620> kind<00:05:31.190> of

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
in the first place because it kind of

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.460 
in the first place because it kind of
messes<00:05:31.520> up<00:05:31.669> your<00:05:31.789> aim<00:05:33.490> at<00:05:34.490> least<00:05:34.699> for<00:05:34.880> me<00:05:35.000> and

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
messes up your aim at least for me and

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.409 
messes up your aim at least for me and
for<00:05:36.470> most<00:05:36.710> people<00:05:36.830> it<00:05:37.250> tends<00:05:37.970> to<00:05:38.060> mess<00:05:38.270> up

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
for most people it tends to mess up

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.570 
for most people it tends to mess up
their<00:05:38.570> aim<00:05:38.750> so<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:39.680> would<00:05:39.979> recommend<00:05:40.130> that<00:05:40.460> you

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
their aim so I would recommend that you

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.100 
their aim so I would recommend that you
do<00:05:40.820> get<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.030> rumbles<00:05:41.449> out<00:05:41.570> it<00:05:41.720> feels<00:05:41.840> a<00:05:41.990> lot

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
do get the rumbles out it feels a lot

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.659 
do get the rumbles out it feels a lot
lighter<00:05:42.320> without<00:05:42.710> them<00:05:42.919> and<00:05:43.099> this<00:05:43.340> would<00:05:43.550> be<00:05:43.639> a

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
lighter without them and this would be a

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.460 
lighter without them and this would be a
really<00:05:43.880> heavy<00:05:44.090> controller<00:05:44.479> if<00:05:44.750> it<00:05:44.840> didn't<00:05:45.139> if

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
really heavy controller if it didn't if
