 access the first link in the description and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.880
 meet fight games are pretty 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.089
 known for having their characters there 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.760
 very odd 100 and even the minds 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.480
 size always has a character that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.859
 You 'll hit the eye and think about sending. 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.320
 these days I was remembering some 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.260
 games and such that I played the whore that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.750
 There was only bizarre trash in the act. 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.809
 tortoise 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.090
 today we will see the most 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.410
 freaks more than minds I do not know 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.059
 Any way you want it 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.629
 so I already clicked I liked it down here 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 by fucking support though there charge until 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.239
 in three it was a game that I played 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.239
 not quite playstation 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.620
 You must have played or 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.180
 no or maybe the cool this game of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.500
 a character I thought was funny 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.200
 damn riot or mox of a not know 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 besides this character was a doll of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.190
 This is a wooden doll. 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.890
 wood 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.680
 now what's more bizarre is more 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.650
 in this character is the story 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.350
 of him when you 0 the technician in three there 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.259
 in the end shows him kind with his family 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.440
 in a family of a wooden dummy 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:37.500
 this show and should be there to make high 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:40.800
 macumba high common a ring in the ring 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.649
 You already thought about it and fight with a car. 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.390
 yes you fight with a car in the game 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.270
 fighters mega mix has this character 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.270
 for you to choose the human type where 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.660
 man takes this idea the car beats using 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.970
 the wheels can only be poison 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.160
 whenever there is a character now and 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.170
 I think it's strange, I'll remember 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.170
 They made a fighting car. 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.440
 if it 's crazy waterfall you should already have 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.120
 heard of the neighborhood that dinosaur 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.000
 satanic pink 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.040
 fear in the game reaches the beans beyond 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.469
 sport the name of the hour 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.109
 not a bloody fighting game to 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:30.390
 Damn you can fight the bartender. 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.700
 I do not know, but I do not know. 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.640
 too strange this dinosaur is 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.370
 is to tear the guts out of the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.769
 people this is very weird the second 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:49.349
 with the pink dinosaur that is of a series 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:51.269
 in hd phone because it is a 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.450
 character that caused a lot of controversy 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:59.040
 In games, you should see her. 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:02.700
 Thinking of the time, I got a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.900
 bone, I'm sorry I tell you but she wants 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.939
 see it not he is man or decided by 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.230
 character on the list because it is not 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.519
 so common to see characters is 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.859
 transsexuals I think because it's a 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.169
 Final game character fight more 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:23.189
 also appear other games as street 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:26.069
 fighter street fighting 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.379
 time there at the time the crazy asshole watching 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.449
 this character to discover that he had 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.639
 a controversy that had whatever one 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:35.540
 story that he was a man who must 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.760
 like this character there is the mouse 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.949
 are connected right? 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.930
 so far she had a game that I 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:46.109
 I played a lot I do not know if you guys 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.329
 they knew was the messiah mano the character 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:52.440
 of this game was an angel who 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.930
 could own the body of people is 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.659
 Wow, what a bizarre thing, my sky god . 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.970
 berg I was even afraid of this game and 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.389
 worse I did not even know how to play I was a 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.019
 stupid of the head but also a child 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.419
 huh 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.790
 You're going to want to be on the other side. 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:11.790
 character that wanting or not is very 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.159
 weird in the games is the slayer the guy 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.359
 looks like a two-meter mannequin 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:20.849

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.240

 front bitch bizarre human bizarre 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.880

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.670

 potassium with her I was willing to 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.980
