00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:09.900
 The house of youtube I am and it is delivered 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.920
 The second gameplay for you is this. 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.920
 gameplay 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.100
 I'll talk about the best class of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.980
 Game is what I liked the most 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:28.429
 if you like the personal video, it's 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:30.900

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:37.920
 also comments that I will respond as 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:41.969
 someone sees is so it is so I gun more 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.570
 I liked sc 2010 is a very quick weapon 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.050
 good, how can you see I've been through 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.050
 she is not 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:04.160
 the equipment at it the best I think 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:04.160
 what are the flu what the shield 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:14.180
 through the wall to kill and then assault 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.180
 and so is a good one from near and far, right? 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.189
 of agility 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.770
 the hard online 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:38.000
 Angie and I recommend you to use the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.000
 debut Assault package is now 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:49.320
 with the watchdog and the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.750
 helicopter that I thought were the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.880
 better the site with it tracks the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.820
 enemies 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.820
 the guard kills me 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.710
 then it opens the enemies and the dog of 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.440
 guard and weeds did not have to give a 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.239
 ground cover right and the helicopter 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.069
 had a cover in the air that is very 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.500
 It's good to see you 're running 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:22.560
 map he goes there killed face that is 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.750
 behind you pump and achim I think 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.620
 the guard dog helps you increase 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.510
 the where are you 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.569
 and if you want to get in the mood it's very 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.650
 good is to play the game also there is also 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.480
 very much the one and explaining is because 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.600
 that guard dog raise the hair is 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.459
 because so if you die for a guy 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.660
 the watchdog goes there and will kill the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:49.549
 that is, the face will stay positive and the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.549
 the most important agreement of the game will 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.730
 find the most important thing in the game 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.319
 because if the guy he looks to see that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.040
 You can not kill more than 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.900
 die makes face is easy it's bad old 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.430
 it will be easy to win 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.769
 and then if you have a case 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.269
 positive it will look with another look 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.480
 old guy 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.950
 it goes well you will feel 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.200
 evidently because the guy is going to look at 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.260
 positive chain will be difficult the s40 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.190
 it will be cool game on the other hand if 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.040
 you have the negative frame goes is very 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:38.579
 on the contrary 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:41.310
 then and that's how it is to get into the body and I 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.420
 I cried to you, I supported you and it's very 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.489
 Good to get on the court. 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:53.830
 so you start playing with your 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:57.010
 friends play their friends 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.510
 is that now it is tense is also tense 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:04.480
 table is tense no 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.210
 and that's it folks I won from 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.890
 game is advised you to play this mode 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:13.990
 game that increases the where's and writes cua 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.770
 click and I liked it and that's it folks 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.770
 said
