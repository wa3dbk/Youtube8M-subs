him had he done that in the middle of

him had he done that in the middle of
the<00:02:19.070> season<00:02:19.370> there<00:02:19.880> would<00:02:20.000> be<00:02:20.030> absolutely

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
the season there would be absolutely

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.560 
the season there would be absolutely
zero<00:02:21.260> chance<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.800> them<00:02:21.980> retaining<00:02:22.520> Chris<00:02:23.300> Bosh

long<00:02:23.960> term<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.610> why<00:02:25.850> Colangelo<00:02:26.630> never

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
long term so that is why Colangelo never

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.170 
long term so that is why Colangelo never
did<00:02:27.140> do<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.410> agree<00:02:27.560> with<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:28.040> maybe<00:02:28.280> not<00:02:28.610> if

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
did do I agree with it maybe not if

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.090 
did do I agree with it maybe not if
someone<00:02:29.600> does<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.200> firm<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.800> belief

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
someone does have that firm of a belief

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.440 
someone does have that firm of a belief
in<00:02:31.250> someone<00:02:31.550> who<00:02:31.640> probably<00:02:31.850> shouldn't<00:02:32.300> call

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
in someone who probably shouldn't call

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.120 
in someone who probably shouldn't call
him<00:02:32.540> up<00:02:32.690> right<00:02:32.840> away<00:02:32.990> so<00:02:33.110> I'll<00:02:33.320> give<00:02:33.530> he<00:02:33.980> do<00:02:34.100> a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
him up right away so I'll give he do a

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.700 
him up right away so I'll give he do a
nice<00:02:34.340> little<00:02:34.370> round<00:02:35.270> of<00:02:35.420> applause<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:36.200> making

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
nice little round of applause for making

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.950 
nice little round of applause for making
somewhat<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.190> an<00:02:37.280> astute<00:02:37.610> comment<00:02:38.120> now<00:02:38.690> for

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
somewhat of an astute comment now for

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.480 
somewhat of an astute comment now for
him<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.200> go<00:02:39.380> on<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.740> say<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.220> he's

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
him to go on and say that he's

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.980 
him to go on and say that he's
questioning<00:02:41.240> about<00:02:42.160> Bosh<00:02:43.160> quitting<00:02:43.760> I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
questioning about Bosh quitting I

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.330 
questioning about Bosh quitting I
somewhat<00:02:44.990> agree<00:02:45.320> with<00:02:45.470> Colangelo<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
somewhat agree with Colangelo in the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.980 
somewhat agree with Colangelo in the
sense<00:02:46.610> because<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.210> doctors<00:02:47.660> didn't

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
sense because if the doctors didn't

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.380 
sense because if the doctors didn't
clear<00:02:48.290> him<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.560> come<00:02:49.040> back<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.180> Raptors

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
clear him to come back and the Raptors

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.480 
clear him to come back and the Raptors
were<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.990> playoff<00:02:51.320> font<00:02:51.560> if<00:02:51.920> she<00:02:52.160> really

were in the playoff font if she really

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.970 
were in the playoff font if she really
wanted<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.180> bad<00:02:53.630> he<00:02:54.170> would<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.470> suited<00:02:54.740> up

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
wanted that bad he would have suited up

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.540 
wanted that bad he would have suited up

ruling cindy had to play because he's

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.470
