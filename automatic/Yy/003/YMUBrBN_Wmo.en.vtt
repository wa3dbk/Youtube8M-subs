00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you can do with him and he is just so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.850

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
bulky and it's just a perfect

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.370 
bulky and it's just a perfect
representation<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.850> rhino<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
representation of rhino kind of like a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.219 
representation of rhino kind of like a
scaled-down<00:02:02.009> version<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.780> diamond

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
scaled-down version of on the diamond

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.850 
scaled-down version of on the diamond
select<00:02:04.439> rhino<00:02:05.450> here<00:02:06.450> he<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:06.780> him<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.259> mean

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
select rhino here he is with him I mean

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.589 
select rhino here he is with him I mean
basically<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.489> same<00:02:08.700> thing<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.420> one

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
basically the same thing but this one

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.860 
basically the same thing but this one
has<00:02:09.750> more<00:02:09.929> articulation<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
has more articulation and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.660 
has more articulation and
uh<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.470> know<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.769> paints<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.190> little<00:02:13.519> bit

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
uh you know the paints a little bit

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.430 
uh you know the paints a little bit
different<00:02:14.000> between<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.510> two<00:02:14.659> but<00:02:14.840> synced<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
different between the two but synced a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.440 
different between the two but synced a
type<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.890> design<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.640> know<00:02:16.670> same<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.180> look

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
type of design you know same like look

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.170 
type of design you know same like look
and<00:02:17.629> everything<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:18.860> course<00:02:19.370> their<00:02:19.549> toes<00:02:19.849> are

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
and everything of course their toes are

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.059 
and everything of course their toes are
painted<00:02:20.569> differently<00:02:21.080> which<00:02:21.650> i<00:02:21.799> think<00:02:21.860> is

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
painted differently which i think is

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.320 
painted differently which i think is
interesting<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.670> don't<00:02:22.909> know<00:02:23.000> which<00:02:23.120> ones

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
interesting I don't know which ones

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.940 
interesting I don't know which ones
aren't<00:02:23.480> accurate<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:24.200> i<00:02:24.230> think<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
aren't accurate I i think that the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.039 
aren't accurate I i think that the
diamond<00:02:25.280> select<00:02:25.400> ones<00:02:25.700> more<00:02:25.819> accurate<00:02:26.299> but<00:02:26.870> i

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
diamond select ones more accurate but i

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.350 
diamond select ones more accurate but i
really<00:02:27.379> do<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.920> marvel<00:02:28.849> universe<00:02:28.879> one<00:02:29.329> I

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
really do like the marvel universe one I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.580 
really do like the marvel universe one I
don't<00:02:29.599> think<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.840> there's<00:02:30.019> any<00:02:30.230> problem

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
don't think that there's any problem

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.039 
don't think that there's any problem
with<00:02:30.650> how<00:02:30.799> they<00:02:30.980> did<00:02:31.220> uh<00:02:31.329> did<00:02:32.329> his<00:02:32.599> um<00:02:32.870> his

up<00:02:50.660> slightly<00:02:51.379> and<00:02:51.829> then<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.280> can<00:02:52.430> move<00:02:52.579> side

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
up slightly and then you can move side

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.509 
up slightly and then you can move side
to<00:02:52.910> side<00:02:53.090> but<00:02:53.989> it<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.200> on<00:02:54.530> such<00:02:54.799> you<00:02:55.160> know<00:02:55.280> just

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
to side but it is on such you know just

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.039 
to side but it is on such you know just
just<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.819> little<00:02:56.030> ball<00:02:56.150> joint<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.569> if<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.780> want

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
just a little ball joint so if you want

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.539 
just a little ball joint so if you want
you<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.379> actually<00:02:57.739> stretch<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.159> up<00:02:58.280> and

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
you can actually stretch it up and

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.699 
you can actually stretch it up and
almost<00:02:59.239> like<00:02:59.599> pop<00:02:59.840> it<00:02:59.989> off<00:03:00.049> from<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.560> can

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
almost like pop it off from and you can

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.080 
almost like pop it off from and you can
just<00:03:00.859> pop<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.159> off<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.459> then<00:03:01.489> just<00:03:01.760> put<00:03:01.909> it<00:03:02.000> on

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
just pop it off and then just put it on

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.210 
just pop it off and then just put it on
slightly<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.989> then<00:03:03.019> he'll<00:03:03.680> be<00:03:03.709> able<00:03:03.859> to<00:03:04.069> look

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
slightly and then he'll be able to look

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.699 
slightly and then he'll be able to look
up<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.700> then<00:03:04.909> go<00:03:05.180> sideways<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.750> stuff<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.290> it

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
up and then go sideways and stuff so it

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.099 
up and then go sideways and stuff so it
is<00:03:07.010> very<00:03:07.280> easy<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.609> manipulate<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.870> joint

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
is very easy to manipulate the the joint

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.960 
is very easy to manipulate the the joint
there<00:03:09.319> you've<00:03:09.829> got<00:03:10.010> ball<00:03:10.250> hen<00:03:10.489> shoulders

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
there you've got ball hen shoulders

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.559 
there you've got ball hen shoulders
hinge<00:03:11.690> swivel<00:03:12.970> elbows<00:03:13.970> which<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.269> great

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
hinge swivel elbows which is great

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.720 
hinge swivel elbows which is great
typically<00:03:15.349> these<00:03:15.500> big<00:03:15.769> figures<00:03:16.130> have<00:03:16.340> bicep

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
typically these big figures have bicep

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.849 
typically these big figures have bicep
swivels<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.389> because<00:03:18.019> their<00:03:18.139> biceps<00:03:18.560> are<00:03:18.680> so

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
swivels and because their biceps are so

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
this was a cool figure I mean it was

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.080 
this was a cool figure I mean it was
quite<00:04:31.560> bulky<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.280> they<00:04:32.610> had<00:04:32.790> an<00:04:32.880> interesting

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
quite bulky and they had an interesting

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.030 
quite bulky and they had an interesting
look<00:04:33.450> but<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.780> certainly<00:04:33.960> wasn't<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.470> classic

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
look but it certainly wasn't the classic

look but it certainly wasn't the classic
version<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.970> rhino<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.720> was<00:04:36.870> more<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.110> the

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
version of rhino it was more of the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.500 
version of rhino it was more of the
ultimate<00:04:37.740> version<00:04:37.950> on<00:04:38.280> which<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.030> so<00:04:39.180> cool<00:04:39.480> I

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
ultimate version on which is so cool I
