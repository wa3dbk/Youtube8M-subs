00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.619 
will then carry your save file over into
the<00:02:13.340> full<00:02:14.340> game<00:02:14.610> once<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.090> decide<00:02:15.450> to

the full game once you decide to
purchase<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.950> think<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> play<00:02:17.640> first<00:02:17.910> is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
purchase it I think the play first is

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.210 
purchase it I think the play first is
actually<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.510> relation<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> playing<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.890> trial

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
actually in relation to playing a trial

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.680 
actually in relation to playing a trial
of<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.640> game<00:02:20.819> see<00:02:21.420> if<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.599> like<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:23.069> then

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
of the game see if you like it and then

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.250 
of the game see if you like it and then
purchase<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:25.400> not<00:02:26.750> okay<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.780> think<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.110> gives

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
purchase or not okay I think that gives

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.940 
purchase or not okay I think that gives
