00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hi guys, how are you? All my blood, I hope. 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.970

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.000
 I'm coming here for another video today. 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:22.380
 teach the 6 how to make these blocks 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:57.239
 very practical range does not have much 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:59.870
 The secret is to do so I liked and help 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:08.330
 advertise my video and help me too 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:10.920
 so you take it with me then neither with me 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.850
 What the hell do you need? 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.250
 make this snowflake be precise 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.250
 from a template that template I'm using 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.979
 I voted for a paper card and paper 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.610
 contact over to him that fit smooth 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.930
 But you too may be doing 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.869
 this mold on the plate that like silverware 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.759
 also will serve and I think 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.950
 any surface that is that I 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.430
 I'm using this one and pass paper. 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.350
 contact it is very visible 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.280
 besides the mold we will be using 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.460
 also liquid soap any soap 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.460
 liquid 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:09.590
 scissors scissors white glue glue 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:15.830
 white vote also using glitter and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:18.890
 glitter no way you want to dare 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:27.410
 also online 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:33.200
 my grandmother will use brush brush will notice using 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:36.709
 hot glue hot glue and glue also okay 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.380
 We're the little stick in the gun. 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.660
 of hot glue depending on how much 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.829
 You 're going to need it. 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.030
 enough of this then you need both 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.380
 things 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:56.480
 to start with the mold 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:03:02.720
 you will get the liquid soap and apply 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:05.120
 a little a bit and this is not only 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.780
 a little droplet does not have to be much 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:15.950
 There you come, spread all over the place. 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.750
 outline of the drawing may fail like this 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.440
 all 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.440
 ae 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.700
 Then you 'll start applying here. 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.760
 passed on 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.549
 Then you will start to apply well. 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:45.319
 So we'll apply it on top. 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.319
 design todinho 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:59.420
 You will be filling is filling the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.420
 whole drawing with hot glue 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:27.740
 well after they 're done it's pretty easy to 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:33.720
 the withdrawal if you just let go here 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:45.240
 it goes and sunshine also easily goes 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:47.540
 pulling it loose releasing to 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.350
 stay like this 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:59.030
 Then you will see with the scissors and it will 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:59.030
 take the excesses you have here 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.580
 What gets done 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.409
 good 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:26.869
 After you've done that, you'll come with a 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:29.229
 bit of the line c takes one size 

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:37.909
 So you think the country is 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:44.649
 enough because there you get a 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:54.339
 a little bit of the glue and pass back here 

00:05:44.649 --> 00:06:00.759
 passed comes with the thread and finally puts 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:06:00.759
 to put yes 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:14.050

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:17.889
 stay here I've already separated here was already king 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:21.400

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:23.259
 the sauber peter moura that we will go 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:31.589

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:33.719
 glue and passing over the flock in 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:40.449
