 Hey, Stephanie with americanmuscle.com, this is my quick breakdown of Whiteline 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.140
 Mount transfer insert bushing is available for MT-82 6-speed that is 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.880
 Found in all 2011 Mustang GT to '14. 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.070
 Whiteline is a performance suspension company whose number one goal is to activate more 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.820
 Grip on your trip, thanks to products such as effect bars, link sets and watts, and other suspension 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.850
 the ingredients. It also specializes in the design and production of cutting edge edge edge technology, 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.539
 Thanks to artificial synthetic rubber material. I have used a few of Whiteline's products 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.020
 the past. In fact, if you want to see more detailed product crashes along with the auto project, 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.320
 Well, then you guys should know what to do now. Click the link below and sign up 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.930
 On our YouTube channel, if you have not already done so. 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.880
 Now, if you have a manual wolf, then chances are you may already run in some commonality 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.200
 Issues such as high rpm locking or locking during aggressive acquisition. This is due to 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.120
 Transfer mount stock, soft rubber bushing, allow for overload transfer 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.070
 Movement when the car is pushed hard or when you really try to pop the gears. 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.350
 This insert bushing from Whiteline eliminates excessive play by filling in small blanks, 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.060
 Enhanced site mounting, eliminating RPM issues completely. Fuss 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.180
 The same insert is made from Whiteline's signature synthetic synthetic rubber which is usually done great 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.170
 Work to reduce noise, vibration and roughness. I usually say, because in the case of this 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.590
 Bushing inserts, you may notice a little more noise inside the cabin. In fact, now 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.860
 It is a great time to return to the product page if you are not already there to find out what 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.750
 Some customers have to say about running this bushing insert into their own ride. 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.780
 As far as the installation goes, the site calls for two hours on this one, but a number of 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.250
 Our customers have stated that it only takes an hour or less. This is the installation that 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.130
 It is held under the car, so make sure our jack and jack stand on standby, or 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.579
 Lift if you are lucky enough to get to one. 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.630
 Of course, detailed installation instructions are available on the product page, and you can 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.920
 Always feel free to reach the Mustang Expert you must have any questions. if I were
