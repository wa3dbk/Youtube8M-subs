00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
got this weird firing mode the first

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.439 
got this weird firing mode the first
shot<00:00:20.039> will<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.430> fire<00:00:20.580> slowly<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.180> if<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.330> keep

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
that stuff like the blender get it's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.100 
that stuff like the blender get it's
just<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.280> type<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> scope<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
just not the type of scope that the the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
just not the type of scope that the the
trail<00:00:52.530> work<00:00:52.620> stuff<00:00:52.800> has<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.699> their<00:00:53.820> wonder

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
trail work stuff has for their wonder

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
trail work stuff has for their wonder
weapons<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.379> had<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> choice<00:00:55.770> between<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.160> ray

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
weapons if I had a choice between a ray

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.920 
weapons if I had a choice between a ray
gun<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.640> put<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.329> gun<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.780> definitely

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
gun and put this gun I would definitely

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.540 
gun and put this gun I would definitely
take<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> ray<00:00:58.440> gun<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.800> compared<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
take the ray gun but compared to this

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.860 
take the ray gun but compared to this
gun<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.879> all<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> other<00:01:00.210> guns<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
gun and all the other guns it is

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.180 
gun and all the other guns it is
actually<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> best<00:01:01.680> guns<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.070> there

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
actually one of the best guns in there

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.100 
actually one of the best guns in there
so<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.210> upgrade<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:03.960> actually

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
so if you do upgrade it you can actually

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.350 
so if you do upgrade it you can actually
up<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> level<00:01:05.100> 20<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.060> guns

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
up go to level 20 that for all your guns

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600 
up go to level 20 that for all your guns
and<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.990> did<00:01:07.290> upgraded<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> level<00:01:08.280> 4

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and I did upgraded to up to level 4

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700 
and I did upgraded to up to level 4
think<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.150> game<00:01:09.390> before<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.560> actually

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
think in this game before we actually

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.609 
think in this game before we actually
died<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.280> yeah<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> cauterizer<00:01:12.619> you

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
died but yeah that's the cauterizer you

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
died but yeah that's the cauterizer you
it's<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.549> random<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.090> wouldn't<00:01:15.600> try<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's it's just random I wouldn't try to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.030 
it's it's just random I wouldn't try to
look<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> box<00:01:16.409> because<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.770> can't<00:01:16.950> look

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
look at the box because you can't look

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
look at the box because you can't look
at<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> box<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.759> try<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.939> look<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
at the box and just try to look at it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.390 
at the box and just try to look at it
and<00:01:19.290> try<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> hit<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.950> when<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> thing

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and try to hit it right when the thing

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.950 
and try to hit it right when the thing
pops<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.970> wouldn't<00:01:21.240> do<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
pops up I wouldn't do that you have a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
pops up I wouldn't do that you have a
less<00:01:22.470> chance<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> getting<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.340> that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
less chance of it getting it at that

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.859 
less chance of it getting it at that
point<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.689> you're<00:01:24.780> gonna

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
point because you know that you're gonna

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.109 
point because you know that you're gonna
miss<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.400> keep<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> box<00:01:26.909> data

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
miss it so just keep it in the box data

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
miss it so just keep it in the box data
randomly<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> very<00:01:28.650> very<00:01:28.740> good<00:01:28.920> gun

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
randomly and it is a very very good gun

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.580 
randomly and it is a very very good gun
so<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:29.460> super<00:01:29.700> excited<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:30.119> these<00:01:30.270> kings<00:01:30.590> but

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
so I'm super excited for these kings but

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.530 
so I'm super excited for these kings but
you<00:01:31.979> also<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.700> thing<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> note<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
you also one thing to note is that you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.060 
you also one thing to note is that you
actually<00:01:33.689> anybody<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> bunch<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.009> people

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
actually anybody are a bunch of people

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.710 
actually anybody are a bunch of people
in<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> game<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.090> once<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.509> know

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
in the game can have it at once I know

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.300 
in the game can have it at once I know
two<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> us<00:01:37.079> had<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:37.439> once<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.979> don't

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
two of us had it at once so you don't

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.950 
two of us had it at once so you don't
have<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.880> only<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.659> person<00:01:39.900> in

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
have to have it so only one person in

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.359 
have to have it so only one person in
the<00:01:40.020> game<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.650> i<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.159> that's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the game can I have it so i think that's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.710 
the game can I have it so i think that's
