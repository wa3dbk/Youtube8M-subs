that but a lot of good people I've been
thinking<00:00:23.220> about<00:00:23.460> maybe<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.779> maybe<00:00:25.019> there

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
thinking about maybe just maybe there

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.259 
thinking about maybe just maybe there
might<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.650> some<00:00:26.070> sort<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.340> emerald<00:00:26.760> remake<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
might be some sort of emerald remake and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.970 
might be some sort of emerald remake and
we're<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> go<00:00:27.599> over<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:28.019> today<00:00:28.320> so

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
we're going to go over that today so

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.950 
we're going to go over that today so
let's<00:00:29.160> start<00:00:29.460> off<00:00:29.640> by<00:00:30.269> talking<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.779> how

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
let's start off by talking about how

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680 
let's start off by talking about how
they<00:00:31.260> might<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> remake<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
they might not do a remake and the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.209 
they might not do a remake and the
reason<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> why<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.500> might<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.980> do

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
reason as to why they might not do

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.400 
reason as to why they might not do
remake<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.480> previous<00:00:36.719> remakes

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
remake as with previous remakes

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.790 
remake as with previous remakes
heartgold<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.579> soulsilver<00:00:39.230> those<00:00:40.230> did<00:00:40.590> not

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
heartgold and soulsilver those did not

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.760 
heartgold and soulsilver those did not
obviously<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> crystal<00:00:42.059> remake<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:43.079> who

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
obviously have a crystal remake but who

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.529 
obviously have a crystal remake but who
knows<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.309> might<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.550> not<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.360> that

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
knows we might just not know about that

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.680 
knows we might just not know about that
and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:46.590> also<00:00:47.090> let's<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.149> talk<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.539> like

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and then also let's just talk about like

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990 
and then also let's just talk about like
I<00:00:49.140> guess<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.860> was<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> fire<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
I guess there was a fire in and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700 
I guess there was a fire in and
leafgreen<00:00:51.210> remake<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.079> never<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> blue

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
leafgreen remake there is never a blue

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
leafgreen remake there is never a blue
remake<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.489> yellow<00:00:53.789> remake<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.510> those

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
remake or yellow remake but those

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.350 
remake or yellow remake but those
necessarily<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:56.250> sequels<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.210> guess

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
necessarily want like sequels I guess

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.939 
necessarily want like sequels I guess
you<00:00:57.480> could<00:00:57.600> say<00:00:57.840> they're<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.770> my<00:00:58.859> other

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you could say they're just like my other

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.150 
you could say they're just like my other
versions<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> game<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.410> honestly<00:01:01.410> we'll

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
versions of the game so honestly we'll

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009 
versions of the game so honestly we'll
have<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> figure<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.820> later<00:01:02.969> too<00:01:03.420> that's

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
have to figure that out later too that's

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
have to figure that out later too that's
really<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.439> much<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.010> got<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.580> why<00:01:05.760> there

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
really as much as I got as to why there

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580 
really as much as I got as to why there
wouldn't<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.510> its<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:06.930> bold<00:01:07.229> statement

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
wouldn't be in its pretty bold statement

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
wouldn't be in its pretty bold statement

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
they could just because it did so well

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.309 
they could just because it did so well
with<00:02:10.349> ruby<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.099> sapphire<00:02:11.220> though

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
with ruby and sapphire though

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.020 
with ruby and sapphire though
or<00:02:12.530> might<00:02:12.980> want<00:02:13.219> to<00:02:13.310> be<00:02:13.519> able<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.760> do<00:02:13.909> that

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
or might want to be able to do that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.929 
or might want to be able to do that
again<00:02:14.329> now<00:02:14.810> if<00:02:15.049> they<00:02:15.200> were<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.439> do<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.670> remake<00:02:16.670> it

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
again now if they were to do a remake it

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.309 
again now if they were to do a remake it
definitely<00:02:17.480> would<00:02:17.749> not<00:02:18.549> be<00:02:19.549> right<00:02:19.879> after

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
definitely would not be right after

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.599 
definitely would not be right after
Omega<00:02:21.319> Ruby<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.739> alpha<00:02:21.859> sapphire<00:02:22.040> I

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire I

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.949 
Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire I
definitely<00:02:23.150> think<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.569> there<00:02:23.840> would<00:02:23.930> be

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
definitely think that there would be

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.140 
definitely think that there would be
some<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.409> the<00:02:24.499> game<00:02:24.709> like<00:02:25.280> Pokemon<00:02:25.760> Z<00:02:25.969> or

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
some of the game like Pokemon Z or

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.819 
some of the game like Pokemon Z or
something<00:02:26.450> like<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:27.079> then<00:02:27.439> you<00:02:27.620> get

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
something like that and then you get

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.039 
something like that and then you get
into<00:02:27.980> emerald<00:02:28.760> because<00:02:29.269> now<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:29.689> different

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
into emerald because now it's different

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.289 
into emerald because now it's different
now<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.230> storyline<00:02:30.799> uptick<00:02:31.159> appears<00:02:32.120> to

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
now the storyline uptick appears to

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.899 
now the storyline uptick appears to
change<00:02:32.680> especially<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:34.069> know<00:02:34.189> them<00:02:34.579> adding

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
change especially you know them adding

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.479 
change especially you know them adding

emerald<00:02:41.689> remake<00:02:42.049> Rose<00:02:42.590> they<00:02:42.739> might<00:02:42.919> have<00:02:43.010> hit

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
emerald remake Rose they might have hit

emerald and stuff like that but anyways

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.390 
emerald and stuff like that but anyways
what<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.090> also<00:02:50.359> think<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:51.019> that<00:02:51.079> with<00:02:52.040> along<00:02:52.370> a

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
what I also think is that with along a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.909 
what I also think is that with along a
possible<00:02:53.060> new<00:02:53.209> storyline<00:02:53.870> got<00:02:54.469> new<00:02:54.650> mega

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
possible new storyline got new mega

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.349 
possible new storyline got new mega
evolutions<00:02:55.549> now<00:02:55.669> so<00:02:55.849> they're<00:02:56.060> going<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.239> be<00:02:56.329> a

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
evolutions now so they're going to be a

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.679 
evolutions now so they're going to be a
lot<00:02:56.659> of<00:02:56.719> changes<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.849> of<00:02:58.849> course<00:02:59.180> pokemon

omega ruby and alpha sapphire a lot of
changes<00:03:02.449> more<00:03:03.439> changes<00:03:03.949> than<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.280> was<00:03:04.549> from

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879

gold and silver charcoal and soul silver

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.220 
gold and silver charcoal and soul silver
and<00:03:07.790> it's<00:03:08.120> going<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.329> be<00:03:08.419> really<00:03:08.719> interesting

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
and it's going to be really interesting

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.619 
and it's going to be really interesting
to<00:03:09.260> see<00:03:09.469> how<00:03:09.560> they<00:03:09.739> play<00:03:09.919> those<00:03:10.189> out<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.730> then

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
to see how they play those out and then

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.240 
to see how they play those out and then
my<00:03:11.780> other<00:03:11.930> reason<00:03:12.349> as<00:03:12.409> to<00:03:12.500> why<00:03:12.709> they<00:03:12.919> might<00:03:13.069> do

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
my other reason as to why they might do

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.550 
my other reason as to why they might do
a<00:03:13.280> remake<00:03:13.639> is<00:03:13.849> they've<00:03:14.329> never<00:03:14.780> done<00:03:15.139> this<00:03:15.349> of

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
a remake is they've never done this of

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.679 
a remake is they've never done this of
course<00:03:15.590> before<00:03:15.949> they<00:03:16.699> have<00:03:16.849> never<00:03:17.090> done<00:03:17.629> a

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
course before they have never done a

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.569 
course before they have never done a
remake<00:03:18.109> and<00:03:18.290> they'd<00:03:18.379> be<00:03:18.409> like<00:03:18.590> well<00:03:19.069> this<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.549> a

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
remake and they'd be like well this is a

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.819 
remake and they'd be like well this is a
really<00:03:20.030> high<00:03:20.239> selling<00:03:20.540> game<00:03:20.870> why<00:03:21.530> don't<00:03:21.739> we

try<00:03:22.069> it<00:03:22.189> out<00:03:22.370> why<00:03:22.699> don't<00:03:22.879> we<00:03:23.000> see<00:03:23.269> where<00:03:23.509> this

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
try it out why don't we see where this

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.780 
try it out why don't we see where this
takes<00:03:23.689> us<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:24.409> obviously<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.549> could<00:03:25.639> be<00:03:25.759> a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
takes us and obviously it could be a

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.999 
takes us and obviously it could be a
pretty<00:03:26.150> good<00:03:26.359> investment<00:03:26.479> for<00:03:26.840> them<00:03:27.079> it's

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.009 
pretty good investment for them it's

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.099 
pretty good investment for them it's
very<00:03:28.370> risky<00:03:28.669> of<00:03:29.090> course<00:03:29.479> because<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.900> don't

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
very risky of course because you don't

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.330 
very risky of course because you don't
know<00:03:30.259> how<00:03:30.470> well<00:03:30.709> it's<00:03:30.739> going<00:03:30.949> to<00:03:31.040> sell<00:03:31.189> because

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
know how well it's going to sell because

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.949 
know how well it's going to sell because
obviously<00:03:31.729> they've<00:03:32.180> never<00:03:32.449> done<00:03:32.659> anything

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
obviously they've never done anything

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.619 
obviously they've never done anything
like<00:03:33.109> this<00:03:33.409> before<00:03:33.620> ever<00:03:34.239> they've<00:03:35.239> never<00:03:35.419> done

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
like this before ever they've never done

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.740 
like this before ever they've never done
a<00:03:36.129> recycle<00:03:37.129> or<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.489> remake<00:03:37.849> of<00:03:37.879> a<00:03:38.090> sequel<00:03:38.269> before

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
a recycle or a remake of a sequel before

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.050 
a recycle or a remake of a sequel before
so<00:03:39.349> they'll<00:03:39.859> be<00:03:40.040> really<00:03:40.370> interesting<00:03:40.819> to<00:03:40.849> see

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
so they'll be really interesting to see

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.449 
so they'll be really interesting to see
what<00:03:41.180> they<00:03:41.299> try<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.569> do<00:03:41.780> with<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.049> um<00:03:42.259> in<00:03:42.949> my

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
what they try and do with this um in my

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.050 
what they try and do with this um in my
general<00:03:44.209> conclusion<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.290> think<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:46.759> they're

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
general conclusion I think that they're

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.039 
general conclusion I think that they're
probably<00:03:47.650> might<00:03:48.650> not<00:03:48.949> be<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.489> remake<00:03:50.060> but<00:03:50.870> I

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
probably might not be a remake but I

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.710 
probably might not be a remake but I
don't<00:03:51.259> know<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:52.099> reason<00:03:52.489> as<00:03:52.579> to<00:03:52.609> why<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.299> just

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
don't know the reason as to why is just

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.469 
don't know the reason as to why is just
because<00:03:54.139> I<00:03:54.470> feel<00:03:54.560> like<00:03:55.189> that<00:03:55.819> just<00:03:56.120> with<00:03:56.329> the

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:56.479 
because I feel like that just with the

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.659 
because I feel like that just with the
order<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.109> like<00:03:57.379> you<00:03:57.590> know<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.129> dates<00:03:58.400> of<00:03:58.549> the

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
order and like you know the dates of the

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.030 
order and like you know the dates of the
games<00:03:58.939> they<00:03:59.299> wouldn't<00:03:59.810> really<00:04:00.290> find<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.799> good

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
games they wouldn't really find a good

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.990 
games they wouldn't really find a good
place<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.609> put<00:04:01.819> it<00:04:01.849> out<00:04:02.060> there<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.620> just

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
place to put it out there and just

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.969 
place to put it out there and just
because<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.659> storyline<00:04:06.319> kind<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.799> seems

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:06.979 
because that the storyline kind of seems

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.619 
because that the storyline kind of seems
to<00:04:07.040> be<00:04:07.189> taken<00:04:07.519> from<00:04:07.609> emerald<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.299> put<00:04:08.509> into

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
to be taken from emerald and put into

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.449 
to be taken from emerald and put into
Omega<00:04:08.930> Ruby<00:04:09.169> and<00:04:09.409> alpha<00:04:09.469> sapphire<00:04:09.650> now

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire now

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.699 
Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire now
granted<00:04:10.849> we<00:04:10.969> have<00:04:11.090> seen<00:04:11.299> very<00:04:11.599> limited<00:04:12.199> images

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
granted we have seen very limited images

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.909 
granted we have seen very limited images
and<00:04:13.009> video<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.879> that<00:04:14.209> could<00:04:14.359> easily<00:04:14.629> change<00:04:14.919> or

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
and video so that could easily change or

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.099 
and video so that could easily change or
just<00:04:16.099> you<00:04:16.280> know<00:04:16.430> be<00:04:16.940> something<00:04:17.329> different<00:04:17.719> we

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
just you know be something different we

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.870 
just you know be something different we
don't<00:04:18.259> know<00:04:18.440> that<00:04:18.650> right<00:04:18.829> now<00:04:18.979> but<00:04:19.579> what<00:04:19.789> I'm

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
don't know that right now but what I'm

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.050 
don't know that right now but what I'm
trying<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:20.150> say<00:04:20.239> here<00:04:20.630> is<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:21.079> that<00:04:21.650> maybe<00:04:22.159> just

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
trying to say here is is that maybe just

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.310 
trying to say here is is that maybe just
because<00:04:23.360> they're<00:04:23.539> trying<00:04:23.719> to<00:04:23.750> implement<00:04:24.080> that

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
because they're trying to implement that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.510 
because they're trying to implement that
storyline<00:04:24.710> from<00:04:24.949> emerald

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
storyline from emerald

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.920 
storyline from emerald
to<00:04:25.639> ruby<00:04:25.879> and<00:04:26.000> sapphire<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.660> they're<00:04:26.810> not

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
to ruby and sapphire that they're not

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.480 
to ruby and sapphire that they're not
going<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.110> want<00:04:27.199> to<00:04:27.440> want<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:28.039> do<00:04:28.190> that<00:04:28.310> again

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
going to want to want to do that again

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.629 
going to want to want to do that again
and<00:04:28.940> like<00:04:29.539> a<00:04:29.569> theta<00:04:29.990> or<00:04:30.319> a<00:04:30.379> Zetas<00:04:30.740> or<00:04:31.009> Omicron

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
and like a theta or a Zetas or Omicron

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.369 
and like a theta or a Zetas or Omicron
emerald<00:04:32.120> they'll<00:04:32.300> just<00:04:32.449> want<00:04:32.660> to<00:04:32.780> keep<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.199> in

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:33.379 
emerald they'll just want to keep it in

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.260 
emerald they'll just want to keep it in
omega<00:04:33.889> ruby<00:04:34.099> and<00:04:34.280> alpha<00:04:34.370> sapphire<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:35.150> then

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
omega ruby and alpha sapphire and then

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.029 
omega ruby and alpha sapphire and then
move<00:04:35.449> on<00:04:35.599> to<00:04:35.629> the<00:04:35.870> next<00:04:35.900> generation<00:04:36.289> of<00:04:36.740> games

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
move on to the next generation of games

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.369 
move on to the next generation of games
which<00:04:37.699> is<00:04:37.849> most<00:04:38.120> likely<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.720> course<00:04:38.960> going<00:04:39.289> to

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:39.379 
which is most likely of course going to

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.040 
which is most likely of course going to
be<00:04:39.500> Pokemon<00:04:39.919> Z<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:40.849> can't<00:04:41.599> wait<00:04:41.690> for<00:04:41.930> that

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
be Pokemon Z so can't wait for that

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.570 
be Pokemon Z so can't wait for that
we'll<00:04:42.500> have<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.680> see<00:04:42.770> what<00:04:42.949> happens<00:04:43.250> with<00:04:43.370> all
