00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.590
 Yes example of this time 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:16.289
 Work is this Gibson Les Paul Custom Nuts 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.330
 It's here 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.580
 No flower 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.580
 That maker is making 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.380
 Say a medium training is improved 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.070
 And let's instead of the what and 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.070
 It will be 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.840
 Yes Well nut exchange So Well yeah yeah now Kedomo I do not go unless remove the natto 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:47.530
 It looks like the side of natto 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:53.440
 Painted neck after painting you 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:01:00.039
 It is a playing guitar, so this side of the rat is painted all over continuously 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:03.670
 If you remove the nut carelessly as it is, you will find it along with the natto which is really so. 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:07.400
 There is a danger that all the paint around can be taken 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:14.210
 Before I remove natto this painted that 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.400
 Toka or scratched off to leave at the Well something like that anti-anti-say was that a thin needle 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.140
 Or Oh 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.580
 I think it would be fine to use such a kind of cutter blade . 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 Zodiac ginger 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.730
 So that it does not come with together 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:35.430
 It is important to keep in mind 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:41.240
 I also like the painting on the natto on the cheek side of the head side, so I cut off the painting here 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.240
 It's dangerous if you don't know it, so I'll cut it here too 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.149
 Yes 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.619
 I will remove a good nut at 8 but firstly the school affixing manners to the 4th meeting end of that night 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.390
 Because it is 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.659
 This bond 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 I want to peel off 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.750
 That's too much of this to come 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:11.039
 Because I may break this side 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:12.940
 I got to to feel about peel off the adhesive endured was Idei of Totsuka not too much this strength 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.690
 This guitar is 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:21.720
 Because natto is in the form of relatively high and deep ditch 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.350
 If anything, for a Les Paul guitar 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.880
 It will be difficult to remove natto 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.020
 Yes yeah 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.990
 If you come to a place like this, it's such an end nipper 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.170
 Like this 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.310
 So add a nut 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.310
 I will remove 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.020
 But imposes that've been with that I feel somewhat like this adhesive This is another unavoidable 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.490
 Since there is no 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.950
 We were able to build in Ekore 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:00.349
 Oh Once out a minimum of natto 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:04.270
 It is a place where that cat paint's public is a little freakish, or the paint remains here 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:08.670
 I will clean up those things 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.380
 It is a dedicated meeting to clean that summer ditch 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.510
 Cheapest 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.569
 This is a bit rough eyes here but this is a bit thin 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.690
 It is said that 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.090
 Going from the near side to the back so as not to peel off the paint 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.010
 ok comes with 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.010
 So here is the opposite 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.970
 Something 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.420
 And 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.420
 New 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.150
 If it is a gate here, I use such a profile file etc. 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.260
 Lighten that 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.689
 Cormorant and I'll finish 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:57.670
 There is also a case where adhesive remains at the end of this No. 4 like this 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.670
 Is such a scraper 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.209
 It will take a 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.209
 It's and adhesive not a head 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.620
 It is the groove of the Do 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:20.200
 It cleaning has been completed but that new 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.470
 A little water if I try to put the natto of the burner 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:29.420
 Normal is narrow and does not enter 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.420
 So now it's a little now I have to cut this part 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.560
 Scrape 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.470
 To say 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.569
 It is the eco of dependency by shaved it is here to 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.920
 Es cut 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:49.490
 Now enter 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:54.169
 Though it is this height to the depth of the groove of air and a child 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.199
 Properly because we always want with it that natto is on the bottom surface of the water 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.920
 It is here that subtly after all this 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:03.220
 A gap under the ledge portion 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:08.750
 It seems that it is ideal to be slightly 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:10.569
 There is a gap where the hair just enters 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.919
 Yes and 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.669
 As it is, it is just sold for Gibson. 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:21.459
 But 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:23.820
 a little from it is slightly wider towards the natto is the width to the neck in a state of matches in the middle a 

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:28.850
 Because it has run out 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.850
 We will cut at both ends is also hey rasp 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.990
 It is against the loss to the whole that goes to that size 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:47.680
 D When finished'll keep neta 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.680
 I firmly do this corner chamfering 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:06:00.810
 Yes yeah yeah everything is not all I finished processing 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:06.900
 Glue 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:12.930
 It is possible to use something like instant glue, so it is best for natto at that point . 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:15.780
 I decided to the center firmly and that adhesive from this gap 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.220
 In the form of pouring a little 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.220
 Adhesion will be good 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:27.300
 It seems that the source melting groove of this thing is from the beginning to the natto 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.400
 a 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.790
 It is cut off 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:37.800
 Well, such a groove is really the width of the neck 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:39.389
 It is something that must be made according to that, but also this is for Gibson and 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.969
 The groove is from the beginning by saying 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:45.900
 a 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:49.190
 Because it is cut at an equal interval I think I would like to use to take advantage of this groove 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:52.120
 Well , because installation was completed once 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:56.830
 I will put a string here 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:59.190
 In the case of Methone I think it would be good to put a defense first on the piece 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.190
 I will 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:08.280
 Yes I tried to put a string for the time being , but in fact it is in this groove, and the matter is healed 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:13.650
 It is also understood also to see what anti Well I'd enter 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:17.620
 Of course, I suppress the ad, I see this gap, but clearly that still 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:22.000
 The height of the reduction is shallow and the groove is shallow 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:27.220
 The height of the phantom is destruction, as it is 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.660
 Even if you put on natto that the intonation is improved, this is not good for sale, so the depth of the ditch 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.660
 We continue to the future challenge
