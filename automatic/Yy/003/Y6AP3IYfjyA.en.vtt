00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.170
 excellent widgets for your device 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.869

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:16.420
 widget from s 3 and s 4 like 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:19.120
 can see it's good that they will need to 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.740
 this simply download a link 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.020

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.829
 well once once downloaded both 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.039
 what they are going to have to do is go open 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.039
 the application 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.280
 nothing is open as I said you will have to 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.219
 download the link you will find it is 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.489

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.140
 widget stress and s4 and you 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.300
 they will choose the one they like most are in this 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.510
 case I will choose for example the dlc 3 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.829
 what am I going to do for this, I am going to give 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.480
 options 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:03.059
 open open a sip 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.059
 and choose the widget for example 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.530

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.250

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.500
 here I have 34 and mayor lc3 I will select 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.890
 and I will simply give him to replace 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.200
 because that I already have it selected 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.430
 once you finish importing the skin 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.740
 it will simply exit the application 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:36.040

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.920
