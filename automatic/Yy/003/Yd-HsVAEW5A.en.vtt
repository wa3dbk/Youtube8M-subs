slides<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:24.000> basically<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> Python<00:02:25.379> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
slides it's basically the Python the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.759 
slides it's basically the Python the
damn<00:02:25.650> plane<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.430> based<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.329> four<00:02:27.689> notes<00:02:27.930> with

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
damn plane is based on four notes with

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:35.869 
damn plane is based on four notes with
slides<00:02:29.129> in<00:02:29.310> between<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.359> it's<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:31.230> subway<00:02:34.879> it's

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
slides in between so it's a subway it's

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.300 
slides in between so it's a subway it's
biscuit<00:02:36.269> is<00:02:36.450> repeating<00:02:37.260> all<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.950> way<00:02:38.069> through

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
biscuit is repeating all the way through

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.369 
biscuit is repeating all the way through
but<00:02:38.579> then<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:39.090> also<00:02:39.299> add<00:02:39.569> some<00:02:39.780> passing<00:02:40.139> tones

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
but then I also add some passing tones

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.610 
but then I also add some passing tones
and<00:02:41.030> what<00:02:42.030> I'm<00:02:42.120> Eddie<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.569> flat<00:02:43.139> file<00:02:43.379> in<00:02:43.560> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
and what I'm Eddie is a flat file in the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.300 
and what I'm Eddie is a flat file in the
flat<00:02:43.859> 9<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:45.120> skills<00:02:45.569> so<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:46.409> adds<00:02:46.709> like

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
flat 9 of the skills so it adds like

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.220 
flat 9 of the skills so it adds like
this<00:02:47.579> stuff<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.540> little<00:02:48.569> bit<00:02:48.900> like<00:02:49.079> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
this stuff that's a little bit like a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:03:02.260 
this stuff that's a little bit like a
bluesy<00:02:49.739> in<00:02:49.950> Jersey

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:19.860 

and<00:03:03.560> here<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.710> play<00:03:05.070> slower

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.840 

in<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:20.990> example<00:03:21.170> I'm<00:03:21.830> playing<00:03:22.100> a<00:03:22.250> mix

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
in this example I'm playing a mix

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.000 
in this example I'm playing a mix
between<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.690> fridge<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.200> diamond<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.770> be

diminished whole half and all ultimately

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.420 
diminished whole half and all ultimately
came<00:03:30.010> 16<00:03:31.010> notes<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.690> i'm<00:03:32.690> mixing<00:03:33.350> groups<00:03:34.160> of
