00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.149 

so<00:01:53.460> we're<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.820> mail<00:01:53.940> him<00:01:54.090> now

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.550 

this<00:01:58.729> card<00:01:59.060> basically<00:01:59.450> this<00:02:00.020> card<00:02:00.289> cannot

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
this card basically this card cannot

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.529 
this card basically this card cannot
deal<00:02:00.740> any<00:02:00.920> damage<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:01.399> me<00:02:01.490> on<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.670> 20<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.420> it

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
deal any damage to me on a 20 and it

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.160 
deal any damage to me on a 20 and it
doesn't<00:02:02.780> have<00:02:02.869> in<00:02:03.049> fact

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
doesn't have in fact

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:14.660 
doesn't have in fact
wow<00:02:05.799> that<00:02:06.100> was<00:02:06.280> awesome

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.010 

probably<00:02:15.360> should<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.510> put<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.690> counter<00:02:15.930> on

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
probably should have put a counter on

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.500 
probably should have put a counter on
this<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.380> don't<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.590> it'll<00:02:16.770> matter

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
this but I don't think it'll matter

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.650 
this but I don't think it'll matter
tumble<00:02:18.510> magnet<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:18.989> this<00:02:19.590> thing

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.590 

and<00:02:23.780> okay

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.780 

and<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:27.260> have<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.590> Sphinx<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.340> can<00:02:28.520> give<00:02:28.640> it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and I have the Sphinx and I can give it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
and I have the Sphinx and I can give it
metal<00:02:29.090> craft<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:31.130> has<00:02:31.280> metal<00:02:31.640> craft

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.390 

so<00:02:37.410> we<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.620> block<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.280> bounce<00:02:38.640> itself<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
so we can block and bounce itself and I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.979 
so we can block and bounce itself and I
have<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.550> glint<00:02:41.790> hawk<00:02:41.910> idol<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.660> turn<00:02:42.870> it

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
have a glint hawk idol and I can turn it

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:58.180 
have a glint hawk idol and I can turn it
into<00:02:43.140> an<00:02:43.800> idol

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.980 

I<00:02:58.280> should<00:02:58.940> probably<00:02:59.510> have<00:03:00.080> this<00:03:00.260> game

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:16.720 

somehow

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.940 

yeah<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.540> got<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.810> sweet<00:03:18.700> grind<00:03:19.700> clock

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.800 

I<00:03:24.069> was<00:03:24.700> kind<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.000> weird

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
I was kind of weird

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.250 
I was kind of weird
alright<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.239> this<00:03:29.239> just<00:03:29.420> won<00:03:29.630> me<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.780> game<00:03:29.900> but

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
alright so this just won me the game but

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.740 
alright so this just won me the game but
it<00:03:30.380> probably<00:03:30.860> sucks<00:03:31.370> against<00:03:32.030> him<00:03:32.209> which<00:03:32.720> is

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
it probably sucks against him which is

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.860 
it probably sucks against him which is
kind<00:03:33.020> of<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.170> weird<00:03:33.349> thing<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.590> say<00:03:34.720> we<00:03:35.720> need

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
kind of a weird thing to say we need

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.360 
kind of a weird thing to say we need
this<00:03:36.260> is<00:03:36.470> gone
