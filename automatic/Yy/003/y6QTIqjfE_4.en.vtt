actually one of it out but it looks like
it's<00:05:03.300> about<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.539> same<00:05:03.720> length<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.530> which<00:05:04.680> is

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
it's about the same length so which is

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:14.180 
it's about the same length so which is
pretty<00:05:04.979> good<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.430> gave<00:05:06.360> me<00:05:06.479> these<00:05:09.199> twelve<00:05:13.190> but
