00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
and now I'm starting to run commit

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.460

trying<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:28.480> make<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.690> play<00:03:29.049> we<00:03:29.230> got<00:03:29.380> to

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
trying to just make a play we got to

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.350 
trying to just make a play we got to
force<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.769> turnover<00:03:29.950> we're<00:03:30.459> done<00:03:30.670> with<00:03:30.880> the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
force a turnover we're done with the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.910 
force a turnover we're done with the
ends<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.810> fine<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.170> Brandon<00:03:32.470> Marshall<00:03:32.799> he

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
ends of fine and Brandon Marshall he

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.100 
ends of fine and Brandon Marshall he
ends<00:03:33.160> up<00:03:33.220> diving<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.910> sliding<00:03:34.480> out<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.630> bounds

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
ends up diving and sliding out of bounds

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.840 
ends up diving and sliding out of bounds
so<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.769> would<00:03:35.890> give<00:03:35.920> us<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.280> chance<00:03:36.310> with<00:03:36.760> the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
so that would give us a chance with the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.030 
so that would give us a chance with the
ball<00:03:37.030> he<00:03:37.329> ends<00:03:37.510> up<00:03:37.570> kicking<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.930> field<00:03:38.110> goal<00:03:38.260> we

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
ball he ends up kicking a field goal we

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.310 
ball he ends up kicking a field goal we
had<00:03:39.160> seven<00:03:39.430> seconds<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:39.940> work<00:03:40.120> with<00:03:40.329> so<00:03:41.109> I'm

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
had seven seconds to work with so I'm

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.229 
had seven seconds to work with so I'm
looking<00:03:41.590> deep<00:03:42.040> for<00:03:42.310> Randy<00:03:42.609> Moss<00:03:42.790> I'm<00:03:43.000> doing<00:03:43.209> a

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
looking deep for Randy Moss I'm doing a

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.970 
looking deep for Randy Moss I'm doing a
bunch<00:03:43.420> of<00:03:43.480> audibles<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.380> end<00:03:44.620> up<00:03:44.739> being<00:03:44.920> a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
bunch of audibles this end up being a

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.920 
bunch of audibles this end up being a
play-action<00:03:45.430> I'd<00:03:45.760> even<00:03:46.030> realize<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.570> almost

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
play-action I'd even realize that almost

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.470 
play-action I'd even realize that almost
cost<00:03:47.230> me<00:03:47.470> but<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.310> can<00:03:48.459> see<00:03:48.609> Randy<00:03:49.030> Moss<00:03:49.209> he's

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
cost me but you can see Randy Moss he's

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.449 
cost me but you can see Randy Moss he's
playing<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.840> safety<00:03:50.320> he's<00:03:50.530> got<00:03:50.739> his<00:03:50.890> man<00:03:51.100> beat

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
playing the safety he's got his man beat

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.599 
playing the safety he's got his man beat
he<00:03:52.000> deflects<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.750> but<00:03:52.959> Randy<00:03:53.410> Moss<00:03:53.650> still<00:03:54.070> ends

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
he deflects it but Randy Moss still ends

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.569 
he deflects it but Randy Moss still ends
up<00:03:54.670> dropping<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.359> rebound<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.290> we<00:03:57.040> end<00:03:57.250> up

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
up dropping the rebound and we end up

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.130 
up dropping the rebound and we end up
losing<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.120> game<00:03:58.359> I<00:03:58.600> don't<00:03:58.810> know<00:03:58.870> how<00:03:59.109> he

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
losing the game I don't know how he

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.949 
losing the game I don't know how he
dropped<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.739> oh<00:04:00.100> my<00:04:01.090> goodness<00:04:01.329> we<00:04:01.660> had<00:04:01.870> to

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
dropped that oh my goodness we had to

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.509 
dropped that oh my goodness we had to
beat<00:04:02.200> drew<00:04:02.500> brees<00:04:02.829> that's<00:04:03.100> probably<00:04:03.400> his

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
beat drew brees that's probably his

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.910 
beat drew brees that's probably his
downfall<00:04:03.760> he<00:04:04.660> sometimes<00:04:05.140> under<00:04:05.620> throws

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
downfall he sometimes under throws

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.680 
downfall he sometimes under throws
receivers<00:04:06.579> but<00:04:06.790> we<00:04:06.850> end<00:04:07.060> up<00:04:07.180> losing<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.510> game

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
receivers but we end up losing the game

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.800 
receivers but we end up losing the game
24<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.410> 21<00:04:08.709> but<00:04:09.040> still<00:04:09.280> not<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.579> bad<00:04:09.940> game<00:04:10.209> just

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
24 to 21 but still not a bad game just

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.330 
24 to 21 but still not a bad game just
trying<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.140> make<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.380> as<00:04:11.500> entertaining<00:04:12.130> as

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
trying to make it as entertaining as

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.640 
trying to make it as entertaining as
possible<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.239> hopefully<00:04:13.840> that's<00:04:14.350> what<00:04:14.560> it

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
possible and hopefully that's what it

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.560 
possible and hopefully that's what it
was<00:04:14.859> I'm<00:04:15.459> not<00:04:15.700> really<00:04:15.820> too<00:04:16.090> concerned<00:04:16.120> about

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
was I'm not really too concerned about

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.599 
was I'm not really too concerned about
when<00:04:16.900> you're<00:04:17.079> losing<00:04:17.530> but<00:04:18.010> once<00:04:18.280> we<00:04:18.430> get<00:04:18.489> the

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
when you're losing but once we get the

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:19.860 
when you're losing but once we get the
playoffs<00:04:18.970> then<00:04:19.209> I'm<00:04:19.329> definitely<00:04:19.479> concerned

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
playoffs then I'm definitely concerned

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.599 
playoffs then I'm definitely concerned
about<00:04:20.079> winning<00:04:20.349> so<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:20.620> can<00:04:20.739> see<00:04:20.950> he<00:04:21.489> had

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
about winning so you can see he had

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.950 
about winning so you can see he had
about<00:04:21.820> 330<00:04:22.570> yards<00:04:22.659> offense<00:04:23.050> i<00:04:23.500> had<00:04:23.590> about

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
about 330 yards offense i had about

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.650 
about 330 yards offense i had about
25<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:24.889> definitely<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.580> game<00:04:26.150> where<00:04:26.360> we<00:04:26.449> each

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
25 so definitely a game where we each

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.659 
25 so definitely a game where we each
move<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.139> ball<00:04:27.319> up<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:27.919> down<00:04:28.069> the<00:04:28.220> field<00:04:28.430> and

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
move the ball up and down the field and

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.340 
move the ball up and down the field and
that's<00:04:28.880> what<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.060> wanted<00:04:29.479> but<00:04:29.539> after<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.169> game

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
that's what I wanted but after the game

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.830 
that's what I wanted but after the game
I<00:04:30.789> decided<00:04:31.789> to<00:04:31.880> go<00:04:32.000> ahead<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.360> do<00:04:32.449> something

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
I decided to go ahead and do something

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.839 
I decided to go ahead and do something
you<00:04:32.960> guys<00:04:33.139> might<00:04:33.380> not<00:04:33.560> agree<00:04:33.889> with<00:04:34.009> it<00:04:34.340> but<00:04:34.370> I

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
you guys might not agree with it but I

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.059 
you guys might not agree with it but I
did<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.419> my<00:04:35.569> last<00:04:35.810> series<00:04:36.199> when<00:04:36.380> Aldon<00:04:36.770> Smith

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
did it my last series when Aldon Smith

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.950 
did it my last series when Aldon Smith
got<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.490> trouble<00:04:37.669> in<00:04:37.940> real<00:04:38.090> life<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.539> figured

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
got in trouble in real life I figured

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960 
got in trouble in real life I figured
I'll<00:04:39.470> make<00:04:39.710> it<00:04:39.830> more<00:04:39.949> challenging<00:04:40.009> for<00:04:40.490> myself

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
I'll make it more challenging for myself

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.170 
I'll make it more challenging for myself
I<00:04:41.090> went<00:04:41.300> ahead<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.690> sold<00:04:41.990> his<00:04:42.199> 99<00:04:42.710> overall

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
version and I picked up a player for

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.680 
version and I picked up a player for
under<00:04:45.770> 5k<00:04:45.979> that<00:04:46.520> was<00:04:46.610> Brian<00:04:46.849> Orakpo<00:04:47.120> and
