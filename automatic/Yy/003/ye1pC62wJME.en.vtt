00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello I am tere and in this video I am going 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.700
 to teach how to wash our brushes 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.340
 I've been doing this little glove inma 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.050
 He cited and I would like to show you how 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.730
 uses because nobody likes to wash 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.500
 the brushes but the truth this glove 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.360
 it facilitates everything we also have to 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.770
 know that washing the brushes is super 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.320
 important because they are full of 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.060
 bacteria and if we do not wash them then we 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.789
 we are putting bacteria on the face 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 this glove he quoted costs at $ 39 and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.830
 there are international shipments to low ones 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.080
 It's handling and a coupon on this side 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.910
 of the glove says to and this means that from 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.530
 this side we are going to wash all our 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.899
 brushes we use to make up 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.000
 the eyes and on this other side says face 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.379
 abajito that means we 're going to wash 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.030
 the brushes we use for 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.550
 Make up the rest of our face 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.820
 also the glove quoted says wash here 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.350
 says rins here they raffle off then this 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.239
 it makes things much easier for us 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.370
 because it literally says what we have 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.500
 what to do there and good now let's see 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.690
 how is this glove used I will 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.550
 start by putting this facial soap on 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.379
 my glove cited and a little water for 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.750
 foaming I feel you do not have this soap 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.950
 you can use some baby shampoo 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.110
 a neutral soap 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.840
 I'm going to start with the side of the brush 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.119
 which is for the eyes and I'm going to take in a 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.549
 fist all the brushes I use to 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.270
 Make up my eyes and in movements 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:23.460
 circular I'll start making foam 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.460
 all this is in the part that I did 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.090
 and then we're going to move on to the part that 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.500
 says ring and taking our brushes 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.840
 individually we are going to do 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.670
 movements from top to bottom and from 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.790
 side to side in the trickle of water 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.440
 to rinse our brushes if you 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.210
 you want you can stop here but if 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.770
 you want a deeper cleaning for 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.610
 your brushes can continue with the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.610
 next steps 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.800
 again we are going to put soap on him but 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.600
 this time to the part that says rifai ni 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.970
 let's do again movements of 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.340
 top down foaming 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.420
 then we went to the little part of the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.700
 side that says 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.130
 rifai plus and we will make movements 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.460
 circular and then rinse it with 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.460
 Water 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.160
 and to finish I'll like to pinch 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.970
 the hairs of the brush to give 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.970
 shape and ready 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.640
 and now we go with the part that says face 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.190
 let's start with the part that says 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.099
 wars and again let's put soap 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.110
 water and let's start with our 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.880
 brush making circular movements 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.880
 to make a lot of foam 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.620
 then we go to the part that says rin 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.480
 if we put ourselves in the trickle of water and 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.629
 we move from top to 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.120
 down from one side to the other again until 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.120
 that the transparent water starts to look 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.850
 and for a deeper cleaning we 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.100
 let's go to the part that says refine and other 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.160
 we do movements from the top towards 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.160
 down 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.829
 and then we go to the part that says 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.829
 rifai we make circular movements 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.900
 if you want you can rinse it there in 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.610
 the part that is raffled plus or if not 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.349
 you can go from the part that says the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.270
 ring yes again in the trickle of water 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:43.000
 until the water comes clear 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.370
 and finally we give shape to our 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.900
 brush remember that this method is the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.700
 that I use I do not know if I am 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.380
 doing correctly but this method 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.770
 has left my brushes in super good 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.050
 been and super clean 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.700
 and that's how our brushes look 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.860
 clean the only thing we have to 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.660
 do is wait for them to dry and I 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.040
 I recommend you leave them on a 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.140
 towel 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.120
