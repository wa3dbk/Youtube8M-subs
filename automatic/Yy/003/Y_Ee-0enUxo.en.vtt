00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.799
 in the garden and as always with you Julia me 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.260
 him and today we'll talk about 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.220
 zucchini is about zucchini 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.720
 a lot of questions come in 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.810
 how can you get the squash 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 ordinary zucchini squash gave very 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.649
 good rich harvest for many 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.489
 it turns out only one barren and and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.270
 Squashes no others have something going on 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.489
 Squashes are rotting and generally can not 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 no way to ripen in general very very 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.860
 there are many misunderstandings with 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.800
 zucchini what I want to say now 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.680
 principle you can still plant in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.730
 open ground zucchini but zucchini have 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.219
 see exactly the garden namely varieties 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.030
 early maturing which you will quickly begin 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.189
 bears fruit and will bring you good fall 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.920
 the harvest 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:14.460
 these zucchini are usually not from 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.409
 cheap I generally say you 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.909
 I warn somewhere not more than twenty 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.549
 rubles a few seeds 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.979
 but these zucchini bush and also as 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.250
 Cucumbers I can call them this word 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.100
 prating tropical practically in them 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.640
 no male flowers but here I have 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.659
 ordinary zucchini planted what to do 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.240
 to zucchini squash began to bear fruit 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.670
 the very first thing you should 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.670
 in general, for myself as grit have 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.049
 expression hack on the nose is zucchini 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.840
 likes humus rotted manure it on 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.640
 we teach him 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.360
 bliss then he grows and bears fruit 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.909
 with full dedication what else do I want to say 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.009
 itâ€™s raining and pretty 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.130
 the weather drops then it's warm here 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.250
 it's cold so we must be with you now 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.179
 already take care of that cucumbers in 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.540
 open group 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.989
 mute zucchini all pumpkin and pumpkin 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.170
 watermelon not ill powdery mildew 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.810
 it is generally a cold rainy disease and 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.060
 temperature difference if here we are 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.000
 let's see you see very green 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.790
 funny such leaves all but here 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.730
 powdery mildew 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.859
 Here are very similar as these leaves 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.920
 this leaves are not sick this is such a sort 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.799
 zucchini powdery mildew 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.099
 here the leaves are covered with such bloom 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:47.790
 what should we do was a rain 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:51.989
 you take usual brilliant green 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.439
 Zelenka in the pharmacy and 40 drops of Zelenka on 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.769
 10 liters of water and ran with 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:02.760
 sprayer all pumpkin cucumbers 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.180
 our zucchini processed everything quickly 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.510
 you know if not working and not 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.299
 to process plants then in general 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.760
 then they will surely get sick it may be 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:19.799
 40 drops of iodine it can be 5 tablets 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.699
 metronidazole is all i say at 10 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:26.400
 liters of water to spray on the neck here 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:28.889
 plant so they do not hurt Well 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.479
 now let's see sometimes 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:35.310
 happens zucchini we begin to rot 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:36.389
 rot and starts here as saying 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.459

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.709
 I got a squash now I do not think I 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.709
 I did not find, in general, I would like you to 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.449
 show that when the zucchini began and 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.000
 the flower did not fall off 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.409
 Here sometimes you look like he is 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.259
 expression we can already say he 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:58.049
 soled you must go and 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:00.269
 remove all those faded 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.030
 here as if on zucchini here these 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.729

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.079
 crop to tank 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:21.639

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.949
 and cut off here you see here about this 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.680

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.129
 rains it may be and not dry and 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:41.500
 how would the zucchini be rotting here 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:45.370

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.669

 say this is great food for chickens for 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.150
 birds for lu so we not only eat them 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.090
 themselves and we harvest but also feed the bird 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.789
 together with the pipe with bran stir 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.599

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.300
 everyone eats 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.819
 and now we 'll see how zucchini 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.370
