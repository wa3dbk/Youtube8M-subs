00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.550
 It is December 1 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.690
 brno 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.570
 Timetable is new 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.430
 But what is the timetable until February 28 because of temporary train publication 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.430
 But because I see it with ease 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.949
 It is a Shinkansen to the room 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.949
 From Tokyo to Hakata 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.499
 If at least seven people are confused 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.079
 From Tokyo to dawn 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.769
 I'm going in 15 minutes after 4 hours It's early in Kansai 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.300
 It is Nozomi 1 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.200
 Well No 15 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.560
 A little bit of money is on it 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.920
 Tokyo University 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.460
 Departure on the 6th and leaving on its own 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.100
 I can talk to you 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 10:55 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.980
 So this is the fastest 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 Tokyo Hakata area 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.360
 Nozomi No. 1 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.110
 I think that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 There are the previous Nozomi 2 and Nozomi 3 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.770
 Entertainment domingo 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.480
 I mean 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.420
 It took 6 o'clock on the other side 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.080
 On the other hand, most of them are on their own on 3 days 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 It's about 11:13 when it comes to Tokyo 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.910
 Sonin 25 takes 5 hours 13 minutes 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.310
 So it's the time with Nozomi 1 and Nozomi 2 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.070
 There is a difference in gun shooting to 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.680
 It is late even to Mayanozomi 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.720
 235 large for protection 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.340
 I saw it 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.140
 I can not live this 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.680
 Nozomi No. 1 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.060
 I left at 6 am 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 I speak at 10:55 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.810
 The original number 3 is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.310
 Please watch 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.680
 626 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.970
 Tokyo University 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.700
 Matsushima 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.430
 To arrive 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.350
 1123 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.350
 Response time 57 minutes 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.370
 Nozomi 1 4 hours 55 minutes 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.510
 I wonder why there is no question of Nozomi 3 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.860
 How is it 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.380
 Nozomi 3 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.610
 Please watch 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.960
 It is divorced same as the panoramic view of the usual stop, but 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.699
 The same as the previous race 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.669
 Do to Hiroshima 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.669
 It is hand high school 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:22.810
 So much 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.479
 One part school 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.479
 If I cut it all the way past Hiroshima, I will continue 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.299
 It goes to the heart, but how is it best 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.669
 Next to Hiroshima as gathered 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.139
 I also have Shin Yamaguchi 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.829
 Lower house Yamaguchi 2 ward supplementary election 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.519

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.789
 Nozomi No. 1 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:48.409
 I myself 10:55 wearing 4 hours 55 minutes 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:54.029
 Nozomi 3 66 first for 1113 points up 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.509
 It takes 4 hours, 57 minutes, but it becomes new Yamaguchi on the way 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.570
 Hey i am not a jr driver 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.570
 I do not know well what it is important 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.680
 Somehow this is also the same as 235's 15th. 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.639
 It is good thing even if it is Pad temple 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.760
 It is 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.329
