00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello you are welcome on 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.370
 a canal 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.710
 Today I show you how you like this one 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 super simple herringbone braid 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.600
 it does not turn out to be the usual one 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.010
 herringbone head knows otherwise and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.740
 where it probably already quite 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.570
 there are many tutorials but he is 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.119
 much easier to get and much easier 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.500
 That's why I thought I was in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.239
 show this video 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.149
 As you speak this fish, ask 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.160
 can do what you need is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.290
 So now I have a dry shampoo 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.640
 used because my hair a bit 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.260
 were ready to use 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.879
 but that's up to you if you're one 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.440
 would like to use dry shampoo reasons 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.640
 then you need a brush and that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.039
 hair in any case once 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.860
 then fight her braid 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.190
 it's easy to make knot casual 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.559
 in any case important that you the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.250
 Fights hair once you need it 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.380
 then a hair gum around the hairy 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.220
 to tie up religious 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.630
 and a lot of little hair ties from that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 predator quite a lot depending on 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.500
 hair length you need many I needed 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.930
 for example quite a lot now was mine 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.740
 Hair is very long and that's it 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.280
 already 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.570
 Let's start his first fun 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.290
 speak my hair with the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.759
 dry shampoo 14 from katies so that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.189
 hair will be a bit grippier and 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.140
 my hair is now also two days 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.659
 not washed so two days old 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.840
 that's why she talks to it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.560
 the finished approach goes away and you 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.090
 attacked 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.710
 Just spray on the approach and 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.710
 rub in a bit 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.700
 not too good that dry shampoo 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.700
 I can really escape you 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:19.270
 so then we can get the hair once 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:21.760
 First, you put your hair on 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.250
 the side she wants to wear 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.990
 me it is my right side then 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.360
 turns her your pony 1 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.340
 and I take a bobby pins for it 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.630
 talk to me in the front so a bit 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.520
 one strand this back and then 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.520
 I stick this with the span 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.710
 next, I'm up my hair 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.710
 the side to the harmony 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.630
 must not be so strong 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:22.720
 then you share a piece of yours 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.720
 partie forward on the plait 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.569
 and tie that up with a little one 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.230
 harmony 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.230
 to 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.300
 then you open this piece 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.960
 and pushes the braid once in the middle 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.960
 by 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.519
 then you are one piece of 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.519
 both sides 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:29.100
 and do the same again and in the 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.100
 through the middle 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.180
 we are actually doing that now 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.180
 the whole time 

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:37.519
 the end when I am with the 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:40.429
 Simply put hair scrub together after her 

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:43.729
 then you're done then you can 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:47.299
 please pull the braid apart like that 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:50.889
 that's all nice and voluminous 

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:50.889
 looks taller 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.380
 if you had grades on the hair now 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.710
 I do not advise you to do that 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.229
 much apart because then pixel 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.490
 the strands of strands therefore and 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.530
 then everything does not look so nice anymore 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.130
 that's what it was with 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.050
 the look you can as I said after 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.910
 to do as he pleases 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.949
 if you do not like it so much 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.169
 you do not want to pull like that 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.550
 a lot out I hope you had fun with 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.860
 video and learned how to do this 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.790
 job can do 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.979
 It is really a nice alternative 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.900
 if you do not look the same every day 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.199
 Every day , the hair wants to be open 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.150
 wear something else and or 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.979
 if you have bad hair day then man 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.820
 It can be done very well 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.740
 like me today 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.270
 and yes I hope you have learned how 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.320
 you do this job and had fun 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.580
 while watching 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.580
