all right well today what I'm playing

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.760 
all right well today what I'm playing
around<00:00:03.510> with<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:05.069> memory<00:00:05.759> sketch<00:00:06.230> as<00:00:07.230> I'm

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
around with is a memory sketch as I'm

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.580 
around with is a memory sketch as I'm
drawing<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.780> one<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.990> most<00:00:10.139> important

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
drawing this one of the most important

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.959 
drawing this one of the most important
things<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.040> think<00:00:11.130> about<00:00:11.490> when<00:00:11.849> I'm

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
things that I think about when I'm

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.030 
things that I think about when I'm
memory<00:00:12.330> sketching<00:00:12.900> it's<00:00:13.500> really<00:00:13.830> just

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
memory sketching it's really just

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.880 
memory sketching it's really just
looking<00:00:14.910> at<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.420> whole<00:00:15.599> overall<00:00:16.049> shape<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.650> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
looking at the whole overall shape of a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.810 
looking at the whole overall shape of a
person's<00:00:17.369> body<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.330> their<00:00:18.690> attitude<00:00:19.670> this<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
person's body and their attitude this is

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.759 
person's body and their attitude this is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
a memory sketch while I was on the train

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.589 
a memory sketch while I was on the train
and<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.710> saw<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.890> guy<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.369> snoring<00:00:27.029> and

know help me because I believe
personally<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.989> memorization<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:42.420> an

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
personally that with memorization is an

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.260 
personally that with memorization is an
aid<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.989> visualization<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.640> something

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
aid to visualization so that's something

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.720 
aid to visualization so that's something
where<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.899> helps<00:00:46.230> me<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:47.129> come<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.700> with

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
where it just helps me just come up with

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.670 
where it just helps me just come up with
new<00:00:48.090> ideas<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.780> different<00:00:48.930> things<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.500> it's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
new ideas and different things so it's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.580 
new ideas and different things so it's
an<00:00:49.770> exercise<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:51.600> was<00:00:51.809> an<00:00:51.899> 18

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
an exercise I do this was an 18

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
an exercise I do this was an 18
you<00:00:52.949> know<00:00:53.100> minute<00:00:53.430> video<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> condensed

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
you know minute video that I condensed

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.529 
you know minute video that I condensed
down<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> five<00:00:55.410> minutes<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:57.000> give

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
down to five minutes and just to give

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.290 
down to five minutes and just to give
you<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.719> rough<00:00:57.989> idea<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.500> my<00:00:58.710> process<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.699> as

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you a rough idea of my process and as

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900 
you a rough idea of my process and as
how<00:01:00.539> I'm<00:01:00.690> drawing<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.550> technically<00:01:02.550> always

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
how I'm drawing I technically always

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
how I'm drawing I technically always
think<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.300> shape<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.860> know<00:01:05.010> one

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
think about shape I have you know one

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.060 
think about shape I have you know one
day<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.939> approach<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.570> drawing<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.560> I'm

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
day I can approach a drawing one way I'm

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.649 
day I can approach a drawing one way I'm
one<00:01:08.280> day<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.060> another<00:01:09.390> way

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
one day and I do it another way

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.350 
one day and I do it another way
there's<00:01:10.380> no<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> don't<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.610> any<00:01:11.790> set

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
there's no I don't really have any set

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.800 
there's no I don't really have any set
way<00:01:13.369> of<00:01:14.369> doing<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:15.780> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
way of doing it but this is what I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.390 
way of doing it but this is what I
typically<00:01:16.549> will<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:19.080> I'm<00:01:19.770> doing<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.220> I'm

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
typically will do so as I'm doing it I'm

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.880 
typically will do so as I'm doing it I'm
thinking<00:01:20.580> about<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.439> hit<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
thinking about you know just hit the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.950 
thinking about you know just hit the
attitude<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.790> way<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.119> guy<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.689> sitting

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
attitude the way this guy was sitting

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.910 
attitude the way this guy was sitting
what<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.830> recall<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.540> guy<00:01:27.920> his

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
what I kind of recall about this guy his

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.910 
what I kind of recall about this guy his
posture<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.210> his<00:01:30.479> legs<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.140> clothes<00:01:31.500> he

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
posture you know his legs the clothes he

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.410 
posture you know his legs the clothes he
was<00:01:31.950> wearing<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.570> was<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:33.930> done<00:01:33.960> using

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
was wearing and this was all done using

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.600 
was wearing and this was all done using
alias<00:01:36.420> SketchBook<00:01:36.960> Pro<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:38.070> I'll<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.430> is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
alias SketchBook Pro and what I'll do is

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
alias SketchBook Pro and what I'll do is
I<00:01:38.729> use<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> light<00:01:39.270> blue<00:01:39.420> pencil<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.170> I'll<00:01:40.619> rough

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
I use a light blue pencil and I'll rough

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.330 
I use a light blue pencil and I'll rough
it<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.360> quickly<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:44.040> then

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
it out you know really quickly and then

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
it out you know really quickly and then
once<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.450> am<00:01:45.600> happy<00:01:45.899> with<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.229> rough

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
once I kind of am happy with my rough

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.030 
once I kind of am happy with my rough
I'll<00:01:47.329> use<00:01:48.329> another<00:01:48.360> layer<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.890> I'll

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
I'll use another layer and then I'll

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.520 
I'll use another layer and then I'll
just<00:01:50.250> start<00:01:50.579> inking<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.450> isn't<00:01:52.049> real

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
just start inking now this isn't real

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.560 
just start inking now this isn't real
flushed<00:01:52.979> out<00:01:53.189> ink<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.420> it's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
flushed out ink as you can see it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.039 
flushed out ink as you can see it's
pretty<00:01:54.810> loose<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.560> pretty<00:01:56.250> rough<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.049> once

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
pretty loose and pretty rough and once

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.880 
pretty loose and pretty rough and once
again<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.320> don't<00:01:58.590> draw<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.979> fast<00:01:59.360> but<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.509> is

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
again I don't draw this fast but this is

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.889 
again I don't draw this fast but this is
you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:02.040> how<00:02:02.610> I'm<00:02:02.790> kind<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.719> that

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you know how I'm kind of just so that

and adding some final details within the
character<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.640> that's<00:05:12.640> it<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.420> that's<00:05:14.350> a

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
character and that's it so that's a

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.250 
character and that's it so that's a
little<00:05:15.130> memory<00:05:15.340> sketch<00:05:15.850> and<00:05:16.180> I<00:05:16.750> hope<00:05:17.080> you
