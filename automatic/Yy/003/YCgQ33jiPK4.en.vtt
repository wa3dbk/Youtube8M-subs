screws okay three on each and this thing

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.589 
screws okay three on each and this thing
is<00:02:22.980> solid<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.519> mean<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.909> could<00:02:24.150> probably<00:02:24.209> drive

is solid I mean I could probably drive

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.330 
is solid I mean I could probably drive
an<00:02:24.750> SUV<00:02:24.870> up<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.409> top<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.799> this<00:02:25.890> thing<00:02:26.099> right<00:02:26.159> now

it's it's not going anywhere it's way
over<00:02:30.420> engineered<00:02:31.040> but<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.459> get<00:02:32.579> an<00:02:32.670> idea<00:02:32.760> for

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
over engineered but you get an idea for

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.660 
over engineered but you get an idea for
how<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.209> caps<00:02:33.450> are<00:02:33.629> gonna<00:02:33.780> fit<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:35.310> top<00:02:35.519> of

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
how the caps are gonna fit on top of

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.809 
how the caps are gonna fit on top of
those<00:02:35.760> top<00:02:36.390> rails<00:02:36.689> and<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:38.430> gonna<00:02:38.549> run<00:02:38.730> all

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
those top rails and just gonna run all

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.490 
those top rails and just gonna run all
the<00:02:38.909> boards<00:02:39.239> like<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:39.659> said<00:02:39.900> at<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.049> 45<00:02:40.470> degree

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the boards like I said at a 45 degree

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.280 
the boards like I said at a 45 degree
angle<00:02:41.209> running<00:02:42.209> perpendicular<00:02:42.599> off<00:02:43.109> that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
angle running perpendicular off that

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.270 
angle running perpendicular off that
front<00:02:43.530> slant<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:46.230> almost<00:02:46.739> there

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
front slant so almost there

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.580 
front slant so almost there
I'll<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.879> decking<00:02:48.629> this<00:02:48.780> tomorrow<00:02:49.049> hopefully

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
I'll be decking this tomorrow hopefully

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.259 
I'll be decking this tomorrow hopefully
if<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.769> weather<00:02:49.920> holds<00:02:49.980> well<00:02:50.940> that's<00:02:51.090> why<00:02:51.180> I'm

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
if the weather holds well that's why I'm

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.670 
if the weather holds well that's why I'm
staining<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:51.750> long<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.079> got<00:02:52.200> good<00:02:52.379> sunny

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
staining as long as I got good sunny

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.729 
staining as long as I got good sunny
days<00:02:53.510> I'll<00:02:54.510> get<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:54.840> my<00:02:54.959> stain<00:02:55.260> done<00:02:55.500> just

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
days I'll get all my stain done just

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.039 
days I'll get all my stain done just
because<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.400> also<00:02:56.549> weather<00:02:56.909> sealer<00:02:57.329> so<00:02:58.019> I

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
because it's also weather sealer so I

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.930 
because it's also weather sealer so I
can<00:02:58.200> actually<00:02:58.319> work<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.859> drizzle<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.760> it's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
can actually work in the drizzle so it's

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.460 
can actually work in the drizzle so it's
not<00:03:00.030> pouring<00:03:00.359> rain<00:03:00.629> I<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.840> still<00:03:01.170> get<00:03:01.260> work

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
not pouring rain I can still get work

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.490 
not pouring rain I can still get work
done<00:03:01.579> but<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:02.939> can<00:03:02.970> see<00:03:03.239> where<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.780> came<00:03:04.200> back

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
through here with my angle grinder and

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.809 
through here with my angle grinder and
basically<00:03:07.349> leveled<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:07.920> plank<00:03:08.250> out<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.700> that

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819

working by yourself and you need a board
to<00:03:39.780> be<00:03:39.930> held<00:03:40.169> you<00:03:40.470> don't<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.859> helper<00:03:41.220> screw

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
to be held you don't have a helper screw

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.369 
to be held you don't have a helper screw
in<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.760> screws<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.419> you've<00:03:42.750> got<00:03:42.959> yourself<00:03:43.290> a

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
in the screws and you've got yourself a

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.869 
in the screws and you've got yourself a
built-in<00:03:43.709> helper<00:03:44.069> that's<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.370> little<00:03:44.639> shelf

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
built-in helper that's a little shelf

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.059 
built-in helper that's a little shelf
that<00:03:45.120> your<00:03:46.049> board<00:03:46.260> can<00:03:46.349> sit<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:46.680> while<00:03:46.949> you

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
that your board can sit on while you

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.420 
that your board can sit on while you
make<00:03:47.280> your<00:03:47.310> measurements<00:03:47.639> and<00:03:48.090> whatnot

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
make your measurements and whatnot

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.099 
make your measurements and whatnot
haven't<00:03:50.430> utilized<00:03:50.579> those<00:03:51.090> today<00:03:51.540> because<00:03:52.019> I

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
haven't utilized those today because I

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.969 
haven't utilized those today because I
was<00:03:52.229> working<00:03:52.409> by<00:03:52.650> myself<00:03:52.859> as<00:03:53.639> usual<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:55.470> it's

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
was working by myself as usual so it's

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.250 
was working by myself as usual so it's
all<00:03:56.159> done<00:03:56.370> pretty<00:03:56.940> much<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.840> ready<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.169> be

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
all done pretty much just ready to be

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.449 
all done pretty much just ready to be
decked

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
decked

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.520 
decked
again<00:04:01.239> I'd<00:04:01.359> much<00:04:01.569> rather<00:04:01.599> stain<00:04:02.109> when<00:04:02.379> it's

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
again I'd much rather stain when it's

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.440 
again I'd much rather stain when it's
all<00:04:02.680> flat<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.010> horizontal<00:04:03.700> like<00:04:03.849> this<00:04:04.090> than

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
all flat and horizontal like this than

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.170 
all flat and horizontal like this than
to<00:04:04.480> stain<00:04:05.230> when<00:04:05.379> it's<00:04:05.500> all<00:04:05.590> put<00:04:05.769> together<00:04:06.180> you

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
to stain when it's all put together you

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.959 
to stain when it's all put together you
see<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.629> compound<00:04:08.230> angles<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.980> vertical

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:09.969 
see a compound angles and vertical

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:11.940 
see a compound angles and vertical
intersections<00:04:10.569> with<00:04:10.719> horizontal<00:04:11.019> joints<00:04:11.769> and

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
intersections with horizontal joints and

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.399 
intersections with horizontal joints and
it's<00:04:12.609> a<00:04:12.909> pain<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.239> butt<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.629> stain<00:04:14.230> after

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
it's a pain in the butt to stain after

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.620 
it's a pain in the butt to stain after
the<00:04:14.650> fact<00:04:14.890> so<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:15.640> prefer<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.299> do<00:04:16.479> all<00:04:16.600> my

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
the fact so I prefer to do all my

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.409 
the fact so I prefer to do all my
standing<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.199> weather<00:04:17.350> sealing<00:04:17.620> first<00:04:18.419> this

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
standing and weather sealing first this

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.729 
standing and weather sealing first this
makes<00:04:19.600> life<00:04:19.810> easier<00:04:20.169> when<00:04:20.500> you're<00:04:20.620> done

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
makes life easier when you're done

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.930 
makes life easier when you're done
because<00:04:21.100> when<00:04:21.220> you're<00:04:21.340> done<00:04:21.430> you're<00:04:21.609> done<00:04:21.699> you

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
because when you're done you're done you

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.340 
because when you're done you're done you
don't<00:04:22.090> have<00:04:22.180> anything<00:04:22.389> to<00:04:22.509> do<00:04:22.630> except<00:04:23.229> to

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
don't have anything to do except to

00:04:23.350 --> 00:05:32.879 
don't have anything to do except to
enjoy<00:04:23.590> it

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.949
