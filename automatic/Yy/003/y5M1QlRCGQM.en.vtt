00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
eyes and pull them further apart so you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.499 
eyes and pull them further apart so you
want<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> apply<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.350> lighter<00:01:22.979> shade<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and do the corner edges a little bit

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.539 
and do the corner edges a little bit
darker<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.930> will<00:01:31.049> make<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> eyes

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
darker because this will make the eyes

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.520 
darker because this will make the eyes
draw<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.450> seem<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.049> close<00:01:34.200> together

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
draw out and not seem so close together

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.550 
draw out and not seem so close together
