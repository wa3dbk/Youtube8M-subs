00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:41.510 
then like this and oops I messed up but
you<00:01:40.380> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.649> get<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> picture<00:01:41.250> i<00:01:41.280> made<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you kind of get the picture i made a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.919 
you kind of get the picture i made a
whole<00:01:41.640> bunch<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:41.939> helmets<00:01:42.299> than<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.719> should

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
whole bunch more helmets than I should

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.169 
whole bunch more helmets than I should
have<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.429> won't<00:01:44.609> have<00:01:44.789> a<00:01:44.850> set<00:01:45.060> of

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
have so we just won't have a set of

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.340 
have so we just won't have a set of
boots<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.539> as<00:01:45.659> long<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.929> don't<00:01:46.109> make<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
boots but as long as you don't make the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.620 
boots but as long as you don't make the
mistake<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.679> I<00:01:46.859> did<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.819> get<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.209> start<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
mistake that I did you get to start the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.800 
mistake that I did you get to start the
game<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:50.060> here<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:52.369> full<00:01:53.369> set<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:54.060> gold

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
game with here we go a full set of gold

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.819 
game with here we go a full set of gold
armor<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:56.640> diamond<00:01:57.119> sword<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.469> that's

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
armor and a diamond sword so that's

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.529 
armor and a diamond sword so that's
about<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.609> the<00:01:59.729> best<00:01:59.909> starts<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.359> think

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
about one of the best starts I think

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.870 
about one of the best starts I think
