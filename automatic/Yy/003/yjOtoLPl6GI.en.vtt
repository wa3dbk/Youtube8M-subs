00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.999 
kind of weird my guess is that art will
build<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> run<00:01:33.900> time<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> next<00:01:34.530> version<00:01:34.770> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
build a run time for the next version of

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.800 
build a run time for the next version of
android<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.820> great<00:01:36.150> because<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.689> will

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
android which be great because it will

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.749

especially lower end devices like the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.469 
especially lower end devices like the
Xperia<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.400> enough<00:01:41.640> sidetracking<00:01:42.180> let's
