00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.380 

okay<00:01:36.800> stopping<00:01:37.310> blending<00:01:37.760> this<00:01:37.880> for<00:01:38.180> about<00:01:38.360> a

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
okay stopping blending this for about a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.250 
okay stopping blending this for about a
minute<00:01:38.660> and<00:01:40.360> gave<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.480> a<00:01:41.540> bit<00:01:41.660> of<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.810> shake-up

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260

throughout and kept blending and this is

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.080 
throughout and kept blending and this is
the<00:01:44.720> texture<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.170> I've<00:01:45.470> got<00:01:45.680> at<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.830> moment

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
the texture that I've got at the moment

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.330 
the texture that I've got at the moment
but<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.330> want<00:01:48.080> this<00:01:48.200> just<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.920> little<00:01:49.190> bit

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
but I want this just a little bit

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.310 
but I want this just a little bit
thinner<00:01:49.610> than<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.120> so<00:01:50.450> I'm<00:01:50.660> going<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.900> add<00:01:51.110> in

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
thinner than that so I'm going to add in

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.140 
thinner than that so I'm going to add in
about<00:01:52.210> half<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.920> milk<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.220> tablespoons

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
about half of this milk so a tablespoons

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.600 
about half of this milk so a tablespoons
worth<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:00.530> then<00:02:00.950> I'll<00:02:01.070> just<00:02:01.220> give<00:02:01.370> it<00:02:01.430> another

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
worth and then I'll just give it another

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.260 
worth and then I'll just give it another
blend<00:02:02.120> for<00:02:02.450> half<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.290> minute<00:02:03.440> or<00:02:03.650> so<00:02:04.210> okay<00:02:05.210> so

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
blend for half a minute or so okay so

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.300 
blend for half a minute or so okay so
this<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.930> texture<00:02:06.410> after<00:02:06.530> adding<00:02:07.220> a

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
this is the texture after adding a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.400 
this is the texture after adding a
tablespoon<00:02:07.940> of<00:02:08.119> soy<00:02:08.510> milk<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.020> running<00:02:09.320> it

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
tablespoon of soy milk and running it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.710 
tablespoon of soy milk and running it
for<00:02:09.590> another<00:02:09.830> half<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.220> minute

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
for another half a minute

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.450 
for another half a minute
I'm<00:02:12.050> going<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.410> add<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.740> rest<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> soy

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
I'm going to add in the rest of the soy

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.270 
I'm going to add in the rest of the soy
milk<00:02:13.520> just<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.090> give<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.770> slightly<00:02:15.770> lighter

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
milk just to give it slightly lighter

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.240 
milk just to give it slightly lighter
texture<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:18.110> if<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.500> like<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.710> thick<00:02:19.040> layer

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
texture but if you like a thick layer

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.300 
texture but if you like a thick layer
then<00:02:19.730> leave<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.180> at<00:02:20.360> that

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
then leave it at that

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.350 
then leave it at that
