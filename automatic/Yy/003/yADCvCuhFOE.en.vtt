lipo charging in though as you can see
here's<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> fairly<00:00:06.990> standard<00:00:07.379> sort<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.710> field

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
here's a fairly standard sort of field

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.330 
here's a fairly standard sort of field
charging<00:00:08.970> set<00:00:09.210> up<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.679> two<00:00:10.679> charges<00:00:11.160> they're

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
charging set up with two charges they're

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.039 
charging set up with two charges they're
perfect<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:11.910> my<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:12.750> they<00:00:12.840> match<00:00:12.990> my

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
perfect for my so that they match my

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.160 
perfect for my so that they match my
generator<00:00:13.740> nicely<00:00:14.420> and<00:00:15.420> normally<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.960> would

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
generator nicely and normally we would

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.710 
generator nicely and normally we would
charge<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> batteries<00:00:17.100> there<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
charge the batteries there on the on the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.620 
charge the batteries there on the on the
flat<00:00:19.020> space<00:00:19.260> they're<00:00:19.470> great<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> field

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
flat space they're great in the field

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.730 
flat space they're great in the field
perfectly<00:00:21.630> good<00:00:21.779> at<00:00:21.810> home<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.230> providing<00:00:22.619> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
perfectly good at home it providing you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.040 
perfectly good at home it providing you
keep<00:00:22.980> an<00:00:23.430> eye<00:00:23.580> out<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.689> batteries

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
keep an eye out for you batteries

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.109 
keep an eye out for you batteries
because<00:00:25.170> if<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.410> go<00:00:25.560> wrong<00:00:25.880> as<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:26.939> know

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
because if they go wrong as we know

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.029 
because if they go wrong as we know
lipase<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.750> pretty<00:00:27.960> dangerous<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.890> this

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
lipase can be pretty dangerous so this

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.980 
lipase can be pretty dangerous so this
is<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> solution<00:00:29.730> I've<00:00:29.820> come<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
is just a solution I've come up with to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.860 
is just a solution I've come up with to
hopefully<00:00:31.140> make<00:00:31.410> things<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.830> little<00:00:32.009> bit<00:00:32.219> safer

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
hopefully make things a little bit safer

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.620 
hopefully make things a little bit safer
what<00:00:33.870> I've<00:00:33.989> got<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.350> mounted<00:00:34.950> either<00:00:35.219> side<00:00:35.730> of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
what I've got is mounted either side of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.500 
what I've got is mounted either side of
the<00:00:37.170> case<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:38.360> for<00:00:39.680> 50<00:00:40.680> Cal<00:00:41.149> ammunition<00:00:42.149> boxes

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the case are for 50 Cal ammunition boxes

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.069 
the case are for 50 Cal ammunition boxes
because<00:00:43.440> these<00:00:43.739> will<00:00:44.040> contain<00:00:45.030> any<00:00:45.270> fire<00:00:45.600> from

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
because these will contain any fire from

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.750 
because these will contain any fire from
any<00:00:46.350> lipo<00:00:46.829> goes<00:00:47.489> bad<00:00:48.620> however<00:00:49.620> that's<00:00:50.550> only

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
any lipo goes bad however that's only

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.160 
any lipo goes bad however that's only
just<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.090> part<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.140> know

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
just a part of it because as we know

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.970 
just a part of it because as we know
contained<00:00:53.539> lipo<00:00:54.539> far<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.230> will

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
contained lipo far in one of these will

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.319 
contained lipo far in one of these will
actually<00:00:56.280> cause<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.610> explosion<00:00:56.940> unless

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
actually cause an explosion unless

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.910 
actually cause an explosion unless
there's<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> way<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> gas<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.379> vent<00:00:58.739> off

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
there's a way for the gas to vent off

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.240 
there's a way for the gas to vent off
and<00:00:59.539> the<00:01:00.539> smoke<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.960> comes<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.770> lie

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
and the smoke that comes from a lie

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.470 
and the smoke that comes from a lie
Paige<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.730> honest<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:03.090> probably<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.449> more

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
Paige be honest will probably do more

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.210 
Paige be honest will probably do more
damage<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.170> property<00:01:04.530> than<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> fire<00:01:05.010> itself

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
damage the property than the fire itself

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.120 
damage the property than the fire itself
will<00:01:05.640> unless<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> far<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> hold<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
will unless that the far get to hold in

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.359 
will unless that the far get to hold in
on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> building<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.479> how<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.409> deal<00:01:10.619> with

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
on the building so how do we deal with

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.410 
on the building so how do we deal with
the<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.479> off-gassing<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.850> lipase<00:01:14.850> well

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the the off-gassing of the lipase well

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
the the off-gassing of the lipase well
here's<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> bid<00:01:17.220> I've

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
here's what I think is that the bid I've

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
here's what I think is that the bid I've
enjoyed<00:01:17.610> doing<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> most<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> back<00:01:19.470> you

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
enjoyed doing the most in the back you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.570 
enjoyed doing the most in the back you
can<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:19.860> I've<00:01:20.790> plumbed<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:22.799> piping<00:01:23.280> here

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
can see I've plumbed in this piping here

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240 
can see I've plumbed in this piping here
which<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.970> completely<00:01:24.390> airtight<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.130> the

storage so should anything go wrong and
it's<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.100> sorted<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.450> done<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.659> very

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it's all sorted so have I done it very

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.550 
it's all sorted so have I done it very
simply<00:02:04.500> here's<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.840> wiring<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> harness

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
simply here's the wiring and the harness

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440 
simply here's the wiring and the harness
from<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.429> order<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> ensure<00:02:09.060> I've<00:02:09.179> got<00:02:09.360> an

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
from it in order to ensure I've got an

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.040 
from it in order to ensure I've got an
airtight<00:02:10.160> exit<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.370> wires<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:12.050> tried

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
airtight exit for the wires I tried

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.820 
airtight exit for the wires I tried
rubber<00:02:13.260> grommets<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
rubber grommets in the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.560 
rubber grommets in the
they<00:02:14.070> didn't<00:02:14.310> work<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.970> i<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.180> got<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> block

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
they didn't work so i just got a block

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.390 
they didn't work so i just got a block
of<00:02:15.750> wood<00:02:15.900> drilled<00:02:16.590> enough<00:02:16.830> holes<00:02:17.070> for<00:02:17.280> each

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
of wood drilled enough holes for each

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.370 
of wood drilled enough holes for each
one<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.910> hole<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.390> big<00:02:18.600> enough<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.200> get

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
one but the hole just big enough to get

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.530 
one but the hole just big enough to get
the<00:02:19.470> wire<00:02:19.650> through<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:21.000> sealed<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the wire through and then sealed the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.080 
the wire through and then sealed the
holes<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:22.290> epoxy<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.640> see<00:02:23.880> there

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
holes with epoxy as you can see there

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.020 
holes with epoxy as you can see there
and<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.660> happens<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:25.140> both<00:02:25.440> sides<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.400> of

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
and that happens on both sides of the of

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.300 
and that happens on both sides of the of
the<00:02:27.180> box<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.140> creates<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.740> really<00:02:29.040> nice

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the box and that creates a really nice

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.750 
the box and that creates a really nice
airtight<00:02:29.910> seal<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.890> plumbing<00:02:32.280> attachments

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
airtight seal the plumbing attachments

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.250 
airtight seal the plumbing attachments
themselves<00:02:33.180> come<00:02:33.390> with<00:02:33.510> rubber<00:02:33.720> grommets<00:02:34.080> of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
themselves come with rubber grommets of

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.410 
themselves come with rubber grommets of
their<00:02:34.410> air<00:02:34.590> tight<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.850> back<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.270> you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
their air tight and on the back here you

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.360 
their air tight and on the back here you
can<00:02:36.570> see<00:02:36.750> probably<00:02:36.990> there's<00:02:37.590> again<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.070> bit<00:02:38.280> of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
can see probably there's again a bit of

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.430 
can see probably there's again a bit of
epoxy<00:02:38.730> there<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.810> seal<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.110> whole

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
epoxy there just to seal that whole

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.890 
epoxy there just to seal that whole
creates<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.130> really<00:02:41.310> nice<00:02:41.550> airtight<00:02:42.120> system

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
creates a really nice airtight system

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.620 
creates a really nice airtight system
and<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.710> course<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.040> ability<00:02:44.400> for<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.880> for

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
and of course the ability for the for

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.470 
and of course the ability for the for
the<00:02:45.660> gases<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.620> escape<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.150> place<00:02:48.270> up

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
the gases to escape so just place up

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.680 
the gases to escape so just place up
there<00:02:48.630> as<00:02:48.870> another<00:02:49.530> idea<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.100> how<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.340> make

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
there as another idea on how to make

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.800 
there as another idea on how to make
like<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.870> charging<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.709> bit<00:02:52.980> safer<00:02:53.600> than<00:02:54.600> what

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
like a charging that bit safer than what

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.570 
like a charging that bit safer than what
you<00:02:54.870> do<00:02:54.990> at<00:02:55.110> home<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.830> course<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.340> lock

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
you do at home and of course this lock

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.670 
you do at home and of course this lock
all<00:02:56.760> comes<00:02:57.180> apart<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.840> take<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.230> case<00:02:58.440> off

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
all comes apart I can take the case off

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.380 
all comes apart I can take the case off
the<00:02:59.220> board<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.580> can<00:02:59.610> see<00:02:59.850> there's<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> handhold

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
the board you can see there's a handhold

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.060 
the board you can see there's a handhold
there<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.870> board<00:03:01.080> nicely<00:03:01.620> fit<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
there and the board nicely fit in the

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.100 
there and the board nicely fit in the
back<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.340> my<00:03:02.400> car<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:02.850> well<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.870> charge

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
back of my car as well so I can charge

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.210 
back of my car as well so I can charge
in<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.320> back<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.650> car<00:03:04.830> again<00:03:04.950> without

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
in the back of the car again without

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.180 
in the back of the car again without
fear<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:06.209> whole<00:03:06.360> car<00:03:06.630> going<00:03:07.170> up<00:03:07.290> should

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
fear of the whole car going up should

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.090 
fear of the whole car going up should
there<00:03:08.370> be<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.550> problem<00:03:08.850> with<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.600> lipo<00:03:10.050> I'm<00:03:10.950> not

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
there be a problem with the lipo I'm not

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.400 
there be a problem with the lipo I'm not
saying<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.459> libraries<00:03:11.820> can<00:03:11.970> be<00:03:12.060> left

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
saying that libraries can be left

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.550 
saying that libraries can be left
unattended<00:03:13.410> during<00:03:14.370> charging<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:14.880> time<00:03:15.560> but

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
unattended during charging this time but

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.290 
unattended during charging this time but
all<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:16.920> takes<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.370> attention<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.209> be

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
all it takes is the attention to be

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.360 
all it takes is the attention to be
diverted<00:03:18.630> for<00:03:18.870> one<00:03:19.050> second<00:03:19.530> that's<00:03:20.100> when<00:03:20.310> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
diverted for one second that's when the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.949 
diverted for one second that's when the
Lopez<00:03:20.700> go<00:03:20.880> bad<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.330> that's<00:03:21.540> when<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.720> drama

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
Lopez go bad and that's when the drama

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.430 
Lopez go bad and that's when the drama
starts<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.830> way<00:03:23.040> i<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:23.670> got<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> much

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
starts and this way i just got a much

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.259 
starts and this way i just got a much
safer<00:03:25.440> feeling<00:03:25.950> about<00:03:26.190> where<00:03:26.850> we<00:03:27.000> care<00:03:27.180> about

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
safer feeling about where we care about

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.630 
safer feeling about where we care about
it
