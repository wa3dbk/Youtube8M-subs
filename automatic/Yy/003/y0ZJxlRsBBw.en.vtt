work but they make it a healthier place
they<00:00:57.059> add<00:00:57.180> humidity<00:00:57.829> filtering<00:00:58.829> through<00:00:59.039> both

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
they add humidity filtering through both

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.700 
they add humidity filtering through both
the<00:00:59.910> root<00:01:00.090> system<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> leaves<00:01:01.020> filter

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the root system and the leaves filter

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.549 
the root system and the leaves filter
out<00:01:01.829> many<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> toxic<00:01:02.760> fumes<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.360> we<00:01:04.320> have

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
out many of the toxic fumes that we have

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.270 
out many of the toxic fumes that we have
in<00:01:04.890> interior<00:01:05.430> buildings<00:01:06.270> today<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.619> not

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
in interior buildings today and so not

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.670 
in interior buildings today and so not
only<00:01:08.479> does<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.509> give<00:01:09.750> us<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.990> pleasant<00:01:10.470> place<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
only does it give us a pleasant place to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.029 
only does it give us a pleasant place to
live<00:01:11.039> but<00:01:11.399> a<00:01:11.460> healthier<00:01:12.000> place<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.800> most<00:01:13.800> of

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
live but a healthier place and most of

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.580 
live but a healthier place and most of
our<00:01:14.160> buildings<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.850> fairly<00:01:15.630> dry<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
our buildings are fairly dry in the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.990 
our buildings are fairly dry in the
summertime<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> air<00:01:17.430> conditioning<00:01:17.940> is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
summertime the air conditioning is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
summertime the air conditioning is
taking<00:01:18.360> humidity<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.890> part<00:01:20.190> of<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
taking humidity out as part of the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
taking humidity out as part of the
cooling<00:01:20.670> process<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.899> wintertime

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
cooling process and in the wintertime

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.279 
cooling process and in the wintertime
even<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.910> heating<00:01:24.179> process<00:01:24.840> takes

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
even more so the heating process takes

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.410 
even more so the heating process takes
even<00:01:25.500> more<00:01:25.649> humidity<00:01:26.190> out<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.819> so<00:01:26.970> plants

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
even more humidity out and so plants

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.930 
even more humidity out and so plants
help<00:01:27.630> add<00:01:27.929> that<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.890> water<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.459> take<00:01:29.640> care

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
help add that as we water and take care

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.990 
help add that as we water and take care
of<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.740> what's<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> best<00:01:32.099> thing<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.429> do<00:01:32.729> as

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
of them what's the best thing to do as

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.540 
of them what's the best thing to do as
far<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.330> caring<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.229> plants<00:01:34.590> well<00:01:34.979> water<00:01:35.280> is

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
far as caring for plants well water is

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.790 
far as caring for plants well water is
very<00:01:36.149> important<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:36.959> want<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.289> over<00:01:37.590> or
