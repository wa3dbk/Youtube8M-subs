with a with a double kill supercharged
and<00:00:58.100> that's<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> got<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.730> probably

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and that's how I got this probably

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.529 
and that's how I got this probably
that's<00:01:00.390> why<00:01:00.539> cuz<00:01:01.289> i<00:01:01.440> won<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.920> 26<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> six<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that's why cuz i won like 26 and six I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.950 
that's why cuz i won like 26 and six I
think<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.799> my<00:01:04.979> KD<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:06.479> probably<00:01:06.780> just

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
think that was my KD I was probably just

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.170 
think that was my KD I was probably just
lucky<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.000> did

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
lucky it's really not just because I did

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
lucky it's really not just because I did
good<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.680> probably<00:01:10.860> look<00:01:11.570> um<00:01:12.570> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
good it was just probably look um so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:02:49.800 
good it was just probably look um so
yeah<00:01:13.439> enjoy<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.280> game<00:01:14.490> play

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.570 

so<00:02:50.810> as<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.140> saw<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.410> gun<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.860> really<00:02:52.220> good<00:02:52.400> for

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
so as you saw the gun is really good for

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.210 
so as you saw the gun is really good for
long-range<00:02:53.030> battles<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:54.500> it's<00:02:54.680> not<00:02:54.890> that

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
long-range battles but it's not that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.089 
long-range battles but it's not that
good<00:02:55.459> for<00:02:55.670> close<00:02:56.120> range<00:02:56.650> I'm<00:02:57.650> going<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.890> try<00:02:58.069> to

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
good for close range I'm going to try to

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.089 
good for close range I'm going to try to
attempt<00:02:58.520> some<00:02:59.150> close<00:02:59.450> close<00:03:00.050> range<00:03:00.620> battles

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
attempt some close close range battles

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.640 
attempt some close close range battles
here<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:02.270> what<00:03:02.390> does<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.900> not<00:03:03.050> really<00:03:03.260> that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
here and what does it's not really that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.270 
here and what does it's not really that
effective<00:03:04.569> because<00:03:05.739> people<00:03:06.739> have<00:03:06.830> shotguns

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
effective because people have shotguns

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.660 
effective because people have shotguns
and<00:03:07.400> stuff<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:08.800> having<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.830> hard<00:03:10.040> time<00:03:10.099> with

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
and stuff so having a hard time with

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.809 
and stuff so having a hard time with
this<00:03:11.860> see<00:03:12.860> it's<00:03:13.010> not<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.310> good<00:03:13.459> for<00:03:13.640> close

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
this see it's not that good for close

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.380 
this see it's not that good for close
range<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:15.530> reloads<00:03:16.430> really<00:03:17.420> fast<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:20.000> fastest

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
range it reloads really fast the fastest

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.090 
range it reloads really fast the fastest
reload<00:03:20.720> I've<00:03:20.840> ever<00:03:20.989> seen<00:03:21.670> falling<00:03:22.670> behind
