both have VGA front-facing cameras but

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.569 
both have VGA front-facing cameras but
we've<00:01:40.409> kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.680> saved<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.280> some<00:01:41.430> other

we've kind of saved this in some other

we've kind of saved this in some other
video<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.180> let's<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.780> right<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.810 
video so let's just get right on to the
meds<00:01:45.119> mark<00:01:45.890> we're<00:01:46.890> using<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.280> quadrant

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
meds mark we're using that quadrant

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.109 
meds mark we're using that quadrant
advanced<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:50.280> we'll<00:01:50.490> start<00:01:50.729> these<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:51.030> the

advanced and we'll start these at the
same<00:01:51.270> time<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> results<00:01:52.350> are

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
same time and see what the results are

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
same time and see what the results are
so<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.439> looking<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
bargain phone and you don't need to be

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.219 
bargain phone and you don't need to be

Alcatel Authority actually really
impressed<00:02:07.950> me<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.520> 15999<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:10.890> think<00:02:11.879> it's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
impressed me for 15999 I think it's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.250 
impressed me for 15999 I think it's
better<00:02:12.209> than

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
better than

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.140 
better than
the<00:02:13.379> Ascend<00:02:14.069> two<00:02:16.069> kind<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.159> with<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.849> screen

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
the Ascend two kind of with the screen

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.180 
the Ascend two kind of with the screen
kind<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.659> on<00:02:18.720> par<00:02:19.080> with<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.500> mercury<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:20.010> my

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
kind of on par with the mercury in my

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.850 
kind of on par with the mercury in my
opinion<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.909> lot<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.810> people<00:02:22.080> really<00:02:22.290> do<00:02:22.620> love

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
opinion a lot of people really do love

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.070 
opinion a lot of people really do love
their<00:02:23.040> Mercury's<00:02:23.489> but<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.849> me<00:02:23.970> when<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.840> saw<00:02:25.019> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
their Mercury's but to me when I saw the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530 
their Mercury's but to me when I saw the
mercury<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.650> was<00:02:25.950> thinking<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.150> little<00:02:27.420> bit

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
mercury I was thinking just a little bit

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.300 
mercury I was thinking just a little bit
less<00:02:27.750> than<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.959> droid<00:02:28.470> incredible<00:02:28.500> that's

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
less than the droid incredible that's

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.930 
less than the droid incredible that's
why<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.489> had<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:31.140> my<00:02:31.680> mind<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.430> they<00:02:32.730> draw

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
why I had in my mind and they draw

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.030 
why I had in my mind and they draw
incredible<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.629> course<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:34.410> really<00:02:34.709> old

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
incredible of course is really old

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.699 
incredible of course is really old
there's<00:02:35.400> there's<00:02:36.180> been<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.750> many<00:02:36.900> releases<00:02:37.290> of

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
there's there's been so many releases of

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.180 
there's there's been so many releases of
the<00:02:37.739> Incredibles<00:02:38.310> since<00:02:38.580> then<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:40.129> when<00:02:41.129> I

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the Incredibles since then and when I

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.039 
the Incredibles since then and when I
look<00:02:41.370> at<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.549> v8<00:02:41.819> thousand<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.360> think<00:02:42.599> about<00:02:42.810> a

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
look at the v8 thousand I think about a

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.140 
look at the v8 thousand I think about a
more<00:02:43.620> premium<00:02:43.980> device<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.489> little<00:02:44.909> bit<00:02:45.000> more

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
more premium device a little bit more

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.979 
more premium device a little bit more
premium<00:02:45.629> finish<00:02:46.530> like<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:48.650> photon<00:02:49.650> Q<00:02:50.989> with

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
premium finish like the photon Q with

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.880 
premium finish like the photon Q with
the<00:02:53.750> black<00:02:54.750> chrome<00:02:55.170> as<00:02:55.410> well<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:58.440> course<00:02:58.560> it's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
the black chrome as well of course it's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.319 
the black chrome as well of course it's
not<00:02:59.010> built<00:02:59.400> like<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.609> Motorola<00:03:00.030> device

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
not built like a Motorola device

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.360 
not built like a Motorola device
Motorola<00:03:00.780> devices<00:03:01.019> are<00:03:01.410> like<00:03:01.560> built<00:03:02.220> like

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
Motorola devices are like built like

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.230 
Motorola devices are like built like
bricks

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.360 

so<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.990> engage<00:03:10.230> should<00:03:10.530> have<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.950> Audrina

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
so the engage should have the Audrina

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.530 
so the engage should have the Audrina
2:05<00:03:12.210> I'm<00:03:12.570> not<00:03:12.720> sure<00:03:13.020> about<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.500> Alcatel

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
2:05 I'm not sure about the Alcatel

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.960 
2:05 I'm not sure about the Alcatel
authority<00:03:15.540> when<00:03:16.170> we<00:03:16.350> get<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.550> Nina

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
authority when we get on to the Nina

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.450 
authority when we get on to the Nina
mark<00:03:18.210> to<00:03:18.570> test<00:03:18.960> it'll<00:03:19.620> tell<00:03:19.920> us<00:03:20.070> what

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
mark to test it'll tell us what

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:31.530 
mark to test it'll tell us what
processor<00:03:21.120> graphics<00:03:21.510> processor<00:03:22.260> they<00:03:22.410> have

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.670 

so<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.799> V<00:03:33.159> 8,000<00:03:33.700> did<00:03:34.049> come<00:03:35.049> out<00:03:35.140> with<00:03:35.200> faster

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
so the V 8,000 did come out with faster

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.479 
so the V 8,000 did come out with faster
results<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.640> time<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:37.540> device<00:03:38.290> score<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.739> 27

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
results this time a device score of 27

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.020 
results this time a device score of 27
Oh<00:03:39.640> 8<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:41.290> device<00:03:41.560> score<00:03:41.860> over<00:03:42.040> here<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.430> 25

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
Oh 8 and a device score over here of 25

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.530 
Oh 8 and a device score over here of 25
24<00:03:43.750> now<00:03:44.409> I<00:03:44.439> had<00:03:44.799> actually<00:03:44.980> done<00:03:45.610> some<00:03:45.879> tests

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
24 now I had actually done some tests

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.380 
24 now I had actually done some tests
once<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:47.260> had<00:03:48.040> used<00:03:48.250> these<00:03:48.430> devices<00:03:48.610> little<00:03:49.239> and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
once I had used these devices little and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.360 
once I had used these devices little and
not<00:03:49.510> off<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.780> fresh<00:03:50.260> reboot<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.829> now<00:03:50.980> total

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
not off of fresh reboot and now total

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.910 
not off of fresh reboot and now total
Authority<00:03:51.790> had<00:03:52.450> edged<00:03:52.750> out<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.110> win<00:03:53.409> over<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.799> V

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
Authority had edged out a win over the V

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.569 
Authority had edged out a win over the V
8000<00:03:54.549> but<00:03:54.760> now<00:03:54.909> after<00:03:55.720> our<00:03:55.930> fresh<00:03:56.430> restart<00:03:57.430> it

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
8000 but now after our fresh restart it

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.349 
8000 but now after our fresh restart it

looks like the VA thousand pulls the

it shows that they do have similar

looks like these devices really do
perform<00:04:33.960> just<00:04:34.960> about<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.320> same<00:04:35.560> I'll<00:04:36.400> run<00:04:36.699> the

perform just about the same I'll run the

perform just about the same I'll run the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
test one more time and then I'll give

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.740 
test one more time and then I'll give
you<00:04:38.500> just<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.430> final<00:04:39.970> total<00:04:40.389> scores<00:04:42.539> and<00:04:43.539> then

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
you just the final total scores and then

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.129 
you just the final total scores and then
