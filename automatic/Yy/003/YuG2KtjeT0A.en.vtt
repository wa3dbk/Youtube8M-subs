I'm over here introducing our new skis

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.560 
I'm over here introducing our new skis
and<00:00:16.820> boots<00:00:16.910> an<00:00:17.119> efficient<00:00:17.570> line<00:00:17.720> um<00:00:18.610> and<00:00:19.610> I'm

this is the quadrant it's Abby's came
out<00:00:32.350> um<00:00:33.350> about<00:00:34.129> six<00:00:34.340> years<00:00:34.400> ago<00:00:34.610> we<00:00:34.879> saw<00:00:35.030> an

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
out um about six years ago we saw an

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.530 
out um about six years ago we saw an
opportunity<00:00:35.559> in<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.710> boot<00:00:36.860> market<00:00:37.540> people

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
opportunity in the boot market people

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.759 
opportunity in the boot market people
are<00:00:38.600> getting<00:00:38.720> stiffer<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.230> stiffer<00:00:39.350> daty

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
are getting stiffer and stiffer daty

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.530 
are getting stiffer and stiffer daty
boots<00:00:40.190> but<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.519> lot<00:00:40.940> of<00:00:41.000> people<00:00:41.059> returning

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
boots but a lot of people returning

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.610 
boots but a lot of people returning
under<00:00:41.809> Alpine<00:00:42.140> boots<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:44.260> we<00:00:45.260> decided<00:00:45.559> to

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
under Alpine boots and we decided to

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.180 
under Alpine boots and we decided to
come<00:00:45.739> out<00:00:45.830> with<00:00:45.979> the<00:00:46.190> factory<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.010> his<00:00:49.010> face

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
come out with the factory and his face

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.350 
come out with the factory and his face
of<00:00:49.370> pain<00:00:49.580> rather<00:00:50.449> than<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:51.610> stiff<00:00:52.610> ATT<00:00:53.030> boot<00:00:53.239> we

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
of pain rather than a stiff ATT boot we

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.670 
of pain rather than a stiff ATT boot we
wanted<00:00:53.659> to<00:00:53.720> bring<00:00:53.900> an<00:00:54.080> Alpine<00:00:54.379> boot<00:00:54.530> with<00:00:54.620> a

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
wanted to bring an Alpine boot with a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.700 
wanted to bring an Alpine boot with a
walk<00:00:54.860> mode<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.420> have<00:00:56.420> here<00:00:56.690> been<00:00:57.379> out<00:00:57.530> for<00:00:57.680> a

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
walk mode and have here been out for a

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.660 
walk mode and have here been out for a
few<00:00:57.769> years<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:58.820> think<00:00:59.710> we're<00:01:00.710> spot<00:01:01.250> on<00:01:01.460> on

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
few years and I think we're spot on on

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.850 
few years and I think we're spot on on
on<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:02.540> market<00:01:03.290> need<00:01:03.470> there<00:01:04.150> right<00:01:05.150> now

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
on the market need there right now

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.080 
on the market need there right now
definitely<00:01:06.860> address<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.340> people<00:01:07.610> counting

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
definitely address the people counting

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.300 
definitely address the people counting
grams<00:01:08.330> that's<00:01:09.260> a<00:01:09.320> very<00:01:09.350> versatile<00:01:09.890> boot<00:01:10.130> in

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
grams that's a very versatile boot in

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.719 
grams that's a very versatile boot in
bounds<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:10.790> out<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:11.000> bounds<00:01:11.119> on<00:01:11.450> piste<00:01:11.750> off

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
bounds and out of bounds on piste off

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.710 
bounds and out of bounds on piste off
but<00:01:13.729> there's<00:01:13.909> a<00:01:13.970> lot<00:01:14.090> of<00:01:14.119> people<00:01:14.420> out<00:01:14.479> there

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
but there's a lot of people out there

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.590 
but there's a lot of people out there
that<00:01:14.930> count<00:01:15.770> engrams<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.460> here<00:01:16.820> we<00:01:16.969> kind<00:01:17.570> of

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
that count engrams and here we kind of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.289 
that count engrams and here we kind of
came<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.810> long<00:01:18.020> way<00:01:18.259> maybe<00:01:18.920> two<00:01:19.670> hours<00:01:19.729> here

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
came a long way maybe two hours here

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.569 
came a long way maybe two hours here
something<00:01:21.229> like<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.920> weight<00:01:22.430> is

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
something like that and weight is

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.609 
something like that and weight is
important<00:01:22.969> but<00:01:23.270> for<00:01:23.990> us<00:01:24.140> it's<00:01:24.320> not<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.590> end

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
important but for us it's not the end

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.880 
important but for us it's not the end
all<00:01:24.890> be<00:01:24.950> all<00:01:25.600> we<00:01:26.600> still<00:01:26.869> want<00:01:27.289> to<00:01:27.350> have<00:01:27.530> a

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
all be all we still want to have a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.529 
all be all we still want to have a
high-performance<00:01:28.490> boot<00:01:29.149> there's<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.420> lot<00:01:29.509> of

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
high-performance boot there's a lot of

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:30.999 
high-performance boot there's a lot of
boots<00:01:29.750> out<00:01:29.960> there<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:30.320> are<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:30.950> are

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
boots out there that are that are

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.060 
boots out there that are that are
lightweight<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.719> you<00:01:33.649> sacrifice

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
lightweight that you you sacrifice

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.919 
lightweight that you you sacrifice
performance<00:01:34.520> or<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:34.909> have<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.060> lower<00:01:35.270> cuff<00:01:35.600> or

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
performance or you have a lower cuff or

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.639 
performance or you have a lower cuff or
a<00:01:35.960> an<00:01:36.229> insignificant<00:01:36.859> liner<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.390> we<00:01:39.350> wanted

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
a an insignificant liner and we wanted

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.919 
a an insignificant liner and we wanted
to<00:01:39.679> build<00:01:39.829> a<00:01:39.979> boot<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.310> uh<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:41.509> skis<00:01:41.719> well

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
to build a boot that uh the skis well

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.080 
to build a boot that uh the skis well
but<00:01:42.320> is<00:01:42.439> also<00:01:42.590> lightweight<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.700> one<00:01:43.880> here

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
but is also lightweight this one here

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.889 
but is also lightweight this one here
way<00:01:44.380> 1715<00:01:45.380> grams<00:01:45.710> if<00:01:46.700> you<00:01:47.299> if<00:01:47.570> you're<00:01:47.719> counting

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
way 1715 grams if you if you're counting

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.510 
way 1715 grams if you if you're counting
grams<00:01:48.350> you're<00:01:48.649> you're<00:01:48.979> looking<00:01:49.280> for<00:01:49.460> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
grams you're you're looking for the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.950 
grams you're you're looking for the
conservation<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.179> energy<00:01:50.299> really<00:01:50.749> going

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
conservation of energy really going

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.749 
conservation of energy really going
uphill<00:01:51.109> and<00:01:51.950> that's<00:01:52.159> where<00:01:52.369> I<00:01:52.399> think<00:01:52.490> it's

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
uphill and that's where I think it's

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.020 
uphill and that's where I think it's
under<00:01:52.960> kind<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.020> estimated<00:01:54.590> how<00:01:54.979> much<00:01:55.159> force

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
under kind of estimated how much force

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.029 
under kind of estimated how much force
you're<00:01:56.240> taking<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.899> using<00:01:57.289> when<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.890> are

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
you're taking and using when you are

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.069 
you're taking and using when you are
hiking<00:01:58.249> and<00:01:58.729> if<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:58.999> don't<00:01:59.179> have<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.420> large

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
hiking and if you don't have a large

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.630 
hiking and if you don't have a large
range<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.499> motion<00:02:00.890> or<00:02:01.009> you<00:02:01.130> have<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> tongue

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
range of motion or you have a tongue

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.340 
range of motion or you have a tongue
that<00:02:01.819> you're<00:02:01.939> flexing<00:02:02.359> against<00:02:02.659> we've<00:02:03.259> been

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
that you're flexing against we've been

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.709 
that you're flexing against we've been
measuring<00:02:03.590> how<00:02:03.979> much<00:02:04.039> force<00:02:04.399> it<00:02:04.549> takes<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:04.999> we

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
measuring how much force it takes and we

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.419 
measuring how much force it takes and we
think<00:02:05.929> that<00:02:06.049> we're<00:02:06.289> actually<00:02:06.469> introducing<00:02:07.369> a

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
think that we're actually introducing a

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.219 
think that we're actually introducing a
conservation<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.210> energy<00:02:08.330> concept<00:02:09.050> going

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
conservation of energy concept going

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.740 
conservation of energy concept going
uphill<00:02:09.470> yes<00:02:10.069> it's<00:02:10.280> light<00:02:10.490> but<00:02:10.729> it's<00:02:11.240> also<00:02:11.330> a

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
uphill yes it's light but it's also a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.300 
uphill yes it's light but it's also a
large<00:02:12.110> freedom<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.650> movement<00:02:12.800> where<00:02:13.190> you're

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
large freedom of movement where you're

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.710 
large freedom of movement where you're
not<00:02:13.430> using<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.850> lot<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.030> energy<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:15.520> think

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
not using a lot of energy so I think

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.510 
not using a lot of energy so I think
think<00:02:17.720> think<00:02:18.200> Rana<00:02:18.380> something<00:02:18.710> here

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
think think Rana something here

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.580 
think think Rana something here
so<00:02:20.910> now<00:02:21.030> we're<00:02:21.150> at<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.270> bottom<00:02:21.600> epic<00:02:22.260> descent

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
so now we're at the bottom epic descent

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.030 
so now we're at the bottom epic descent
grandma<00:02:23.010> day<00:02:23.780> with<00:02:24.780> some<00:02:24.960> interesting<00:02:25.290> willow

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
grandma day with some interesting willow

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.300 
grandma day with some interesting willow
skiing<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.520> bottom<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.650> want<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.190> show

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
skiing at the bottom but I want to show

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.290 
skiing at the bottom but I want to show
you<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.460> little<00:02:29.550> bit<00:02:29.640> more<00:02:29.790> about<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.060> range<00:02:30.210> of

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
you a little bit more about the range of

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.270 
you a little bit more about the range of
motion<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.840> rearward<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.990> great<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.500> flats

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
motion the rearward is great for flats

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.640 
motion the rearward is great for flats
ideally<00:02:36.270> you're<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.690> uphill<00:02:36.840> sometime<00:02:37.440> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
ideally you're going uphill sometime and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.800 
ideally you're going uphill sometime and
that's<00:02:38.520> where<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.000> lot<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.330> boots<00:02:39.540> come<00:02:39.720> up

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that's where a lot of boots come up

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.540 
that's where a lot of boots come up
short<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.760> have<00:02:41.880> 40<00:02:42.240> degrees<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.660> rotation

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
short and we have 40 degrees of rotation

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.030 
short and we have 40 degrees of rotation
through<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.790> rearward<00:02:45.180> 20<00:02:45.540> degrees<00:02:45.780> back<00:02:46.040> 20

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
through the rearward 20 degrees back 20

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.680 
through the rearward 20 degrees back 20
degrees<00:02:47.280> forward<00:02:47.550> lot<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.030> boots<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.390> fine

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
degrees forward lot of boots have fine

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.440 
degrees forward lot of boots have fine
rearward<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.460> have<00:02:50.610> too<00:02:50.820> much<00:02:50.970> you're

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
rearward but if you have too much you're

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.940 
rearward but if you have too much you're
using<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.780> lot<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:51.960> your<00:02:52.230> hamstring<00:02:52.740> just

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
using a lot of your hamstring just

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.220 
using a lot of your hamstring just
pulling<00:02:53.400> yourself<00:02:53.490> along<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.990> get<00:02:55.170> a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
pulling yourself along so to get a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.220 
pulling yourself along so to get a
really<00:02:55.530> long<00:02:55.680> stride<00:02:56.780> forward<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:58.050> pretty

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
really long stride forward is pretty

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.950 
really long stride forward is pretty
critical<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.790> that's<00:03:00.090> where<00:03:00.330> this

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
critical and that's where this

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.950 
critical and that's where this
technology<00:03:01.620> allows<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.910> that

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
technology allows you to have that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.110 
technology allows you to have that
resistance<00:03:03.960> free<00:03:04.170> tour<00:03:04.410> mode<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.880> then<00:03:06.030> I'm

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
resistance free tour mode and then I'm

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.870 
resistance free tour mode and then I'm
gonna<00:03:06.240> get<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.540> top<00:03:07.340> lock<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.520> back<00:03:08.610> down

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
gonna get to the top lock it back down

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.960 
gonna get to the top lock it back down
and<00:03:09.980> now<00:03:10.980> you're<00:03:11.100> ready<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.310> go<00:03:11.490> down<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:11.940> a
