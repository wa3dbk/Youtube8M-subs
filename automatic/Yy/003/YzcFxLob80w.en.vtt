00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.780
 hello skeleton jana today I will teach you 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.480
 The easiest way to remove enamel 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.880
 in the nail and it's going to be very simple what 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.150
 let's see very fast as with a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.020
 scissors and cut half of the cotton that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.020
 I already have a clean hand in Japan 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.770
 the cotton in nail polish remover I always 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.770
 I use without acetone 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.860
 and now it's very easy and cut back 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.860
 to the size of our nail 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.940
 and I put it 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.230
 yes that I fall 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.080
 I would like to talk a little while this 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.480
 I leave a few minutes more or less of the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.430
 importance that he has now makes the 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.250
 movement that I'm going to do when 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.600
 we remove the excess paint 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.510
 makeup 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.910
 it does not matter if we have glitter and that 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.580
 kind of things that we usually lose in 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.250
 the nail the movement at the time of 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.240
 remove the cotton there is a movement 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.630
 circular nothing error and that action 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 so the nail the truth is that the assaults and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.729
 then the easiest way to remove it 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:04.220
 it is thus less aggressively to the nail assault 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:07.070
 minus the cuticle and the truth is that 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.150
 Let's go without enamel in the moments 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.510
 It is very simple and very easy and I tell you 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.430
 if you have glitter some extras is 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.750
 easier to remove it the only thing 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.780
 we have to do is because it is 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:27.250
 soaked leaves us a little doing that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.970
 movement like this to remove it and be 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.970
 you see how easy 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.430
 I believe that with this 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.400
 although it seems a very simple video me 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.829
 go forget stick is very 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.620
 important the nail always has to 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.959
 be well taken care of and care begins 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.180
 from a good makeup does not matter only 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.430
 or it is not necessary to always have it well 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:08.310
 make-up care begins from the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.050
 most basic makeup or 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.740
 moisturize and keep your hands always well 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.310
 clean 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.390
 you were already 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.390
 make is easy 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.820
 goodbye
