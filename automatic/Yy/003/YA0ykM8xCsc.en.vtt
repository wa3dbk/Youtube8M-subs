00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.340
 that song that we like too much and you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.770
 like to share it in a fast way 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.289
 without having to write it on twitter 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.579

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.410

 make videos about this do not go to 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.740
 Take the time to do it, which are the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.450
 precautionary measures you should take in 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.180

 junk tweets good friends once here 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.110
 we enter our music application 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.970
 as an example I'm in albums we're going to 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.140
 your teacher intro 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.450
 wait for me a problem 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.060
 let's go back to start 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.019
 in theory 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.879
 and that's what I needed to forgive 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.439
 the interruption but it is the first time 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.659
 that this tweet comes out and it made me very 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.939
 good as you can see I have the 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.260
 lyrics in all my songs and it's something 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.790
 very nice because I am very 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.340
 perfectionist in what is my music 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.400
 because my space is my music 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.150
 good perfection as you can observe 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.480
 Here is an option to share 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.430
 a button to have to explain to 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.790
 put twitter message mail on facebook 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.859
 places that I'm going to put the twitter and like 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.989
 can observe appear directly 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.989
 tweet we send 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.850
 perfect 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.070
 how can it sound like that what he studied 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.920
 the tweet if I want I can publish it in 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.020
 facebook was excellent because some 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.390
 before 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.160
 for what that particular song 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.050
 that we all like or that you say 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.780
 this song must be heard by my 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.150
 friends so to publish them is not 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.340
 from more good friends on my part that's 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.020
 all remember my name is Jorge and this 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.020
