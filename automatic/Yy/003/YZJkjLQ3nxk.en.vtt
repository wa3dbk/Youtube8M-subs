00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.130
 to the two chalets these terms to youtube 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.780
 and in this video I'm going to show you some 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.030
 tweets was decided for it 7 that I have 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.619
 seemed very good the first tweet that 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.629
 I'm going to show you it's called top flow and 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.580
 you can find it for free in 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.650
 the Mayan repository and that as always 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.720
 I'm going to leave you here below good 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.670
 basically what this tweet does is 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.620
 create animations in the dock of our 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.180
 device as you are seeing once 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.740
 that we have installed it, let's go to 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.080
 adjustments where we will create a small 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.640
 direct access as you see is here bar 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.350
 the dock in which we will be able to 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.460
 set up a little bit this click we're going to 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.859
 be able to enable or 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.399
 disable the tweet choose the space 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.199
 between the icons choose the speed and 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.789
 choose the perspective is worth then here 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.829
 we have the topics that we can choose that 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.499
 as you are going to see are many are worth I do not 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.239
 I am in wii as you have seen and I am going to 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.699
 change for example blue inderba I'm going 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.199
 to teach you some subjects so you can see 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.569
 well, a little bit what can 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.639
 offer this ticket this would be a cylinder 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:01.489
 ok we could for example for example 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:03.859
 modify the distance between icons 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.950
 let's modify it so you can see a 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.840
 How does it work? Let's put it on 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.770
 well let's put it a little bigger 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.619
 to see how 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.750
 As you can see, that was how it was before and now 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.869
 As you can see, well, there is more distance 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:25.060
 between the icons we are going to put another theme 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:27.939
 for example this cover flow let's see 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.579
 how is it worth and good and could 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.289
 continue then good seeing what is the theme 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.939
 what do you like best to implement it in 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.740
 your device the truth is that it is 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.469
 a very good customization tweet 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.319
 that I would join it with a tweet like 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.729
 it could be barrel or some series of 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.200
 personalization the truth is that it is a 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.179
 very cool tweet and as I said 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.039
 you can find it for free in 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.420
 the mod my repository in the next 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.610
 tour that I 'm going to teach you is called 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.289
 homeland status bar and you can find it 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.659
 free in the repository 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.579
 zanetti as always I'll leave it 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.349
 over here underneath what does this 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.479
 tweet as its own name indicates is 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.489
 create us a battery bar in the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.920
 status bar of our devices is worth 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:08.500
 as you see here in the status bar I have 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.390
 a green bar that tells me the before the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.950
 forgiveness battery that I have left is worth as 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.810
 I'm saying good once we have 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.549
 install this tweet let's go to settings 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.790
 where will you create a content access 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.579
 direct 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.709
 as you can see here is battery status bar 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.209
 in which we will be able to configure a 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.040
 little this trick ok we will be able to 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.400
 enable you can enable this tweet 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.290
 choose the width of the bar voucher 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.390
 battery that create us the status varies 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.670
 I have to top it is worth as you see then good 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.769
 occupies all status bar we could we can 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.239
 putting it thinner or thicker is worth this 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.430
 is the thickest thing that can be put as 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.129
 you are seeing choose where we want the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.900
 bar up in the middle or down and 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.780
 choose the color of the bar is worth it 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.730
 I turned green because well as the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.829
 batteries we usually put them in color 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.379
 green but you can choose the color that 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.980
 whatever you want because changing patterns 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.599
 good red green blue and yellow vale 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.010
 to make all colors 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.079
 well as you can see, it's a pretty tutu 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.480
 original and then well you can be 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.950
 quite useful for displaying the battery 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.989
 to your device in a way 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.579
 different the last tweet that I'm going to 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.349
 teaching is called safe house and you can 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.120
 find it for free on 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.470
 repository of times that is not what I'm going 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.299
 to leave here below as the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.129
 previous tweets because it's coming by 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.229
 defect when doing jailbreak in our 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.240
 device and therefore we already have it 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.550
 all installed 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.650
 good that is this tweet this tweet and what 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.390
 what it does is interact a bit with the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.670
 lock code of our device 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.520
 for I will give an example so 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.550
 you understand me well with this tweet 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.470
 I can choose a network worth the one that I 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.660
 I connect frequently as can be the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.910
 from my house and when I'm connected to that 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.610
 network my device is not going to have code 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.740
 of security is good if I left home 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.630
 ok and I was not connected to that network 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.550
 man connect to another that is not my 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.470
 house is not the place where I live that 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.170
 frequented as an office or any 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.910
 site would have security code I 'm going 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.470
 to make a demonstration worth once 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.960
 that you have installed this tweet let's go 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.660
 to adjustments where we create a small 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.810
 direct access as you see we are going to 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.430
 see let's see it is here 6 hawes in 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.580
 which we will be able to enable is 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.890
 enable the tweet and choose a network 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.170
 good that it is then in which we want 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.940
 that our device does not have the 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.890
 security code and in my case I have 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.260
 since the in my house I called wlan 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.810
 b4 and while in my house has 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.030
 connected to this wifi network my device 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.750
 will not have security code 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.000
 I 'm going to block it, I 'm going to unlock it and 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.790
 As you can see, it does not have a security code 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.770
 If I left home or disconnected 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.970
 disconnect forgiveness from this network or I 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.520
 connect be another vale I'm going to 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.940
 disconnect it my device would have 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.130
 security code because then good 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.110
 with this tweet I would think that I'm in a 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.910
 unsafe site is worth it or I'm not in 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.550
 house therefore the code is activated 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.500
 security I'm going to remove the wifi it's worth 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.770
 I 'm going from home, I 'm going to block my 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.020
 device I'm going to unlock it and how 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.990
 you see the code appears that judgment is worth 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.669
 which in this case is 3 883 this tweet is 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.890
 very useful so good for all those 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.410
 occasions when we are at home that 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.120
 we do not want it to be good when 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.530
 we unlocked our device that 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.640
 is appearing all the time the 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.440
 security code 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.970
 however, when we leave, it's worth 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.650
 yes we need it in case we 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.030
 they steal since we have a lot of 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.520
 important information in our 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.200
 device we will have all the advantages 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.210
 to have security code 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.650
 good guys this I feel for today a 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.690
