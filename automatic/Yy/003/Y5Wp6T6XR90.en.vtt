let's<00:03:10.980> talk<00:03:11.069> about<00:03:11.130> those<00:03:11.430> controls<00:03:11.850> the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
let's talk about those controls the

let's talk about those controls the
touchpad<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.959> interesting<00:03:13.590> but

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
touchpad is interesting but

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.800 
touchpad is interesting but
unfortunately<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:14.730> far<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.000> can't<00:03:15.330> see<00:03:15.510> any<00:03:15.660> way

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
unfortunately so far I can't see any way

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.280 
unfortunately so far I can't see any way
to<00:03:15.840> use<00:03:16.080> it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
to use it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.600 
to use it
ergonomically<00:03:16.799> while<00:03:17.100> at<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> same<00:03:17.430> time

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
ergonomically while at the same time

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.580 
ergonomically while at the same time
accessing<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.390> sticks<00:03:18.630> or<00:03:18.780> buttons<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.319> this

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
accessing the sticks or buttons so this

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.410 
accessing the sticks or buttons so this
means<00:03:19.830> it'll<00:03:20.069> probably<00:03:20.130> be<00:03:20.730> used<00:03:20.940> for<00:03:21.150> menu

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
means it'll probably be used for menu

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.789 
means it'll probably be used for menu
movement<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.200> occasional<00:03:22.650> game

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
movement and the occasional game

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.229 
movement and the occasional game
specifically<00:03:23.340> designed<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.850> work<00:03:24.090> in

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
specifically designed to work in

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.759 
specifically designed to work in
conjunction<00:03:24.299> with<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:25.019> touchpad<00:03:25.260> in<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.620> move

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
conjunction with a touchpad in the move

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.920 
conjunction with a touchpad in the move
but<00:03:26.340> adding<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.730> touchpad<00:03:26.910> probably<00:03:27.600> does<00:03:27.780> mean

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
but adding a touchpad probably does mean

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.569 
but adding a touchpad probably does mean
we'll<00:03:28.109> see<00:03:28.230> more<00:03:28.410> ports<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.010> most<00:03:29.190> popular

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
we'll see more ports of the most popular

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.610 
we'll see more ports of the most popular
mobile<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.150> tablet<00:03:30.450> games<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.900> ps4<00:03:31.140> it's

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
mobile and tablet games to the ps4 it's

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.410 
mobile and tablet games to the ps4 it's
not<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> touchscreen<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.670> course<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:33.269> the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
not a touchscreen of course but the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.940 
not a touchscreen of course but the
touch<00:03:33.570> pads<00:03:33.810> close<00:03:34.079> enough<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.620> biggest

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
touch pads close enough that the biggest

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.349 
touch pads close enough that the biggest
games<00:03:35.190> will<00:03:35.400> find<00:03:35.579> a<00:03:35.640> way<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.790> make<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.060> work

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
games will find a way to make it work

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.729 
games will find a way to make it work
but<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.780> most<00:03:36.959> interesting<00:03:37.440> thing<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.620> me

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
but the most interesting thing to me

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.110 
but the most interesting thing to me
about<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:38.100> controller<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.790> built<00:03:39.000> in

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
about the controller is that built in

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.210 
about the controller is that built in
move<00:03:39.359> bar<00:03:39.660> we've<00:03:40.109> never<00:03:40.320> really<00:03:40.500> had<00:03:40.769> motion

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
move bar we've never really had motion

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.920 
move bar we've never really had motion
controls<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.790> allow<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.060> player<00:03:42.150> access<00:03:42.810> to

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
all the sticks and buttons of a regular

controller at the same time by combining
the<00:03:46.560> two<00:03:46.590> it'll<00:03:46.980> certainly<00:03:47.160> allow<00:03:47.519> for<00:03:47.730> some

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
the two it'll certainly allow for some

the two it'll certainly allow for some

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
the spatial location of the controller

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.940 
the spatial location of the controller
it<00:03:51.570> opens<00:03:51.810> up<00:03:51.930> everything<00:03:52.170> from<00:03:52.350> using<00:03:52.859> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
touchscreen but it certainly opens up

new possibilities for design and on the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.940 
software side Gaikai streaming games is
probably<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.959> most<00:04:07.079> exciting<00:04:07.410> thing<00:04:07.739> in<00:04:07.829> my

probably the most exciting thing in my
mind<00:04:08.100> first<00:04:08.609> because<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.060> opens<00:04:09.329> up<00:04:09.420> whole<00:04:09.630> new

handle very well so it seems like the
share<00:05:53.009> feature<00:05:53.219> is<00:05:53.429> an<00:05:53.550> answer<00:05:53.789> to<00:05:53.909> a<00:05:53.939> problem

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:54.149 
share feature is an answer to a problem

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:56.209

that<00:05:54.479> doesn't<00:05:54.659> really<00:05:54.869> exist<00:05:55.050> or<00:05:55.439> at<00:05:55.769> best<00:05:55.800> a

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
that doesn't really exist or at best a

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:57.649 
that doesn't really exist or at best a
poor<00:05:56.429> solution<00:05:56.729> to<00:05:56.999> something<00:05:57.179> that<00:05:57.360> YouTube

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
poor solution to something that YouTube

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.179 
poor solution to something that YouTube
already<00:05:57.959> does<00:05:58.079> well<00:05:58.259> and<00:05:58.499> I<00:05:58.829> bet<00:05:59.039> you'll

00:05:59.179 --> 00:05:59.189 
already does well and I bet you'll

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:00.439 
already does well and I bet you'll
probably<00:05:59.339> be<00:05:59.639> able<00:05:59.699> to<00:05:59.849> get<00:05:59.939> to<00:06:00.029> YouTube<00:06:00.300> from

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
probably be able to get to YouTube from

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.359 
probably be able to get to YouTube from
your<00:06:00.569> ps4<00:06:00.779> also<00:06:01.649> I've<00:06:01.800> been<00:06:01.829> told<00:06:02.129> they're

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:02.369 
your ps4 also I've been told they're

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:03.499 
your ps4 also I've been told they're
thinking<00:06:02.639> about<00:06:02.699> letting<00:06:02.999> the<00:06:03.179> EyeToy

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
thinking about letting the EyeToy

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.149 
thinking about letting the EyeToy
livestream<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.139> person<00:06:04.559> playing<00:06:04.800> the<00:06:04.889> game

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
livestream the person playing the game

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.609 
livestream the person playing the game
so<00:06:05.189> look<00:06:06.059> forward<00:06:06.239> to<00:06:06.329> that<00:06:06.419> anyway<00:06:07.229> it'll<00:06:07.499> be

00:06:07.609 --> 00:06:07.619 
so look forward to that anyway it'll be

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:08.929 
so look forward to that anyway it'll be
interesting<00:06:07.800> to<00:06:07.979> see<00:06:08.099> what<00:06:08.249> Microsoft<00:06:08.729> brings

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
interesting to see what Microsoft brings

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.409 
interesting to see what Microsoft brings
to<00:06:09.059> the<00:06:09.149> table<00:06:09.419> now<00:06:09.539> we'll<00:06:09.989> see<00:06:10.050> you<00:06:10.139> next<00:06:10.229> week
