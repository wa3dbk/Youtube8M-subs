my best I'm suggesting it's a good one
of<00:03:55.730> five<00:03:56.270> and<00:03:56.720> it's<00:03:57.290> not<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.560> bad<00:03:57.830> choice<00:03:57.890> one<00:03:58.490> of

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
of five and it's not a bad choice one of

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.220 
of five and it's not a bad choice one of
the<00:03:58.670> apples<00:03:58.940> if<00:03:59.210> you<00:03:59.330> were<00:03:59.450> only<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.870> have<00:03:59.960> one

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
the apples if you were only to have one

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.110 
the apples if you were only to have one
Apple<00:04:00.590> in<00:04:00.740> your<00:04:00.890> tree<00:04:01.130> in<00:04:01.250> your<00:04:01.340> garden<00:04:01.670> it

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
Apple in your tree in your garden it

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.550 
Apple in your tree in your garden it
isn't<00:04:02.420> this<00:04:02.570> isn't<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.930> choice<00:04:03.110> you'd<00:04:03.380> regret

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
isn't this isn't a choice you'd regret

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:31.210 
isn't this isn't a choice you'd regret
probably<00:04:28.360> so<00:04:29.360> these<00:04:29.480> are<00:04:29.690> for<00:04:30.220> Winchester

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
Lord Lambourn we've got we planted

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.870 
Lord Lambourn we've got we planted
originally<00:04:36.620> hundred<00:04:37.040> of<00:04:37.160> these<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.730> we

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
originally hundred of these and we

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.850 
originally hundred of these and we
decided<00:04:38.300> they<00:04:38.510> were<00:04:38.600> too<00:04:38.750> close<00:04:38.990> together<00:04:39.170> so

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
decided they were too close together so

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.080 
decided they were too close together so
we<00:04:39.920> removed<00:04:40.190> every<00:04:40.400> other<00:04:40.520> once<00:04:40.730> we've<00:04:40.940> got

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
we removed every other once we've got

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.930 
we removed every other once we've got
about<00:04:41.270> about<00:04:41.750> forty<00:04:42.200> six<00:04:42.530> of<00:04:42.860> these<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.430> they

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
about about forty six of these and they

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.180 
about about forty six of these and they
pay<00:04:44.150> for<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.420> pay<00:04:44.630> well<00:04:44.840> most<00:04:45.110> years<00:04:45.440> it's<00:04:45.740> I
