00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello to all and welcome to this live 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.899
 play heavy rain or playing at the big 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.790
 Rain in France is a game published by 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.920
 sony directed by quantic dream and you 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.210
 already know all this is not it so 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.980
 after this fade to black completely 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.440
 useless we find ourselves in front of a guy in 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
 slip that visibly wakes up towards 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.990
 noon visibly on the mercury planet 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.820
 given the power of the sun's rays and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.619
 that sums up just about all the game 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.880
 we see an arrow we press on it if 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.109
 we do because the game asks either 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.000
 remains stuck like a tale in bed 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.500
 all day and I do not move forward 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.480
 the other characters tell you 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.489
 good fuck fuck you and continue to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.840
 live their little life and that's what 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.290
 I love it is that if we get to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.610
 plant 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.170
 the character is left with 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.170
 spasms uncontrollable and ridiculous 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 In short, I feel that it is not the first 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.500
 time it's going to happen 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.430
