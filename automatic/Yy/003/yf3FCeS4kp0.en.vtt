00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 new pope election looks like 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.310
 come to a standstill an hour ago from the furnace 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.379
 pipes of the sistine chapel in the vatican 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.360
 heavy black smoke was falling again 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.500
 This means that none of the applicants 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.799
 the required number of cardinal votes 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.630
 electors did not get when to wait 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.680
 the results of the next vote are not 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.720
 how much can it take 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.699
 ask the browser you this 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.410
 Vladimir Gloucester Vadim Gluzsky he 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.939
 comes out live from Rome to one 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.939
 agree apparently was not easy 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.219
 Well, while it was not easy to agree 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.980
 recall that 8 years ago when Cardinal 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.800
 Joseph Ratzinger was the clear favorite this 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.870
 it took him 2 days and four tours 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.879
 voting to be elected by 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.550
 pontiff this time clear favorites 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.539
 some therefore really smoke 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.520
 today was falling for a long time it was thick black 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.399
 smoke is exactly the same as the day before 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.280
 late in the evening at this minute cardinals 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.039
 have lunch despite what is going on now 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 fasting is not only holy spirit 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.640
 eat cardinal here for example by 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 Information which published today 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.470
 the italian press the night before at dinner 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.439
 cardinals fed pasta with tomatoes 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.420
 soup Minister and he and a plate of cheeses and 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.580
 what else many have paid attention to is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.130
 which is theoretically yes and practically in 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.140
 principle during conclave cardinals 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.600
 absolutely cut off from the world they can't 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.729
 use her phone not internet 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.470
 and even the windows of the hotel of saint marta where 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 they live during conclave must be 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.820
 closed so God forbid nobody saw 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.270
 what happens behind the walls of this hotel 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.800
 so yesterday to three in the morning 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.360
 holy march burned light 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.580
 the cardinals did not disagree despite 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.290
 their old age did not go to sleep 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.070
 clearly discussed over and over again 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.790
 agreed or tried 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.680
 agree 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.240
 but no less than 2 today's morning 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.740
 round of voting again as we have already 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.860
 We understood nor to no avail and so who 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.140
 dimensions 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.570
 until he alone is the cardinal lara 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.850
 angelo skola he was considered the favorite and up 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.680
 start conclaves again leaks 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.540
 because officially the same information from 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.580
 the walls of the sistine chapel are not there 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.290
 leaks all the same yesterday and this morning 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.780
 more than 50 voted for him 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.240
 cardinals but this is clearly not enough for him 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.060
 to be elected pontiff we recall 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.090
 for this he needs support 77 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.760
 cardinals electors karina milano 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.380
 angelo skola reformer he favors 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.570
 like a fierce foe 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.550
 Roman Curia the only thing that him 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.950
 mostly cardinals are charged with 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.720
 north america is his political 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.760
 engagement you are very connected with 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.100
 real politics and being 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.170
 the archbishop of milan claims that he 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.750
 is spiritual father ex-prime minister 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.010
 silvio berlusconi and this aspect 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.530
 political aspect where 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.120
 Chipped activities do not arrange 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.800
 cardinals again i repeat in 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.020
 mostly from psycho america 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.900
 his main opponent is the challenger 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.980
 competitor is a protege of the Roman curia 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.010
 cardinal 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.290
 from Brazil a bit of bedrock sherrahhe squeaks 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.030
 sÃ£o paulo and even before yesterday he 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.280
 was also one of the favorites but again 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.070
 on the leak last night for 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.989
 he voted only 30 cardinals 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.690
 what does it say that all night 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.820
 and this morning Roman curia hastily 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.070
 looking for a new candidate after all 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.260
 you need to put your 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.420
 which will not allow for example leaks 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.000
 Wikileaks dossier publication in press 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.459
 which is so annoying if you can 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.380
 speak cardinals roman curia in 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.120
 anyways new challenger today 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.670
 there was this american cardinal 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.530
 timati ad-davan is a cardinal blogger 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.120
 who is already famous for streaming here 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.100
 he participates in the conclave for the first time 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.360
 the day before he declared the production of sucre 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.300
 mental phrase in conclave 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.440
 poorly fed this phrase is just quoted 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.090
 today with all italian 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.200
 observers all say indignantly 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.300
 well, what about an american 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.460
 he just does not know all the charms of ours 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.560
 italian food but that's all what 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.540
 called technical details that's all 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.430
 information leakage is so curious 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.680
 even fun details 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.770
 voting continues after about 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.690
 three o'clock 115 electoral cardinals again 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.580
 will enter the Sistine Chapel in the evening yet 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.650
 two rounds of voting and about 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.990
 twenty two thirty at 22:45 by 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.870
 Moscow time the next portion 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.030
 white black smoke stays waiting 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.950
 Andrew, let's wait and see, thanks 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.720
 Vadim live was in one blouse 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.130
 he is waiting for the decision of the Catholic Cardinals 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.130
 until the pontiff is elected
