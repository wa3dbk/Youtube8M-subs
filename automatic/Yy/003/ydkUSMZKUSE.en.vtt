hey Tim reset here doing another
Fibonacci<00:00:04.140> video<00:00:04.620> tutorial<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:05.910> this

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Fibonacci video tutorial and in this

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.670 
Fibonacci video tutorial and in this
video<00:00:06.330> I'm<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.720> show<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:06.960> how<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.319> use

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
video I'm going to show you how I use

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.089 
video I'm going to show you how I use
Fibonacci<00:00:08.450> extensions<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.590> way<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.740> draw

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
Fibonacci extensions and the way I draw

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.720 
Fibonacci extensions and the way I draw
these<00:00:11.309> rather<00:00:12.320> let's<00:00:13.320> begin<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:13.830> when<00:00:14.400> to

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
these rather let's begin with when to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.599 
these rather let's begin with when to
draw<00:00:14.940> them<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.809> use<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.609> Fibonacci

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
draw them and you use a Fibonacci

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.990 
draw them and you use a Fibonacci
extension<00:00:18.210> when<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.810> traded<00:00:19.260> through<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
extension when we traded through a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000 
extension when we traded through a
negative<00:00:21.000> 23<00:00:21.449> percent<00:00:21.810> target<00:00:22.020> typically

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
negative 23 percent target typically

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.890 
negative 23 percent target typically
what<00:00:23.160> will<00:00:23.279> happen<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.480> market<00:00:24.779> will

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
what will happen is the market will

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.259 
what will happen is the market will
start<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> move<00:00:25.410> fairly<00:00:25.980> rapidly<00:00:26.550> either<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
start to move fairly rapidly either to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.470 
start to move fairly rapidly either to
the<00:00:27.390> down<00:00:27.539> side<00:00:27.810> or<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.920> up<00:00:29.099> side<00:00:29.480> will

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the down side or to the up side will

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.659 
the down side or to the up side will
start<00:00:30.720> trading<00:00:31.050> through<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.679> negative<00:00:31.980> 23%

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
start trading through the negative 23%

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.970 
start trading through the negative 23%
targets<00:00:33.059> down<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> negative<00:00:34.320> 61<00:00:34.710> eight

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
targets down to the negative 61 eight

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.119 
targets down to the negative 61 eight
targets<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.670> that's<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.540> key<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.050> or<00:00:37.920> that's

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
targets and that's the key to or that's

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.880 
targets and that's the key to or that's
the<00:00:38.280> signal<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.030> start<00:00:39.570> using<00:00:39.809> extensions<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the signal to start using extensions and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.790 
the signal to start using extensions and
so<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:42.180> way<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.660> draw<00:00:43.020> an<00:00:43.140> extension<00:00:43.649> as

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
so the way I will draw an extension as

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400 
so the way I will draw an extension as
opposed<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.820> traditional<00:00:45.360> drawing<00:00:46.020> from

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
opposed to a traditional drawing from

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
opposed to a traditional drawing from
the<00:00:48.260> high<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.800> low<00:00:50.010> or<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.239> are<00:00:51.360> looking<00:00:51.539> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the high to low or if you are looking it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.560 
the high to low or if you are looking it
along<00:00:52.050> from<00:00:52.350> lows<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.860> highs<00:00:53.039> an<00:00:53.430> extension<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
along from lows to highs an extension is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.610 
along from lows to highs an extension is
drawn<00:00:55.260> from<00:00:55.500> lows<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.760> lows<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> case

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
drawn from lows to lows or in the case

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.270 
drawn from lows to lows or in the case
of<00:00:58.829> Long's

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
of Long's

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.270 
of Long's
highs<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.940> highs<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.410> setup<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.949> here

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
highs to highs so the setup we have here

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.920 
highs to highs so the setup we have here
trade<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.350> 50%<00:01:05.000> sold<00:01:06.000> off<00:01:06.210> sold

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
trade it up to the 50% sold off sold

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.450 
trade it up to the 50% sold off sold
through<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> negative<00:01:07.650> 23<00:01:07.979> percent<00:01:08.280> target

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
through the negative 23 percent target

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.210 
through the negative 23 percent target
down<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> 61<00:01:09.540> 8<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.260> instead<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> drawing<00:01:10.950> from

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
down the 61 8 so instead of drawing from

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.080 
down the 61 8 so instead of drawing from
highs<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.630> lows<00:01:13.310> I'll<00:01:14.310> start<00:01:14.610> drawing<00:01:14.820> from

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
highs to lows I'll start drawing from

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.960 
highs to lows I'll start drawing from
lows<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:16.200> lows<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.830> I'll<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.670> ahead<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
lows to lows and I'll go ahead and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.800 
lows to lows and I'll go ahead and
remove<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.540> initial<00:01:19.080> drawing<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.659> what<00:01:21.659> we

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
remove that initial drawing and what we

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.950 
remove that initial drawing and what we
have<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:23.310> series<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.090> extensions<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
have then is a series of extensions that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.160 
have then is a series of extensions that
begin<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.320> form<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:27.270> way<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> will

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
begin to form and the way that I will

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.560 
begin to form and the way that I will
continue<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.740> draw<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> extensions<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
continue to draw the extensions is to

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.390 
continue to draw the extensions is to
use<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.110> same<00:01:31.680> anchor<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.880> new<00:01:33.450> lows<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.400> then

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
use the same anchor to new lows and then

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.980 
use the same anchor to new lows and then
yet<00:01:35.610> again<00:01:35.729> same<00:01:36.570> anchor<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.880> new<00:01:39.360> lows<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
yet again same anchor to new lows and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.510 
yet again same anchor to new lows and
that<00:01:40.439> gives<00:01:40.740> us<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.100> series<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.790> extensions<00:01:42.540> now

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
that gives us a series of extensions now

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.340 
that gives us a series of extensions now
often<00:01:44.520> times<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:46.200> bit

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
often times it can be a little bit

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.520 
often times it can be a little bit
difficult<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:47.250> into<00:01:47.430> an<00:01:47.700> extension<00:01:48.240> I

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
difficult to get into an extension I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.160 
difficult to get into an extension I
rarely<00:01:49.530> take<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.250> first<00:01:50.810> extension<00:01:51.810> because

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
rarely take the first extension because

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.090 
rarely take the first extension because
you<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:53.240> what<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> anchor<00:01:54.780> point<00:01:55.100> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you don't know what the anchor point is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.490 
you don't know what the anchor point is
going<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.579> always<00:01:57.090> until<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.079> first

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
going to be always until the first

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.399 
going to be always until the first
extension<00:01:58.979> identifies<00:01:59.850> itself<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.810> well

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
extension identifies itself so well

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.649 
extension identifies itself so well
usually<00:02:01.649> happen<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.520> we're<00:02:03.030> trading<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
the negative 23 percent target and it's

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
draw from Lowe's to Lowe's or highs to

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.520 
draw from Lowe's to Lowe's or highs to
highs<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.120> once<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.359> first<00:02:18.719> extension<00:02:19.290> is

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
highs and once the first extension is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.309 
highs and once the first extension is
identified<00:02:20.040> I'll<00:02:20.639> use<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.060> same<00:02:21.359> anchor<00:02:21.749> to

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
identified I'll use that same anchor to

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.789 
identified I'll use that same anchor to
new<00:02:22.499> lows<00:02:22.769> or<00:02:23.099> same<00:02:23.939> anchor<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.450> new<00:02:24.629> highs<00:02:24.840> for

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
new lows or same anchor to new highs for

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.330 
new lows or same anchor to new highs for
the<00:02:25.889> long<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.430> take<00:02:27.329> that<00:02:27.719> set<00:02:28.079> up<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.379> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the long and take that set up in the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.720 
the long and take that set up in the
direction<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.719> current<00:02:31.230> trend<00:02:31.609> and<00:02:32.609> so

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
direction of the current trend and so

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.199 
direction of the current trend and so
extensions<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.389> be<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.750> little<00:02:34.409> bit<00:02:35.030> tricky<00:02:36.030> at

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
extensions can be a little bit tricky at

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.619 
extensions can be a little bit tricky at
times<00:02:36.709> but<00:02:37.709> take<00:02:38.459> them<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:38.909> sign<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.299> the

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
times but take them as a sign that the

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.140 
times but take them as a sign that the
market<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.109> very<00:02:40.230> strong<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:41.219> one<00:02:41.549> direction

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
market is very strong in one direction

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.480 
market is very strong in one direction
or<00:02:42.359> another
