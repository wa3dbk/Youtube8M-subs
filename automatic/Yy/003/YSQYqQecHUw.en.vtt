00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.450 
it dyed and cut alike am a coppery color
and<00:00:12.509> but<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.139> faded<00:00:13.440> loads<00:00:13.769> because<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.130> was

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
and but it faded loads because I was

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.599 
and but it faded loads because I was
originally<00:00:14.639> blonde<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.650> know<00:00:16.800> red<00:00:17.369> going

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
originally blonde so you know red going

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.700 
originally blonde so you know red going
to<00:00:17.730> blonde<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.090> will<00:00:18.210> fade<00:00:18.449> loads<00:00:18.720> anyway<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.680> I

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
to blonde it will fade loads anyway so I

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.370 
to blonde it will fade loads anyway so I
thought<00:00:20.449> considering<00:00:21.449> i<00:00:21.810> won't<00:00:22.050> really<00:00:22.230> get
