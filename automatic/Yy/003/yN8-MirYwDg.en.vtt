00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
how much you bench bro you stuck on a

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.140 
how much you bench bro you stuck on a
plateau<00:00:03.959> you<00:00:04.170> don't<00:00:04.529> know<00:00:04.710> why<00:00:05.000> there's<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> lot

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
plateau you don't know why there's a lot

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.400 
plateau you don't know why there's a lot
of<00:00:06.240> reasons<00:00:06.480> why<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.810> might<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.200> case

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
of reasons why that might be the case

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.049 
of reasons why that might be the case
but<00:00:07.740> in<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.069> video<00:00:08.280> I'm<00:00:08.460> giving<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.820> one

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
but in this video I'm giving you one

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.669 
but in this video I'm giving you one
alternate<00:00:09.450> solution<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.469> fact

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
alternate solution and this is the fact

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.720 
alternate solution and this is the fact
that<00:00:10.769> people<00:00:10.860> don't<00:00:11.219> want<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.370> do<00:00:11.490> that

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
that people don't want to do that

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.820 
that people don't want to do that
fucking<00:00:12.030> overhead<00:00:12.360> work<00:00:12.570> okay<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.349> this

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
fucking overhead work okay and this

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.289 
fucking overhead work okay and this
problem<00:00:14.219> really<00:00:14.309> stands<00:00:14.820> from<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:14.969> upper

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
problem really stands from the upper

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.640 
problem really stands from the upper
little<00:00:15.509> programs<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.049> everybody's<00:00:16.410> doing

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
little programs that everybody's doing

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.529 
little programs that everybody's doing
out<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> can't<00:00:18.029> stand<00:00:18.390> these

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
out of this and I can't stand these

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.630 
out of this and I can't stand these
goddamn<00:00:18.900> programs<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:19.590> people<00:00:20.010> are<00:00:20.189> not

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
goddamn programs because people are not

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.240 
goddamn programs because people are not
training<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> proper<00:00:21.539> way<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:22.230> does<00:00:22.500> work<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
training the proper way it does work to

build bigger legs bigger squats and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.790 
build bigger legs bigger squats and
deficit<00:00:26.420> fails<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:28.050> terms<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.529> upper<00:00:28.769> body

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
deficit fails in terms of upper body

deficit fails in terms of upper body
development<00:00:29.490> that's<00:00:29.580> why<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> lot<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> these

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150

bench bigger weights have big pecs

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.389 
bench bigger weights have big pecs
however<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:54.989> only<00:00:55.199> doing<00:00:55.379> wide<00:00:55.829> okay

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
however if you are only doing wide okay

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.939 
however if you are only doing wide okay
and<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.539> big<00:00:57.930> chest<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and you have a big chest then there is a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.819 
and you have a big chest then there is a
clear<00:00:59.309> identifiable<00:01:00.199> weakness<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> chain

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

of<00:01:02.039> pressing<00:01:02.579> which<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.690> delts<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of pressing which is the delts and the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.090 
of pressing which is the delts and the
triceps<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.390> fail<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.680> overhead

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
triceps and if you fail to do overhead

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.490 
triceps and if you fail to do overhead
press<00:01:08.340> work<00:01:08.659> essentially<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.320> keep

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
press work essentially just you keep

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.310 
doing the bench press what are you going
to<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.150> you're<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> keep<00:01:13.020> over

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
to do you're going to keep over

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.289 
to do you're going to keep over
developing<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> chest<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.310> absence<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.119> the

Delta and the fucking triceps so how do

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.160 
Delta and the fucking triceps so how do
you<00:01:17.310> develop<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.909> dozen<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.270> triceps<00:01:18.780> well

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you develop the dozen of triceps well

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870 
you develop the dozen of triceps well
you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.470> close<00:01:19.740> grip<00:01:19.950> bench<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.580> that's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you can do close grip bench but that's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700 
you can do close grip bench but that's
not<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.330> topic<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> video<00:01:21.900> people<00:01:22.439> don't

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
overhead press work what's going to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.550 
overhead press work what's going to
build<00:01:26.520> bigger<00:01:26.759> delts<00:01:27.180> overhead<00:01:27.869> press<00:01:28.170> or

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
build bigger delts overhead press or

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.080 
build bigger delts overhead press or

close grip bench what's going to build

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.950 
close grip bench what's going to build
bigger<00:01:30.270> triceps

bigger triceps

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.649 
bigger triceps
you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.710> argue<00:01:31.890> close<00:01:32.280> grip<00:01:32.490> edge<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
you can argue close grip edge but the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
you can argue close grip edge but the
overhead<00:01:33.900> presses<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> lift<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.890> most<00:01:35.310> people

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
overhead presses a lift that most people

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.490 
overhead presses a lift that most people
are<00:01:35.759> lagging<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.140> assure<00:01:37.259> you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
are lagging in and if I can assure you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
are lagging in and if I can assure you
that<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.130> lock<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.299> gotten

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that if you can lock have you gotten

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.510 
that if you can lock have you gotten

of powerlifting

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.190 
of powerlifting
it's<00:02:11.060> about<00:02:11.210> squat<00:02:11.569> bench<00:02:11.780> doesn't<00:02:12.140> if

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
it's about squat bench doesn't if

it's about squat bench doesn't if
therefore<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:13.069> movements<00:02:13.640> should<00:02:13.850> be<00:02:14.030> around

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
therefore the movements should be around

therefore the movements should be around
this<00:02:14.569> ok<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:16.069> benches<00:02:16.370> are<00:02:16.520> poised<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:16.819> the

this ok the benches are poised on the

this ok the benches are poised on the
press<00:02:17.150> therefore<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.569> shouldn't<00:02:17.840> do<00:02:17.930> any

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
press therefore you shouldn't do any

vertical pressing but that doesn't make

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.670 
vertical pressing but that doesn't make

reference<00:02:42.080> once<00:02:42.290> again<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.830> believe<00:02:43.489> if<00:02:43.610> he

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
reference once again I believe if he

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.330 
reference once again I believe if he
overhead<00:02:44.090> presses<00:02:44.480> 275<00:02:45.260> for<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.560> single<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.130> he

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
overhead presses 275 for a single and he

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.220 
overhead presses 275 for a single and he

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
also reverse grip bench is about four or

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.310 
also reverse grip bench is about four or
five<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.739> above<00:02:49.130> I<00:02:49.670> look<00:02:50.209> guys<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:51.140> some

five and above I look guys but some
people<00:02:51.590> could<00:02:51.769> bench<00:02:51.950> press<00:02:52.040> three<00:02:52.550> plates

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
people could bench press three plates

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.110 
people could bench press three plates
beside<00:02:53.209> okay<00:02:53.810> 315<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.160> cannot<00:02:55.489> overhead

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120

press 185 so what's going to really have

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.390 
press 185 so what's going to really have
a<00:02:59.269> great<00:02:59.630> impact<00:02:59.750> if<00:03:00.350> they<00:03:00.530> continue<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.160> focus
