00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.740

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.030

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.790

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.710
 I will enter and come back so I came in first 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.350
 go to the profile settings and 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.190
 we change our version of the game at the very 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.280
 the last ie the release of the 17 hagra teeth 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.230
 click save click play wait 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.990
 also downloads and skip this 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.650
 Here is our mine launched here we see 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.980
 what is it 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.640
 on force beta that is actually 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.100
 stage earlier beta ie shaders themselves 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.040
 came out just recently just two days ago 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.909
 and forge came out quite a while ago 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.610
 Single player game 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.859
 assembly shaders we go that is it is possible 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.409
 the map is different, so this is an example. 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:19.659
 and here we appear in the world and see that 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.329
 we already have shaders that is grass 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.359
 animated so everything further that is all 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.609
 something like that we want shaders then 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:30.579
 I can see what records I have 30 fps 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.109
 the dead man falls nothing that is not 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.450
 There are of course cutters 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.310
 oh well, actually everything is very 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.740
 Posh work also show where me 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.749
 a little yes that is here i stand 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.950
 these ones here so that there is no spacer in 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:46.840
 last video in 164 or 162 was that is 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 and asked what tesa shaders cost 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.109
 now you can also see 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.319
 added a couple of others 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.389
 that is, this is such a cool that is 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:00.030
 actually in a cool shader this 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:02:03.490
 for shooting any so to speak 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.789
 the country's serials don't know very much 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.939
 Others will also fit here 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.700
 also 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.860
 I almost forgot and in the folder there is more precisely 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.350
 there are many other shaders ie we 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.459
 exit the game see what we have in 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.360
 folder additional files are here 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.970
 optional shaders 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.980
 past versions we go here copy 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.280
 that is , we insert them all into 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.430
 shaderpak folder i'm here here they are 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.560
 which are actually installed now 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.600
 here is nothing more to tell 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.550
