00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.779
 as a kid complain and bring a new 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.410
 video first of all I want 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.750
 apologize because then I had 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.790
 said earlier that he was going to raise the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.219
 new version of waiting a week ago 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.139
 and then I could not for reasons 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.550
 personal but here I bring you the new 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.140
 version 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.210
 first of all in this version I have 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.509
 added 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.400
 a couple of peculiarities and I'm going to 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.869
 teach little by little before that good here 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.309
 right now it's not loading well 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.320
 battery so why is it a hundred 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.210
 hundred I forgot to change that icon 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.980
 which is the subject of 17 that I have 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.480
 previously but I've made changes in 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 the battery thing that now they are not going to 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.620
 notice I've also made changes to the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.059
 battery when it is disconnected that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.940
 I will not be able to show them either 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.360
 why 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.450
 if I unplug it obviously it's going 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.940
 to disconnect the screen but good in 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.940
 these changes that I have done most of all 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.670
 the battery of the girl of a little I've 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.350
 removed certain edges small changes 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.000
 that I've done in the week so the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.010
 I really could not tell you 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.540
 completely by the version that you 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.240
 have compared with the version that already 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.610
 I have by the way I have also added what 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.470
 that would be the center of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.130
 notifications 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.370
 most of all I do not know for those who have 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.810
 seen an iphone4 get one be from 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.730
 they will have realized that they have removed the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.100
 blur background and they have totally put it 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.280
 black for performance issues 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.280
 no and joel added this himself 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.000
 the notification center that I've 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.670
 added is based on one created in a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.120
 issue of to 17 if I do not remember just that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.010
 I have done practically what 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.660
 same only that if they have been given 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.450
 account for those who have that was almost 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:55.220
 the same is that if they see in the corners 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.680
 the one who has the theme of there is not seen 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.570
 it looks like it lacks a line here what 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.010
 what I have done is that I have put everything 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.940
 I have arranged the subject to make it 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.260
 totally good here with also this is 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.479
 have to fix what would be 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.979
 the battery I have to move the battery 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.810
 there also this here 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.220
 I will try to change them 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.000
 what would come would be doing for the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.580
 next version of steps for example 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.160
 we go into settings for which I have 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.920
 posted my twitter what of the camera 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.380
 ios 7 to those who have seen it at the beginning 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.069
 when I was there I scroll and I walk 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.870
 little and I posted it on my twitter and 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.489
 for those who want to have this my 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.200
 twitter does not publish it here because 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.599
 I would have to be making a video and 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.239
 also many will say if deal right here 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.680
 in the video but well I prefer that 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.000
 go to my twitter and see 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.430
 because there are also many things that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.069
 I have there that for example I have not 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.660
 mentioned does not mention the videos 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.239
 for example he has also made a new 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.799
 project that I have called it dark good no 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.200
 I have named him yet in fact he 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.840
 I put it like that so just that 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.810
 simply the white in only that in 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.780
 black only in but then in the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.090
 springboard will be able to put the letters in 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.739
 white without needing to have all 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.290
 all the letters january so they are 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.060
 I would have white letters and here I do not like 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.780
 who does not want to let me in, we hope that 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.780
 a little 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.720
 let's see here and we come to you for what 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.500
 who can see in the sprint also what 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.239
 what I have done is that the circles that you 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.430
 they say on what page are the posts in 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.010
 black and I still have not changed the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.959
 spotlight I think there's a tweet that makes 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.390
 that is eliminated because the damage 7 does not 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.950
 have but if I can I look for the icon and 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.260
 what I do is that I put it transparent 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.819
 so you do not see yourself in the sprint by 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.379
 We are waiting here for you to charge, I feel that 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.480
 wants to come to you to follow us 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.019
 made small details have public of 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.540
 the navigation bar that does not enter 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.130
 now good on my twitter publish what 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.880
 the ship made a bar that I made a 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.880
 pair of changes there 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.200
 well how to explain you 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.950
 that at zero wants to be 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.780
 what he was talking good if the 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.140
 denial bar that I've made a couple of 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.120
 changes and I tried to put the colors 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.320
 but as I keep saying what happens is 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.639
 that will continue to be irrigated 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.370
 too many applications have me 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.460
 said hey well well publish yourself 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.930
 and they want to mess around with it but the 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.940
 they're not really going to do anything with that 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.820
 because no no no it found great utility 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.530
 when here the little arrows they have seen 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.090
 for example here what I have done is that 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.669
 is I have changed the color and I have 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.430
 put more to the 7 years you could say 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:44.480
 well or not about the other symbols what 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.480
 let me in 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.229
 lately I do not know what happens to him what 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.030
 I have very much been fiddling 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.520
 too much and I've made many changes 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.849
 good here about the circles too 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.639
 changes are often changed in changes 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.259
 that at first glance are not noticed but if 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.909
 are changes that the fact this version and 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.669
 for the next version I have thought 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.889
 do too many things that I'm going to put it 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.129
 all of truth and the truth of the 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.810
 Christmas what the adjustment thing is here 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.969
 where it says adjustments above and what the 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.159
 buttons on the sides and I know how to put the 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.710
 of colors but that's going to be a tutorial 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:23.449
 It will take at least 15 minutes 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.860
 explain it and you have to download programs 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:32.479
 starting with the former with what is of d 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:35.240
 of mack and how to explain back that is 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:39.020
 of more those who have windows have 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.120
 than installing a virtual machine and 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.280
 in install them to the machine 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.650
 machine not any computer too 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.210
 does that so I'm going to see how I do it 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.819
 to explain what will come without the 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.919
 tutorial and nothing else was to remember 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.460
 that down here in the description I'm going 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.789
 to leave the link of the waiting and 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.590
 also the truth I do not know what happens to me 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:04.220
 I was like that, it has also been like 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:08.150
 I'm also a videoblogger so I'm 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.280
 as well as a before editing good in order 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.229
 I leave the line the description of 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.750
 video remember that my twitter funeral 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.060

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.220
 watching as I go because also there 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.630
 I'm writing today I hope I can 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.430
 change and we're telling you and I'm going 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.930
 doing doing different so like 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.740
