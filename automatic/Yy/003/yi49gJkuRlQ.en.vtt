you know I never used the word cure but
this<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> paradigm<00:00:11.849> shift<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.360> medicine

14 years ago we did our first patient
and<00:00:21.520> then<00:00:22.060> we<00:00:22.240> just<00:00:22.480> expanded<00:00:23.020> to<00:00:23.140> many

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
and then we just expanded to many

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.020 
and then we just expanded to many
different<00:00:23.620> autoimmune<00:00:24.250> disorders<00:00:24.760> and<00:00:24.940> now

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
different autoimmune disorders and now

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.960 
different autoimmune disorders and now
we<00:00:25.090> have<00:00:25.390> any<00:00:25.750> clinical<00:00:26.230> trials<00:00:26.680> for<00:00:26.970> many

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970

took<00:01:06.130> my<00:01:06.400> blood<00:01:06.670> out<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.479> collected<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.500> stem

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
took my blood out and collected the stem

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.260 
cells and then they gave me my stem
cells<00:01:11.500> back<00:01:11.680> just<00:01:11.979> like<00:01:12.100> a<00:01:12.160> blood<00:01:12.460> transfusion

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270

I'm<00:01:53.800> very<00:01:54.280> optimistic<00:01:54.429> I<00:01:54.970> think<00:01:55.179> that<00:01:55.330> we<00:01:55.450> can

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
I'm very optimistic I think that we can

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.450 
I'm very optimistic I think that we can
use<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.200> know<00:01:56.289> stem<00:01:56.530> cell<00:01:56.710> therapy<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.280> lot

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
use you know stem cell therapy and a lot

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.880 
use you know stem cell therapy and a lot
of<00:01:57.580> diseases<00:01:57.909> and<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:58.450> I<00:01:58.479> hope<00:01:58.869> that<00:01:59.140> we<00:01:59.770> can

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
of diseases and so I hope that we can

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.310 
of diseases and so I hope that we can
continue<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.610> find<00:02:01.090> therapies<00:02:01.840> for<00:02:02.140> more

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
continue to find therapies for more

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.650 
continue to find therapies for more
debilitating<00:02:02.860> diseases

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.220 
two-year follow-up again test results
were<00:02:34.219> negative<00:02:34.249> factors<00:02:35.150> below<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
were negative factors below the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.949 
were negative factors below the
transplant<00:02:36.739> had<00:02:36.920> ports<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.849> am<00:02:38.030> cured<00:02:38.420> he

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
transplant had ports and I am cured he

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.280 
transplant had ports and I am cured he
won't<00:02:39.170> say<00:02:39.379> it<00:02:39.499> but<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.769> think<00:02:40.959> when<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.049> first

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
won't say it but I think when I first

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.220 
won't say it but I think when I first
started<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:42.739> about<00:02:43.420> 2425<00:02:44.420> years<00:02:44.780> ago<00:02:45.170> I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
started this about 2425 years ago I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.750 
started this about 2425 years ago I
thought<00:02:45.409> I'd<00:02:45.560> have<00:02:45.709> all<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:45.980> answers<00:02:46.159> in<00:02:46.400> five

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
thought I'd have all the answers in five

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.270 
thought I'd have all the answers in five
years<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.989> it's<00:02:48.139> a<00:02:48.260> lot<00:02:48.500> more<00:02:48.680> working<00:02:49.099> a<00:02:49.159> lot

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
years so it's a lot more working a lot

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.789 
years so it's a lot more working a lot
more<00:02:49.549> time<00:02:49.760> than<00:02:49.969> you<00:02:50.090> can<00:02:50.239> imagine<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:51.739> is

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
more time than you can imagine this is

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.649 
more time than you can imagine this is
just<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.519> beginning<00:02:52.639> there's<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.269> much<00:02:53.450> more

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
just the beginning there's so much more

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.479 
just the beginning there's so much more
that<00:02:53.810> come<00:02:54.019> out<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.409> that's<00:02:55.189> what

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
that come out of this that's what

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.580 
that come out of this that's what
happens<00:02:55.819> when<00:02:55.939> you<00:02:56.030> open<00:02:56.120> new<00:02:56.870> doors<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.409> for

happens when you open new doors and for

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.920 
happens when you open new doors and for
me<00:02:57.709> that's<00:02:58.310> what<00:02:58.669> life<00:02:59.269> is<00:02:59.299> about<00:02:59.480> it's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930

opening the doors of doors that in a way

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.390 
opening the doors of doors that in a way
