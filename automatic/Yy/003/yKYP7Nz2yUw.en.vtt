there<00:04:16.709> at<00:04:16.829> all<00:04:17.070> right<00:04:17.459> now<00:04:17.699> but<00:04:18.539> we<00:04:18.690> know<00:04:19.729> that

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
there at all right now but we know that

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.890 
there at all right now but we know that
once<00:04:21.030> there<00:04:21.359> was<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.479> path<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:22.049> ran<00:04:22.289> from<00:04:22.320> four

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
once there was a path that ran from four

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.990 
once there was a path that ran from four
towards<00:04:24.229> those<00:04:24.350> buildings<00:04:24.949> so<00:04:25.520> once<00:04:25.820> again

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
towards those buildings so once again

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.629 
towards those buildings so once again

tool and looking a game here in this
kind<00:04:47.360> of<00:04:47.449> area<00:04:47.949> I'm<00:04:48.949> wondering<00:04:49.340> if<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.729> was

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
kind of area I'm wondering if that was

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.409 
kind of area I'm wondering if that was
any<00:04:49.970> different<00:04:50.270> in<00:04:50.600> 1973<00:04:51.590> yeah<00:04:52.100> so<00:04:52.370> there's<00:04:53.330> a

couple of different houses there see
this<00:04:59.150> this<00:04:59.289> house<00:05:00.289> here<00:05:00.850> looks<00:05:01.850> like<00:05:01.940> there

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
this this house here looks like there

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.659 
this this house here looks like there
was<00:05:02.300> a<00:05:02.330> house<00:05:02.570> there<00:05:02.960> in<00:05:03.160> 1973<00:05:04.160> next<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.550> that

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
was a house there in 1973 next to that

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:13.060 
was a house there in 1973 next to that
one<00:05:06.910> so<00:05:07.910> if<00:05:08.120> we<00:05:08.270> take<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:10.030> back<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.330> now<00:05:12.070> there's

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
one so if we take it back to now there's

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.560 
one so if we take it back to now there's
some<00:05:13.250> green<00:05:13.490> space<00:05:13.669> there<00:05:14.150> next<00:05:14.389> to<00:05:14.539> that

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
some green space there next to that

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.260 
some green space there next to that
building<00:05:15.160> so<00:05:16.160> it<00:05:16.220> tells<00:05:16.460> us<00:05:16.699> yet<00:05:16.910> once<00:05:17.120> again

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
building so it tells us yet once again

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.750 
building so it tells us yet once again
be<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.660> good<00:05:17.840> site<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.139> have<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.470> look<00:05:18.650> at<00:05:18.889> now<00:05:19.639> I'm

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
be a good site to have a look at now I'm

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.749 
be a good site to have a look at now I'm
just<00:05:19.910> using<00:05:20.180> this<00:05:20.479> for<00:05:20.780> as<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.380> demonstration

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
just using this for as a demonstration

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.339 
just using this for as a demonstration
obviously<00:05:22.759> they'd<00:05:22.970> say<00:05:23.150> for<00:05:23.479> its<00:05:23.720> protected

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
obviously they'd say for its protected

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.400 
obviously they'd say for its protected
area<00:05:24.770> so<00:05:25.009> it's<00:05:25.220> an<00:05:25.430> area<00:05:25.729> of<00:05:26.050> historical<00:05:27.050> local

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
area so it's an area of historical local

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.850 
area so it's an area of historical local
interest<00:05:27.889> which<00:05:28.729> means<00:05:29.320> absolutely<00:05:30.320> don't

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
interest which means absolutely don't

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.589 
interest which means absolutely don't
get<00:05:31.010> on<00:05:31.130> there<00:05:31.280> don't<00:05:31.580> detect<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.180> don't<00:05:32.449> go

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
get on there don't detect it don't go

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.719 
get on there don't detect it don't go
look<00:05:32.810> on<00:05:32.990> forts<00:05:33.500> are<00:05:34.250> you<00:05:34.430> going<00:05:34.580> to<00:05:34.639> get

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
look on forts are you going to get

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.700 
look on forts are you going to get
yourself<00:05:35.060> into<00:05:35.240> a<00:05:35.360> lot<00:05:35.570> of<00:05:35.690> trouble<00:05:36.080> there

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
yourself into a lot of trouble there

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.790 
yourself into a lot of trouble there
they're<00:05:37.460> local<00:05:38.060> historical<00:05:39.050> sites<00:05:39.349> so

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
they're local historical sites so

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.640 
they're local historical sites so
they're<00:05:40.190> of<00:05:40.430> archaeological<00:05:41.389> importance<00:05:42.020> so

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
they're of archaeological importance so

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.149 
trouble get arrested go to jail get a
big<00:05:49.849> fine<00:05:50.169> we<00:05:51.169> don't<00:05:51.199> want<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:51.620> we<00:05:51.889> don't

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
big fine we don't want that we don't

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.370 
big fine we don't want that we don't
want<00:05:52.310> that<00:05:52.430> at<00:05:52.490> all<00:05:52.699> but<00:05:52.940> I<00:05:53.360> just<00:05:53.630> want<00:05:53.810> to<00:05:53.870> use

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
want that at all but I just want to use

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.890 
want that at all but I just want to use
this<00:05:54.650> as<00:05:54.889> a<00:05:54.949> demo<00:05:55.430> that's<00:05:55.699> all<00:05:55.970> because<00:05:56.630> it<00:05:56.780> was

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
this as a demo that's all because it was

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.860 
this as a demo that's all because it was
a<00:05:56.930> really<00:05:57.139> good<00:05:57.409> example<00:05:57.530> so<00:05:58.250> once<00:05:59.240> again<00:05:59.419> you

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
a really good example so once again you

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.490 
a really good example so once again you
can<00:06:00.380> see<00:06:00.729> 1973<00:06:02.530> 2005<00:06:03.530> even<00:06:04.400> this<00:06:04.490> area<00:06:04.970> here

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
can see 1973 2005 even this area here

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.779 
can see 1973 2005 even this area here
probably<00:06:06.500> where<00:06:06.650> the<00:06:06.740> parking<00:06:07.220> lot<00:06:07.280> is<00:06:07.430> right

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
probably where the parking lot is right

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.610 
probably where the parking lot is right
now<00:06:08.000> so<00:06:08.210> not<00:06:08.330> very<00:06:08.539> good<00:06:08.720> for<00:06:08.750> detecting<00:06:09.440> but

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
now so not very good for detecting but

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.700 
now so not very good for detecting but
imagine<00:06:10.010> that<00:06:10.130> was<00:06:10.280> a<00:06:10.310> field<00:06:11.349> take<00:06:12.349> it<00:06:12.500> across

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
imagine that was a field take it across

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.029 
imagine that was a field take it across
one<00:06:13.130> sales<00:06:13.430> houses<00:06:14.030> there<00:06:14.620> so<00:06:15.620> it's<00:06:15.830> just

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
one sales houses there so it's just

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.399 
one sales houses there so it's just
great<00:06:16.340> really<00:06:16.880> good<00:06:17.090> tool<00:06:17.360> so<00:06:17.900> i'll<00:06:18.050> put<00:06:18.260> up

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
great really good tool so i'll put up

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:19.830 
great really good tool so i'll put up
all<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.710> information<00:06:19.280> for<00:06:19.430> this<00:06:19.580> website

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
all the information for this website

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.210
