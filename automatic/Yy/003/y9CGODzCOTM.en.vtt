00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.960
 this dance with the generic name of garlic 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.079
 or ax are thus designated to the showy 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 wifalas extras also do not remain 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.060
 an extraordinary relief to these 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.329
 parties with their emotional joyful music 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.850
 and tender melodies later in the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.489
 pantheist spirit of the former peasant 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.829
 where the peasant exalts with joy and 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.440
 he forgets all his pains momentarily 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.429
 not simply because the child is there 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 that joy that emotion of sharing and 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:05.670
 to throw for the land for the virgin 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 that's why this expression is also 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.490
 dionisÃ­aca of the agriculture before the announcement of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.730
 the next crop in the exploration 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.340
 musical and sound man front that 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.350
 feels feels bewitched also by 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.159
 the lust of the earth the life 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.159
 then that is what the 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.189
 the rest 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.439
 emphasizing what is progressing and are 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.810
 part of many of the festivities that 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.440
 still performed in each of these 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.630
 communities not what what they tell us 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.430
 here in in other information that this is 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.850
 for example a dance that also 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.549
 dance in the time of san juan bautista 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.440
 then it's part of the party is part 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.140
 of the life of the population but 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.819
 obviously when there is a presentation 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.399
 where is going to highlight what is the 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.440
 obviously they and the dance 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.000
 what else represents it because they are 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.880
 presenting and that's why we have the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.140
 opportunity to now be here 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.560
 knowing this to this set that 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.989
 also like the others the others 199 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.940
 groupings then make a great effort 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.130
 to get to the city and to be able 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.310
 be presented very early you have to 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.440
 highlight it I tell you something zonal and 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.630
 this also thanks thanks to my 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.670
 gentlemen parents who have allowed me 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.880
 live with nature 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.060
 I really do not know what the saying says 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.550
 you learn 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.110
 where events occur and people by 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.000
 example I had that opportunity to see 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.580
 when they participate in this type of 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.650
 activities and women wake up 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.239
 very early they will rise at 32 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.750
 the morning and they start cooking at 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.489
 prepare the cold cuts or the snack and then 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.069
 the man prepares everything that is 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.810
 necessary to launch and so in couple 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.790
 they are constituted they are needed in a 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.220
 determined place in the community and 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.010
 all together they travel together 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.510
 during the road they come singing 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.819
 making his harangues not that today 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.340
 we win are the winners we 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.330
 we bring the prize here then they arrive 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.100
 here they dance and then they return 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.840
 leaving the stadium they will share 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.090
 is getting all the women bring 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.970
 in the snack betrayed accurate that's 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.120
 something very very very important and part of 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.830
 a tradition that goes beyond a 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.580
 presentation in a stadium is not 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.380
 really the vocation that exists 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.150
 it's important, that's not why it's also 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.390
 urgent that the authorities recognize 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.710
 that and that they can give support to this 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.740
 tradition to this intangible heritage 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.620
 what is alive and what is there with 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.850
 Wanting to show is not good tv peru 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.210

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.190
 does these transmissions from province 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.290
 entirely in hd that is what you 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.480
 is watching is a spectacular image 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.140
 of this tradition because that's very 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.390
 important you have to give the new the 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.640
 technique the format that is right now in 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.340
 vogue to talk about our tradition and 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.380
 not because only that is how they value themselves 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.049
