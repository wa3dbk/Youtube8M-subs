forward<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.110> wasn't<00:01:49.320> too<00:01:49.530> bothered<00:01:49.680> by

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
forward but I wasn't too bothered by

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.149 
forward but I wasn't too bothered by
that<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.250> he's<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.610> defensive<00:01:51.450> mid<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
that because he's the defensive mid and

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.440 
that because he's the defensive mid and
this<00:01:53.159> team<00:01:53.399> had<00:01:53.670> plenty<00:01:54.180> of

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
attacking prowess you'll see that in a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
attacking prowess you'll see that in a
minute<00:01:59.820> though<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.750> moving<00:02:01.109> on<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.530> mid
