to accomplish Kenneth's career the other

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.180 
to accomplish Kenneth's career the other
components<00:05:19.990> are<00:05:20.140> made<00:05:20.530> up<00:05:20.650> of<00:05:20.740> resume

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.060

introduction etc and finally
interviewing<00:05:26.350> skills<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.919> think<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.310> long

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
interviewing skills I think the long

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.580 
interviewing skills I think the long
term<00:05:27.730> benefits<00:05:28.240> are<00:05:28.480> that<00:05:28.510> we<00:05:29.169> are<00:05:29.350> going<00:05:29.500> to

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
term benefits are that we are going to

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.470 
term benefits are that we are going to
be<00:05:29.680> graduating<00:05:29.919> students<00:05:30.790> from<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.060> college

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
be graduating students from the college

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.659 
be graduating students from the college

but don't just walk away with a degree

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.750 
but don't just walk away with a degree
they're<00:05:34.120> walking<00:05:34.510> away<00:05:34.630> with<00:05:34.990> experience

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
they're walking away with experience

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.969

from<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.340> college's<00:05:42.880> standpoint<00:05:43.419> we're

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
from the college's standpoint we're

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.350 
from the college's standpoint we're
providing<00:05:44.229> better<00:05:44.830> access<00:05:45.460> to<00:05:45.729> higher

providing better access to higher

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.930 
providing better access to higher
education<00:05:46.450> a<00:05:47.260> lot<00:05:47.620> of<00:05:47.830> families<00:05:48.310> are<00:05:48.550> finding

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
education a lot of families are finding

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.240 
education a lot of families are finding
it<00:05:49.180> hard<00:05:49.450> to<00:05:49.570> afford<00:05:50.169> higher<00:05:50.410> education<00:05:50.470> for

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
it hard to afford higher education for

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.550 
it hard to afford higher education for
their<00:05:51.400> children<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:52.030> this<00:05:52.780> is<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.020> way<00:05:53.320> in

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
their children and this is a way in

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.860 
their children and this is a way in
which<00:05:53.590> some<00:05:54.460> of<00:05:54.490> those<00:05:54.700> families<00:05:55.180> can<00:05:55.419> have

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
which some of those families can have

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.140 
which some of those families can have
their<00:05:56.169> students<00:05:56.560> attend<00:05:56.860> college<00:05:57.280> and<00:05:57.640> not

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
their students attend college and not

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.200 
their students attend college and not
graduate<00:05:58.900> with<00:05:58.930> a<00:05:59.260> lot<00:05:59.710> of<00:06:00.010> indebtedness<00:06:00.820> I

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
graduate with a lot of indebtedness I

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.290 
graduate with a lot of indebtedness I
think<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.750> program<00:06:02.520> allows<00:06:03.520> students<00:06:04.180> the

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
think the program allows students the

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.940 
think the program allows students the
opportunity<00:06:04.900> to<00:06:04.930> interact<00:06:05.530> with<00:06:05.800> one<00:06:05.919> another

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
opportunity to interact with one another

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.310 
opportunity to interact with one another
and<00:06:06.550> a<00:06:07.060> level<00:06:07.360> that<00:06:07.510> may<00:06:07.780> never<00:06:07.990> have<00:06:08.140> happened

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
and a level that may never have happened

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.610 
and a level that may never have happened
before<00:06:09.040> it's<00:06:09.580> so<00:06:09.850> I<00:06:10.270> think<00:06:10.660> beautiful<00:06:11.260> to<00:06:11.470> me

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
before it's so I think beautiful to me

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.830 
before it's so I think beautiful to me
to<00:06:11.830> see<00:06:11.979> students<00:06:12.520> who<00:06:12.669> may<00:06:13.180> not<00:06:13.390> have<00:06:13.570> a<00:06:13.600> cost

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
to see students who may not have a cost

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.110 
to see students who may not have a cost
together<00:06:14.200> you<00:06:14.650> know<00:06:14.740> may<00:06:14.890> not<00:06:14.919> share<00:06:15.400> the<00:06:15.880> same

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
together you know may not share the same

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.520 
together you know may not share the same
friend<00:06:16.450> group<00:06:16.720> don't<00:06:16.960> travel<00:06:17.200> in<00:06:17.290> the<00:06:17.380> same

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
friend group don't travel in the same

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.210 
friend group don't travel in the same
circles

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
circles

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.150 
circles
and<00:06:18.400> so<00:06:19.030> when<00:06:19.419> maybe<00:06:19.600> never<00:06:19.900> you<00:06:20.560> know<00:06:20.710> engage

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
and so when maybe never you know engage

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.219 
and so when maybe never you know engage
with<00:06:21.370> one<00:06:21.490> another<00:06:21.520> come<00:06:22.419> together<00:06:22.690> for<00:06:23.200> a

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
with one another come together for a

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:24.779 
with one another come together for a
collective<00:06:23.620> reason<00:06:24.010> and<00:06:24.220> I<00:06:24.520> think<00:06:24.550> the

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
collective reason and I think the

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.150 
collective reason and I think the
provider<00:06:25.120> program

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
provider program

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.370 
provider program
is<00:06:26.370> that<00:06:26.610> the<00:06:27.090> entire<00:06:27.390> campus<00:06:27.840> is<00:06:27.960> a<00:06:28.020> learning

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
is that the entire campus is a learning

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.780 
is that the entire campus is a learning
community<00:06:28.590> it's<00:06:28.980> not<00:06:29.130> that<00:06:29.280> I<00:06:29.340> go<00:06:29.460> to<00:06:29.490> class

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
community it's not that I go to class

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.790 
community it's not that I go to class
then<00:06:30.150> I<00:06:30.210> go<00:06:30.360> back<00:06:30.540> to<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:30.720> dorm<00:06:31.080> where<00:06:31.530> I<00:06:31.560> go<00:06:31.740> to

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
then I go back to a dorm where I go to

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.830 
then I go back to a dorm where I go to
class<00:06:32.070> and<00:06:32.310> then<00:06:32.430> I<00:06:32.520> go<00:06:32.640> to<00:06:32.670> work<00:06:32.790> but<00:06:33.540> to<00:06:33.660> see

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
class and then I go to work but to see

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.750 
class and then I go to work but to see
sort<00:06:34.080> of<00:06:34.140> a<00:06:34.200> connection<00:06:34.530> between<00:06:34.770> all<00:06:35.430> of<00:06:35.460> that

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
sort of a connection between all of that

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.310 
sort of a connection between all of that
that<00:06:36.000> really<00:06:36.150> I'm<00:06:36.360> in<00:06:36.510> this<00:06:36.660> space<00:06:36.840> and<00:06:37.260> in

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
that really I'm in this space and in

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.960 
that really I'm in this space and in
this<00:06:37.410> environment<00:06:37.770> to<00:06:38.160> learn<00:06:38.310> at<00:06:38.550> every<00:06:38.790> level

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
this environment to learn at every level

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.730 
this environment to learn at every level
and<00:06:39.300> in<00:06:39.630> every<00:06:39.840> component<00:06:40.170> fits<00:06:40.560> together

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
and in every component fits together

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.710 
and in every component fits together
that<00:06:41.220> way<00:06:41.430> and<00:06:42.030> so<00:06:42.180> I<00:06:42.210> really<00:06:42.420> think<00:06:42.570> you<00:06:42.630> know

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
that way and so I really think you know

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.270 
that way and so I really think you know
those<00:06:42.870> are<00:06:42.990> some<00:06:43.140> key<00:06:43.380> elements<00:06:43.920> to<00:06:43.980> it<00:06:44.220> I

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
those are some key elements to it I

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.770 
those are some key elements to it I
think<00:06:44.490> for<00:06:44.640> the<00:06:44.820> students<00:06:45.240> as<00:06:45.360> well<00:06:45.390> what

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
think for the students as well what

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.180 
think for the students as well what
they're<00:06:45.900> gonna<00:06:45.990> see<00:06:46.290> is<00:06:46.440> that<00:06:46.650> you<00:06:47.070> know

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
they're gonna see is that you know

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.890 
they're gonna see is that you know
beyond<00:06:47.520> going<00:06:47.760> to<00:06:47.970> class<00:06:48.210> and<00:06:48.480> doing<00:06:48.660> well

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
beyond going to class and doing well

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.020 
beyond going to class and doing well
succeeding<00:06:49.440> academically<00:06:50.070> they<00:06:50.610> start<00:06:50.910> to

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
succeeding academically they start to

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.760 
succeeding academically they start to
see<00:06:51.210> themselves<00:06:51.450> in<00:06:51.960> a<00:06:52.080> different<00:06:52.260> way<00:06:52.530> as

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
see themselves in a different way as

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.440 
see themselves in a different way as
well<00:06:53.040> they<00:06:53.340> see<00:06:53.400> that<00:06:53.700> it's<00:06:53.880> important<00:06:54.360> to

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450
