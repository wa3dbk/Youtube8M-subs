this time I'm going to be doing
something<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.589> little<00:00:07.620> different<00:00:07.919> and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
something a little different and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.600 
something a little different and
probably<00:00:09.120> also<00:00:09.599> for<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.130> next<00:00:11.130> couple<00:00:11.550> of

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
probably also for the next couple of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.259 
probably also for the next couple of

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
as far as reviews are going this time

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.050 
as far as reviews are going this time
I'm<00:00:15.299> doing<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.139> Hasegawa<00:00:17.270> f-16<00:00:18.270> egg<00:00:18.810> plane

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
I'm doing the Hasegawa f-16 egg plane

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.590 
I'm doing the Hasegawa f-16 egg plane
these<00:00:21.060> are<00:00:21.470> as<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.800> tell<00:00:23.010> from<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.600> box

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
these are as you can tell from the box

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.210 
these are as you can tell from the box
are<00:00:24.810> at<00:00:24.930> her<00:00:25.050> neat<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:27.650> deformed<00:00:28.650> aircraft

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
are at her neat little deformed aircraft

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.080 
are at her neat little deformed aircraft
that<00:00:29.420> basically<00:00:30.420> looked<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.080> eggs<00:00:32.090> so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that basically looked a lot like eggs so

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.459 
that basically looked a lot like eggs so
let's<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.719> into<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.200> then<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.469> see

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
let's get into it then so as you can see

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.360 
let's get into it then so as you can see

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
right off we comes with two sets of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.029 
right off we comes with two sets of
decal<00:00:44.760> sheets<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:46.020> having<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.829> major

markings and then a second one with
smaller<00:00:50.789> stencils<00:00:52.160> for<00:00:53.160> various<00:00:53.550> different

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
smaller stencils for various different

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.810 
smaller stencils for various different
bits<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:56.760> has<00:00:57.090> markings<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.690> two<00:00:57.870> aircraft

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
bits it has markings for two aircraft

one<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> foreign<00:01:00.770> service<00:01:01.770> f-16<00:01:02.670> not<00:01:03.600> exactly

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
one a foreign service f-16 not exactly

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.590 
one a foreign service f-16 not exactly
sure<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:04.589> country<00:01:05.100> roughed<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:06.090> my<00:01:06.390> head

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
sure which country roughed up my head

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.609 
sure which country roughed up my head
and<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> standard<00:01:08.630> three<00:01:09.630> tone<00:01:09.810> gray<00:01:10.140> scheme

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and the standard three tone gray scheme

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.950 
and the standard three tone gray scheme
and<00:01:11.030> also<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.270> f-16<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.790> of<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:15.720> almost

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and also a f-16 out of I'm almost

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.390 
and also a f-16 out of I'm almost
certain<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:17.220> Korean<00:01:17.610> Air<00:01:17.820> Race<00:01:19.189> again<00:01:20.189> in

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
certain it's a Korean Air Race again in

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.510 
certain it's a Korean Air Race again in
the<00:01:20.610> three<00:01:20.909> color<00:01:21.150> scheme<00:01:21.710> now<00:01:22.710> what's<00:01:23.369> nice

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the three color scheme now what's nice

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.370 
the three color scheme now what's nice
about<00:01:23.580> these<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.390> planes<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.990> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
about these little planes is that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.010 
about these little planes is that
there's<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:26.430> far<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.820> number<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.780> steps

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
there's as far as number of steps

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.240 
there's as far as number of steps
there's<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.890> many

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
there's not that many

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.160 
there's not that many
and<00:01:30.560> really<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.909> say<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.420> good

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
and really it's I would say it's a good

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.280 
and really it's I would say it's a good
starter<00:01:34.740> kit<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:36.450> there's<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
starter kit in that and there's not that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.569 
starter kit in that and there's not that
much<00:01:37.710> work<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:40.710> basically

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
much work to it and you can it basically

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.670 
much work to it and you can it basically
you<00:01:41.759> won't<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.590> an

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
you won't have that much of an

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
you won't have that much of an
opportunity<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.180> frustrated

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
opportunity to really get frustrated

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.889 
opportunity to really get frustrated
with<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:47.060> fairly<00:01:48.060> basically<00:01:48.869> I

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
with it and you can fairly basically I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.710 
with it and you can fairly basically I
would<00:01:49.170> say<00:01:49.320> an<00:01:49.829> almost<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> weekend<00:01:50.939> worth<00:01:51.540> of

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
would say an almost a weekend worth of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.109 
would say an almost a weekend worth of
work<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.640> there's<00:01:53.820> only<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
work as you can see here there's only a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.230 
work as you can see here there's only a
single<00:01:54.450> sprue<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.110> parts<00:01:55.640> we<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> upper

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
single sprue of parts we have the upper

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.219 
single sprue of parts we have the upper
and<00:01:57.540> lower<00:01:57.979> fuselage<00:01:58.979> halves<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.229> intake

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and lower fuselage halves the intake

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.090 
and lower fuselage halves the intake
landing<00:02:01.890> gear<00:02:02.630> hat<00:02:03.630> pilot<00:02:04.170> figure<00:02:04.350> I'm

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
landing gear hat pilot figure I'm

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.790 
landing gear hat pilot figure I'm
guessing<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.640> did<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
guessing they did just the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.040 
guessing they did just the
Triana<00:02:07.760> vory<00:02:08.660> Tom<00:02:09.190> seam<00:02:10.190> lines<00:02:11.140> tail<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
Triana vory Tom seam lines tail and

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.630 
Triana vory Tom seam lines tail and
stabilizers<00:02:15.050> as<00:02:15.170> well<00:02:15.350> as<00:02:15.530> two<00:02:15.860> fairly<00:02:16.430> large

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
stabilizers as well as two fairly large

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.590 
stabilizers as well as two fairly large
missiles<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:18.500> one<00:02:18.830> thing<00:02:19.100> on<00:02:19.370> these<00:02:20.240> from<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
missiles the one thing on these from the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.860 
missiles the one thing on these from the
instruction<00:02:21.050> sheet<00:02:22.120> there<00:02:23.120> are<00:02:23.150> no<00:02:23.450> markings

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
instruction sheet there are no markings

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.130 
instruction sheet there are no markings
for<00:02:24.290> those<00:02:24.590> missiles<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.580> unfortunately<00:02:26.420> they

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
for those missiles so unfortunately they

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.140 
for those missiles so unfortunately they
are<00:02:27.170> going<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.950> look<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.120> little

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
are going to kind of look a little

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.850 
are going to kind of look a little
sparse<00:02:30.020> in<00:02:30.320> comparison<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:32.590> rest<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.770> the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
sparse in comparison to the rest of the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.690 
sparse in comparison to the rest of the
aircraft<00:02:34.280> as<00:02:34.520> far<00:02:34.730> as<00:02:34.850> markings<00:02:35.240> go<00:02:36.490> but<00:02:37.490> yeah

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
aircraft as far as markings go but yeah

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.360 
aircraft as far as markings go but yeah
as<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.360> said<00:02:38.420> there's<00:02:38.720> not<00:02:38.840> too<00:02:39.080> much<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.770> this

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
as I said there's not too much to this

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.620 
as I said there's not too much to this

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
other thing before I forget another very

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.250 
other thing before I forget another very
good<00:04:07.630> point<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:09.330> this<00:04:10.330> kid<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:10.780> others<00:04:10.990> like

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
good point to this kid and others like

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.510 
good point to this kid and others like
it<00:04:11.310> is<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.730> price<00:04:12.940> as<00:04:13.240> they're<00:04:13.510> only<00:04:13.750> about

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
it is the price as they're only about

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.420 
it is the price as they're only about
ten<00:04:15.520> to<00:04:15.640> twelve<00:04:15.880> dollars<00:04:16.269> here<00:04:16.510> in<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.690> US<00:04:17.430> so

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
ten to twelve dollars here in the US so

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.180 
ten to twelve dollars here in the US so
you<00:04:18.519> can<00:04:18.760> probably<00:04:19.420> get<00:04:19.810> them<00:04:20.019> fairly<00:04:20.799> easily

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
you can probably get them fairly easily

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.340 
you can probably get them fairly easily
and<00:04:21.960> relatively<00:04:22.960> inexpensive<00:04:24.390> so<00:04:25.390> again<00:04:25.930> that

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
and relatively inexpensive so again that

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.460 
and relatively inexpensive so again that
was<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:27.100> mascara<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.270> sixteen<00:04:28.720> big<00:04:29.200> plane

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
was the mascara of sixteen big plane

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.880
