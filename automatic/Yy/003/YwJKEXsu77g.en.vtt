00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
and forget it forget about all the basic

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.820 
and forget it forget about all the basic
principles<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:46.460> have<00:01:46.580> learned<00:01:47.290> with<00:01:48.290> patents

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
principles we have learned with patents

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.880 
principles we have learned with patents
and<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.430> system<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.200> that's<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.740> big

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
and the system and so that's the big

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.230 
and the system and so that's the big
thing<00:01:51.920> too

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
thing too

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.320 
thing too
think<00:01:54.840> about<00:01:55.140> or<00:01:55.920> looking<00:01:56.430> everything<00:01:56.760> from<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
think about or looking everything from a

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.810 
think about or looking everything from a
horse's<00:01:57.870> point<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.350> view<00:01:58.530> or<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
horse's point of view or from a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.020 
horse's point of view or from a
partnership<00:02:00.300> point<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.380> view<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.220> you<00:02:02.280> can

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
partnership point of view so you can

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.950 
partnership point of view so you can
keep<00:02:03.300> your<00:02:04.010> relationship<00:02:05.010> going<00:02:05.540> even<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
keep your relationship going even in a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.770 
keep your relationship going even in a
higher<00:02:07.530> competition<00:02:08.460> that's<00:02:08.970> very<00:02:09.570> very

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
higher competition that's very very

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.990 
higher competition that's very very
important<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> me<00:02:11.270> talk<00:02:12.270> about<00:02:12.350> some

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
important to me talk about some

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.340 
important to me talk about some
strategies<00:02:15.000> I've<00:02:15.270> learned<00:02:15.570> with<00:02:15.780> Pirelli

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350

they're<00:02:16.950> helping<00:02:17.520> me<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:18.060> chomping<00:02:18.690> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
they're helping me in chomping and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.520 
they're helping me in chomping and
that's<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.830> main<00:02:20.370> part<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:20.940> emotion<00:02:21.660> you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
that's the main part it's emotion you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.010 
that's the main part it's emotion you
know<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:23.070> horses<00:02:23.730> run<00:02:23.970> very<00:02:24.300> fast<00:02:24.570> out<00:02:24.959> of
