 news from sony ubisoft 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.640
 old and microsoft it's far from 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.619
 finished 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.559

 shortly, moreover, you can 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.600
 follow commented on jeuxvideo.com just 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.129
 next to the click 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.809
 but there will not have been a conference 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.940
 nintendo today since the show 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.320
 finally opens its doors and we have full 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.480
 full of games to see exactly 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.469
 we wait for all the games that nintendo 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.079
 has not yet unveiled 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.160
 if if nintendo a little communicated on the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.020
 console in itself there are some 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.030
 days there it will be hoped in any case 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.410
 focused on games and outside of 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.879
 Nintendo, we'll see what we're doing 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.890
 see assassin's creed iii today I 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.310
 thought 3 halo 4 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.710
 the star is explained in pieces and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.540
 and you get all all topics 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.760
 videos and all the insights from here 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.060
 a few hours on jeuxvideo.com has very 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.900
 quick 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.900
 ciao ciao 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.270
 we are in an ultra world 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.220
 connected is controlled by the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.290
 computers but who controls the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.729
 computers this is basically the subject 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.869
 of the new license presented yesterday 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.149
 evening by ubisoft 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.070
 during his lecture at e3 the game 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.409
 is called watchdogs the hero or rather 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.360
 the anti hero is a hacker named 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.610
 hyde pierce who use computers 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.170
 to spy on his enemies ubisoft had 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.210
 kept this nugget as final bunch 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.100
 of his lecture and the facts was 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.990
 successful gameplay videos are 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.539
 really impressive but nothing 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 more normal watchdog is indeed a game 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.869
 triple aaa in other words a license 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.460
 major in the budget amounts to 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.909
 tens of millions of 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.979
 dollars 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.960
 it was developed by ubisoft montreal 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.759
 is for now there is no date 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.750
 precise launching and it is however 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.729
 confirmed for pc xbox 360 and ps3 a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.330
 future hit we'll talk about again without 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.330
 doubt very soon 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.590
 a few weeks ago we will 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.330
 presented a technological demo 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.280
 impressive campus the studio 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.680
 french led by david cage who 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.239
 we must have the excellent clean last night 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.680
 at 3 it's during the conference sony 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.829
 that the studio has unveiled its new 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.410
 project titled beyond except this will be a 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.829
 excluded ps3 that goes beyond the simple game 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.780
 video 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.060
 this title should be an experience 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.620
 composed of ultra realistic scenes the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.329
 actors were all captured by the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.769
 capture performance bias and the 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.140
 main character is downright 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.269
 performed by a confirmed actress in 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.170
 ntage that we saw in the gino movies 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.120
 and inception 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.070
 she will play the role of jodie in the cold 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.200
 this young woman complex and tortured and 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.880
 endowed with supernatural powers and we 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.010
 will follow for several years of his 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.480
 life but it will have to be patient because the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.480
 game will only be released in 2013 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.230
 as expected the conference microsoft has 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.660
 booked yesterday a nice surprise to all 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.700
 fans of the franchise gears of war a 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.410
 new episode was presented yesterday this 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.030
 is not a sequel but a prequel that 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.960
 takes place thus ten years before the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.760
 first trilogy 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.430
 we will follow dimon baird and we will 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.560
 will meet a certain marcus fenix the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.660
 hero of the three previous episodes this 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.370
 new opus of gears of war will be enough 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.230
 different since it is not developed 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.240
 by epic games indeed it's the studio 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.640
 people can fly that we know mostly 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.070
 in his title ultra violent bulletstorm 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.870
 who was charged to take over 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.490
 and apparently people can fly he did not 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.530
 decided to venture into the adventure 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.270
 philosophical normally it's always 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.980
 as violent and the demo is a 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.480
 sequence of scenes more percussive 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.030
 than the ihm that others will be 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.940
 obviously an excluded xbox 360 and the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.320
 title will be released in 2013 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.780
 the adedy of the day and for fred foot for 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.720
 the organization of the holidays of jvc 2012 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.860
 self derision and humor guaranteed the click 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.360
 it's over for today 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.140
 found again very soon and honestly 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.140
 it's good
