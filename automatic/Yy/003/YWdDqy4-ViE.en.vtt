00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
yard box so that was the one thing about

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310 
yard box so that was the one thing about
Rooney<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.570> did<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:33.930> enjoy

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
about him but overall if he had good

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.660 
about him but overall if he had good
work<00:01:37.259> rates<00:01:37.500> he<00:01:37.770> would<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> best

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
work rates he would be one of the best

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.260 
work rates he would be one of the best
strikers<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> game<00:01:39.600> he<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.259> strong

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
strikers in the game he is strong

strikers in the game he is strong
decently<00:01:42.270> fast<00:01:42.540> his<00:01:42.990> shots<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.500> amazing<00:01:43.950> he

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
decently fast his shots are amazing he

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.280 
decently fast his shots are amazing he
can<00:01:44.250> actually<00:01:44.490> pass<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> striker<00:01:45.720> which<00:01:46.079> is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
can actually pass for a striker which is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.550 
can actually pass for a striker which is
so<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.340> useful<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.750> said<00:01:48.810> about<00:01:49.140> Tevez

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
so so useful like I said about Tevez

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.219 
so so useful like I said about Tevez
Rudy<00:01:50.189> he's<00:01:50.549> probably<00:01:51.030> better<00:01:51.329> suited<00:01:51.450> off<00:01:51.990> as

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Rudy he's probably better suited off as

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.380 
Rudy he's probably better suited off as
a<00:01:52.259> cam<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.860> mean<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.850> high<00:01:54.000> defensive

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
a cam I mean with that high defensive

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
is quite unfortunate but overall he's

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.979 
is quite unfortunate but overall he's
still<00:04:01.280> a<00:04:01.310> fantastic<00:04:02.180> player<00:04:02.390> he<00:04:02.629> cost<00:04:02.840> me

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
still a fantastic player he cost me

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.580 
still a fantastic player he cost me
around<00:04:03.140> 85<00:04:03.680> k<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:05.090> just<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.690> little<00:04:06.049> bit<00:04:06.170> cheaper

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
around 85 k so just a little bit cheaper

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.130 
around 85 k so just a little bit cheaper
than<00:04:06.829> a<00:04:06.890> Rooney<00:04:07.760> over<00:04:08.030> there<00:04:08.180> but<00:04:08.480> as<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:09.049> can

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
than a Rooney over there but as you can

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.900 
than a Rooney over there but as you can
see<00:04:09.319> just<00:04:09.530> these<00:04:09.680> first<00:04:09.980> clips<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.430> heading<00:04:10.760> is

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
see just these first clips is heading is

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.449 
see just these first clips is heading is
quite<00:04:11.329> substantial<00:04:11.590> it's<00:04:12.590> quite<00:04:12.950> good<00:04:13.160> and

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
quite substantial it's quite good and

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.670 
quite substantial it's quite good and
for<00:04:14.329> how<00:04:14.450> small<00:04:14.750> he<00:04:14.930> is<00:04:14.959> he's<00:04:15.230> not<00:04:15.349> exactly

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
for how small he is he's not exactly

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.370

Paul<00:04:16.489> his<00:04:17.060> work<00:04:17.299> rates<00:04:17.510> are<00:04:17.660> high<00:04:17.810> low<00:04:18.079> which

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
Paul his work rates are high low which

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.920 
Paul his work rates are high low which
is<00:04:18.560> quite<00:04:18.919> good<00:04:19.130> for<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.370> striker<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:20.030> personally

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
is quite good for a striker I personally

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.110 
is quite good for a striker I personally
don't<00:04:21.109> like<00:04:21.290> it<00:04:21.650> too<00:04:22.070> much<00:04:22.250> because<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.820> find

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
don't like it too much because I find

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.540 
don't like it too much because I find
that<00:04:23.419> if<00:04:23.780> they're<00:04:24.440> always<00:04:24.620> right<00:04:25.039> beside<00:04:25.400> the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
that if they're always right beside the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.670 
that if they're always right beside the
defender<00:04:26.000> they're<00:04:26.210> never<00:04:26.389> completely<00:04:27.110> open

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
defender they're never completely open

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.980 
defender they're never completely open
which<00:04:27.950> is<00:04:28.130> frustrating<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.760> me<00:04:28.789> but<00:04:29.210> overall

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990
