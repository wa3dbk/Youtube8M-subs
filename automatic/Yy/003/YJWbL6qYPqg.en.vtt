don't<00:00:52.649> know<00:00:52.710> exactly<00:00:53.129> what<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.610> means

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
don't know exactly what this means

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.330 
don't know exactly what this means
obviously<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.860> lead<00:00:56.010> us<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> believe

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
obviously but one can lead us to believe

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.310 
obviously but one can lead us to believe
that<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.850> got<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.050> online

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
that it's got to do with the online

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.099 
that it's got to do with the online
feature<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.039> GTA<00:00:59.399> 5<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.000> who<00:01:00.600> knows<00:01:00.780> exactly

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
feature in GTA 5 and who knows exactly

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.740 
feature in GTA 5 and who knows exactly
what<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.920> gonna<00:01:02.129> bring<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.600> all

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
what this is gonna bring this is all

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
what this is gonna bring this is all
this<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.589> potential<00:01:05.040> leaked<00:01:05.250> information

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
this is all potential leaked information

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.820 
this is all potential leaked information
and<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.810> thinking<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.320> maybe<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.680> could

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and I'm thinking that maybe it could

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.800 
and I'm thinking that maybe it could
have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> actual<00:01:09.270> drug

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
have to do more with the actual drug

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.140 
have to do more with the actual drug
dealing<00:01:10.170> business<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.710> GTA<00:01:11.400> 5<00:01:11.700> maybe<00:01:11.970> they

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
dealing business in GTA 5 maybe they

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
dealing business in GTA 5 maybe they
were<00:01:12.210> giving<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.689> expansions<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.530> maybe

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
were giving more expansions or maybe

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.020 
were giving more expansions or maybe
they're<00:01:13.979> gonna<00:01:14.100> give<00:01:14.280> us<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.549> ability<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
they're gonna give us the ability to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.719 
they're gonna give us the ability to
start<00:01:15.450> selling<00:01:15.930> drugs<00:01:16.259> mind<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.430> think<00:01:17.580> that's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
start selling drugs mind I think that's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.670 
start selling drugs mind I think that's
that's<00:01:17.970> at<00:01:18.119> least<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:18.479> thought<00:01:18.780> maybe<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.530> can

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that's at least my thought maybe we can

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.109 
that's at least my thought maybe we can
start<00:01:19.920> selling<00:01:20.250> drugs<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.670> other<00:01:20.700> players

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
start selling drugs to other players

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.300 
start selling drugs to other players
maybe<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.140> start<00:01:22.290> doing<00:01:22.619> stuff<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.100> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
maybe we can start doing stuff like that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.980 
maybe we can start doing stuff like that
who<00:01:23.790> knows<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.750> very

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
who knows but I think this is very

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.749 
who knows but I think this is very
interesting<00:01:25.170> information<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.369> who<00:01:26.549> knows

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
interesting information and who knows

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.910 
interesting information and who knows
when<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.750> potential<00:01:28.290> leak<00:01:28.470> could<00:01:28.710> actually

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
when this potential leak could actually

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.190 
when this potential leak could actually
happen<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:30.479> excited<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:31.170> really

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
happen but I'm really excited I'm really

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.719 
happen but I'm really excited I'm really
you<00:01:31.619> know<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.310> hoping<00:01:32.520> that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you know I'm really really hoping that

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
you know I'm really really hoping that
this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.180> make<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.450> big<00:01:33.720> change<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.200> GTA<00:01:34.560> 5

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
this is gonna make a big change in GTA 5

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.980 
this is gonna make a big change in GTA 5
as<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:36.030> would<00:01:36.150> kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> game<00:01:36.960> more

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
as it would kind of make the game more

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
as it would kind of make the game more
interesting<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.189> actually<00:01:38.520> control

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
interesting if we can actually control

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
interesting if we can actually control
more<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> drug<00:01:39.750> stuff<00:01:40.110> maybe<00:01:40.920> they're

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
more of the drug stuff maybe they're

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.740 
more of the drug stuff maybe they're
gonna<00:01:41.189> add<00:01:41.369> more<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.030> missions<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.720> the

what you guys would think about this I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.530 
what you guys would think about this I
actually<00:02:15.670> kind<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.910> looking<00:02:16.180> forward<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
something like this I think it would be

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.260 
something like this I think it would be
really<00:02:18.340> cool<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.730> would<00:02:18.820> make<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.090> game<00:02:19.210> a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
really cool and it would make the game a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.360 
really cool and it would make the game a
little<00:02:19.390> bit<00:02:19.540> more<00:02:19.720> interesting<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.410> give<00:02:21.250> it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
little bit more interesting and give it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.830 
little bit more interesting and give it
like<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.520> totally<00:02:21.910> different<00:02:21.940> spin<00:02:22.570> you<00:02:22.750> know

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840
