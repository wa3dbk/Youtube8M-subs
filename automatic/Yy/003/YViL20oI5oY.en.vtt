there ain't no decent doughnuts in
general<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.790> then<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:25.970> learned<00:02:26.209> that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
general and and then I learned that

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.880 
general and and then I learned that
there<00:02:26.599> was<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.930> closest<00:02:27.349> Krispy<00:02:27.650> Kremes

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
there was the closest Krispy Kremes

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.860 
there was the closest Krispy Kremes
about<00:02:28.190> five<00:02:28.430> miles<00:02:28.640> south<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.180> highway<00:02:29.510> I

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
about five miles south on a highway I

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.660 
about five miles south on a highway I
because<00:02:30.620> I'm<00:02:30.739> new<00:02:30.890> in<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.100> area<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.400> didn't

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
because I'm new in the area I didn't

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.250 
because I'm new in the area I didn't
have<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.850> lot<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.180> experience<00:02:32.720> driving<00:02:32.870> down

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
have a lot of experience driving down

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.979 
have a lot of experience driving down
that<00:02:33.470> highway<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.030> first<00:02:35.209> few<00:02:35.450> times<00:02:35.720> I

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
that highway so the first few times I

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.140 
that highway so the first few times I
drove<00:02:36.170> down<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:37.070> was<00:02:37.280> for<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.609> purpose<00:02:37.820> of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
drove down it it was for the purpose of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.390 
drove down it it was for the purpose of
getting<00:02:38.269> donuts<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:39.500> accidentally<00:02:40.100> trained

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
getting donuts so I accidentally trained

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.819 
getting donuts so I accidentally trained
myself<00:02:40.609> to<00:02:41.150> associate<00:02:41.840> donuts<00:02:42.410> with<00:02:42.620> driving

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
myself to associate donuts with driving

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.220 
myself to associate donuts with driving
down<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.310> highway<00:02:43.489> now<00:02:44.180> every<00:02:44.690> time<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.930> drop

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
down that highway now every time I drop

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.960 
down that highway now every time I drop
down<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.530> highway<00:02:45.829> for<00:02:46.069> whatever<00:02:46.370> reason<00:02:46.790> I

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
down the highway for whatever reason I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.970 
down the highway for whatever reason I
can't<00:02:47.480> help<00:02:47.660> but<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.930> think<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.260> myself<00:02:48.290> hey

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
can't help but to think to myself hey

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.069 
can't help but to think to myself hey
Krispy<00:02:49.400> Kreme<00:02:49.609> it's<00:02:50.120> an<00:02:50.209> idea<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.690> just<00:02:50.720> pops

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
Krispy Kreme it's an idea it just pops

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.720 
Krispy Kreme it's an idea it just pops
into<00:02:51.290> my<00:02:51.470> head<00:02:51.500> as<00:02:51.859> a<00:02:51.890> response<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.430> driving

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
into my head as a response to driving

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.970 
into my head as a response to driving
down<00:02:52.940> on<00:02:53.120> highway<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.019> not<00:02:54.230> too<00:02:54.380> long<00:02:54.560> ago<00:02:54.620> it's

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
down on highway so not too long ago it's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.740 
down on highway so not too long ago it's
driving<00:02:55.280> down<00:02:55.400> at<00:02:55.579> my<00:02:55.730> way<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.389> that<00:02:56.510> thought

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
driving down at my way and that thought

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.479 
driving down at my way and that thought
popped<00:02:57.049> into<00:02:57.200> my<00:02:57.410> head<00:02:57.440> about<00:02:57.799> donuts<00:02:58.280> and

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
popped into my head about donuts and

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.390 
popped into my head about donuts and
that<00:02:58.609> kicked<00:02:59.060> in<00:02:59.299> a<00:02:59.569> prefrontal<00:03:00.500> analytic

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
that kicked in a prefrontal analytic

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.190 
that kicked in a prefrontal analytic
process<00:03:01.940> I'm<00:03:02.209> gonna<00:03:02.359> describe<00:03:02.690> like<00:03:02.959> this

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
process I'm gonna describe like this

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.309 
process I'm gonna describe like this
basically<00:03:03.829> what<00:03:04.340> my<00:03:05.209> part<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.660> my<00:03:05.720> pre<00:03:06.139> frontal

basically what my part of my pre frontal

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.490 
basically what my part of my pre frontal
brain<00:03:06.530> says<00:03:07.510> well<00:03:08.510> we<00:03:08.690> can<00:03:08.840> get<00:03:08.959> krispy<00:03:09.290> kreme

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
prefrontal cortex about whether or not I

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.420

should<00:04:21.850> pursue<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:22.480> option<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:23.110> that

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
should pursue this option and that

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.120 
should pursue this option and that
