engaging co-op liner that's difficult

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.160

question<00:01:19.700> they're<00:01:20.090> all<00:01:20.240> fascinating

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
question they're all fascinating

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.070 
question they're all fascinating
individuals<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.250> think<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.850> plot<00:01:23.150> was<00:01:23.480> the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
individuals I think the plot was the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.350 
individuals I think the plot was the
most<00:01:24.610> interesting<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:25.760> engaging<00:01:25.850> because<00:01:26.270> it

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
most interesting and engaging because it

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.820 
most interesting and engaging because it
was<00:01:26.450> three<00:01:26.630> different<00:01:26.930> versions<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.620> same

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
was three different versions of the same

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.430 
was three different versions of the same
sort<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.370> clone<00:01:28.640> character<00:01:29.270> similar<00:01:29.990> sort<00:01:30.320> of

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
sort of clone character similar sort of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.340 
sort of clone character similar sort of
I<00:01:31.040> guess<00:01:31.400> features<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.210> very<00:01:32.990> different

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
I guess features but very different

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.620 
I guess features but very different
language<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:34.520> got<00:01:34.670> one<00:01:34.880> who's<00:01:35.090> like<00:01:35.360> the

Alpha you know and you got another one

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.150 
Alpha you know and you got another one
it's<00:01:37.850> like<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:38.090> crazy<00:01:38.420> crackhead<00:01:39.350> psychopath

like the the moods you did you know one

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.390 
like the the moods you did you know one
really<00:02:33.200> interesting<00:02:33.560> thing<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.830> we<00:02:33.950> did<00:02:34.160> is

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
really interesting thing that we did is

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.430 
really interesting thing that we did is
you<00:02:34.940> know<00:02:35.060> we<00:02:35.240> kind<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.600> planned<00:02:35.840> out<00:02:36.170> what<00:02:36.319> we

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
you know we kind of planned out what we

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.260 
you know we kind of planned out what we
wanted<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.010> had<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> vibe<00:02:37.550> from<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.030> first

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
wanted and we had a vibe from the first

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.870 
wanted and we had a vibe from the first
game<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:39.140> we<00:02:39.290> really<00:02:39.560> tried<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.860> develop<00:02:40.250> the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
game but we really tried to develop the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.570 
game but we really tried to develop the
creatures<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.540> take<00:02:41.720> them<00:02:41.870> farther<00:02:42.200> and

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
creatures to take them farther and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.100 
creatures to take them farther and
jacamo<00:02:43.580> we<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:43.940> let<00:02:44.150> him<00:02:44.330> run<00:02:44.540> with<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.959> and

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
jacamo we just let him run with it and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.390 
jacamo we just let him run with it and
he<00:02:45.319> just<00:02:45.500> looked<00:02:45.680> took<00:02:45.860> everything<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
he just looked took everything to the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.150 
he just looked took everything to the
next<00:02:46.520> level<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.230> we<00:02:48.230> did<00:02:48.440> very<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.040> know<00:02:49.100> very

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
next level and we did very you know very

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.220 
next level and we did very you know very
freeform<00:02:49.760> experimenting<00:02:50.690> see<00:02:50.900> what<00:02:51.050> worked

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
freeform experimenting see what worked

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.010 
freeform experimenting see what worked
really<00:02:51.440> well<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.040> i<00:02:52.819> think<00:02:53.300> i<00:02:53.720> think<00:02:53.750> the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
really well and i think i think the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.110 
really well and i think i think the
fancy<00:02:54.530> guys<00:02:54.680> are<00:02:54.920> really<00:02:55.250> really<00:02:55.580> gonna<00:02:55.790> dig

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
fancy guys are really really gonna dig

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.030 
fancy guys are really really gonna dig
what<00:02:56.690> we've<00:02:56.810> done<00:02:56.990> with<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.680> creatures

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
what we've done with the the creatures

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.670 
what we've done with the the creatures
it<00:02:58.160> has<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> really<00:02:58.580> unique<00:02:59.150> feel<00:02:59.959> and<00:02:59.990> sal<00:03:00.440> to

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
it has a really unique feel and sal to

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.850 
it has a really unique feel and sal to
it

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.160 

so<00:03:04.860> which<00:03:05.310> which<00:03:05.700> character<00:03:06.210> did<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.900> find

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
so which which character did you find

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.040 
so which which character did you find
the<00:03:07.500> most<00:03:07.920> challenging<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.700> play<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.240> think

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
the most challenging to play I think

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.540 
the most challenging to play I think
that<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.530> blow<00:03:10.770> was<00:03:10.980> probably<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> most

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
that the blow was probably the most

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.630 
that the blow was probably the most
challenging<00:03:12.120> because<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.600> had<00:03:12.780> some<00:03:13.170> real

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
challenging because it had some real

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.890 
challenging because it had some real
some<00:03:14.640> sort<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.910> real<00:03:15.030> constraints<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
some sort of real constraints on the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.580 
some sort of real constraints on the
character<00:03:17.930> legitimate<00:03:18.930> constraints<00:03:19.470> like

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
character legitimate constraints like

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.390 
character legitimate constraints like
the<00:03:20.130> weight<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.550> huge<00:03:21.060> character<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:22.400> there

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
the weight is a huge character and there

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.460 
the weight is a huge character and there
are<00:03:23.520> certain<00:03:23.760> limitations<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:24.690> would<00:03:25.380> imagine

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
are certain limitations I would imagine

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.630 
are certain limitations I would imagine
when<00:03:25.830> you're<00:03:25.950> carrying<00:03:26.220> around<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.490> much

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
when you're carrying around that much

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.449 
when you're carrying around that much
weight<00:03:26.850> which<00:03:27.090> had<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.420> be<00:03:27.540> very<00:03:27.570> careful<00:03:28.170> of

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
weight which had to be very careful of

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.120 
weight which had to be very careful of
whereas<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.850> other<00:03:29.880> crawler<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.130> you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
whereas the other crawler and the you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.430 
whereas the other crawler and the you
know<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.370> siren<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.300> so<00:03:33.780> forth<00:03:34.050> that

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
know the siren and and so forth that

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.530 
know the siren and and so forth that
there's<00:03:35.010> sort<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.520> no<00:03:35.580> precedent<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.239> the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
there's sort of no precedent that the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.020 
there's sort of no precedent that the
bloat<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.020> kind<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.520> realistic<00:03:38.520> precedent

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
bloat is a kind of a realistic precedent

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.479 
bloat is a kind of a realistic precedent
that<00:03:39.090> we'd<00:03:39.330> have<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.540> kind<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.530> hone<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.220> on<00:03:41.310> you

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
that we'd have to kind of hone in on you

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.970 
that we'd have to kind of hone in on you
it's<00:03:41.940> hard<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.300> be<00:03:42.390> dangerous<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.050> cumbersome

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
it's hard to be dangerous and cumbersome

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.530 
it's hard to be dangerous and cumbersome
at<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.220> same<00:03:44.400> thing<00:03:44.640> right<00:03:44.970> especially<00:03:45.120> when

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
at the same thing right especially when

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.140 
at the same thing right especially when
you<00:03:45.660> got<00:03:45.780> used<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.260> playing<00:03:46.670> agile<00:03:47.670> freaks

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
you got used to playing agile freaks

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.780 
you got used to playing agile freaks
like<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.600> plot<00:03:49.430> yeah<00:03:50.430> i<00:03:50.489> think<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.760> probably

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
like the plot yeah i think it probably

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.750 
like the plot yeah i think it probably
took<00:03:51.150> us<00:03:51.300> 20<00:03:51.600> minutes<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.930> show<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.470> yeah<00:03:53.220> yeah

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
took us 20 minutes to show you yeah yeah

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.120 
took us 20 minutes to show you yeah yeah
with<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> bit<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.600> Bill<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.260> Burt<00:03:55.650> waddling

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
with a bit of Bill and Burt waddling

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.310 
with a bit of Bill and Burt waddling
around<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.550> book<00:03:56.700> all<00:03:57.150> over<00:03:57.420> better<00:03:57.690> upon<00:03:58.110> the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
around the book all over better upon the

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.199 
around the book all over better upon the
natural<00:03:58.770> blew<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.010> off<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.430> then<00:03:59.610> Jack<00:03:59.880> Mahood

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
natural blew it off and then Jack Mahood

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.420 
natural blew it off and then Jack Mahood
which<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.630> cannot<00:04:01.080> applaud<00:04:01.680> them<00:04:01.920> enough<00:04:02.220> for

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
which I cannot applaud them enough for

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.610 
which I cannot applaud them enough for
doing<00:04:02.700> because<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.120> just<00:04:03.410> inspires<00:04:04.410> and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
doing because it just inspires and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.920 
doing because it just inspires and
motivates<00:04:04.650> me<00:04:05.220> um<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.700> know<00:04:05.820> maybe<00:04:06.420> someday

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
motivates me um you know maybe someday

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.420 
motivates me um you know maybe someday
we'll<00:04:07.260> we'll<00:04:07.470> put<00:04:07.680> out<00:04:07.799> some<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.160> videos
