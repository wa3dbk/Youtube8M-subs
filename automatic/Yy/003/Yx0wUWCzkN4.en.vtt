00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
for the heavy work sets so we've started

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.969 
for the heavy work sets so we've started
with<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> big<00:00:54.479> compound<00:00:55.019> movement<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
with a big compound movement for the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.619 
with a big compound movement for the
shoulders<00:00:56.369> let's<00:00:56.820> get<00:00:57.000> some<00:00:57.180> more<00:00:57.329> weight<00:00:57.600> on

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
shoulders let's get some more weight on

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.259 
shoulders let's get some more weight on
there<00:00:58.019> and<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.799> overload<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.549> push<00:01:00.059> our

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
there and really overload and push our

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:15.020 
there and really overload and push our
bodies<00:01:00.420> towards<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.049> 12<00:01:01.350> rep<00:01:01.500> max<00:01:13.880> this<00:01:14.880> is

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
bodies towards that 12 rep max this is

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.719 
bodies towards that 12 rep max this is
really<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.390> first<00:01:15.600> work<00:01:15.960> set<00:01:16.429> where<00:01:17.429> I<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
really my first work set where I get to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.600 
really my first work set where I get to
push<00:01:17.940> my<00:01:18.119> body<00:01:18.300> lifting<00:01:19.140> heavier<00:01:19.409> weights<00:01:19.610> so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
push my body lifting heavier weights so

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.609 
push my body lifting heavier weights so
form<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.060> technique<00:01:21.259> really<00:01:22.259> become

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
form and technique really become

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:34.850 
form and technique really become
important<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.429> one<00:01:33.440> did<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.530> might<00:01:34.679> end

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
important on this one did you might end

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.820 
important on this one did you might end
up<00:01:34.920> warm<00:01:35.190> up<00:01:35.659> hit<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:36.810> top<00:01:37.049> reps<00:01:37.289> on<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.649> I

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
up warm up hit my top reps on there I

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.859 
up warm up hit my top reps on there I
still<00:01:38.220> feel<00:01:38.429> like<00:01:38.459> I<00:01:38.819> can<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.090> heavier<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.750> I'm

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
still feel like I can go heavier so I'm

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.149 
still feel like I can go heavier so I'm
going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> continue<00:01:40.500> adding<00:01:40.649> a<00:01:40.920> small

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
going to continue adding a small

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.760 
going to continue adding a small
increase<00:01:41.789> to<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> machine<00:01:42.810> only<00:01:43.259> about<00:01:43.410> five

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
increase to the machine only about five

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.580 
increase to the machine only about five
or<00:01:44.099> ten<00:01:44.310> percent<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.750> whole<00:01:45.929> reason<00:01:46.349> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
or ten percent the whole reason that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.199 
or ten percent the whole reason that
we're<00:01:46.770> trying<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.039> stimulate<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.640> body<00:01:47.849> for

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
we're trying to stimulate the body for

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.510 
we're trying to stimulate the body for
more<00:01:48.330> growth<00:01:48.599> is<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.379> overload<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.069> muscles

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
more growth is to overload the muscles

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.369 
more growth is to overload the muscles
so<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.970> body<00:01:51.179> has<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.479> adapt<00:01:51.959> you<00:01:52.229> don't

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:52.379 
so that the body has to adapt you don't

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.199 
so that the body has to adapt you don't
want<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.619> too<00:01:52.890> heavy<00:01:53.099> so<00:01:53.759> sticking<00:01:54.090> with

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
want to go too heavy so sticking with

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.380 
want to go too heavy so sticking with
maybe<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.989> 10%<00:01:55.319> weight<00:01:55.920> increase<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> good

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
maybe a 10% weight increase is a good

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.150 
maybe a 10% weight increase is a good
rule<00:01:57.629> of<00:01:57.660> thumb<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.289> able<00:01:58.379> to<00:01:58.470> increase<00:01:58.860> in

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
rule of thumb to be able to increase in

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.339 
rule of thumb to be able to increase in
who<00:01:59.340> made<00:01:59.519> your<00:01:59.640> weights<00:01:59.849> up<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.750> if<00:02:00.989> you<00:02:01.140> can

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
who made your weights up but if you can

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.889 
who made your weights up but if you can
stick<00:02:01.709> with<00:02:01.739> the<00:02:01.950> same<00:02:02.129> rep<00:02:02.369> range<00:02:02.640> 10<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.599> 12

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
stick with the same rep range 10 to 12

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.580 
stick with the same rep range 10 to 12
for<00:02:04.410> maximum<00:02:04.890> muscle<00:02:05.369> growth

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
for maximum muscle growth

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
for maximum muscle growth
I<00:02:22.150> had<00:02:23.150> my<00:02:23.299> 12<00:02:23.629> rep<00:02:24.140> range<00:02:24.379> again<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.190> even

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
I had my 12 rep range again and even

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.309 
I had my 12 rep range again and even
though<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.760> could<00:02:26.269> have<00:02:26.390> got<00:02:26.599> a<00:02:26.629> few<00:02:26.959> more<00:02:27.080> reps

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
though I could have got a few more reps

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.320 
though I could have got a few more reps
I<00:02:27.620> would<00:02:28.190> have<00:02:28.280> broken<00:02:28.459> my<00:02:28.700> form<00:02:29.000> and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
I would have broken my form and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.880 
I would have broken my form and
technique<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.900> it's<00:02:30.230> important<00:02:30.680> if<00:02:30.769> you<00:02:30.860> want

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
technique and it's important if you want

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.400 
technique and it's important if you want
to<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.220> most<00:02:31.459> out<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:31.760> your<00:02:32.030> training

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
to get the most out of your training

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.259 
to get the most out of your training
stay<00:02:33.410> with<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.769> same<00:02:34.099> rep<00:02:34.340> range<00:02:34.610> until<00:02:35.120> you

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
stay with that same rep range until you

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.300 
stay with that same rep range until you
can't<00:02:35.569> lift<00:02:35.750> anymore<00:02:36.019> even<00:02:36.890> though<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.160> could

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
can't lift anymore even though you could

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.910 
can't lift anymore even though you could
get<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.489> few<00:02:37.760> more<00:02:37.879> reps<00:02:37.940> out<00:02:38.620> I've<00:02:39.620> been<00:02:39.650> using

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
get a few more reps out I've been using

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.550 
get a few more reps out I've been using
other<00:02:40.220> muscle<00:02:40.640> groups<00:02:40.819> like<00:02:40.970> my<00:02:41.780> triceps<00:02:42.349> and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
other muscle groups like my triceps and

other muscle groups like my triceps and
some<00:02:43.280> more<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.640> traps<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.209> assist<00:02:44.569> with

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
some more of the traps that assist with

some more of the traps that assist with
that<00:02:44.780> exercise<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:46.099> what<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.280> do<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.700> lift<00:02:47.000> as

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
that exercise so what I do is lift as

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.509 
that exercise so what I do is lift as
much<00:02:47.390> weight<00:02:47.630> as<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.170> as<00:02:48.769> soon<00:02:49.040> as<00:02:49.130> I<00:02:49.220> can't

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519

technique and form I stop move on to the
next<00:02:54.590> exercise<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.519> switch<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.910> up<00:02:56.000> speaking

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
next exercise and switch it up speaking

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.720 
next exercise and switch it up speaking
of<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.110> next<00:02:57.319> one<00:02:57.470> I'm<00:02:57.680> going<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.250> switch<00:02:58.489> this

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
of the next one I'm going to switch this

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.569 
of the next one I'm going to switch this
one<00:02:58.940> around<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.599> now<00:03:00.200> face<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.799> bench<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.549> I

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
one around and now face the bench so I

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.330 
one around and now face the bench so I
can<00:03:01.790> focus<00:03:01.940> more<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.420> my<00:03:02.780> rear<00:03:03.110> delts<00:03:03.470> by<00:03:03.980> doing

side and continue lifting until I'm all
done<00:04:12.760> let's<00:04:13.380> get<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.560> it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.640 

here<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.650> goes<00:04:21.799> I'm<00:04:22.220> aiming<00:04:22.789> for<00:04:22.820> 12

here it goes I'm aiming for 12

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.629 
here it goes I'm aiming for 12
likelihood<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.800> I'll<00:04:25.070> probably<00:04:25.400> get

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
likelihood is I'll probably get

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.129 
likelihood is I'll probably get
somewhere<00:04:25.940> in<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.090> region<00:04:26.240> of<00:04:26.419> eight<00:04:26.660> or<00:04:26.930> nine

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
somewhere in the region of eight or nine

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.290 
somewhere in the region of eight or nine
and<00:04:27.380> strip<00:04:28.070> off<00:04:28.250> depending<00:04:28.699> how<00:04:28.850> I'm<00:04:28.970> feeling

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
and strip off depending how I'm feeling

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.990 
and strip off depending how I'm feeling
one<00:04:29.720> maybe<00:04:30.169> two<00:04:30.470> plates<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.009> then<00:04:31.639> get<00:04:31.820> those

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
one maybe two plates and then get those

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.379 
one maybe two plates and then get those
final<00:04:32.330> three<00:04:33.050> or<00:04:33.139> four<00:04:33.350> reps<00:04:33.590> with<00:04:34.370> just<00:04:35.150> all

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
final three or four reps with just all

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:46.060 
final three or four reps with just all
our<00:04:35.509> effort

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.620

now I pretty much petite fully on that
last<00:05:17.639> set<00:05:17.939> so<00:05:18.149> I've<00:05:18.360> taken<00:05:18.599> two<00:05:18.989> plates<00:05:19.259> off<00:05:19.499> to

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:19.739
