I thought immediately of the spiral so I

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.530 
I thought immediately of the spiral so I
came<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> visit<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.670> went<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
common when walking around and it was a

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.600 
common when walking around and it was a
beautiful<00:02:06.470> sparkly<00:02:07.470> day<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:10.500> long<00:02:11.280> was

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.180 
beautiful sparkly day and the long was
covered<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.090> leaves<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.040> there<00:02:14.040> was<00:02:14.160> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
covered with leaves and there was a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.570 
covered with leaves and there was a
woman<00:02:14.730> who<00:02:14.940> had<00:02:15.540> made<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.410> spiral<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
woman who had made a spiral in the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.180 
woman who had made a spiral in the
leaves<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.630> thought<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.890> wild

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
leaves and I thought this is just wild

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.780 
leaves and I thought this is just wild
it<00:02:20.700> was<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.270> an<00:02:21.510> omen<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.310> then<00:02:23.520> I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
it was just like an omen so then I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.210 
it was just like an omen so then I
thought<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.690> shell<00:02:24.990> of<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.410> chambered

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
thought the shell of a chambered

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.880 
thought the shell of a chambered
nautilus<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.470> oldest

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
nautilus it's one of the oldest

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.870 
nautilus it's one of the oldest
creatures<00:02:29.160> on<00:02:29.640> earth<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:31.100> starts<00:02:32.100> its<00:02:32.280> life<00:02:32.400> in
