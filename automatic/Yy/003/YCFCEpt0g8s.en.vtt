 even though get tabea weeks ago 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.699
 I recognize as determined since 2009 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.310
 when I started using youtube what 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.289
 is now six years ago and then has 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.780
 introduce you today 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.329
 this is about collections now 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.700
 have come out in the summer and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.980
 the oli collection neck adrenaline swiftly 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 and the models ears collection means 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.699
 polish potter 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.520
 this is a collection where you already are 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.070
 hears okay there are any colors that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.420
 to be tanned and to be tanned 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.040
 I have just been me again 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.390
 I had to go through it first 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.680
 not for the hot ones I have them 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.710
 painted so I show so good old 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.810
 can and thought somehow sees mine 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.340
 Looks totally happy if I too 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.430
 Great, I'm going to say one right now 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.820
 and I am now even know how a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.360
 toast bread but I thought that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.560
 I look for something and yes me someday 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.180
 also start with the motto 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.040
 fence slats because I think so too 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.049
 just a baby I have now 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.759
 each from both collections dry lake 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.670
 to be sent but there is one 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.140
 coalition even more colors so the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.060
 I carry you now would not show 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.470
 the only ones who experience it you can do it 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.720
 like to go on the side and times 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.450
 watch cabrios on rebuilt so 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.950
 the shop was different from the past 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.110
 now a little clearer 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.000
 and I think it's much more 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.840
 products have come so there is 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.310
 also paints and sigma 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.070
 brushes lies products you will find there 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.540
 everything possible so as worth focusing on 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.869
 every time I look in but me 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.320
 I like new ones and that is 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.240
 I start directly with the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.810
 Wear unity because that is mine 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.430
 absolute highlight at all that is 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.020
 the here and I just have a photo 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.120
 made and i have the feeling of 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.990
 does not come over in the camera like 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.190
 he really is 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.040
 it is an absolutely blatant strong one 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.140
 neon orange so who patches and stands 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.850
 And it is always so in the summer 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.700
 trend that comes again and again 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.500
 always at the pool to have such nails 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.209
 that pops right and that makes good 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.340
 mood 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.590
 but that's really the paint then 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.180
 what is incredibly crass like that 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.850
 lights and I fear that you will 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.440
 in the camera does not recognize it like that 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.900
 in reality, I have just arrived 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.000
 Apply as her thought beaming 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.200
 very enlightened in the dark and then 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.970
 I looked at it in the dark 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.580
 but unfortunately the game is not there 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.610
 Incidentally, cocktail aua and the 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.670
 next trough I 'll show you the neck 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.940
 bikini and that's also from models oh 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.220
 no, and he is very very yellow doll 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.750
 So also neon yellow and the bangs now 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.239
 not so again is synonymous to electricity 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.890
 but also neon in any case 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.930
 The order has so a bit 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.030
 bitchy was at the first shift 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.590
 a bit stressful though, that has changed 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.420
 then given as the second layer 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.760
 So I applied the goods too 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.200
 nice again and regularly though 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.540
 then you really need two 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.880
 layers of that and then it is too 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.500
 already the third was from models 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.600
 that is thurk means her and that is just 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.940
 a not so great at e.on was but 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.739
 a very very nice light blue 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.350
 that really is not that bright right now 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.670
 gross but he really good wearable 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.620
 even for people who are not so mega 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.570
 gaudy but still want one 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.130
 very very nice happy colors then 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.870
 Now I come to my olli 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.519
 paint that I can show you and that 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.230
 I start as one with the here 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.600
 Maybe it looks in the camera now 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.060
 worth doing the same thing as from 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.230
 But it's really absolute 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.540
 that is not so tron tripped 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.070
 which also has shimmer in it and always 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.930
 you can easily see what you are doing 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.790
 must take into account the lacquers 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.769
 Completely these are not the paints now 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.299
 high gloss dry but if you 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.170
 have your high glossy finish 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.079
 you want to have 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.430
 would wear a top coat over it 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.840
 I also recommend you because I have 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.000
 always the impression that it is otherwise 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.130
 knew a bit unevenly 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.720
 it is not but tidier sits 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.700
 I have you again with top coat 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.620
 both always filmed that you see 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.880
 could be different again and me 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.070
 start with the red here 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.889
 I already said that means 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.370
 Fireball and said he has more beautiful 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.220
 to be found with is such a bright red 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.350
 sound and the shimmer is so pink looks 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.120
 how beautiful and especially with the 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.250
 top coat I like that very much 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.560
 I've got one more color the 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.320
 maybe the first moment looks like 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.540
 The color bikini from the model 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.490
 song collection is different though 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.360
 this is already the sound of 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.100
 oli is clearly desired league and also 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.280
 a bit shine as I think 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.200
 and that means she can I believe that 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.970
 is the second highest of those who i am 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.919
 so here you have it if you are more 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.780
 and there I would tell you the two 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.440
 recommend because they are really right 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.600
 crass and shine everything else 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.690
 so the third lay of orly awakens 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.440
 can say now is that is one 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.350
 beautiful purple blue so it is one 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.440
 purple has more blue than one 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.270
 proportion of red and that is relatively dark 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.120
 but nevertheless it shines so from the inside 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.940
 because he is very many 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.530
 color pigments simply has and despite that 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.300
 it is dark so he has a certain 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.830
 Luminous you may see it in 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.550
 the recordings i do not know how good the 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.320
 are managed 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.510
 but it really is a very very 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.250
 beautiful lay that was already all 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.360
 I can imagine paints through you 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.590
 I hope I could maybe you 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.020
 bit inspired a little bit 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.550
 to bring more color on the nails because 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.890
 That's what we really want to do now 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.169
 hagen and the weather is in the moment 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.789
 thank God so first time the 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.060
 colors can also be well worn and in the 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.680
 the whole thing is really cool 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.360
 otherwise completely natural camp as in 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.590
 the infobox just check it out 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.130
 maybe you 'll find some nice ones 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.440
 stuff 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.310
 and then of course a great day and 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.610
 until the 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.610
 times
