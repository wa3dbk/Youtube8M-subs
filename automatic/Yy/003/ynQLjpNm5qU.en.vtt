film then I thought it was going to be

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
film then I thought it was going to be
the<00:01:30.600> action<00:01:31.110> sequences<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.369> really

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
good the animation is quite good some of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
good the animation is quite good some of
just<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> pure<00:01:36.450> visual<00:01:36.720> effects<00:01:37.110> were

just the pure visual effects were

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.390
