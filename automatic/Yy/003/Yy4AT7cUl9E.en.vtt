in<00:00:00.120> this<00:00:00.900> tutorial<00:00:01.110> I'll<00:00:01.650> show<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.100> create

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
in this tutorial I'll show how to create

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.949 
in this tutorial I'll show how to create
an<00:00:02.460> animation<00:00:02.879> where<00:00:03.270> we<00:00:03.419> get<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:03.720> feeling

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
an animation where we get this feeling

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.140 
an animation where we get this feeling
of<00:00:04.170> having<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.620> camera<00:00:04.859> rotating<00:00:05.670> around<00:00:05.819> an

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
of having a camera rotating around an

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.690 
of having a camera rotating around an
object<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.870> do<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:07.859> you'll<00:00:08.130> first<00:00:08.429> have<00:00:08.580> to

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
object to do this you'll first have to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.570 
object to do this you'll first have to
open<00:00:09.269> an<00:00:09.540> assembly<00:00:10.080> model<00:00:10.410> for<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.190> example

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
open an assembly model for this example

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.879 
open an assembly model for this example
I'll<00:00:11.940> use<00:00:12.000> an<00:00:12.540> assembly<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.290> did<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> long

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
I'll use an assembly that I did a long

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:26.730 
I'll use an assembly that I did a long
time<00:00:13.920> ago

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.980 

so<00:00:27.340> now<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:27.640> first<00:00:28.060> thing<00:00:28.240> we'll<00:00:28.449> have<00:00:28.600> to<00:00:28.779> do

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
so now the first thing we'll have to do

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.470 
so now the first thing we'll have to do
is<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.410> enable<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:30.039> visual<00:00:30.550> of<00:00:30.820> your<00:00:31.240> room

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
is to enable the visual of your room

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.940 
is to enable the visual of your room
you'll<00:00:31.750> need<00:00:31.900> to<00:00:32.020> see<00:00:32.230> your<00:00:32.410> room<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:32.800> see

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
you'll need to see your room and see

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.490 
you'll need to see your room and see
your<00:00:33.100> lighting<00:00:33.640> also<00:00:34.450> so<00:00:34.900> to<00:00:34.960> do<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:35.200> you'll

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
your lighting also so to do this you'll

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.549 
your lighting also so to do this you'll
have<00:00:35.650> to<00:00:35.800> go<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.190> view<00:00:36.930> display<00:00:37.930> setting<00:00:38.379> and

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
have to go and view display setting and

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.479 
have to go and view display setting and
model<00:00:39.460> this<00:00:39.670> point<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:41.530> shadows<00:00:42.250> and

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
model this point going shadows and

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.700 
model this point going shadows and
enable<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.690> rendering<00:00:44.140> of<00:00:44.260> your<00:00:44.440> environment

apply<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:46.780> you<00:00:46.809> got<00:00:47.019> your<00:00:47.170> room<00:00:48.390> one

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
apply that now you got your room one

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.910 
apply that now you got your room one
thing<00:00:49.629> you'll<00:00:49.780> notice<00:00:50.050> is<00:00:50.410> that<00:00:50.470> when<00:00:50.769> you're

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
thing you'll notice is that when you're

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.189 
thing you'll notice is that when you're
rotating<00:00:51.129> your<00:00:51.580> object<00:00:52.120> you<00:00:52.809> don't<00:00:52.989> get<00:00:53.170> a

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
rotating your object you don't get a

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.140 
rotating your object you don't get a
sense<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.589> a<00:00:53.680> camera<00:00:53.949> rotating<00:00:54.699> what<00:00:55.000> you'll

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
sense of a camera rotating what you'll

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.680

now we're going to do something very

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.370 
now we're going to do something very
similar<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.450> what<00:01:41.660> we<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:41.810> did<00:01:42.170> with

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
similar to what we just did with

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.980 
similar to what we just did with
environment<00:01:43.010> but<00:01:43.130> now<00:01:43.340> with<00:01:43.700> delighting<00:01:44.240> what

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
environment but now with delighting what

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.140 
environment but now with delighting what
what<00:01:45.200> accomplished<00:01:45.770> here<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.040> not<00:01:46.340> delighting

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
what accomplished here is not delighting

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.770 
what accomplished here is not delighting
to<00:01:47.750> rotate<00:01:48.290> when<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.070> object<00:01:49.360> rotates<00:01:50.360> we're

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
to rotate when the object rotates we're

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.760 
to rotate when the object rotates we're
going<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:50.990> go<00:01:51.080> so<00:01:51.290> we're<00:01:51.410> going<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.650> go<00:01:51.740> into

rotates<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.280> reference<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.180> model

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
rotates in the reference of the model

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.450 
rotates in the reference of the model
right<00:02:26.750> here<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.620> now<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.830> can<00:02:28.250> see<00:02:28.400> the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
right here so now you can see the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.230 
right here so now you can see the
difference<00:02:29.410> there<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.560> go<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.850> now<00:02:32.000> that's

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
difference there you go so now that's

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.490 
difference there you go so now that's
done<00:02:32.570> now<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.270> really<00:02:35.480> get<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> sense<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:36.350> a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
done now you can really get a sense of a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.980 
done now you can really get a sense of a
camera<00:02:36.770> rotating<00:02:37.580> around<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.480> object<00:02:38.720> right

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
camera rotating around the object right

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.050 
camera rotating around the object right
so<00:02:41.990> we're<00:02:42.530> going<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.920> tweak<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.580> little<00:02:43.700> bit<00:02:43.940> our

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
so we're going to tweak a little bit our

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.820 
so we're going to tweak a little bit our
environment<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.780> make<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.110> look<00:02:45.260> better<00:02:45.500> so

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
environment to make it look better so

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.250 
environment to make it look better so
we're<00:02:45.950> going<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.310> go<00:02:46.610> back<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.810> render

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
we're going to go back in the render

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.760 
we're going to go back in the render
control<00:02:48.740> and<00:02:49.040> I'm<00:02:49.880> gonna<00:02:50.140> modify<00:02:51.140> environment

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
control and I'm gonna modify environment

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.470 
control and I'm gonna modify environment
for<00:02:52.070> us<00:02:52.510> cylinder<00:02:53.510> style<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:55.489> just<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.360> movie

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
for us cylinder style so just a movie

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:09.460 
for us cylinder style so just a movie
the<00:02:59.480> Fallen<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.350> bottom<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:08.290> all<00:03:09.290> right

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.339 
let's say you want your animation to
start<00:04:10.280> in<00:04:10.519> this<00:04:10.819> orientation<00:04:12.160> then<00:04:13.160> you<00:04:14.349> type

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
start in this orientation then you type

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.620 
start in this orientation then you type
you<00:04:15.800> won<00:04:16.160> or<00:04:16.190> anything<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:16.880> want<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.329> saved

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
animation starts here then I want the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.659 
animation starts here then I want the
camera<00:04:30.229> to<00:04:30.610> go<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:33.169> here<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.310> we're<00:04:34.430> going<00:04:34.550> to

rotate<00:04:45.050> more<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.790> hear<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:47.419> at<00:04:47.540> all<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:47.960> you

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
rotate more to hear so at all this you

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.300 
rotate more to hear so at all this you
three<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:50.360> now<00:04:50.539> to<00:04:50.600> link<00:04:51.020> those<00:04:51.560> three<00:04:51.979> views

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
three so now to link those three views

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.840 
three so now to link those three views
into<00:04:52.610> an<00:04:52.850> animation<00:04:53.270> we're<00:04:54.260> going<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.850> take

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
into an animation we're going to take

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.750 
into an animation we're going to take
those<00:04:56.120> views<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.780> put<00:04:57.380> it<00:04:57.500> in<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:58.190> timeline

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
those views and put it in the timeline

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.570 
those views and put it in the timeline
right<00:04:59.360> here<00:04:59.650> do<00:05:00.650> this<00:05:00.860> you'll<00:05:01.039> have<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.340> click

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
right here do this you'll have to click

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:11.230 
right here do this you'll have to click
right<00:05:02.270> here<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:04.570> select<00:05:05.800> view<00:05:06.800> one<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:10.580> right

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
right here and select view one so right

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.050 
right here and select view one so right
here<00:05:11.450> just<00:05:12.410> like<00:05:12.560> view<00:05:12.860> one<00:05:13.130> then<00:05:13.729> you<00:05:13.760> set<00:05:14.030> a

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
here just like view one then you set a

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.159 
here just like view one then you set a
timer<00:05:14.419> start<00:05:15.080> after<00:05:15.710> an<00:05:15.950> event<00:05:16.729> we<00:05:17.690> want<00:05:17.900> the

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
timer start after an event we want the

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.750 
timer start after an event we want the
animation<00:05:18.500> set<00:05:18.889> of<00:05:18.979> view<00:05:19.190> one<00:05:19.400> so<00:05:19.550> we're<00:05:19.669> going

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
animation set of view one so we're going

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.210 
animation set of view one so we're going
to<00:05:19.850> put<00:05:19.970> view<00:05:20.270> want<00:05:20.479> to<00:05:20.570> start<00:05:20.840> at<00:05:21.220> zero

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
to put view want to start at zero

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.810 
to put view want to start at zero
seconds<00:05:22.700> after<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.389> start<00:05:23.690> of<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.900> animation

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
seconds after the start of the animation

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.250 
seconds after the start of the animation
so<00:05:25.820> we're<00:05:25.910> going<00:05:26.000> to<00:05:26.090> apply<00:05:26.210> as<00:05:26.510> you<00:05:26.900> can<00:05:27.020> see

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
so we're going to apply as you can see

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.770 
so we're going to apply as you can see
