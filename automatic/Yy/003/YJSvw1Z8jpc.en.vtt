00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.419

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.880
 Today I want to do a review on a tassel 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 which I ordered on the iherb site these 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.049
 professional brushes they are very me 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.680
 really liked 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.910
 called the bedroom this series is green 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.439
 bamboo that is tassels with a green pen and 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.260
 also green is present in their 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.539
 pile here they have synthetic very 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.330
 soft and very pleasant i am delighted with 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.309
 This set here is only 15 brushes I 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.660
 I want to tell you almost certainly 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.290
 each in more detail 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.879
 This set cost 82 dollars, that is, I 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.190
 I can say that these brushes are not quite 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.149
 cheap one brush i looked at 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.930
 russian sites 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.840
 goes from 400 to 1000 rubles can 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.829
 cost well in total on the site 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.260
 aif.ru 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.440
 set cost me 82 dollars this 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.449
 I think quite inexpensive though there are 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.350
 other sets with pink handles with 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.080
 black pens and so on so let's 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 proceed to the review directly if 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.250
 you are interested then stay with me 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.960
 all enjoy 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.140
 The first two brushes are of course the brush. 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.420
 for applying powder and for applying 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.850
 blush and bronzer and some dry 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.159
 products of course i can say 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.390
 be a brush only positive 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.420
 case for applying powder from 980 and 964 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.850
 for applying blush they are very soft they 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.710
 very pleasant 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.780
 nice to touch your face these 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.350
 brush well I don't know just what about them 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.290
 you can still say just amazing not 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.509
 wash very well and do not fade in it 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.399
 their big plus comes next brush was 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.040
 fiber with this brush I put 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.610
 tonal basis it lays down very very 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.150
 smooth 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.300
 how rbh how is it in Russian 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.010
 please tell me that is this 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.040
 brush was fiber repeat in number 955 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.480
 very convenient to apply foundation 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.000
 distribute it a lot in yourself tonal 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.280
 cream does not take away and strictly speaking 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.590
 creates a fairly smooth coating 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.900
 Further the next two brushes are also very 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.970
 soft single brush 949 stages and whale brush 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.480
 it is intended to be applied also in 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.430
 principle you can wear and tone and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.320
 highlighter and bronzer of some cream 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.860
 options it is convenient to apply 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.050
 foundation in the area around the nose 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.120
 because to penetrate to such 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.780
 hard to reach places and this tassel 947 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.739
 small application brush 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.780
 foundation in principle it can 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.810
 put concealer on like big ones 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.730
 plots she is also very soft not much 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.880
 takes a lot of cream 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.160
 picks up the basics 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.950
 very well they are washed very well 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.230
 washed off in principle from cream 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.930
 textures so these brushes i love very much 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.510
 Now I also actively use the name further 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.810
 Concealer brush it certainly less 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.850
 than the previous brush is much this brush 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.100
 936 I make I use it concealer 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.230
 concealer under the eyes she is very me 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.030
 remind brush and cats I something 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.430
 I ca nâ€™t say anything special about it except 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.230
 the fact that it is tougher than the rest 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.260
 but it is also not bad washed from 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.330
 cream texture the next brush is 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.580
 brush 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.100
 785 brush for shading I apply for 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.950
 shading shadows on some big 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.030
 surfaces for shading shadows in 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.549
 inner century folds even in principle 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.930
 for applying shadows for very light 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.690
 of applying shadows 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.900
 next brush 980 this brush pencil 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.110
 it is tougher but nevertheless all 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.460
 equal on the tip it is soft enough 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.390
 very good on 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.250
 all dry foods and basically dry 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.820
 products I mean the shadows and in principle 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.220
 it also does quite good liquid shadows 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.410
 on the surface of the mobile century, but more often 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.210
 I use everything to put 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.600
 dark shadows in the corner of the eye and then them 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.820
 a little bit there to shade further brush 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.880
 755 is a brush again duo fiber but it 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.160
 a brush for applying shadows she's good at 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.710
 In principle, its advantages are that it does not cause 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.210
 only dry textures but also cream 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.310
 texture cream shadows 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.000
 because just so she duo fiber 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.220
 very good draws in principle not 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.780
 takes nothing extra very well 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.120
 only the only thing is washing is big and 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.990
 next brush then I'll show you also 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.120
 and the shadow brush unfortunately is not enough 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.900
 so such some kind of medium brush in 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:54.040
 this set for shadows is simply no pain bo 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.710
 big either brush smaller it just 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.200
 Here is such a brush 772 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.080
 but in principle she is certainly not very comfortable 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.330
 apply shadows to the entire surface 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.740
 rolling century because it is again 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:12.730
 I repeat a little but here it is 772 brush 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:16.060
 good on dark third 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:20.139
 centuries for example she is comfortable 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.970
 apply shadows also on the lower eyelid in 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.980
 In principle, it suits me, but some 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.470
 transitional brush of course not enough 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.210
 further brush sponge here I am often 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.840
 I use to put shadows 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.740
 on the whole surface of the century it is a brush 740 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.660
 also very cool and usually down favor 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.110
 often such brush sponges 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.930
 with do not fly spa Giverny and becomes 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.720
 uncomfortable minus here is sponge very well 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.870
 attached and even when washing i mean it 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:54.520
 it does not fly it does not bend in my opinion 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:57.190
 it's just a great brush brush for 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.950
 eyelashes or rather a brush for eyelashes and for 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.720
 brow 733 nothing special about 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.780
 I can not say she is not bad 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.470
 enough in principle as probably in 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:12.220
 all similar sets further brush 762 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.440
 this brush is beveled to apply for example 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.240
 cream gel liners not personally 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.310
 uncomfortable me just as uncomfortable 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.390
 shading her eyeliner 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.740
 pencil but she draws very well 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.770
 shadow eyeliner 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.080
 that is, if we type the shadow on this brush 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.390
 the sub comes out very smooth very 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.640
 good they are comfortable to her other species 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.750
 do it because it is too soft 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.420
 and 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:42.580
 besides, she can also 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:44.080
 apply eye shadow or pigment to 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.000
 This is also suitable 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:51.340
 further, not a bad brush in number 710 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.050
 this brush to apply just 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.080
 directly cream gel 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:07:01.180
 eyeliner and the last brush for 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:03.190
 applying lipstick is brush number 542 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.770
 I really liked the brush because 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.050
 she is neither big nor small well 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.980
 distributes lipstick well does not apply and 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:14.800
 good lipstick washed off here this 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:19.390
 Here are my opinions on the set of brushes linen 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.940
 This is 15 pieces I repeat all the link to these 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.970
 brushes where I ordered them I will leave below 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.330
 yes of course here is such a case to 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:30.210
 these brushes are sho here such a case and I 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.380
 I think it's good enough 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:36.070
 professional brushes which 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:38.110
 like not just girls 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.970
 who are just doing makeup but 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.010
 even make-up professionals 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.920

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:48.180
