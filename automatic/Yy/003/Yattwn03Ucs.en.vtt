and<00:03:27.359> trying<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.079> do<00:03:28.170> anything<00:03:28.560> but<00:03:29.130> suppress

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819

use<00:03:40.889> the<00:03:41.130> home<00:03:42.260> now<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.590> do<00:03:44.130> understand<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
use the home now I do understand the

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:45.800 
use the home now I do understand the
point

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
point

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.620 
point
changes<00:03:46.200> was<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.830> make<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.010> ump<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.550> CQ<00:03:48.120> monster

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
changes was to make the ump a CQ monster

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.460 
changes was to make the ump a CQ monster
and<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.590> think<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.010> did<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.190> great<00:03:50.459> job<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.090> I

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
and I think it did a great job of that I

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.080 
and I think it did a great job of that I
just<00:03:52.470> think<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.860> damage<00:03:53.250> drops<00:03:53.670> off<00:03:53.880> a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
just think that the damage drops off a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.040 
just think that the damage drops off a
little<00:03:54.660> too<00:03:54.870> sharply<00:03:55.590> while<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.280> see<00:03:56.459> eq

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
little too sharply while and see eq

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.020 
little too sharply while and see eq
having<00:03:58.050> only<00:03:58.319> a<00:03:58.500> 5<00:03:58.830> meter<00:03:59.069> range<00:03:59.370> where<00:03:59.910> this

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
having only a 5 meter range where this

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
gun is truly at home means it's

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.000 
gun is truly at home means it's
basically<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.420> contention<00:04:04.140> with<00:04:04.440> shotguns

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
bumped up 02 the 10 meter range bring 10

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.320 
bumped up 02 the 10 meter range bring 10
meter<00:04:24.120> damage<00:04:24.570> from<00:04:25.550> 28.6<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:27.090> maybe<00:04:27.360> 30<00:04:27.960> or<00:04:28.200> 31

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
meter damage from 28.6 to maybe 30 or 31

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.120 
meter damage from 28.6 to maybe 30 or 31
then<00:04:30.330> have<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:30.720> weapon<00:04:31.050> continue<00:04:31.710> dropping

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
then have this weapon continue dropping

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.310 
then have this weapon continue dropping
off<00:04:32.280> drastically<00:04:32.580> like<00:04:33.389> it<00:04:33.540> currently<00:04:34.020> does

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
off drastically like it currently does

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.200 
off drastically like it currently does
as<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.960> sets<00:04:37.229> now<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.950> UM<00:04:38.100> feels<00:04:38.430> miles<00:04:38.880> ahead

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
as it sets now the UM feels miles ahead

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.560 
as it sets now the UM feels miles ahead
of<00:04:39.479> what<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.900> previously<00:04:40.229> was<00:04:40.680> but<00:04:41.669> I<00:04:41.880> almost

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
of what it previously was but I almost

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.469 
of what it previously was but I almost
always<00:04:42.810> find<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.740> m5<00:04:44.220> k<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.669> just<00:04:45.060> superior

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
always find the m5 k is just superior

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.379 
always find the m5 k is just superior
the<00:04:46.290> difference<00:04:46.770> at<00:04:46.979> close<00:04:47.340> range<00:04:47.700> is<00:04:47.940> not

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
the difference at close range is not

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.920 
the difference at close range is not
much<00:04:48.690> but<00:04:49.380> even<00:04:49.770> there<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.460> m5<00:04:51.000> k<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.479> the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
much but even there the m5 k is the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.760 
much but even there the m5 k is the
faster<00:04:52.380> killer<00:04:52.620> by<00:04:53.610> mid-range<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.660> m5<00:04:55.200> k<00:04:55.470> has

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
faster killer by mid-range the m5 k has

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.880 
faster killer by mid-range the m5 k has
a<00:04:55.800> 200<00:04:56.640> ms<00:04:57.000> advantage<00:04:57.539> almost<00:04:58.229> making<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.650> kill

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
a 200 ms advantage almost making a kill

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.600 
a 200 ms advantage almost making a kill
twice<00:04:59.550> as<00:04:59.789> fast<00:05:00.000> as<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.570> UMP<00:05:01.340> overall<00:05:02.340> though

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
twice as fast as the UMP overall though
