00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379 
you'll see I've got motor still

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.740 
you'll see I've got motor still
unplugged<00:00:14.830> and<00:00:15.570> what<00:00:16.570> I've<00:00:16.660> done<00:00:16.810> now<00:00:16.870> is

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
unplugged and what I've done now is

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.750 
unplugged and what I've done now is
transmitters<00:00:19.750> on<00:00:19.920> helicopters<00:00:20.920> on<00:00:21.070> what<00:00:21.730> I

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
transmitters on helicopters on what I

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.640 
transmitters on helicopters on what I
want<00:00:21.970> to<00:00:22.029> go<00:00:22.119> through<00:00:22.539> the<00:00:22.840> way<00:00:22.929> I<00:00:22.960> do<00:00:23.080> it<00:00:23.349> is<00:00:23.470> I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
want to go through the way I do it is I

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.769 
want to go through the way I do it is I
check<00:00:23.679> for<00:00:24.189> my<00:00:24.369> servo<00:00:24.789> movement<00:00:25.210> make<00:00:25.599> sure<00:00:25.750> I

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
check for my servo movement make sure I

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.720 
check for my servo movement make sure I
can<00:00:25.990> get<00:00:26.109> all<00:00:26.230> my<00:00:26.259> several<00:00:26.710> servos<00:00:27.279> moving<00:00:27.640> in

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
can get all my several servos moving in

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.509 
can get all my several servos moving in
the<00:00:27.820> right<00:00:27.939> direction<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.980> next<00:00:30.279> thing<00:00:30.429> I

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
the right direction and the next thing I

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.060 
the right direction and the next thing I
do<00:00:30.580> is<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.900> check<00:00:32.710> for<00:00:33.280> my<00:00:33.400> swash<00:00:33.730> movement<00:00:34.300> and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
do is I check for my swash movement and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.729 
do is I check for my swash movement and
they're<00:00:36.149> they're<00:00:37.149> kind<00:00:37.360> of<00:00:37.480> complicated<00:00:38.050> kind

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
they're they're kind of complicated kind

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.860 
they're they're kind of complicated kind
of<00:00:38.860> sometimes<00:00:39.039> at<00:00:39.489> first<00:00:39.760> once<00:00:40.420> you<00:00:40.570> figure

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
of sometimes at first once you figure

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.510 
of sometimes at first once you figure
them<00:00:40.989> out<00:00:41.050> and<00:00:41.170> understand<00:00:41.620> it<00:00:41.770> it's<00:00:41.980> really

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
them out and understand it it's really

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.880 
them out and understand it it's really
simple<00:00:42.640> I'll<00:00:43.149> try<00:00:43.899> to<00:00:43.960> explain<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.590> best<00:00:44.770> I

helicopter there put it in stunt mode
okay<00:00:55.989> this<00:00:56.410> is<00:00:56.500> why<00:00:56.620> it's<00:00:56.800> important<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.730> have

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
okay this is why it's important to have

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.959 
okay this is why it's important to have
the<00:00:58.090> motor<00:00:58.300> unplugged<00:00:58.980> okay<00:01:00.010> then<00:01:00.640> will<00:01:00.820> you<00:01:00.850> I

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
the motor unplugged okay then will you I

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.959 
the motor unplugged okay then will you I
do<00:01:01.170> put<00:01:02.170> your<00:01:02.289> throttle<00:01:02.890> stick<00:01:03.100> at<00:01:03.280> mid<00:01:03.609> stick

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
do put your throttle stick at mid stick

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.850 
do put your throttle stick at mid stick
okay<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:05.980> where<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:07.630> want<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:07.930> have<00:01:08.080> this

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
is where we're gonna be setting

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.219 
is where we're gonna be setting
everything<00:01:10.000> up<00:01:10.180> you<00:01:10.540> can<00:01:10.659> have<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:10.960> at<00:01:11.080> mid

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
everything up you can have that at mid

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.210 
everything up you can have that at mid
stick<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.710> then<00:01:11.799> we're<00:01:11.920> gonna<00:01:12.009> go<00:01:12.159> through

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
stick and then we're gonna go through

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.460 
stick and then we're gonna go through
and<00:01:12.610> make<00:01:12.759> sure<00:01:12.909> everything's<00:01:13.330> level<00:01:13.570> go<00:01:14.290> up

and make sure everything's level go up
through<00:01:14.770> working<00:01:15.250> our<00:01:15.430> way<00:01:15.460> up<00:01:15.580> through<00:01:15.850> the

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
through working our way up through the

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.679 
through working our way up through the
head<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.570> top<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.020> blades<00:01:17.259> there<00:01:17.530> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
head to the top to the blades there so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.749 
head to the top to the blades there so
okay<00:01:19.689> again<00:01:20.229> we<00:01:20.650> got<00:01:20.799> in<00:01:21.009> here<00:01:21.040> what<00:01:21.549> I'm<00:01:21.640> gonna

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
okay again we got in here what I'm gonna

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.530 
okay again we got in here what I'm gonna
check<00:01:22.000> for<00:01:22.030> now<00:01:22.329> is<00:01:22.570> my<00:01:22.720> servo<00:01:23.079> direction<00:01:23.520> so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
check for now is my servo direction so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.789 
check for now is my servo direction so
when<00:01:25.540> I<00:01:25.570> push<00:01:25.869> forward<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.409> we<00:01:26.500> start<00:01:26.740> with

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
when I push forward that we start with

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.649 
when I push forward that we start with
forwards<00:01:27.189> here<00:01:27.310> when<00:01:27.909> I<00:01:27.970> push<00:01:28.180> forwards<00:01:28.600> I

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
forwards here when I push forwards I

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.730 
forwards here when I push forwards I
want<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.960> swash<00:01:29.229> plate<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.930> go<00:01:32.049> down<00:01:32.259> now<00:01:32.560> you

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
want the swash plate to go down now you

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.230 
want the swash plate to go down now you
can<00:01:32.860> see<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.860> side<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.399> trying<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.850> push<00:01:37.090> it

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
can see this side is trying to push it

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.139 
can see this side is trying to push it
up<00:01:37.299> ever<00:01:37.540> so<00:01:37.750> slightly<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.850> now<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.030> other

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
up ever so slightly but now the other

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.789 
up ever so slightly but now the other
servos<00:01:40.689> work<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.079> finding<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:41.470> silver

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
servos work and finding this silver

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.160 
servos work and finding this silver
servos<00:01:42.340> working<00:01:42.700> fine<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.119> because<00:01:43.689> only<00:01:43.899> this

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
servos working fine so because only this

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.120 
servos working fine so because only this
one<00:01:44.439> servo<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.540> acting<00:01:46.540> weird<00:01:46.869> I<00:01:47.200> would<00:01:47.770> go<00:01:47.920> in

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
one servo is acting weird I would go in

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.179 
one servo is acting weird I would go in
to<00:01:48.340> my<00:01:48.549> servo<00:01:48.850> reversing<00:01:49.540> menu<00:01:49.869> and<00:01:50.189> change

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
to my servo reversing menu and change

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.899 
to my servo reversing menu and change
that<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.939> is<00:01:55.090> down<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:57.280> down<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.579> setup

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
that and that is down going down a setup

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
that and that is down going down a setup
list

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
list

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
list
reverse<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.630> it's<00:02:01.930> my<00:02:02.049> aileron<00:02:02.500> servo

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
reverse and it's my aileron servo

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.020 
reverse and it's my aileron servo
reverse<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:05.310> I'll<00:02:06.310> just<00:02:06.340> go<00:02:06.640> back<00:02:06.670> out

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
reverse that and I'll just go back out

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.290 
reverse that and I'll just go back out
so<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.270> know<00:02:07.329> that's<00:02:07.539> it<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.740> now<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.970> see<00:02:10.119> when

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
so I know that's it so now you see when

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.600 
so I know that's it so now you see when
I<00:02:10.330> push<00:02:10.600> forwards<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:14.500> pulls<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.980> down<00:02:15.010> just

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
I push forwards it pulls it down just

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.880 
I push forwards it pulls it down just
like<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.940> should<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:18.040> back<00:02:18.280> goes<00:02:18.490> up<00:02:18.640> now

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
like it should and the back goes up now

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.840 
like it should and the back goes up now
when<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> go<00:02:21.160> left<00:02:22.800> you'll<00:02:23.800> notice<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
when I go left you'll notice that the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.660 
when I go left you'll notice that the
swash<00:02:25.120> plate<00:02:25.330> goes<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.350> right<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:27.460> not

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
swash plate goes to the right it's not

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.790 
swash plate goes to the right it's not
just<00:02:27.970> one<00:02:28.210> servo<00:02:28.660> that's<00:02:28.870> backwards<00:02:29.410> both

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
just one servo that's backwards both

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.170 
just one servo that's backwards both
servos<00:02:30.400> or<00:02:30.520> backwards<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:34.710> same<00:02:35.710> thing<00:02:36.180> okay

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
servos or backwards the same thing okay

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.560 
servos or backwards the same thing okay
now<00:02:37.930> because<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.530> two<00:02:38.830> servos<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:40.240> don't

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
now because it's two servos you don't

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.560 
now because it's two servos you don't
use<00:02:40.870> your<00:02:41.050> servo<00:02:41.320> reversing<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.850> go<00:02:43.060> into<00:02:43.540> a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
use your servo reversing you go into a

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.110 
use your servo reversing you go into a
swash<00:02:43.960> mix<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.100> other<00:02:45.400> part<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.000> my

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
swash mix this is the other part of my

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.600 
swash mix this is the other part of my
setup<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.720> then<00:02:47.290> also<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.740> wanted<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.070> show<00:02:48.340> you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
setup and then also I wanted to show you

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.180 
setup and then also I wanted to show you
my<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.810> pitch<00:02:50.080> okay<00:02:51.300> go<00:02:52.300> up<00:02:52.930> see<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.860> swash

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
my the pitch okay go up see the swash

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.600 
my the pitch okay go up see the swash
plate<00:02:54.340> comes<00:02:54.640> down<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.000> should<00:02:55.180> go<00:02:55.330> up<00:02:55.360> too<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
plate comes down it should go up too and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.600 
plate comes down it should go up too and
alternately<00:02:58.530> okay<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.010> my<00:03:00.160> pitch<00:03:00.400> is

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
alternately okay so my pitch is

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.760 
alternately okay so my pitch is
backwards<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.140> my<00:03:02.290> left<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.710> right

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
backwards and so is my left and right

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.900 
backwards and so is my left and right
aileron<00:03:03.580> okay<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.780> what<00:03:04.900> am<00:03:04.990> i<00:03:05.080> do<00:03:05.760> second<00:03:06.760> part

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
aileron okay so what am i do second part

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.850 
aileron okay so what am i do second part
here<00:03:07.090> go<00:03:08.050> back<00:03:08.230> up<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.790> my<00:03:11.040> adjust<00:03:12.040> list<00:03:13.860> go

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
here go back up to my adjust list go

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.840 
here go back up to my adjust list go
down<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.400> my<00:03:15.580> swash<00:03:16.000> mix<00:03:16.890> okay<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.730> you'll

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
down to my swash mix okay and you'll

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.250 
down to my swash mix okay and you'll
remember<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.210> had<00:03:19.420> set<00:03:19.630> these<00:03:19.810> all<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.140> way

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
remember I had set these all the way

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.200 
remember I had set these all the way
back<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.740> fifty<00:03:21.130> well<00:03:21.400> not<00:03:21.670> all<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.850> way<00:03:22.000> back

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
back to fifty well not all the way back

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.410 
back to fifty well not all the way back
with<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.600> changed<00:03:23.140> them<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.290> fifty<00:03:23.710> from<00:03:27.420> sixty

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
with I changed them to fifty from sixty

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.970 
with I changed them to fifty from sixty
there<00:03:28.600> so<00:03:29.440> anyways<00:03:30.250> my<00:03:31.380> he<00:03:32.380> gives<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.680> three

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
there so anyways my he gives you three

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.450 
there so anyways my he gives you three
options<00:03:33.160> here<00:03:33.990> l<00:03:34.990> aileron<00:03:35.770> elevator<00:03:35.950> and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
options here l aileron elevator and

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.450 
options here l aileron elevator and
pitch<00:03:36.670> okay<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:38.110> elevator<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.770> fine<00:03:39.010> when

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
pitch okay so the elevator is fine when

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.180 
pitch okay so the elevator is fine when
I<00:03:39.490> push<00:03:39.790> forwards<00:03:40.380> that's<00:03:41.380> fine<00:03:41.710> the<00:03:41.860> elevator

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
I push forwards that's fine the elevator

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.730 
I push forwards that's fine the elevator
is<00:03:42.280> fine<00:03:42.460> but<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.150> aileron<00:03:43.750> left<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.590> right

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
is fine but the aileron left and right

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.430 
is fine but the aileron left and right
that's<00:03:45.700> backwards<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:47.020> I'm<00:03:47.080> gonna<00:03:47.200> do<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.380> I'm

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
that's backwards so I'm gonna do is I'm

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.290 
that's backwards so I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:03:47.530> change<00:03:47.740> that<00:03:47.890> plus<00:03:48.190> 50<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.820> negative

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
gonna change that plus 50 to a negative

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:58.600 
gonna change that plus 50 to a negative
50

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.620 

okay<00:03:59.610> and<00:03:59.850> then<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> other<00:04:00.210> thing<00:04:00.450> I'm<00:04:00.540> gonna

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
okay and then the other thing I'm gonna

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.570 
okay and then the other thing I'm gonna
do<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.840> go<00:04:00.960> down<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.140> my<00:04:01.350> pitch<00:04:01.680> I'm<00:04:02.400> gonna

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
do is go down to my pitch I'm gonna

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.150 
do is go down to my pitch I'm gonna
change<00:04:02.820> my<00:04:03.000> pitch<00:04:03.210> from<00:04:03.480> plus<00:04:03.780> 50<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.770> negative

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
change my pitch from plus 50 to negative

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.730 
change my pitch from plus 50 to negative
50<00:04:10.610> okay<00:04:11.610> now<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.180> got<00:04:12.450> negative<00:04:13.080> 50<00:04:13.350> plus<00:04:13.560> 50

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
50 okay now I got negative 50 plus 50

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.690 
50 okay now I got negative 50 plus 50
negative<00:04:14.280> 50

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
negative 50

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.330 
negative 50
now<00:04:15.739> you'll<00:04:16.739> see<00:04:17.030> my<00:04:18.030> pitch<00:04:18.470> go<00:04:19.470> up<00:04:19.769> see<00:04:20.220> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
now you'll see my pitch go up see the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.670 
now you'll see my pitch go up see the
swashplate<00:04:20.610> move<00:04:20.880> up<00:04:21.170> and<00:04:22.170> it<00:04:22.260> comes<00:04:22.470> down

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
swashplate move up and it comes down

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.380 
swashplate move up and it comes down
just<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.700> way<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:23.940> should<00:04:23.970> be

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
just the way it should be

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.120 
just the way it should be
now<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.020> had<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.410> reverse<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:25.830> because

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
now I had to reverse this because

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.340 
now I had to reverse this because
because<00:04:26.760> you'll<00:04:27.120> note<00:04:27.300> before<00:04:27.540> when<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:27.960> go<00:04:28.320> up

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
because you'll note before when I go up

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.800 
because you'll note before when I go up
and<00:04:28.740> then<00:04:28.830> come<00:04:29.070> down<00:04:29.100> all<00:04:29.550> three<00:04:30.330> servos

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
and then come down all three servos

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.660 
and then come down all three servos
we're<00:04:31.020> backwards<00:04:31.230> not<00:04:31.590> just<00:04:31.830> one<00:04:31.980> all<00:04:32.250> three

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
we're backwards not just one all three

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.640 
we're backwards not just one all three
of<00:04:32.760> them<00:04:32.880> works<00:04:33.060> backwards<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:34.080> if<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.500> only

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
of them works backwards so if you only

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.290 
of them works backwards so if you only
have<00:04:34.770> one<00:04:35.100> servo<00:04:35.460> backwards<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:35.940> use<00:04:36.090> the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
have one servo backwards to use the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300 
have one servo backwards to use the
servo<00:04:36.510> reversing<00:04:37.140> if<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.710> have<00:04:37.890> more<00:04:38.190> than

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
servo reversing if you have more than

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.010 
servo reversing if you have more than
one<00:04:38.490> servo<00:04:38.760> backwards<00:04:39.270> you're<00:04:39.690> gonna<00:04:39.810> use

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
one servo backwards you're gonna use

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.710 
one servo backwards you're gonna use
your<00:04:40.050> swash<00:04:40.440> mix<00:04:40.770> what<00:04:41.640> so<00:04:42.150> again<00:04:42.330> that's

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
your swash mix what so again that's

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.760 
your swash mix what so again that's
sorted<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:44.540> so<00:04:45.540> is<00:04:45.630> my<00:04:47.480> left<00:04:48.480> right<00:04:48.750> so<00:04:49.620> that

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
sorted and so is my left right so that

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.610 
sorted and so is my left right so that
is<00:04:49.920> good<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.220> go<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.480> was<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:52.080> servo

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
is good to go so that was the servo

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.250 
is good to go so that was the servo
directions<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.160> swash<00:04:53.370> movement<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.960> next

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
directions and swash movement the next

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.000 
directions and swash movement the next
step<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.710> do<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.880> go<00:04:57.030> through<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.830> this<00:04:58.830> is

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
step I do is I go through and this is

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.580 
step I do is I go through and this is
when<00:04:59.160> I'll<00:04:59.280> set<00:04:59.550> my<00:04:59.670> sub<00:04:59.970> trims<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:00.560> when<00:05:01.560> I

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
when I'll set my sub trims and when I

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.280 
when I'll set my sub trims and when I
say<00:05:01.800> sub<00:05:02.040> trims<00:05:02.480> you<00:05:03.480> want<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.780> get<00:05:03.900> all<00:05:04.080> your

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
say sub trims you want to get all your

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.430 
say sub trims you want to get all your
circle<00:05:04.710> horns<00:05:05.360> straight<00:05:06.360> either<00:05:06.960> with<00:05:07.260> the

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
circle horns straight either with the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.310 
circle horns straight either with the
servo<00:05:07.680> or<00:05:08.010> 90<00:05:08.669> degrees<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.419> servo<00:05:09.720> should

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
servo or 90 degrees to the servo should

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.190 
servo or 90 degrees to the servo should
always<00:05:10.440> be<00:05:10.680> in<00:05:10.980> across<00:05:11.760> whatever<00:05:12.270> weight<00:05:12.540> so

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
always be in across whatever weight so

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.480 
always be in across whatever weight so
depending<00:05:13.500> on<00:05:13.560> where<00:05:13.800> your<00:05:13.950> servos<00:05:14.340> are

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
depending on where your servos are

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.190 
depending on where your servos are
mounted<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:15.240> know<00:05:15.330> try<00:05:15.540> to<00:05:15.570> line<00:05:15.810> your<00:05:15.960> servo

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200

mounted you know try to line your servo
horn<00:05:16.470> according<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.460> your<00:05:17.640> servo<00:05:18.030> when<00:05:18.720> you

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
horn according to your servo when you

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.030 
horn according to your servo when you
first<00:05:18.990> set<00:05:19.230> up<00:05:19.350> things<00:05:19.530> up

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
first set up things up

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.310 
first set up things up
you'll<00:05:20.760> see

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.600 

and<00:05:24.320> see<00:05:24.500> how<00:05:24.590> this<00:05:24.770> one's<00:05:24.950> just<00:05:25.160> ever<00:05:25.370> so

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
and see how this one's just ever so

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.180 
and see how this one's just ever so
slightly<00:05:25.640> tilted<00:05:26.420> forward<00:05:26.830> so<00:05:27.830> now<00:05:27.980> that<00:05:28.040> I

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
slightly tilted forward so now that I

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.540 
slightly tilted forward so now that I
got<00:05:28.250> all<00:05:28.640> my<00:05:28.670> other<00:05:29.140> directions<00:05:30.140> correct<00:05:31.010> now

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
got all my other directions correct now

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.270 
got all my other directions correct now
only<00:05:31.760> set<00:05:32.090> my<00:05:32.240> servo<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:33.080> sub<00:05:33.290> trims<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:33.680> to

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
only set my servo the sub trims and to

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.490 
only set my servo the sub trims and to
do<00:05:34.430> that<00:05:34.780> what<00:05:35.780> you're<00:05:35.870> gonna<00:05:35.960> do<00:05:38.320> is<00:05:39.320> you're

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
do that what you're gonna do is you're

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.320 
do that what you're gonna do is you're
gonna<00:05:39.560> want<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:39.830> go<00:05:39.980> to<00:05:40.010> your<00:05:40.400> sub<00:05:40.640> trim<00:05:40.880> menu

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:54.160 

okay<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:47.570> this<00:05:47.750> is<00:05:47.870> my<00:05:47.990> aileron<00:05:48.440> servo<00:05:49.870> so<00:05:53.170> go

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
okay and this is my aileron servo so go

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.110 
okay and this is my aileron servo so go
down<00:05:54.380> to<00:05:54.470> my<00:05:54.560> aileron<00:05:54.950> and<00:05:55.220> you<00:05:55.580> just<00:05:55.730> move<00:05:55.940> it

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
down to my aileron and you just move it

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.930 
down to my aileron and you just move it
either<00:05:56.240> way<00:05:56.600> and<00:05:57.020> you'll<00:05:57.920> see<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:58.250> servo<00:05:58.700> horn

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
either way and you'll see the servo horn

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.020 
either way and you'll see the servo horn
move<00:06:01.570> so<00:06:02.570> just<00:06:02.600> put<00:06:03.050> you<00:06:03.440> know<00:06:03.560> set<00:06:03.950> it<00:06:03.980> get<00:06:04.910> it

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
move so just put you know set it get it

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:11.890 
move so just put you know set it get it
as<00:06:05.120> straight<00:06:05.360> as<00:06:05.510> you<00:06:05.570> can<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:07.310> for<00:06:08.240> mine<00:06:10.900> seem

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
as straight as you can and for mine seem

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.110 
as straight as you can and for mine seem
to<00:06:12.110> be<00:06:12.380> I<00:06:12.740> think<00:06:13.010> it<00:06:13.070> was<00:06:13.160> 53<00:06:15.220> so<00:06:16.220> and<00:06:16.850> again

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
to be I think it was 53 so and again

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.940 
to be I think it was 53 so and again
you're<00:06:17.930> gonna<00:06:17.990> do<00:06:18.170> that<00:06:18.320> with<00:06:18.620> all<00:06:18.770> three

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
you're gonna do that with all three

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.610 
you're gonna do that with all three
servos<00:06:19.460> make<00:06:20.450> sure<00:06:20.630> they're<00:06:20.810> all<00:06:20.960> correct

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
servos make sure they're all correct

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.530 
servos make sure they're all correct
there<00:06:21.860> again<00:06:22.400> you're<00:06:22.520> doing<00:06:22.640> this<00:06:22.910> at<00:06:23.090> mid

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
there again you're doing this at mid

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:30.670 
there again you're doing this at mid
stick<00:06:24.640> with<00:06:25.640> idle<00:06:26.210> up<00:06:27.130> okay<00:06:28.300> so<00:06:29.500> once<00:06:30.500> you<00:06:30.590> got

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
stick with idle up okay so once you got

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.330 
stick with idle up okay so once you got
all<00:06:30.740> your<00:06:30.980> sub<00:06:31.250> trims<00:06:32.320> your<00:06:33.320> servo<00:06:33.590> arms<00:06:34.010> done

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
all your sub trims your servo arms done

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.740 
all your sub trims your servo arms done
and<00:06:34.670> you<00:06:34.790> know<00:06:35.060> all<00:06:35.180> your<00:06:35.210> subscripts

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
and you know all your subscripts

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.320 
and you know all your subscripts
adjusted<00:06:36.200> if<00:06:36.350> you<00:06:36.710> don't<00:06:36.890> have<00:06:37.100> sub<00:06:37.910> trims<00:06:38.180> you

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
adjusted if you don't have sub trims you

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.390 
adjusted if you don't have sub trims you
can<00:06:38.570> like<00:06:39.170> if<00:06:39.290> you<00:06:39.350> have<00:06:39.470> a<00:06:39.970> say<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:42.590> belt<00:06:42.950> CP

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
can like if you have a say the belt CP

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.750 
can like if you have a say the belt CP
you<00:06:44.180> can<00:06:44.390> either<00:06:44.570> use<00:06:45.140> your<00:06:45.170> trim<00:06:45.620> tabs<00:06:45.890> to<00:06:46.580> try

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
you can either use your trim tabs to try

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.300 
you can either use your trim tabs to try
to<00:06:46.820> get<00:06:46.970> your<00:06:47.060> servo<00:06:47.420> heart<00:06:47.660> straight<00:06:48.320> or<00:06:48.590> you

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
to get your servo heart straight or you

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.070 
to get your servo heart straight or you
can<00:06:49.460> just<00:06:49.670> try<00:06:49.820> to<00:06:49.880> compensate<00:06:50.300> with

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
can just try to compensate with

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.320 
can just try to compensate with
lengthening<00:06:51.770> one<00:06:52.190> of<00:06:52.280> the<00:06:52.370> rods<00:06:52.610> to<00:06:52.820> make<00:06:53.120> the

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
lengthening one of the rods to make the

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.350 
lengthening one of the rods to make the
swashplate<00:06:53.600> level<00:06:54.190> because<00:06:55.190> the<00:06:55.760> next<00:06:56.120> step

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
swashplate level because the next step

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.150 
swashplate level because the next step
is<00:06:57.850> going<00:06:58.850> through<00:06:59.330> and<00:07:00.020> you<00:07:00.740> need<00:07:00.890> to<00:07:01.010> make

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
is going through and you need to make

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.070 
is going through and you need to make
sure<00:07:01.190> everything<00:07:01.730> all<00:07:02.420> the<00:07:02.690> way<00:07:02.720> up<00:07:02.780> through

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
sure everything all the way up through

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.280 
sure everything all the way up through
all<00:07:03.230> the<00:07:03.290> way<00:07:03.350> through<00:07:03.500> the<00:07:03.590> head<00:07:03.740> is<00:07:04.730> level

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
all the way through the head is level

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.210 
all the way through the head is level
starting<00:07:06.290> you<00:07:06.500> always<00:07:06.740> start<00:07:06.950> at<00:07:07.010> the<00:07:07.040> bottom

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
starting you always start at the bottom

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.300 
starting you always start at the bottom
so<00:07:08.020> again<00:07:09.020> the<00:07:09.140> next<00:07:09.320> step<00:07:09.590> after<00:07:09.860> you<00:07:10.040> got

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
so again the next step after you got

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.760 
so again the next step after you got
your<00:07:10.550> servo<00:07:11.090> horn<00:07:11.180> straight<00:07:11.570> go<00:07:12.170> through<00:07:12.530> and

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
your servo horn straight go through and

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.310 
your servo horn straight go through and
for<00:07:13.670> me<00:07:13.820> you<00:07:14.420> know<00:07:14.450> cuz<00:07:14.750> my<00:07:14.900> link<00:07:15.080> is<00:07:15.200> there

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320 
for me you know cuz my link is there

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.260 
for me you know cuz my link is there
laid<00:07:15.440> out<00:07:15.560> like<00:07:15.680> this<00:07:15.830> first<00:07:16.400> step<00:07:16.640> make<00:07:17.240> sure

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
laid out like this first step make sure

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.420 
laid out like this first step make sure
these<00:07:17.540> Lincoln's<00:07:17.900> are<00:07:17.990> the<00:07:18.050> same<00:07:18.260> length<00:07:18.470> make

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
these Lincoln's are the same length make

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.910 
these Lincoln's are the same length make
sure<00:07:19.640> this<00:07:19.940> is<00:07:20.300> parallel<00:07:20.660> with<00:07:20.900> this<00:07:21.080> I<00:07:21.320> did

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:21.920 
sure this is parallel with this I did

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.700 
sure this is parallel with this I did
that<00:07:21.950> all<00:07:22.280> the<00:07:22.460> way<00:07:22.550> around<00:07:22.640> then<00:07:23.450> I<00:07:23.720> worked<00:07:24.080> to

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
that all the way around then I worked to

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.040 
that all the way around then I worked to
the<00:07:24.830> swashplate<00:07:25.070> I<00:07:25.490> got<00:07:25.820> these<00:07:26.030> linkages<00:07:26.420> so<00:07:26.690> I

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
the swashplate I got these linkages so I

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.350 
the swashplate I got these linkages so I
work<00:07:27.470> on<00:07:27.620> all<00:07:27.800> three<00:07:28.010> linkages<00:07:28.400> go<00:07:29.000> that<00:07:29.210> up

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 
work on all three linkages go that up

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.780 
work on all three linkages go that up
get<00:07:29.630> the<00:07:29.690> swashplate<00:07:29.960> level<00:07:30.500> and<00:07:30.710> then<00:07:31.400> for<00:07:31.670> me

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790 
get the swashplate level and then for me

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.530 
get the swashplate level and then for me
it<00:07:32.000> was<00:07:32.660> a<00:07:32.690> matter<00:07:32.930> of<00:07:34.090> getting<00:07:35.090> this<00:07:35.270> level

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.540 
it was a matter of getting this level

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.519 
it was a matter of getting this level
with

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:36.529 
with

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.309 
with
I<00:07:36.559> washed<00:07:37.099> out<00:07:37.279> assembly<00:07:37.579> and<00:07:38.029> then<00:07:38.749> also<00:07:38.989> I<00:07:39.139> up

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.319 
I washed out assembly and then also I up

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:46.019 
I washed out assembly and then also I up
here<00:07:39.349> I<00:07:39.529> have<00:07:39.739> these<00:07:40.399> arms<00:07:40.909> right<00:07:41.149> here<00:07:41.649> see

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:46.029 

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:48.999 

see<00:07:47.029> that<00:07:47.239> so<00:07:47.719> that<00:07:47.899> that<00:07:48.139> all<00:07:48.529> has<00:07:48.769> to<00:07:48.919> be

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:49.009 
see that so that that all has to be

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.609 
see that so that that all has to be
level<00:07:49.189> for<00:07:49.459> me<00:07:49.549> now<00:07:49.909> depending<00:07:50.419> on<00:07:50.479> what<00:07:51.289> like

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:51.619 
level for me now depending on what like

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:53.739 
level for me now depending on what like
the<00:07:51.769> belts<00:07:52.069> EP<00:07:52.459> and<00:07:52.699> the<00:07:52.729> honeybee<00:07:53.359> King<00:07:53.599> they

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:53.749 
the belts EP and the honeybee King they

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:55.329 
the belts EP and the honeybee King they
have<00:07:53.899> lots<00:07:54.169> of<00:07:54.289> little<00:07:54.529> linkages<00:07:55.099> that<00:07:55.279> you

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:55.339 
have lots of little linkages that you

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:56.859 
have lots of little linkages that you
got<00:07:55.519> a<00:07:55.549> kind<00:07:55.759> of<00:07:55.909> a<00:07:55.999> line<00:07:56.209> and<00:07:56.419> they're<00:07:56.539> on<00:07:56.659> top

00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:56.869 
got a kind of a line and they're on top

00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:58.719 
got a kind of a line and they're on top
it's<00:07:57.589> the<00:07:57.739> same<00:07:57.919> process<00:07:58.339> just<00:07:58.369> get

00:07:58.719 --> 00:07:58.729 
it's the same process just get

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.919 
it's the same process just get
everything<00:07:59.059> level<00:07:59.469> all<00:08:00.469> the<00:08:00.529> way<00:08:00.799> up<00:08:00.919> and<00:08:01.069> down

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:01.929 
everything level all the way up and down

00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:04.929 
everything level all the way up and down
that's<00:08:02.949> that's<00:08:03.949> the<00:08:04.099> next<00:08:04.249> up<00:08:04.399> and<00:08:04.609> it<00:08:04.789> could

00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:04.939 
that's that's the next up and it could

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:06.129 
that's that's the next up and it could
be<00:08:05.059> a<00:08:05.089> pain<00:08:05.359> in<00:08:05.479> the<00:08:05.509> butt<00:08:05.719> you<00:08:05.749> know<00:08:05.899> you're

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:06.139 
be a pain in the butt you know you're

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:07.899 
be a pain in the butt you know you're
gonna<00:08:06.259> there's<00:08:07.039> depending<00:08:07.549> on<00:08:07.609> what<00:08:07.729> kind<00:08:07.789> of

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:07.909 
gonna there's depending on what kind of

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:09.069 
gonna there's depending on what kind of
helicopter<00:08:08.029> you<00:08:08.389> have<00:08:08.509> you<00:08:08.629> more<00:08:08.899> or<00:08:09.019> less

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:09.079 
helicopter you have you more or less

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:11.079 
helicopter you have you more or less
linkages<00:08:09.649> but<00:08:10.279> again<00:08:10.579> you<00:08:10.699> want<00:08:10.849> to<00:08:10.909> work

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:11.089 
linkages but again you want to work

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:14.739 
linkages but again you want to work
bottom<00:08:11.899> to<00:08:12.169> top<00:08:12.339> get<00:08:13.339> everything<00:08:13.579> level<00:08:13.849> after

00:08:14.739 --> 00:08:14.749 
bottom to top get everything level after

00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:16.719 
bottom to top get everything level after
you<00:08:14.929> get<00:08:15.079> then<00:08:16.069> we're<00:08:16.219> gonna<00:08:16.309> go<00:08:16.429> ahead<00:08:16.519> and

00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:16.729 
you get then we're gonna go ahead and

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:19.239 
you get then we're gonna go ahead and
check<00:08:16.909> the<00:08:17.059> pitch
