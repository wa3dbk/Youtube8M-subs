00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 how about friends talking about yahel and 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.279
 if here my friend cristian of mom is going 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.470
 to touch moments will teach them to 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.790
 play moments on guitar that's that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.010
 good asshole to see how he goes out because 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.860
 the piano chords are complicated 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.719
 thank you very much from this thanks we are going 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.820
 to start losing we will use 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.189
 midtone tone down to not 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.199
 complicate nobody is the song here they 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.859
 I leave the tuner link and see how 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.859
 we start 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.149
 in action 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.440
 let's start with the chords for the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.080
 intro and the stanza are going to be 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.080
 the ninth and re sigh 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.510
 also a my concept the question in 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.420
 these chords is very simple nothing more 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.520
 we do not take off of two three and four these 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.520
 they always stay fixed only 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.200
 and my minor 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.810
 let's start with the rhythm as it is 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.810
 the first how i do it 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:03.380
 it's like your tun tun tun tun you already know that 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.900
 work so up or down up 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.900
 Check 321 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.240
 I'm going to put the letter for you 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.240
 to check how it looks 3 2 1 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.620
 but let's go to the pre-chorus part and 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.870
 seem to use re-fought chords 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.790
 in sharp fa we use the big toe 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.090
 to press fret two strings six 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.900
 Sun 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.600
 me with 7a 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.590
 the least 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:46.640
 F sharp with seventh if minor and 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.360
 then comes a conscious minor and ma 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.960
 seventh and 2 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:57.470
 then comes a sun with low or itself 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.620
 this is with finger number 2 fret number 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.020
 two strings 5 â€‹â€‹and the skinny the 4 in the 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.840
 rope 2 13 3 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.470
 the least 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.300
 and the answered the rhythm is very very 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.739
 similar to the first nothing more than now 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.739
 Chubutense is mute 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.360
 here 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.879
 ok slower 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:01.170
 Today I'm going to put the lyrics so that 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.170
 check how it looks 3 2 1 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.530
 perfect and we go to the chorus part and 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.160
 This is easier because nothing 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.070
 uses the 1 2 3 1 2 3 that make a 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.850
 2 3 is down down down and chucu down 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.850
 fast up 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.430
 d 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:54.180
 d 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.180
 ok I put the letter 321 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.970
 yes 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.569
 straight and we will have the complete song 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.969

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.989
