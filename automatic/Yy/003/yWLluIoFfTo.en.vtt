00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
got two automatic modes regular and then

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
got two automatic modes regular and then
the<00:01:53.460> superior<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.689> superior<00:01:55.170> takes<00:01:55.470> a

few shots in quick succession and tries
to<00:01:58.110> combine<00:01:58.290> them<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> best<00:01:59.189> shot

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
to combine them to get the best shot

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.639 
to combine them to get the best shot
possible<00:01:59.540> you've<00:02:00.540> also<00:02:00.689> got<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> background<00:02:01.259> D

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649

shots as well and try and blow out your
background<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:07.640> then<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.179> your<00:02:09.390> 360

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229

the backlight correction and HDR for

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.479 
the backlight correction and HDR for
high<00:02:30.540> dynamic<00:02:31.020> range<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.400> gonna

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
high dynamic range and this is gonna

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.100 
high dynamic range and this is gonna
take<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> bunch<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.120> pictures<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.720> combine

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
them so that your highlights and your

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.309 
them so that your highlights and your
shadows<00:02:36.060> both<00:02:36.330> look<00:02:36.569> good<00:02:36.720> at<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.870> same<00:02:36.959> time

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
shadows both look good at the same time

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.620 
shadows both look good at the same time
I<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.459> do<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> lot<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.819> my<00:02:39.000> shooting<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.480> P

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
I like to do a lot of my shooting in P

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.809 
I like to do a lot of my shooting in P
mode<00:02:39.840> which<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.170> program<00:02:40.650> automatic<00:02:41.190> mode<00:02:41.370> and

mode which is program automatic mode and

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.400 
mode which is program automatic mode and
this<00:02:42.269> is<00:02:42.390> where<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.750> camera<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.110> pretty<00:02:43.230> much

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
this is where the camera is pretty much

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.140 
this is where the camera is pretty much
automatic<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.250> gives<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.550> couple<00:02:44.880> of

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
automatic but it gives you a couple of

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.420 
automatic but it gives you a couple of
overrides<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.530> change<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.890> ISO<00:02:47.160> speed

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
overrides you can change the ISO speed

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.009 
overrides you can change the ISO speed

yourself from 80 all the way up to
twelve<00:02:49.319> thousand<00:02:49.799> eight<00:02:49.920> hundred<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:51.090> can

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
twelve thousand eight hundred you can

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.940 
twelve thousand eight hundred you can
change<00:02:51.480> your<00:02:51.630> white<00:02:51.810> balance<00:02:52.260> your<00:02:52.470> focus

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
change your white balance your focus

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.759 
change your white balance your focus
your<00:02:53.190> continuous<00:02:53.730> shooting<00:02:54.380> metering<00:02:55.380> all

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
your continuous shooting metering all

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.520 
your continuous shooting metering all
things<00:02:56.100> like<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.660> now<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.110> left<00:02:58.319> hand

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
things like that now on the left hand

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.190 
things like that now on the left hand
panel<00:02:58.769> here<00:02:59.190> are<00:02:59.400> your<00:03:00.060> most-used<00:03:00.390> options

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
panel here are your most-used options

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.050 
panel here are your most-used options
and<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.650> change<00:03:02.040> these<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.610> see<00:03:02.790> fit

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
and you can change these as you see fit

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.600 
and you can change these as you see fit
so<00:03:03.959> if<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.440> wanted<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.769> change<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.400> go<00:03:05.580> in

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
so if you wanted to change it you go in

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.330 
so if you wanted to change it you go in
here<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.180> push<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> little<00:03:06.600> gear<00:03:07.019> and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
here and you push the little gear and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.320 
here and you push the little gear and
then<00:03:08.340> let's<00:03:08.580> say<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.760> don't<00:03:08.940> use<00:03:09.120> white

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
then let's say you don't use white

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.000 
then let's say you don't use white
balance<00:03:09.660> very<00:03:09.780> often<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.410> use<00:03:10.560> metering

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
balance very often but you use metering

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.470 
balance very often but you use metering
you<00:03:11.190> just<00:03:11.370> drag<00:03:11.610> out<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.940> metering<00:03:12.209> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
you just drag out the metering and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.380 
you just drag out the metering and
replace<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.549> from<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.670> white<00:03:14.819> balance<00:03:15.209> and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
replace it from the white balance and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.479 
replace it from the white balance and
now<00:03:15.900> metering<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.530> always<00:03:16.829> available<00:03:17.040> here<00:03:17.400> on

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
now metering is always available here on

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.280 
now metering is always available here on
the<00:03:17.519> left<00:03:17.730> hand<00:03:17.820> side<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.480> if<00:03:19.019> that's<00:03:19.200> a

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
the left hand side so if that's a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.380 
the left hand side so if that's a
setting<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.650> use<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.769> lot<00:03:20.070> it's<00:03:20.940> very<00:03:21.000> quick<00:03:21.329> to

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
setting you use a lot it's very quick to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.259 
setting you use a lot it's very quick to
get<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.810> now<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.290> let<00:03:23.220> me<00:03:23.310> show<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.640> how<00:03:23.970> those

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
get to now and let me show you how those

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.270
