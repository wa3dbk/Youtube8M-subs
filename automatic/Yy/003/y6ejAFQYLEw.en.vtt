balanced<00:02:24.230> field<00:02:24.470> for<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.890> servers<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.520> its

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
balanced field for the servers and its

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.430

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.850 
hoping to bring to the eSports scene
once<00:02:38.690> they<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:38.960> it<00:02:39.080> more<00:02:39.230> refined<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.740> what

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
once they get it more refined so what

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.770 
once they get it more refined so what
you<00:02:39.980> need<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.190> know<00:02:40.250> about<00:02:40.460> this<00:02:40.730> mode<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.510> that

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
you need to know about this mode is that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.290 
you need to know about this mode is that
there's<00:02:41.960> two<00:02:42.110> teams<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:42.500> eight<00:02:42.620> players<00:02:43.300> there

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
there's two teams of eight players there

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.240 
there's two teams of eight players there
are<00:02:44.570> three<00:02:44.960> capture<00:02:45.350> points<00:02:45.740> think<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.070> Call

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
are three capture points think of Call

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.340 
are three capture points think of Call
of<00:02:46.280> Duty<00:02:46.640> domination<00:02:47.330> three<00:02:47.630> flags<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.200> got

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
of Duty domination three flags you got

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.530 
of Duty domination three flags you got
to<00:02:48.470> capture<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.640> first<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:50.060> five<00:02:50.180> hundred

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
to capture and the first of five hundred

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.810 
to capture and the first of five hundred
points<00:02:50.720> wins<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.830> more<00:02:52.010> capture<00:02:52.490> points

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
points wins so the more capture points

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.510 
points wins so the more capture points
your<00:02:52.970> team<00:02:53.150> holds<00:02:53.570> at<00:02:53.690> one<00:02:53.930> time<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.890> faster

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
your team holds at one time the faster

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.310 
your team holds at one time the faster
you<00:02:55.550> are<00:02:55.910> accruing<00:02:56.330> these<00:02:56.570> points<00:02:56.959> towards

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
you are accruing these points towards

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.140 
you are accruing these points towards
your<00:02:57.410> total<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:58.190> also<00:02:58.550> get<00:02:58.670> points<00:02:59.090> for

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
your total you also get points for

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.840 
your total you also get points for
killing<00:02:59.570> enemies<00:03:00.170> but<00:03:00.739> it's<00:03:01.190> not<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.459> large

the main point of the map is to control
these<00:03:06.830> capture<00:03:07.370> points<00:03:07.760> there<00:03:08.150> are<00:03:08.540> three

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
these capture points there are three

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.840 
these capture points there are three
capture<00:03:09.470> points<00:03:09.739> on<00:03:09.830> each<00:03:09.980> map<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.670> map

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
capture points on each map on this map

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.740 
capture points on each map on this map
I'm<00:03:11.000> shooting<00:03:11.270> right<00:03:11.450> now<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
I'm shooting right now this is the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.780 
I'm shooting right now this is the
there's<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.530> central<00:03:14.010> point<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.520> clock

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
there's a central point in the clock

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.430 
there's a central point in the clock
tower<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.420> then<00:03:15.540> there's<00:03:15.690> our<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.140> side

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
tower and then there's our to side

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.330 
tower and then there's our to side
points<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.130> on<00:03:18.120> each<00:03:18.420> map<00:03:18.720> there<00:03:19.020> is<00:03:19.200> a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
points and on each map there is a

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.030 
points and on each map there is a
special<00:03:20.340> objective<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.360> on<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.780> map<00:03:22.040> there's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
special objective so on this map there's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.680 
special objective so on this map there's
a<00:03:23.190> trebuchet<00:03:23.790> for<00:03:24.000> each<00:03:24.120> team<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.600> the

a trebuchet for each team and the
trebuchet<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.230> very<00:03:25.710> important<00:03:26.280> it's<00:03:26.430> very

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
trebuchet is very important it's very

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.000 
trebuchet is very important it's very
destructive<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.840> if<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.530> don't<00:03:28.680> take<00:03:28.830> out

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
destructive and if you don't take out

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.610 
destructive and if you don't take out

the trebuchet from a team who knows how

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.680 
the trebuchet from a team who knows how
to<00:03:31.680> use<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:31.950> they<00:03:32.310> will<00:03:32.610> win<00:03:32.880> because<00:03:33.420> the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
to use it they will win because the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.960 
to use it they will win because the
trebuchet<00:03:34.200> just<00:03:34.860> blows<00:03:35.220> up<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.550> clock<00:03:35.760> tower

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
trebuchet just blows up the clock tower

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.240 
trebuchet just blows up the clock tower
and<00:03:36.300> can<00:03:36.450> just<00:03:36.690> keep<00:03:37.170> knocking<00:03:37.560> back<00:03:38.010> and

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
and can just keep knocking back and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.400 
and can just keep knocking back and
doing<00:03:38.370> massive<00:03:38.670> damage<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.810> if<00:03:40.020> you're<00:03:40.140> trying

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
doing massive damage so if you're trying

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.780 
doing massive damage so if you're trying
to<00:03:40.560> sit<00:03:40.770> there<00:03:40.920> on<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.160> clock<00:03:41.340> tower<00:03:41.490> trying

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
to sit there on the clock tower trying

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.280 
to sit there on the clock tower trying
to<00:03:41.850> capture<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.209> point<00:03:42.480> they<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:43.020> just<00:03:43.200> keep

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
to capture a point they can just keep

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.990 
to capture a point they can just keep
firing<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.950> trebuchet<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.550> there<00:03:44.730> knocking

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
firing the trebuchet in there knocking

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.479
