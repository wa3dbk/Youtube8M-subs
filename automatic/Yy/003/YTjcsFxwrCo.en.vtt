00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
is a sequel is it a pre-poll it's

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.560 
is a sequel is it a pre-poll it's
actually<00:00:44.700> kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.000> hard<00:00:45.210> question<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
actually kind of a hard question to

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.900 
actually kind of a hard question to
answer<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> sequel<00:00:47.670> it's

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
answer so it's it's not a sequel it's

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.549 
answer so it's it's not a sequel it's
not<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.450> king's<00:00:48.780> quest<00:00:48.870> nine<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.500> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
not it's not king's quest nine and it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.900 
not it's not king's quest nine and it's
not<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> reboot<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.489> sort<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
not a reboot it's sort of like a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.840 
not a reboot it's sort of like a
reimagining<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.250> doing<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.670> we're

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
reimagining so what we're doing is we're

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.729 
reimagining so what we're doing is we're
telling<00:00:54.120> stories<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.539> exist<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.230> between

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
telling stories that exist in between

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.240 
telling stories that exist in between
the<00:00:56.100> original<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.750> our<00:00:57.930> first<00:00:58.199> chapter<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the original one so our first chapter is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.549 
the original one so our first chapter is
actually<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.090> how<00:01:00.300> King<00:01:00.570> grant<00:01:00.960> became<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
actually about how King grant became a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.229 
actually about how King grant became a
knight<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> first<00:01:02.430> game<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.940> about<00:01:03.030> how<00:01:03.180> he

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
knight so the first game is about how he

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.250 
knight so the first game is about how he
became<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> king<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.870> we're<00:01:03.989> telling<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
became the king and we're telling a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.660 
became the king and we're telling a
story<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.650> takes<00:01:04.769> place<00:01:04.890> before<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.519> if

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
