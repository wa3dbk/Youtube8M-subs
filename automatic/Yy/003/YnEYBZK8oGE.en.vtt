00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
the steps I typically use when I want to

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.820 
the steps I typically use when I want to
or<00:00:07.160> incorporate<00:00:08.160> some<00:00:08.970> fabric<00:00:09.570> into<00:00:10.349> my

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
here in this illustration so we're gonna

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.819 
here in this illustration so we're gonna
go<00:00:32.610> into<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.469> Photoshop<00:00:34.469> cs6<00:00:36.410> I'm<00:00:37.410> gonna<00:00:37.649> go

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
go into that Photoshop cs6 I'm gonna go

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.869 
go into that Photoshop cs6 I'm gonna go
up<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> file<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.850> open<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.270> new<00:00:39.570> skin<00:00:43.879> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
up to file to open the new skin and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.860 
up to file to open the new skin and
there's<00:00:45.300> my<00:00:46.160> sketched<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.489> image<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.840> I

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
there's my sketched out image that I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.130 
there's my sketched out image that I
scanned<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.070> computer<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.840> first

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
scanned into the computer the first

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.500 
scanned into the computer the first
thing<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:53.360> typically<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:57.030> mess

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
thing I do typically is I I don't mess

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
thing I do typically is I I don't mess
with<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.930> background<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.250> keep<00:00:59.430> my

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
with that background I like to keep my

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.389 
with that background I like to keep my
original<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.050> duplicate<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.070> hide

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
original so I just duplicate it and hide

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.630 
original so I just duplicate it and hide
back<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.180> I'm<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:05.570> adjust<00:01:06.570> my<00:01:07.350> lines<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
back and I'm going to adjust my lines a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.090 
back and I'm going to adjust my lines a
little<00:01:08.850> bit<00:01:09.030> by<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.869> image<00:01:10.100> adjustment

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
little bit by going to image adjustment

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.429 
little bit by going to image adjustment
then<00:01:11.369> levels<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.900> move

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
then levels and I'm just going to move

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.880 
then levels and I'm just going to move
this<00:01:16.680> tick<00:01:17.070> over<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> middle<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.590> far

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
this tick over to the middle to the far

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.469 
this tick over to the middle to the far
right<00:01:21.409> just<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.830> those<00:01:23.040> lines<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.880> dark<00:01:24.299> as

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
right just to get those lines as dark as

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.170 
right just to get those lines as dark as
I<00:01:25.820> get<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> image<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.630> pop

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
I get the image to pop

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.380 
I get the image to pop
now<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:30.140> these<00:01:30.680> two<00:01:31.130> here<00:01:31.400> make<00:01:31.730> your<00:01:32.180> line

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
now this these two here make your line

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.920 
now this these two here make your line
start<00:01:32.900> there<00:01:33.790> this<00:01:34.790> white<00:01:35.090> line<00:01:35.300> makes<00:01:35.630> the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
start there this white line makes the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.360 
start there this white line makes the
white<00:01:36.140> pop<00:01:36.530> out<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.190> little<00:01:37.490> white<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:40.220> I've

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
white pop out and a little white so I've

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.200 
white pop out and a little white so I've
been<00:01:40.550> hit<00:01:40.760> okay<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.270> just<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.670> then

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
been hit okay to just that and then

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.540 
been hit okay to just that and then
we're<00:01:44.570> going<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.930> place<00:01:45.380> my<00:01:45.410> fabric<00:01:46.310> like

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
we're going to place my fabric like

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.930 
we're going to place my fabric like
going<00:01:46.820> into<00:01:46.970> file<00:01:47.270> place<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.730> these<00:01:49.730> are

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
going into file place and these are

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.270 
going into file place and these are
fabrics<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.510> I've<00:01:50.720> downloaded<00:01:51.100> from<00:01:52.100> the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
fabrics that I've downloaded from the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.470 
fabrics that I've downloaded from the
internet<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:53.420> I've<00:01:53.570> got<00:01:53.690> my<00:01:53.860> documents

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
internet and I've got my documents

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.840 
internet and I've got my documents
downloads<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:59.180> this<00:01:59.470> is<00:02:00.470> what<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:00.740> want

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.300 

so<00:02:04.850> that's<00:02:05.300> gonna<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:05.930> fall<00:02:06.290> in<00:02:06.530> there<00:02:06.800> put<00:02:07.280> a

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
so that's gonna just fall in there put a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.770 
so that's gonna just fall in there put a
rotate<00:02:07.760> a<00:02:07.850> little<00:02:07.910> bit<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:10.280> get<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.880> in

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
rotate a little bit so I can get it in

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.070 
rotate a little bit so I can get it in
the<00:02:12.050> angle<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.160> want<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:14.120> match<00:02:14.300> my<00:02:14.600> image

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the angle that I want to match my image

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.120 
the angle that I want to match my image
and<00:02:15.800> hit<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.160> checkmark<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.830> then<00:02:19.010> we're

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
and hit that checkmark so then we're

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.420 
and hit that checkmark so then we're
gonna<00:02:19.220> add<00:02:19.430> an<00:02:19.670> extra<00:02:20.060> layer<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.630> reemerge

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
gonna add an extra layer and reemerge

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.840 
gonna add an extra layer and reemerge
this<00:02:22.430> smart<00:02:22.820> object<00:02:22.970> since<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.720> can't<00:02:24.050> edit<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
this smart object since I can't edit the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.910 
this smart object since I can't edit the
smart<00:02:26.180> object<00:02:26.330> alone<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.080> needed<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.650> be<00:02:27.740> on<00:02:27.890> a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
smart object alone I needed to be on a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.900 
smart object alone I needed to be on a
regular<00:02:28.900> layer<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.910> high-back<00:02:32.480> good

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
regular layer and a high-back good

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.110 
regular layer and a high-back good
shortcut<00:02:34.910> hit<00:02:35.300> L<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:36.140> that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
shortcut hit L for that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.309 
shortcut hit L for that
