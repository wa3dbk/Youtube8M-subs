00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
common misconception up to this point

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.830 
common misconception up to this point
but<00:03:40.890> if<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.100> look<00:03:41.310> at<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:41.580> idea<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:42.300> fig<00:03:42.570> it's

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
but if you look at the idea of fig it's

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.190 
but if you look at the idea of fig it's
actually<00:03:43.820> good<00:03:44.820> right<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:45.840> something

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
actually good right is this something

when<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.650> mean<00:03:55.980> what<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.459> say<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.910> what<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.090> mean

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
when I mean what I say that what I mean

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.900 
when I mean what I say that what I mean
is<00:03:57.360> like<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.980> should<00:03:59.040> be<00:03:59.310> spread<00:03:59.760> out

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
is like the a you should be spread out

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.760 
is like the a you should be spread out
over<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:00.209> whole<00:04:00.420> bunch<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.720> products<00:04:01.170> now<00:04:01.440> it's

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
over a whole bunch of products now it's

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.540 
over a whole bunch of products now it's
it's<00:04:02.510> really<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.750> kind<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.170> shrunk<00:04:05.040> into<00:04:05.280> a

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
it's really just kind of shrunk into a

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.150 
it's really just kind of shrunk into a
few<00:04:06.180> write<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.600> few<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:07.080> get<00:04:07.200> attention<00:04:07.560> but

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
few write a few that get attention but

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.470 
few write a few that get attention but
here<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.490> have<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.730> opportunity<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.270> present

here you have the opportunity to present

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.710 
here you have the opportunity to present
your<00:04:09.810> game<00:04:10.020> present<00:04:10.470> your<00:04:10.620> project<00:04:10.770> and

your game present your project and

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.330 
your game present your project and
hopefully<00:04:12.720> get<00:04:12.959> picked<00:04:13.290> as<00:04:13.470> one<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.980> two

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
hopefully get picked as one of two

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.220 
hopefully get picked as one of two
products<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.180> can<00:04:15.450> be<00:04:15.660> put<00:04:15.870> out<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.020> the

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
products that can be put out to the

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.440 
products that can be put out to the
marketplace<00:04:16.730> interestingly<00:04:17.730> enough<00:04:18.180> right

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
marketplace interestingly enough right

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.560 
marketplace interestingly enough right
now<00:04:18.720> they're<00:04:19.320> only<00:04:19.530> letting<00:04:19.890> people<00:04:20.570> fund

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
now they're only letting people fund

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.270 
now they're only letting people fund
these<00:04:21.840> projects<00:04:22.440> if<00:04:22.620> they<00:04:22.860> have<00:04:23.040> like<00:04:23.250> a

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
these projects if they have like a

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.730 
these projects if they have like a
million<00:04:23.640> dollars<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.360> capital<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.350> the

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
million dollars in capital and the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.379 
million dollars in capital and the
minimum<00:04:26.010> investment<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.820> one

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
minimum investment is one

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.059 
minimum investment is one
in<00:04:27.569> dollars<00:04:27.930> that's<00:04:28.409> what's<00:04:28.650> happening<00:04:29.009> right

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
in dollars that's what's happening right

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.969 
in dollars that's what's happening right
now<00:04:29.249> so<00:04:29.639> you<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:30.330> me<00:04:30.539> well<00:04:30.960> maybe<00:04:31.080> not<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:31.949> but

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
now so you and me well maybe not you but

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.520 
now so you and me well maybe not you but
definitely<00:04:32.610> me<00:04:32.819> I<00:04:33.090> couldn't<00:04:33.509> put<00:04:34.050> money<00:04:34.289> into

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
definitely me I couldn't put money into

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.950 
definitely me I couldn't put money into
one<00:04:34.800> of<00:04:34.919> these<00:04:34.979> projects<00:04:35.460> but<00:04:36.449> they're<00:04:36.659> hoping

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
one of these projects but they're hoping

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.920 
one of these projects but they're hoping
to<00:04:37.229> open<00:04:38.189> it<00:04:38.520> up<00:04:38.639> to<00:04:38.759> everybody<00:04:39.120> down<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.719> road

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
to open it up to everybody down the road

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.899 
to open it up to everybody down the road
and<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.229> think<00:04:40.469> that's<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.919> solid<00:04:41.129> idea<00:04:41.400> if<00:04:41.819> I

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
and I think that's a solid idea if I

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.730 
and I think that's a solid idea if I
could<00:04:42.090> put<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.509> a<00:04:42.629> thousand<00:04:43.080> bucks<00:04:43.199> on<00:04:43.379> a<00:04:43.409> game

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
could put in a thousand bucks on a game

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.100 
could put in a thousand bucks on a game
that<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.610> trust<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.270> development<00:04:45.719> team<00:04:45.749> I've

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
that I trust the development team I've

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.050 
that I trust the development team I've
trust<00:04:46.439> their<00:04:46.620> previous<00:04:46.979> works<00:04:47.279> and<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.639> can<00:04:47.879> get

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
trust their previous works and I can get

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.179 
trust their previous works and I can get
a<00:04:48.090> financial<00:04:48.719> return<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:49.289> however<00:04:49.620> much<00:04:49.889> based

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189 
a financial return of however much based

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.700 
a financial return of however much based
on<00:04:50.370> that<00:04:50.490> initial<00:04:50.729> investment<00:04:51.419> that<00:04:52.050> actually

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
on that initial investment that actually

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.249 
on that initial investment that actually
speaks<00:04:52.919> more<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.370> me<00:04:53.639> than<00:04:54.330> just<00:04:54.389> giving<00:04:54.930> them

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
speaks more to me than just giving them

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.800 
speaks more to me than just giving them
money<00:04:55.499> for<00:04:56.129> the<00:04:56.219> product<00:04:56.639> at<00:04:56.789> least<00:04:57.060> if<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.479> have

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
money for the product at least if I have

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.019 
money for the product at least if I have
some<00:04:58.080> stake<00:04:58.499> in<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:58.919> might<00:04:59.249> have<00:04:59.490> some<00:04:59.759> say

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:00.029 
some stake in it I might have some say

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:01.850 
some stake in it I might have some say
if<00:05:00.300> they're<00:05:00.539> dragging<00:05:01.080> their<00:05:01.110> ass<00:05:01.409> about

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
if they're dragging their ass about

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.100 
if they're dragging their ass about
getting<00:05:02.279> it<00:05:02.400> done<00:05:02.610> Tim<00:05:03.270> fucking<00:05:03.750> Schafer

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
getting it done Tim fucking Schafer

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.200 
getting it done Tim fucking Schafer
right<00:05:04.289> that's<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.250> way<00:05:05.340> I<00:05:05.370> see<00:05:05.699> that<00:05:05.909> is<00:05:06.090> like

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
right that's the way I see that is like

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.689 
right that's the way I see that is like
it<00:05:06.360> kind<00:05:06.599> of<00:05:06.719> puts<00:05:07.050> control<00:05:07.710> back<00:05:08.400> in<00:05:08.610> the

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
it kind of puts control back in the

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.450 
it kind of puts control back in the
hands<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:10.080> investors<00:05:10.710> right<00:05:11.189> because

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
hands of the investors right because

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.200 
hands of the investors right because
they<00:05:11.669> can<00:05:12.000> in<00:05:12.449> essence<00:05:13.229> go<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:14.669> developers

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
they can in essence go to the developers

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.089 
they can in essence go to the developers
here<00:05:15.389> and<00:05:15.599> go<00:05:15.719> listen<00:05:15.960> what's<00:05:16.529> taking<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:17.069> so

I<00:05:28.439> would<00:05:28.830> really<00:05:28.979> hope<00:05:29.310> that<00:05:29.909> they<00:05:30.389> take<00:05:30.419> this

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
seriously because if this works this

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.079

be<00:06:12.149> pretty<00:06:12.389> interesting<00:06:12.870> and<00:06:13.020> one<00:06:13.139> that<00:06:13.289> I'm

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:13.379 
be pretty interesting and one that I'm

be pretty interesting and one that I'm
very<00:06:13.830> curious<00:06:14.099> to<00:06:14.310> see<00:06:14.580> where<00:06:15.419> it<00:06:15.599> goes<00:06:15.810> next

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
very curious to see where it goes next

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.269

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
everything else pcs gaming is growing

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.469 
everything else pcs gaming is growing
it's<00:06:25.500> still<00:06:25.830> growing<00:06:26.159> it's<00:06:26.490> not<00:06:27.000> going<00:06:27.210> to<00:06:27.300> die

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
it's still growing it's not going to die

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.719 
it's still growing it's not going to die
off<00:06:27.719> a<00:06:27.750> gaming<00:06:28.289> crash<00:06:28.589> is<00:06:28.889> not<00:06:29.129> coming

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
off a gaming crash is not coming

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.869 
off a gaming crash is not coming
especially<00:06:30.000> if<00:06:30.599> people<00:06:31.529> are<00:06:31.649> able<00:06:31.860> to<00:06:32.279> invest

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
especially if people are able to invest

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.700 
especially if people are able to invest
into<00:06:33.149> it<00:06:33.330> themselves<00:06:33.750> and<00:06:34.020> it's<00:06:34.529> not

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
into it themselves and it's not

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.129 
into it themselves and it's not
bottlenecked<00:06:35.459> which<00:06:36.060> essentially<00:06:36.509> is<00:06:36.659> what

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
bottlenecked which essentially is what

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.990 
bottlenecked which essentially is what
might<00:06:37.500> cause<00:06:37.800> another<00:06:37.830> crash<00:06:38.490> if<00:06:38.699> we<00:06:38.819> can

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
might cause another crash if we can

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.300 
might cause another crash if we can
remove<00:06:39.300> that<00:06:39.509> bottleneck<00:06:39.990> then<00:06:40.949> I<00:06:41.069> think

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
remove that bottleneck then I think

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.719 
remove that bottleneck then I think
everything

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
everything

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.369 
everything
we'll<00:06:41.849> be<00:06:41.969> okay<00:06:42.300> in<00:06:42.360> fig<00:06:42.689> does<00:06:42.930> feel<00:06:43.169> like<00:06:43.349> a

we'll be okay in fig does feel like a

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:45.249 
we'll be okay in fig does feel like a
pretty<00:06:43.710> good<00:06:43.919> step<00:06:44.219> in<00:06:44.339> the<00:06:44.400> right<00:06:44.610> direction

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 
pretty good step in the right direction

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.959 
pretty good step in the right direction
