 with or if I took off all makeup or a 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.289
 tonic is a moisturizing 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.649
 according to the type of skin 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.480
 The second step I prepared with timer 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.120
 which is a product that already reduces a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 the thinner lines of the face are 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.820
 important does not take your life away then 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.190
 The first tip cleanses your face and 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
 people find anywhere pharmacy 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.890

 makeup is perfumeries and shops of matia 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.480
 base for preparing the skin where the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.170
 apparent is a crime until the cream in 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.720
 extreme is white and white goes 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.670
 prepare the skin will it prepare the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.270
 fur strip brightness and leaves the skin in 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.250
 A more velvety tone is safe and has a 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.100
 little anxiety because it is any 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.369
 makeup is already the same for a skin 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.530
 is soft or dry or mixed she always 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.210
 ends up producing a little more or 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.570
 less and the insured figure 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.119
 The second alcohol corrective tip is the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.310
 corrective I know around the eyes 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.860
 Where are you afraid do not have a little more 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.810
 gasoline around the nose that is always 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.210
 redder when the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.549
 corrective of unifying the skin is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.540
 any other stain she has that the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:49.020
 person is after the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.370

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.350

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.870
 let her in the drawing she is a tip 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.450
 also looks at brasilia did still the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.400
 bright presence whenever you need to 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.470
 be brilliant in makeup because you can 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.290
 getting a little red already covers already 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.720
 the imperfections look is also rare and the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.150
 well- drawn eyebrow she already lifts 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.030
 the look already is to differentiate rejuvenesce some 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.900
 good years do not understand 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.470
 maintenance 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.210
 she does not take risks at home and stay in 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.920
 I sing a little more because I do not 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.800
 works sometimes it will save us people 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.000
 draws on eyebrow and woman at home 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.580
 it goes a little bit a little bit more 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.560
 a little bit and crap that time 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.170
 watching a movie and is not that what then do not 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.060
 have the same playing strip was carefully 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.380
 professional delivery to the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.910
 while he is doing the makeup 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.130
 What can we do in our hair for 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.600
 percent we have a very easy thing 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.550
 To make her hair I talked a 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.489
 little with her back she has a hair 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.440
 My hair is full, of course, I already 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.750
 left a little to the back and we 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.780
 Let's just cut the front of us. 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.970
 let's get a fringe do my 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.700
 hair was the youngest person leaves 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.640
 because his life the face hair was a 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.100
 long will not get good wire is so 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.709
 then the aged but not exactly 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.880
 is any fringe is not a fringe 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.950
 and a long fringe never a 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.739
 straight fringe that I find very childish 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.570
 Sat pulls everything cuts on the front on top of the 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.980
 I particularly think eyebrow 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.050
 a children's diaper and went with a lot of 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.790
 People think that making this straight fringe 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.150
 It will look like a child, not really. 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.709
 it's the opposite if it gets strange to you 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.360
 You have to have a city guy just that 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.239
 best you can sing 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.239
 together with you clause can start and 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.250
 it just looks're a most lines 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.420
 about the difference of the plate is 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:07.300
 different now all you see only with 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.580
 a scissors at the front and how to 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.730
 We're going to soften this hair. 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.970
 the weight of her face 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.860
 hello getting lighter is already getting 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.690
 lighter 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.370
 Let's make the following crumple before 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.740
 and then when the person is doing 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.780
 here for you to see the difference 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.720
 Look how it really was 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.850
 heavy visual and that 's what we're going 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.610
 get out of here from that other side too 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.620
 to take the excess weight off the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.210
 front and then you always leave your face 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.150
 more exposed looks different looks 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.040
 different is not a little do not need 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.690
 have the volume because you are older 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.880

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.610

 Great, it gets super cute. 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.770

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.790
 exactly this is you have more 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.150
