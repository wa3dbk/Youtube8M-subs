00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:05.680
 After more than 30 years, she now comes to the streets the sixth generation of the 

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:10.210
 Jetta from the house Volkswagen a middle class car in Germany 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.900
 more than exotic can be called that looks international but very different 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.399
 So far, Volkswagen has built over nine point 6 million Jetta 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.380
 for our beautiful compact segment for even one of our most important 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.110
 Vehicles especially for the notchback markets 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.950
 like here in the United States or even in China quite a whole 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.220
 important car 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.030
 and which by the 4 of course in the United States alone for 50 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.760
 percent 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 our cocoa volume here in this country brand Volkswagen 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.609
 and III USA are such a significant market for this model 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.059
 Volkswagen is organizing its international presentation in San 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.699
 Francisco journalists from all over the world can visit the Californian metropolis 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.570
 that vehicles are put through their paces 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.130
 Result The new generation of the Jetta is anything but a facelift this 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.790
 is a completely new model on its own and not a variant 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.790
 of the tried and true gold 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.220
 bigger comfortable dynamic with a completely new design so 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.930
 now also presents the new Schlatter 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.710
 It was built in Germany and is built exclusively in Mexico 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.080
 we have 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.290
 Chatter the sixth generation of the proportions significantly stretched at the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.110
 Wheelbase extended 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.620
 When you see how beautiful in the width of the vehicles now in length 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.280
 the proportions I think that I am here by design a vehicle what 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 I think this brand has a very big chance 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.750
 in the interior, the new Jetta shows in a completely new guise 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.629
 it is visibly over 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.629
 the big round instruments are easy to read 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:20.219
 everything Ebner now looks more than if a middle-class vehicles suspect 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.599
 would like to 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.510
 Under the hood come in the US initially two well-tried gasoline 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.510
 Suction engines with two and two and a half liters displacement are used 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.639
 "In Europe we will use exclusively the engines of Pilsen on the 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.979
 or would drive 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.979
 Expose Hans Pum second tdi engines 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.929
 Of course we will also the equipment 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.789
 say times to adjust the German market percent 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.629
 because the new Jetta will come on the market in Germany in January 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.030
 Due to the other specifications it will not be as cheap as in 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.209
 to be with the US 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.810
