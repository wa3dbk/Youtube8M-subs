00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.342
Tom Erik and Jokke have finally reached the top of BÃ¸ttajuvet

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:06.362
where the snow creates problems

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.060
Gigantic snow cornice over there!

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.380
Yeah ... F**ck that's some meters eh!

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.880
F**ck it's sketchy to walk here

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.840
What's dangerous with a snow cornice like this one is that...

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.700
in worst case they can crack further upp than expected

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.100
and then you both go down the valley

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:28.072
Huge....

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.760
Check it out

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.420
But I don't know how well it's holding so let's put on some ropes and

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.720
Yes, let's do that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.720
Do you manage to go to the tip?

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.500
Not without being secured, because of the snow

00:00:45.723 --> 00:00:47.063
Then we fix that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.440
What we do to find an exit point...

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.920
Is basically to go to the top of the mountain that you think is possible to jump

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.020
And then crawl to the tip and throw some stones down

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.000
You then count the seconds from the throw to the stone hits the ground

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.160
The stones fall faster than the human body

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.580
So it's a good...

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.080
... you have a pretty good ...

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.580
margin

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.180
12 seconds

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.360
When it's 12 seconds there are several hundred meters to impact

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.075
so then you have a good margin

00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:32.715
and if there also is a little overhang it's supersafe

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.500
You can fall like a bag of potatoes

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.388
for about at least 10 seconds

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.400
To master the ability to flight 1 meter over ground

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.100
or between some trees, or between a crack in the mountain

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.100
or things like that....

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.320
it makes you want to...

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:50.036
get a feeling on how it is to really fly

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.160
it's probably something of the most crazy and awesome a human can experience

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.560
If you fuck up, yes.. you die

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.880
but you don't want to stand and think: yes, now I have to focus on that

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.960
That's not what you focus on

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.620
I have had friends in basejumping...

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.940
that have lost their lifes jumping

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.980
It can happen to everybody

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.980
it's a reality

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.560
it also makes you appreciate, much more, the friendship you have with the person you jump with

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
and it's that person

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.280
that in worst case will save your life

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.080
or...

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.860
you need to save his.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.820
the reason I die... if it base is the reason

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.400
then...

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.247
Anyways ... I wouldn't regret it for a second

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.320
but

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.580
I know I would die doing something I love to do.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.240
Now i don't need anymore!

00:04:55.491 --> 00:04:57.551
Did you see that sprucetree??

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.500
It was that christmas tree, it was like yeess, he got a shock !... you know

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.400
Overdose you know

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:08.285
It was so amazing!!

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.920
One can believe that a basejumper is totally mentaly insane and couldn't be more of an idiot

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.860
but I'm just myself...

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.700
a little kid that loves to fly

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.920
not more than that.
