of<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.190> middle<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.760> it<00:01:50.910> works<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
of it in the middle like it works and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.520 
of it in the middle like it works and
take<00:01:52.200> great<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:53.310> um<00:01:53.690> yeah<00:01:54.690> I<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.440> might

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
take great but um yeah I think I might

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.930 
take great but um yeah I think I might
actually<00:01:55.590> take<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.130> off<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.340> put<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> stock

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
actually take that off and put a stock

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.030 
actually take that off and put a stock
back<00:01:57.120> out<00:01:57.300> I<00:01:57.330> guess<00:01:57.480> they're<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:58.040> shovels

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
back out I guess they're really shovels

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.550 
back out I guess they're really shovels
