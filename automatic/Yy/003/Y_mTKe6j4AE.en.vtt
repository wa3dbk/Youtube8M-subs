though<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.799> size<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.250> nice<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:13.209> have<00:03:13.359> to<00:03:13.509> put

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
though the size is nice you have to put

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.360 
though the size is nice you have to put
on<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.900> desk<00:03:14.169> and<00:03:14.379> then<00:03:14.439> you<00:03:14.859> kind<00:03:15.099> of<00:03:15.159> hover

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
on a desk and then you kind of hover

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.490 
on a desk and then you kind of hover
over<00:03:15.759> it<00:03:15.879> which<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.180> really<00:03:16.299> awkward<00:03:16.599> I<00:03:17.019> mean

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
over it which is really awkward I mean

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.899 
over it which is really awkward I mean
obviously<00:03:17.680> they<00:03:18.069> wouldn't<00:03:18.340> put<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.459> kickstand

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
obviously they wouldn't put a kickstand

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.520 
obviously they wouldn't put a kickstand
on<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.150> because<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.389> ruins<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.959> aesthetics

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
on it because that ruins the aesthetics

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.869 
on it because that ruins the aesthetics
right<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:21.009> would<00:03:21.099> be<00:03:21.189> functional<00:03:21.430> we<00:03:21.699> cannot

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
right it would be functional we cannot

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.550 
right it would be functional we cannot
best<00:03:22.239> you<00:03:22.479> times<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.019> like<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.409> virtual

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
best you times and I like the virtual

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.069 
best you times and I like the virtual
keyboard<00:03:23.919> is<00:03:24.310> great<00:03:24.669> but<00:03:25.269> typing<00:03:25.750> out<00:03:25.900> like

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
keyboard is great but typing out like

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.439

getting<00:03:26.470> onto<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.769> keyboard<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:28.150> awkward

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
getting onto the keyboard is the awkward

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.819 
getting onto the keyboard is the awkward

interfaces<00:04:27.980> I'm<00:04:28.190> glad<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.520> mentioned<00:04:28.610> pin<00:04:28.910> to

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
interfaces I'm glad you mentioned pin to

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.280 
interfaces I'm glad you mentioned pin to
zoom<00:04:29.120> because<00:04:29.180> of<00:04:29.390> course<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.720> does<00:04:29.900> that<00:04:30.080> to

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
zoom because of course it does that to

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.050 
zoom because of course it does that to
keyboard<00:04:31.010> also<00:04:31.250> works<00:04:31.430> well<00:04:31.610> but<00:04:31.730> again<00:04:31.820> like

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
keyboard also works well but again like

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.250 
keyboard also works well but again like
I<00:04:32.120> said<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.330> got<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.480> hover<00:04:32.690> over<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:33.110> there

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
I said you got a hover over it so there

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.900 
I said you got a hover over it so there
we<00:04:33.380> aren't<00:04:33.620> typing<00:04:33.890> over<00:04:34.010> it<00:04:34.190> even<00:04:34.820> though

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
we aren't typing over it even though

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.000 
we aren't typing over it even though
it's<00:04:35.090> got<00:04:35.210> an<00:04:35.360> oleophobic<00:04:35.540> screen<00:04:36.290> it<00:04:36.800> gets

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
it's got an oleophobic screen it gets

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.260 
it's got an oleophobic screen it gets
very<00:04:37.100> fingerprints<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:37.820> don't<00:04:37.970> notice<00:04:38.210> it

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
very fingerprints you don't notice it

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.969 
very fingerprints you don't notice it
too<00:04:38.450> much<00:04:38.600> when<00:04:38.840> it's<00:04:39.020> on<00:04:39.260> well<00:04:39.590> we<00:04:39.650> just<00:04:39.770> wipe

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
too much when it's on well we just wipe

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.409 
too much when it's on well we just wipe
this<00:04:40.160> we<00:04:40.460> would<00:04:40.639> actually<00:04:40.790> clean<00:04:41.120> this<00:04:41.210> off

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
this we would actually clean this off

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.050 
this we would actually clean this off
but<00:04:41.600> hold<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:41.900> okay<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:42.380> that<00:04:43.130> is<00:04:43.250> a<00:04:43.280> nice<00:04:43.460> now

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
but hold on okay so that is a nice now

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.030 
but hold on okay so that is a nice now
I'm<00:04:44.479> turning<00:04:44.630> it<00:04:44.870> off<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.290> you<00:04:45.770> literally

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
I'm turning it off and you literally

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.860 
I'm turning it off and you literally
could<00:04:46.280> frame<00:04:46.550> someone<00:04:46.940> for<00:04:47.180> murder<00:04:47.300> with<00:04:47.750> the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
could frame someone for murder with the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.390 
could frame someone for murder with the
number<00:04:48.169> of<00:04:48.290> agar<00:04:48.530> prints<00:04:48.830> you<00:04:48.890> can<00:04:49.040> pull<00:04:49.220> off

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
number of agar prints you can pull off

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.700 
number of agar prints you can pull off
this<00:04:49.580> thing<00:04:49.820> because<00:04:50.030> within<00:04:50.320> seconds<00:04:51.320> and

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
this thing because within seconds and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.260 
this thing because within seconds and
because<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.160> because<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.520> is<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.640> touch<00:04:52.940> device

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
because it because it is a touch device

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.700 
because it because it is a touch device
yeah<00:04:53.479> look<00:04:53.630> at<00:04:53.720> that<00:04:53.750> again<00:04:54.020> it's<00:04:54.380> gonna<00:04:54.500> get<00:04:54.680> a

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
apps battery life is phenomenal by the

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.820 
apps battery life is phenomenal by the
way<00:06:11.430> I've<00:06:12.330> got<00:06:12.390> mine<00:06:13.020> well<00:06:13.410> here's<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.680> thing

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
way I've got mine well here's the thing

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.250 
way I've got mine well here's the thing
you<00:06:14.220> can't<00:06:14.550> USB<00:06:15.300> charge<00:06:15.600> it<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:15.810> your<00:06:15.930> computer

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
you can't USB charge it to your computer

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.830 
you can't USB charge it to your computer
so<00:06:17.190> it<00:06:17.580> doesn't<00:06:17.910> charge<00:06:18.120> whenever<00:06:18.390> the<00:06:18.570> charge

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
so it doesn't charge whenever the charge

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.750 
so it doesn't charge whenever the charge
actually<00:06:19.020> says<00:06:19.320> not<00:06:19.530> you're<00:06:19.710> not<00:06:19.740> charging<00:06:20.160> so
