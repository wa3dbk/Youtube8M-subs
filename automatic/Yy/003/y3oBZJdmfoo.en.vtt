00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.910 
like so it's a shorter jacket it's white
and<00:01:01.399> um<00:01:02.719> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> has<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.019> moto<00:01:04.439> feel<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and um kind of has that moto feel a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.429 
and um kind of has that moto feel a
little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.549> there<00:01:05.850> um<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> cloth

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
little bit there um it's more of a cloth

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.880 
little bit there um it's more of a cloth
material<00:01:08.000> but<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.330> thought<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.290> white<00:01:10.590> jacket

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
material but I thought a white jacket

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
material but I thought a white jacket
would<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.430> cute<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.450> too<00:01:12.750> thick

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
would be cute and it's not too thick

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.980 
would be cute and it's not too thick
although<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> cold<00:01:13.950> these<00:01:14.640> days

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
although it is kind of cold these days

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.749 
although it is kind of cold these days
over<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.229> California<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.070> I'm<00:01:17.580> probably

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
over here in California but I'm probably

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.210 
over here in California but I'm probably
chillier<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.409> big<00:01:19.799> east

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
chillier over there for big east

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.140 
chillier over there for big east
coasters<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.939> West<00:01:21.630> people<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.500> um<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
coasters and West people so um this is a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.060 
coasters and West people so um this is a
little<00:01:24.450> bit<00:01:24.540> lighter<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> thought<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
little bit lighter but I thought that it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.670 
little bit lighter but I thought that it
was<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.400> cute<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> white

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
this was a lot longer and the print is a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.209 
this was a lot longer and the print is a
bit<00:02:01.829> older<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.479> also<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.219> one-shoulder

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
bit older but it is also a one-shoulder

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.150 
bit older but it is also a one-shoulder
dress<00:02:05.750> but<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.229> see<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> has<00:02:07.680> this

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
dress but as you can see it has this

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.919 
dress but as you can see it has this
animal<00:02:08.789> print<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.450> on

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
animal print going on

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.380 
animal print going on
that<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> maxi<00:02:11.280> does<00:02:11.969> come<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.329> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that and it is a maxi does come with a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.289 
that and it is a maxi does come with a
belt<00:02:12.719> here<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.530> i<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.640> website<00:02:15.060> has

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
belt here and i think the website has

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.449 
belt here and i think the website has
five<00:02:15.659> dollar<00:02:15.959> flat<00:02:16.439> rate<00:02:16.650> shipping<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.340> then

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
five dollar flat rate shipping and then

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.420 
five dollar flat rate shipping and then
I<00:02:17.549> think<00:02:17.909> it's<00:02:18.060> free<00:02:18.390> shipping<00:02:18.420> after<00:02:19.250> $75<00:02:20.250> so

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
I think it's free shipping after $75 so

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.530 
I think it's free shipping after $75 so
it<00:02:20.489> goes<00:02:20.609> all<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.819> way<00:02:21.269> down<00:02:21.569> here<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:23.540> I'm

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
it goes all the way down here so I'm

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.209 
it goes all the way down here so I'm
looking<00:02:24.719> forward<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:25.349> how<00:02:25.469> it<00:02:25.620> looks<00:02:25.920> on
