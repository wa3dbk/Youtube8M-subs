00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.359

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.030
 walk next bus are these 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.150
 great products crazy panda is yes 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.429
 we all know that I read yes 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.379
 we all know that was namely all 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.210
 ever somehow here and have us 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.820
 chris given that's all so hey that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.560
 are all so former endorsers of the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.990
 golden lotus either in the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.510
 pagoda stood or below as flowers 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.700
 very happy and in the fog too no 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.510
 a guru in the fog, too 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.489
 one of them stood there and they grab that 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.629
 carl somehow not at all that anymore 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.820
 here the hair and here chaos and everywhere 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 be a bit crazy and hate 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.719
 of course, everything, somehow, too 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.010
 only to deal with hordes and alliance 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.469
 we act in the whole mess yes 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.989
 somehow the two are to blame 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.840
 beautiful statues in the lot of the rings 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.910
 partly broken and now there are first 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.350
 strong respect respect there you can already 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.280
 freak out and look for the other one 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.880
 decide page 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.380
 it is not already here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.119
 others just the whole thing 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.590
 box that his here somewhere 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.140
 tailor has pulled yes they stay 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.909
 even those keep in spite of their senkaku and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.049
 they do not stay that way anymore 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.540
 unaffected 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.439
 we should not take up anymore 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.380
 I had already driven that you 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.720
 said the video podcast 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.630
 cameramen and the gc coalition 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:40.140
 Of course that would be completely right anyway 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.049
 maybe theirs too 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.920
 even that problem but then 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.020
 would you maybe 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.270
 neatly put on this hole ghosts 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.500
 This is but I take it all 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.720
 fleckenberg your boss can yes we have 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.070
 here are three features and that are 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.630
 Protector but they work completely 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.100
 different from the endless protector from 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.610
 the key it finally spring falls to me 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.500
 let's say 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.829
 you can not beat him nicely 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.220
 row after somehow here away but 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.020
 they have to become one 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.530
 that meant fully so that's one 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.860
 a bit like the mini last phase one 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.099
 It has about 20 percent so you should 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.080
 Watch that one that you really 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.090
 at the same time within a short time 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.060
 time window all in one percent 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.770
 Otherwise brings the problem once a 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.780
 one percent ends and the other 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.930
 but not yet made on all percent 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.319
 jobs and does not get 20 high 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.420
 beautiful 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.650
 and then the whole mess starts 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.840
 at the front but what else is added is the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.970
 set desperate measures I think 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.430
 means one 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.819
 these are special attacks that everyone 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.300
 single of the three churches here 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.180
 each uses 66 out of 31 health 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.900
 and since they are not the life bar 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.489
 divide 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.319
 as we should have just stated 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:09.120
 Of course you take care that you have the 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.190
 not simultaneously at 66 and 33 below 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.810
 klop because otherwise all 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.819
 at the same time her desperate measures 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.739
 use and as the name already 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:22.620
 somehow sounds desperate and build 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.269
 then good and that leads then 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.950
 probably in most fans in 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.250
 that happens at the same time that is you 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.959
 The three casinos do not have to 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.940
 just down to one percent at a time 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.110
 bring you also have to look that 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.720
 you take turns on the 66 33 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.069
 percent down will work with it 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.989
 do not let you burst 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.079
 I already see how somehow 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.659
 flexible or for groups never the principle 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.999
 strap on and just kinda one up 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.159
 to vomit I take and vomit 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.200
 which is in Ifa just so they run 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.579
 Together at the steam serving cool down 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.769
 and probably will also mark 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.810
 maybe it is also here alone 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.609
 or horizon 2.0 there was also 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.919
 great joy I think I rather think 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.419
 less so according to the critic 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.859
 The fight was not really like that either 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:18.870
 complicated as probably sounds 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.389
 the question is of course like that now 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.550
 with the tanqueray expires because at three 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.949
 I do not think you can post here 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.900
 So it's about to take three tanks 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.669
 Although just as if one would 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.830
 one drink and the other the others 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.130
 two yes or maybe has a pure one 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.340
 I totally like magic when people 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.690
 marco amelia lands is so 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.500
 not nice but so boring turn 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:52.259
 fire mae need the timbre is 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:54.900
 perfectly okay if not hold 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:58.520
 he does not have to think then agro from therefore 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.229
 maybe it survived 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.820
 i have intentional aco I love it 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.479
 So I want to die 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.070
 does not work that I do 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.419
 think there is a lot more to it now 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.130
 actually not really to say 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.090
 we would have it in any case 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.220
 a bit chaotic 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.570
 there are many more now 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.099
 I did not say anything only at three or 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.900
 Four different I create have the 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.080
 I do not exactly look at it either 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.460
 honest to preview everything else 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.169
 keep exciting until you slide 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.509
 keep a little bit of west tension 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.639
 but what you look like there is there 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.380
 commercial and that should probably 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:39.750
 die relatively fast like that with about 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.099
 so that is the folk group heard 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.780
 to a boÃŸel namely a right 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.770
 did not know that it was a player dome 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.970
 is 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.449
 looks very strong or as watery as 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.809
 from somewhere mean you 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.759
 but it also has a line in it 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:06:00.210
 middle of the dome was this too 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:02.430
 Healer lady of the three and plain 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:08.490
 and gripping that this place lay 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:12.089
 Heal the old one the individual 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:15.870
 skills I have got myself we go 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:18.259
 always very very short notice to the 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.999
 post write in other less 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.710
 quite simple and also about 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:25.339
 not preloaded somehow hereby so 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.339
 quite know 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.710
 but I have something else in mine 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.710
 bucket full of excuses
