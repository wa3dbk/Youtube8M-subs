this video I'm gonna be showing you how
you<00:00:06.509> can<00:00:06.839> achieve<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.500> 3<00:00:07.859> by<00:00:08.069> 3<00:00:08.990> rib<00:00:10.910> stitch

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.040 

these<00:00:16.850> the<00:00:17.850> reason<00:00:18.000> why<00:00:18.240> I'm<00:00:18.390> covering<00:00:18.690> is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
these the reason why I'm covering is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.810 
these the reason why I'm covering is
because<00:00:19.470> from<00:00:20.250> here<00:00:20.750> to<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.859> 2x2<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
because from here to here is the 2x2 and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.400 
because from here to here is the 2x2 and
from<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.170> here<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:25.980> by<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:26.430> rib

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
from here to here is the one by one rib

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.759 
from here to here is the one by one rib
you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.130> difference<00:00:30.710> these<00:00:31.710> are

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
you can see the difference these are

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.610 
you can see the difference these are
closer<00:00:32.340> these<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> little<00:00:33.809> more<00:00:33.930> apart

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
closer these are a little more apart

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.450 
closer these are a little more apart
from<00:00:34.920> each<00:00:35.100> other

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
from each other

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:46.549 
from each other
and<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.809> even<00:00:37.140> more<00:00:38.329> apart<00:00:45.050> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.289> see

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
and this is even more apart you can see

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.639 
and this is even more apart you can see
in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> back<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.750> tell<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> difference

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
in the back you can tell the difference

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:59.330 
in the back you can tell the difference
this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> 3<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:51.270> 3<00:00:52.789> 2<00:00:53.789> by<00:00:53.820> 2<00:00:55.789> 3<00:00:56.789> by<00:00:57.000> 3<00:00:57.300> 3<00:00:57.390> by<00:00:57.899> 2<00:00:58.309> 1<00:00:59.309> by

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
this is 3 by 3 2 by 2 3 by 3 3 by 2 1 by

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.590 
this is 3 by 3 2 by 2 3 by 3 3 by 2 1 by
1<00:01:00.020> since<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.260> using<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.600> 20<00:01:04.159> casted<00:01:05.159> on

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
1 since I'm using the 20 casted on

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.940 
1 since I'm using the 20 casted on
stitches<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.020> had<00:01:07.290> from<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> beginning

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
stitches that I had from the beginning

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.749 
stitches that I had from the beginning
I'm<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.939> end<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:13.500> making<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:16.560> last<00:01:16.770> 2

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
I'm going to end up making the last 2

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.800 
I'm going to end up making the last 2
stitches<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:19.549> they<00:01:20.549> were<00:01:20.610> part<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.869> 3

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
stitches as if they were part of the 3

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.530 
stitches as if they were part of the 3
usually<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.229> cast<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.549> multiples<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:28.130> 6

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
usually you would cast on multiples of 6

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.840 
usually you would cast on multiples of 6
in<00:01:30.540> order<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.470> even<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.509> see<00:01:34.549> one<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
in order to get it even and see one of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.760 
in order to get it even and see one of
the<00:01:36.570> lines<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> rows<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.310> missing

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
the lines one of the rows is missing

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:51.100 
the lines one of the rows is missing
okay<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.369> let's<00:01:41.640> begin

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.030 

okay

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.460 

I'm<00:01:54.520> going<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:55.060> knit<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.840> first<00:01:56.080> three

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
I'm going to knit the first three

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:12.000 
I'm going to knit the first three
stitches<00:01:58.320> one

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.729 

two<00:02:14.430> three<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:16.629> am<00:02:16.810> knitting<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.590> the

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
two three and I am knitting in the

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.580 
two three and I am knitting in the
Eastern<00:02:18.159> European<00:02:18.819> method<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.629> that<00:02:20.409> is

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
Eastern European method and that is

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.509 
Eastern European method and that is
because<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:22.739> stitch<00:02:23.739> that's<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.340> needle

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
because the stitch that's on the needle

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.780 
because the stitch that's on the needle
the<00:02:25.180> loop<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.659> leaning<00:02:26.079> George<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.129> fact<00:02:27.430> when

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the loop is leaning George the fact when

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.220 
the loop is leaning George the fact when
it's<00:02:28.769> when<00:02:29.769> it's<00:02:29.920> time<00:02:30.129> to<00:02:30.159> knit<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:32.049> is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
it's when it's time to knit so this is

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.589 
it's when it's time to knit so this is
Pearl<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.890> it's<00:02:33.159> leaning<00:02:33.519> towards<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.269> front

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
Pearl and it's leaning towards the front

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.869 
Pearl and it's leaning towards the front
from<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.680> front<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:37.060> from<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.480> back<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.640> I'm

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
from the front not from the back so I'm

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:58.400 
from the front not from the back so I'm
going<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:44.220> purl<00:02:45.450> one<00:02:49.500> go<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:53.370> full<00:02:54.720> screen

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.020 

now<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.970> see<00:03:00.240> in<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:01.140> back<00:03:01.350> stitch<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
now you can see in the back stitch the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.860 
now you can see in the back stitch the
loop<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.630> leaning<00:03:04.170> towards<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> front<00:03:05.870> from

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
loop is leaning towards the front from

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
loop is leaning towards the front from
the<00:03:06.900> back<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.210> means<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:13.020> it's<00:03:13.410> it's

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
the back so that means that it's it's

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.420 
the back so that means that it's it's
easier<00:03:14.400> for<00:03:14.460> me<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:16.730> grab<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.970> loop<00:03:18.980> if<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.160> pick

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
easier for me to grab the loop if I pick

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:29.240 
easier for me to grab the loop if I pick
it<00:03:20.580> up<00:03:20.730> if<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.090> knit<00:03:21.330> from<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.810> back

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:38.820 

three<00:03:31.160> now

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:47.620 

now<00:03:39.430> I'm<00:03:39.790> going<00:03:40.180> to

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.890 

purl<00:03:48.350> one

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.640 

Pro<00:03:54.530> to

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:13.150 

pearl<00:04:00.280> three

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.270 

and<00:04:13.720> one

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.199 

so

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.640 

three

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.320 

/<00:04:27.810> lon

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.670 

for<00:04:36.000> sure

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.350 

pearl<00:04:42.419> free<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.940> remember<00:04:45.940> what<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.240> said

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
pearl free and remember what I said

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.710 
pearl free and remember what I said
about<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:47.080> last<00:04:47.259> two<00:04:47.620> stitches<00:04:48.000> this<00:04:49.000> is<00:04:49.060> this

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
about the last two stitches this is this

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.980 
about the last two stitches this is this
only<00:04:49.960> happen<00:04:50.470> because<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:51.160> cast<00:04:51.669> it<00:04:51.850> on<00:04:51.990> 20

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
only happen because I cast it on 20

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.200 
only happen because I cast it on 20
stitches<00:04:54.630> if<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:56.139> wanted<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.620> 3x3<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.610> be<00:04:57.729> even

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
stitches if I wanted the 3x3 to be even
