hi ichiba mrs. Kealey kinkier look even
if<00:00:03.949> done<00:00:04.190> just<00:00:04.970> got<00:00:05.120> a<00:00:05.149> little<00:00:05.330> quick<00:00:05.480> update

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
if done just got a little quick update

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.230 
if done just got a little quick update
with<00:00:06.529> my<00:00:07.210> 3116<00:00:08.210> RM<00:00:08.630> rear<00:00:08.900> motor<00:00:09.080> now<00:00:10.240> going

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
with my 3116 RM rear motor now going

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.119 
with my 3116 RM rear motor now going
into<00:00:11.360> rear-wheel<00:00:11.750> drive<00:00:11.780> so<00:00:12.469> it's<00:00:12.830> just<00:00:12.950> the

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:13.129 
into rear-wheel drive so it's just the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.640 
into rear-wheel drive so it's just the
rear<00:00:13.280> end<00:00:13.490> that's<00:00:13.610> driven<00:00:13.790> so<00:00:14.379> that's<00:00:15.379> where

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
rear end that's driven so that's where

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.370 
rear end that's driven so that's where
the<00:00:15.710> only<00:00:16.510> spool<00:00:17.510> is<00:00:17.689> there's<00:00:17.900> nothing<00:00:18.020> up<00:00:18.289> the

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
the only spool is there's nothing up the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.029 
the only spool is there's nothing up the
front<00:00:19.750> just<00:00:20.750> got<00:00:20.930> a<00:00:20.960> couple<00:00:21.080> of<00:00:21.260> months<00:00:21.500> so

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
front just got a couple of months so

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.460 
front just got a couple of months so
change<00:00:22.490> it<00:00:22.580> up<00:00:22.670> change<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.269> layout<00:00:23.470> so

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
change it up change the layout so

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.130 
change it up change the layout so
batteries<00:00:24.830> in<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.010> center<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:25.430> it's<00:00:25.580> um

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
batteries in the center so it's um

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.339 
batteries in the center so it's um
longitudinal<00:00:27.140> and<00:00:28.060> I've<00:00:29.060> got<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:29.720> server<00:00:30.050> up

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
longitudinal and I've got the server up

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.780 
longitudinal and I've got the server up
here<00:00:30.619> instead<00:00:30.920> of<00:00:30.980> it<00:00:31.340> being<00:00:31.400> here<00:00:33.220> just<00:00:34.220> doing

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
here instead of it being here just doing

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.760 
here instead of it being here just doing
a<00:00:35.000> quick<00:00:35.120> mod<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:35.510> haven't<00:00:36.020> really<00:00:36.440> worked<00:00:36.560> on

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
a quick mod I haven't really worked on

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.530 
a quick mod I haven't really worked on
it<00:00:36.890> in<00:00:37.010> a<00:00:37.130> while<00:00:37.250> but<00:00:37.460> I've<00:00:37.580> got<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.850> couple<00:00:38.420> of

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
it in a while but I've got a couple of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.480 
it in a while but I've got a couple of
servers<00:00:38.840> lying<00:00:39.050> right<00:00:39.200> now<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:40.310> thought

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
servers lying right now and I thought

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.460 
servers lying right now and I thought
I'd<00:00:40.670> probably<00:00:41.000> bring<00:00:41.240> it<00:00:41.390> up<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:41.900> here<00:00:42.290> we<00:00:42.350> go

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
I'd probably bring it up so here we go

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.560 
I'd probably bring it up so here we go
it's<00:00:43.780> okay<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.290> this<00:00:45.380> is<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.530> handbrake<00:00:45.890> and

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
it's okay so this is a handbrake and

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.620 
it's okay so this is a handbrake and
this<00:00:47.570> is<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:48.470> steering<00:00:49.400> wheel<00:00:49.460> I<00:00:49.850> haven't

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
this is a steering wheel I haven't

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.100 
this is a steering wheel I haven't
actually<00:00:50.720> got<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.110> UM<00:00:52.660> motor<00:00:53.660> hooked<00:00:53.900> up<00:00:54.020> to

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
actually got the UM motor hooked up to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.210 
actually got the UM motor hooked up to
the<00:00:54.200> wheels<00:00:54.350> because<00:00:54.560> I<00:00:54.740> need<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.010> buy<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.190> new

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
the wheels because I need to buy a new

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.990 
the wheels because I need to buy a new
shaft<00:00:55.520> which<00:00:55.790> recently<00:00:56.420> broke<00:00:57.130> but<00:00:58.130> um<00:00:58.280> idea

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
shaft which recently broke but um idea

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.420 
shaft which recently broke but um idea
is<00:00:59.180> that<00:00:59.420> when<00:01:00.200> you<00:01:00.320> punch<00:01:00.890> onto<00:01:01.130> the<00:01:01.220> brake

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
is that when you punch onto the brake

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.270 
is that when you punch onto the brake
the<00:01:02.150> handbrake<00:01:02.540> flips<00:01:02.720> up<00:01:02.900> and<00:01:03.140> just<00:01:03.950> acts<00:01:04.190> as

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
the handbrake flips up and just acts as

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:17.650 
the handbrake flips up and just acts as
a<00:01:04.370> handbrake<00:01:04.900> so<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:16.190> guess<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.360> like<00:01:17.600> a

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
a handbrake so so I guess it's like a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.720 
a handbrake so so I guess it's like a
handbrake<00:01:18.080> action<00:01:18.440> so<00:01:18.620> right<00:01:19.400> now<00:01:19.550> you're

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
handbrake action so right now you're

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.780 
handbrake action so right now you're
accelerating<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:20.450> mean<00:01:20.870> your<00:01:20.990> brake<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:22.580> apply

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
accelerating I mean your brake you apply

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.680 
accelerating I mean your brake you apply
the<00:01:22.850> handbrake<00:01:24.460> also<00:01:25.460> I've<00:01:25.580> got<00:01:25.790> I've<00:01:26.480> done

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
the handbrake also I've got I've done

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.790 
the handbrake also I've got I've done
the<00:01:26.810> steering<00:01:27.200> as<00:01:27.770> well<00:01:28.150> so<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.450> put<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.560> cores

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
the steering as well so I put the cores

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:41.630 
the steering as well so I put the cores
of<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:31.010> closer

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.469 

okay<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.939> whoops<00:01:45.090> also<00:01:46.090> worked<00:01:46.299> on<00:01:46.360> the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
okay and whoops also worked on the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.960 
okay and whoops also worked on the
steering<00:01:46.720> angle<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.500> okay<00:01:48.369> it's<00:01:48.460> not<00:01:48.580> exactly

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
steering angle so okay it's not exactly

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.029 
steering angle so okay it's not exactly
