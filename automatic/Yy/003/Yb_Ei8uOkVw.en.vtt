Royce<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.879> I<00:03:27.419> thought<00:03:27.569> it<00:03:27.690> might<00:03:27.810> be<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.959> little

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
Royce and I thought it might be a little

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.300 
Royce and I thought it might be a little
interesting<00:03:28.379> experiment<00:03:29.220> because

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
interesting experiment because

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.490 
interesting experiment because
everybody's<00:03:29.849> on<00:03:30.000> pretty<00:03:30.480> darn<00:03:30.720> good<00:03:30.870> chem<00:03:31.319> in

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
everybody's on pretty darn good chem in

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.990 
everybody's on pretty darn good chem in
this<00:03:31.620> formation<00:03:31.949> I<00:03:32.159> thought<00:03:32.370> please<00:03:32.669> please

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
this formation I thought please please

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.899

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.689 
please please please work like I'm
hoping<00:03:36.449> it<00:03:36.750> might<00:03:37.260> now<00:03:38.250> because<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:38.639> is

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
hoping it might now because this is

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.789 
hoping it might now because this is
somewhat<00:03:39.269> similar<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.959> for<00:03:40.139> 231<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.769> I

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
somewhat similar to that for 231 that I

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.920 
somewhat similar to that for 231 that I
live<00:03:40.980> come<00:03:41.159> up<00:03:41.280> against<00:03:41.489> false<00:03:41.730> nine<00:03:41.940> squad

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
live come up against false nine squad

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.809 
live come up against false nine squad
and<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.440> still<00:03:43.500> might<00:03:43.859> go<00:03:44.069> back<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.579> but

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
and I still might go back to that but

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.129 
and I still might go back to that but
one<00:03:45.060> thing's<00:03:45.269> for<00:03:45.329> certain<00:03:45.479> we're<00:03:45.780> gonna<00:03:45.959> need

breakup label um kind of got back and
that's<00:04:42.340> just<00:04:42.580> poor<00:04:42.760> defending<00:04:43.090> for<00:04:43.300> me<00:04:43.360> I

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
that's just poor defending for me I

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.760

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
chasing the run which is what I normally

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.830 
chasing the run which is what I normally
do<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.630> give<00:04:46.840> up<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:48.030> really<00:04:49.030> really<00:04:49.360> easy
