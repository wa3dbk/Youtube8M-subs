00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.479
 Hey guys! I'm in Asakusa today 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.228
 and I'm getting ready for the Sanja Festival 

00:00:13.632 --> 00:00:15.872
 and i have my festival attire here 

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:19.130
 These men are going to help me because I am not sure how to do it exactly 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.961
 So I thought I could show you 

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:23.632
 Because it's pretty cool, you don't often get the chance to wear this type of clothing 

00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:26.792
 So yeahhh! We start with the tabi 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.520
 My feet are very big so it is always difficult for me to put them on 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.930
 This is one they've already tied 

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:52.486
 It starts with just two such strings 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.730
 and you weave them through the holes 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.280
 and when you're done it will look like this! 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.680
 So this will go between your big toe 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.280
 Take these two strings 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.560
 and pull them through these loops 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.060
 Then you pull this string through here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.940
 Fasten it here 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.620
 Get it here for a moment 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.400
 Put it in line with your foot 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.160
 Like this 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.660
 Bring it up here 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.320
 and back on this side 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.860
 make sure it matches here 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.840
 with your heel 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.100
 Let's put yours on 

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:48.454
 My own are a little different than yours 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.560
 My own are made of plastic, yours are made of rope 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.820
 This is plastic? 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.760
 Place your foot here in the rear section 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.920
 Put the strings through this 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.560
 and then here 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.520
 Then they will remain closed! 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.740
 Then you can cut the remaining piece of rope with scissors 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.480
 Leave a little bit 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.500
 You can take them off in no time 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.900
 All done! 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.860
 These are fun 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.889
 They look great! 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.280
 I am so looking forward to it! 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.882
 It rained until about half an hour ago 

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:37.967
 We are so lucky that it just stopped! I think we're going to get fantastic weather 

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.068
 This is the second time I go to the Sanja Festival 

00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:42.876
 Last year I did not participate 

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:46.348
 So it is very nice to be part of it this year 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.400
 Excuse me 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.460
 Thank you! 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.740
 Ok guys, it's time for the gloves (jacket) 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.140
 and the obi (belt) 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.760
 They are going to attach this for me 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.200
 Left goes upstairs 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.720
 A little lower 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.480
 Too tight? 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.560
 No it's fine! 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.920
 Here you will find the names of different stores 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.580
 We have a kamameshi store, so it says "Asadori" 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.540
 Ok, here we are completely dressed in our festival clothing! 

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:00.969
 I would like to thank Yummy Japan very much 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.908
 for the invitation to attend the festival this year with them 

00:06:03.908 --> 00:06:05.588
 because I had a lot of fun! 

00:06:05.588 --> 00:06:08.314
 Don't forget to stay informed about my new video 

00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:11.673
 I will show you how cool the festival is 

00:06:11.673 --> 00:06:14.100
 It is quite intensive 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.422
 and I look forward to sharing it with you! 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.680
 Thank you for looking and see you again soon! Bye!
