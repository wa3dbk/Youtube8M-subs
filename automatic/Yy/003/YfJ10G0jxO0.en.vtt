00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 often young people who spend their 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.609
 days behind a screen to goinfrer 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.529
 cod I had legs so 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.400
 watch other people finally play 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.400
 really nothing 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.590
 we learned this week that the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.660
 library of the console or there passed 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.820
 the cap of the 1000 games available and 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.860
 also that more than 5000 game was on the ground 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.840
 2 on steam you do not see the report 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.759
 and bring them a fifth 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.770
 impressive fall sales have 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.750
 started well since November 26 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.940
 on the valve platform and get 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.010
 extends until December 2 sales 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.450
 which is called exploration a name 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.770
 which is not insignificant and which makes 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.480
 reference to clashes as you go 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.489
 go to explore the game pages 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.379
 these balances are actually a 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.420
 real life size test for 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.100
 steam following its update discovery 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.839
 arrived late September this update 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.819
 had seen the arrival of a new page 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.199
 always putting in place 

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:59.719
 before personalized recommendations 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.789
 and of course the controversial arrival of 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.620
 curators these massive balances and the 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.840
 sales that will generate will allow 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.190
 at steam to evaluate discreetly the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.409
 breakdown of sales and deduce 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.479
 so the true influence of the curators 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.920
 but also the true relevance or not of 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.840
 his model of recommendation or 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.400
 automatic that created it is time 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.900
 of truth also for the little ones 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.910
 india developers and in need of 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.410
 visibility who will discover if their 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.020
 fears about this update 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.580
 was founded why am I 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.020
 closes in time with a branquignol in 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.750
 your kind then I could do 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.310
 much richer things that is 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.860
 like storing my socks for example 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.810
 there for some time out guard 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.610
 simulator a game that looked more like 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.290
 a joke because a real video game 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.820
 but since what differentiates the true 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.740
 joke game it's his success 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.540
 of audience then god simulator had the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.760
 right to this recognition and is going to 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.770
 see enriching with a dlc to transform 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.600
 the years gameplay and my words born next to 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.370
 this kind of light game based on the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.110
 charisma idea breaks there are games 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.700
 to heavier subjects and that would deserve 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.530
 just as much visibility 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.550
 this is the case of this war of mind release 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.170
 November 14 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.760
 this war of mind is still a game of 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.340
 war but this one has the particularity 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.050
 to place you on the other side of the mirror 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.090
 you play not one of his soldiers 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.470
 overtrained but manage civilians in 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.479
 a 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.670
 ravaged by the war that is trying to 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.320
 survive somehow just like tp 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.550
 times the interest of the game lies in 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.290
 the choices he will ask you to 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.700
 make choices that will require you 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.920
 sometimes to close your eyes to your 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.390
 moral and giving a dimension 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.770
 deep in title remember that this game has 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.040
 scored a very honorable score 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.080
 of 83 on metacritic either six points of 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.480
 more than the pc version of another game of 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.130
 war came out on the same period that I 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.620
 will not name but I'm just talking about 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.620
 after the Russian Mafia 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.770
 it's official the last call of duty 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.390
 will finally have the right to zombies and 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.860
 it will be in January 2015 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.900
 and I must confess that it is 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.130
 pleasure because the extraterrestrials of kid 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.840
 we did not want it at the level of 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.370
 zombies yes because for the call of 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.380
 it's not worth giving you trouble 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.360
 to write a script and to solicit 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.130
 actors we are we simple people 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.870
 the story of an edgy horde of guys 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.220
 who want us badly enough we are enough to 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.080
 have a great time 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.970
 I'm in favor of a zombie mode in 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.040
 stand alone you will see a day without 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.390
 having to do that will happen the new mode 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.160
 zombie for waiting to see do 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.260
 will propose much more responsive zombies 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.269
 able to hopping using their 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.860
 exoskeleton capable of driving 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.780
 helicopters using their phone 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.280
 portable to take control of the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.790
 white house and carry a policy 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:46.330
 neo zombies conservative and the king of 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:49.390
 so there is a lot of mea culpa 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.560
 moment the studio 343 industries apologizes 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.750
 for the matchmaking problem 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.580
 met by halo the master chief 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.890
 collection the fact that this problem 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.840
 coming from the matchmaking was not trivial 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.209
 since this was the first argument of the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.160
 compilation the promise of being able to 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.650
 find on any maps of 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.510
 the halo series in one match making the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.549
 studio whip itself in a 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.569
 open letter saying do not have 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.069
 proposed the experience you deserve 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.109
 remains that with the impressive number 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.209
 of cards that this compilation resumes 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.900
 the studio offers us a nice job of 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.750
 renovation 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.759
 finally offers us sells and then there 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.350
 obviously ubisoft apologizes to 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.479
 about assassin's creed and for that 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.340
 do it offer a dlc but we do not know 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.750
 not exactly what he apologizes to him 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.539
 so it makes everyone uncomfortable 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.130
 apologize for dlc apologize for bugs to 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.110
 the outlet apologize for buying the 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.880
 youtube hours ah yes ok well 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.160
 apologize for being the leader of the 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.690
 disguised advertising on youtube has and that 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.900
 it's beautiful to the classies it's all about 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.060
 your honor excuses accepted 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.800
 and then there is the ps vita that comes from 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.930
 to be pinned for advertising 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.849
 lies in the United States in question 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.160
 launching commercials only to 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.169
 the sony era was packed and had 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.210
 sold among others stream capacity 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.889
 and its ps3 games like the wiiu 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.930
 with his meal tray thing that 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.680
 finally only the ps4 managed to do 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.300
 no excuses 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.039
 here if not the obligation to 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.500
 compensate the complainants a little 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.050
 bought the console between February and June 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.610
 2012 justice will now be able to 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.830
 look at the case of the wiiu 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.389
 yes because it's not normal we 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.389
 had sold me drawings on link
