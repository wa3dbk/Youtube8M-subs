00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.099
 Only the best online games of 2015 by 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.019
 genres come in and choose 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.030
 almost all browser strategies 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.100
 use the same idea 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 arranging your own village 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.930
 and turning into a prosperous town 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.570
 they differ only in the approach to detail and 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.640
 visual execution 1 medieval 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 online game tribal pile was pretty 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.449
 successful campaign to games did not 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 reinvent the wheel 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.649
 but just took a clear comfortable 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.070
 proven model with its pluses and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.320
 minuses and created a tribal wars 2 what 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.149
 second war does not give the tribes genre 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.250
 something new in any case not 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.770
 makes the game bad rather the opposite 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.910
 the main thing is not fucking up and what is good 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.940
 works first positive point in 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 this strategy is the ease of learning 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.449
 if almost every game is given 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.820
 the genre at the very beginning scares the player 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.350
 long introduction and tons of text here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.960
 the player is quickly shown and told 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.049
 all you need to know for the arrangement and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.390
 protect their land and then leaves 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.000
 alone with the second positive 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.920
 moment beautiful visual style 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 picture though done in low 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.330
 resolution but everything looks very 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.640
 beautiful every building in detail 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.130
 traced and when improving it changes its 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.320
 view even the initial shed traced 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.909
 extremely detailed if you play 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.340
 some time the village 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.500
 turns into a real castle around 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.869
 which are forests and mountains and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.790
 zooming in and bringing the camera closer to 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.700
 anything can be seen as on 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.590
 clay career workers are working 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.750
 the carpenter drank the boards in his sawmill on 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.070
 market traders vparivayut something customers 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.909
 and warriors train near the barracks 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.010
 the gameplay itself is divided into two parts 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.110
 development of its own fortress and the war for 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.070
 territory in the first case all 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.110
 standard 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.630
 There are five types of resources that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.940
 required for everything for construction and 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.340
 improve buildings for training troops 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.009
 hiring heroes in general for all 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.200
 as for the military unit, everything is here 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.660
 depends on the size of the army because 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.030
 fight must constantly attack 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.220
 robbers to the villages to seize 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.010
 enemy territories and defend their 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.440
 land and stuff like that if the screen 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.780
 the castle shows only the castle and everything is there 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.330
 your then switching to global 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.850
 the card becomes clear that your 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.600
 possession is just a drop in the sea of ​​the same 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.790
 fortresses 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.370
 whose owners are the same 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.920
 players and goals they have the same evolve 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.720
 and capture anything and everything of course 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.790
 interaction with other players on 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.680
 This does not end as you can 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.870
 only fight with them but unite 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.670
 tribes for which to unite and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.950
 I think it is not necessary to explain, and so it is clear 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.799
 that for the destruction of the tribes at least 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.720
 to capture their land tribal wars 2 you can 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.850
 play alone but initially the game 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.760
 created taking into account the fact that the players 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.170
 will play captive teams and will provide 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.750
 not only economic military 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.180
 support but also protect against more developed 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.519
 players will also help to better learn the game 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.980
 tribes this fundamental part of the game 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.530
 everyone who enters can get where 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.959
 more experience than playing alone 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.410
 highly recommended to join 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.480
 tribes 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.690
 they play alone just easier and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.220
 more fun 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.530
 many say that this type of strategy 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.720
 tedious because any action takes 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.760
 a few minutes or even hours and therefore 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.790
 not fun to play for those who so 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.590
 thinks now a small digression 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.510
 imagine what would happen to the third and yes 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.530
 in general with any heroes if you remove 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.379
 step by step 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.180
 that's what chaos would be and now let's take 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.239
 a card which is many times larger than 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.069
 heroes and do all the actions almost 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.840
 instant thought I think it is clear but 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.790
 if someone still lacks 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.980
 speeds just grab 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.769
 several fortresses and engage at once 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.769
 all at this moment it will become clear 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.930
 all the advantages of a time system even 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.510
 more will be all very fast and difficult 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.239
 will be uglyadet everything but enough 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.670
 reflections just summarize the tribal 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.540
 nap two looks pretty good for 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.790
 its genre 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.459
 gameplay standard but but with 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.829
 Donat has its own characteristics 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.620
 it only affects the speed of development and 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.109
 does not give anything that you can not get 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.330
 on their own since the game browser on the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.130
 it is clear that you can play it right in 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.940
 real time browser vs 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.789
 other players 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.650
 also released a mobile app to play 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.330
 possible on smartphones and tablets 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.940
 for fans of such entertainment 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.620
 who are already quite a lot of tribal 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.620
 Pile two is what you need
