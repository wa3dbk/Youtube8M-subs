00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 city â€‹â€‹youth competitions 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 robotics held in Novosibirsk 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.620
 yet only the second time 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.420
 however, the activity of which increases 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.179
 the number of young people participating in them 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.670
 people are surprised and pleased by the organizers in 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.830
 last year there were about 50 people 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.869
 now the number of people willing to show their 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.769
 advances in creating robots has increased 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.800
 more than 4 times in principle we were 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.660
 ready for what 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.810
 kids will want to take stock 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.079
 outgoing calendar year but such 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.260
 scope of participants and such activity we 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.649
 didn't expect it was very nice and it was 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.379
 nice to see new faces new training 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.469
 establishments that we have not yet met on 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.860
 territories and person and other institutions 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.219
 where they held similar events 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.180
 for example it is 54 school for example stage 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.590
 university with its new team and 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.379
 many other family including 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.570
 the teams that appeared I understand 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.640
 only against the background of the interests of parents and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 children to this wonderful 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.659
 did this first shift some exactly 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 my children are involved in what they are 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.270
 competition of course passion desire 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.460
 defeat they turn on some here 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.450
 such aspirations and desires to win 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.240
 the brain begins to work hard and well 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.280
 this motivation on helps to assimilate 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.440
 knowledge in the future then there are some 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 new methods new algorithm and learn 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.619
 something else to repay again among 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.869
 newbies 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.880
 stand out those who rightly consider 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.500
 themselves veterans because they already had 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.420
 compete and more than once 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.640
 it was necessary even in a few but even 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 larger than well than this 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.179
 the competition well the first one was inter and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.970
 themselves ranked first the second was 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.770
 competition 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.170
 Well, I do not remember this, too, winter youth 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.700
 competitions were in the summer ranked third 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.619
 place where they were not competitions we 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 ranked first 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.940
 perseverance is needed so what is all this 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.040
 debug but this with one try not 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.380
 you have to make some effort 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.370
 so that everything worked out and preferably on 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.250
 good result 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.900
 when you program 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.350
 the first time does not always work 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.820
 because it's one thing to write a program 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.810
 so every other thing is already to have it all 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.170
 drove well that is from the finished program 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.300
 it is necessary to draw out what is already on will still 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.530
 better assessment 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.209
 successful competition 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.200
 robotics determines the set 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.730
 components 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.620
 this and the activities of the organizers 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.910
 competitions and selection of participants and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.400
 motivation and level of training 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.680
 participants and finally technical 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.780
 provision and financing for 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.750
 to be a sponsor is necessary well 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.520
 work need to make money then 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.140
 you can support these 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.180
 competitions can support children 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.910
 I just can say about the prizes 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.120
 prizes and well more than a hundred thousand rubles we 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.770
 provide this 4 prizes 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.180
 inside the prize and one gift lyceum 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:11.150
 organizer here before that her 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.040
 further they had an incentive to take 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.380
 similar competitions 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.140
 even adults take care of adults too 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.970
 competitive moment 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.250
 more interesting to them is whose robot 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.530
 still better or cooler as they say 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.700
 only about will win here we are honest 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.379
 classes he sit there 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.260
 here they are 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.959
 created a robot and let me first not 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.420
 understood what they want they did such 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.720
 the model is on a little light but on extremely 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.450
 measure on 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.799
 yesterday all robots that are used 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:48.099
 beat beat but they decided more 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.879
 and refine got a reverse 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:54.159
 the result gave you I did not come cold 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.799
 if the program did it she you 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.110
 satisfies doing robots ok 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.510
 but do not bring it to perfection 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.730
 there may be a reverse situation with 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.959
 time immemorial the school began with 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.049
 learning the alphabet 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.750
 alphabet form and it was pointless to start 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.560
 study of mathematics and science 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.569
 history and other sciences 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.389
 not having learned in practice to make up 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.250
 letters words and phrases in their native language 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:21.130
 Something is taking place here today in this room 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.780
 similar children learn the alphabet of the engineer 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.120
 the details of which and stands 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.889
 robotic designer lego give 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.039
 opportunity to develop technical 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.039
 literacy
