car<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.390> we're<00:01:40.170> still<00:01:40.350> working<00:01:40.470> on

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
car and it just we're still working on

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
car and it just we're still working on
the<00:01:40.770> tune<00:01:40.950> because<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.280> only<00:01:41.400> got<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.579> couple

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the tune because if we only got a couple

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.819 
the tune because if we only got a couple
miles<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.930> interior<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.350> meant<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
miles on it but the interior is meant to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.130 
miles on it but the interior is meant to
do<00:01:43.979> long-haul<00:01:44.670> cruising<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:45.869> once<00:01:46.049> I

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
really like the way you integrated the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.910 
really like the way you integrated the
new<00:02:05.399> technology<00:02:06.180> under<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> hood<00:02:06.770> again<00:02:07.770> it's

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
new technology under the hood again it's

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.680 
new technology under the hood again it's
very<00:02:08.129> clean<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.700> looks<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:08.910> General

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
very clean but it looks like General

very clean but it looks like General
Motors<00:02:09.720> put<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.200> motor<00:02:10.440> in

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
Motors put this motor in

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.380 
Motors put this motor in
well<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.349> was<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:12.610> intended<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.090> do<00:02:13.239> that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
the industrial look and we could have

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.559 
the industrial look and we could have
made<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.400> really<00:02:18.519> bling<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.090> done<00:02:19.329> all<00:02:19.450> the
