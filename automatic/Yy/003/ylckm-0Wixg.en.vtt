00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
continue with its growth it's not really

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.979

well<00:04:10.500> we're<00:04:10.590> already<00:04:10.709> 80<00:04:10.980> percent<00:04:11.370> we've

well we're already 80 percent we've
already<00:04:11.640> committed<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.299> 80<00:04:12.390> percent<00:04:12.780> cut

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
cuts we're being told by that committee

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.710 
cuts we're being told by that committee
that<00:04:30.979> basically<00:04:31.979> back<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.400> their<00:04:32.550> 2005<00:04:33.479> levels

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
that basically back to their 2005 levels

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.170 
that basically back to their 2005 levels
by<00:04:34.020> 2050<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.280> be<00:04:35.430> achieved<00:04:35.760> with<00:04:35.970> with

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
by 2050 can that be achieved with with

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.550 
by 2050 can that be achieved with with
the<00:04:36.270> growth<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:36.720> we<00:04:36.810> see<00:04:37.050> well<00:04:37.470> the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
the growth that we see well the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.890 
the growth that we see well the
stainable<00:04:38.370> aviation<00:04:38.880> commission<00:04:39.450> basically

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
stainable aviation commission basically

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.719 
stainable aviation commission basically
and<00:04:40.169> it's<00:04:40.260> an<00:04:40.350> aviation<00:04:40.770> lobby<00:04:40.979> which<00:04:41.610> is

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
and it's an aviation lobby which is

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.370 
and it's an aviation lobby which is
actually<00:04:42.000> saying<00:04:42.180> we<00:04:42.330> can<00:04:42.539> do<00:04:42.660> this<00:04:42.810> we've<00:04:43.139> got

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
actually saying we can do this we've got

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.379 
actually saying we can do this we've got
to<00:04:43.500> do<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.710> is<00:04:44.010> already<00:04:44.400> targeting<00:04:44.820> 2000

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
to do this is already targeting 2000

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.870 
to do this is already targeting 2000
levels<00:04:45.630> rather<00:04:46.080> than<00:04:46.260> 2005<00:04:47.039> levels<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:47.580> as<00:04:47.700> we

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
levels rather than 2005 levels so as we

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.000 
levels rather than 2005 levels so as we
grow<00:04:48.180> we<00:04:48.570> want<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.810> produce<00:04:48.960> less<00:04:49.320> atmospheric

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
grow we want to produce less atmospheric

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.379 
grow we want to produce less atmospheric
pollution<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.610> that's<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.060> think<00:04:51.180> it

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
pollution and that's I think it

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.090 
pollution and that's I think it
achievable<00:04:51.630> we've<00:04:52.110> seen<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.470> gold<00:04:52.650> standard

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
achievable we've seen the gold standard

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.040 
achievable we've seen the gold standard
today<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.520> new<00:04:53.639> gold<00:04:53.850> standard<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.389> a380<00:04:54.810> and

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
today the new gold standard the a380 and

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.990 
today the new gold standard the a380 and
that's<00:04:55.440> set<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.680> new<00:04:55.800> benchmark<00:04:55.979> briefly<00:04:56.610> can

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
that's set the new benchmark briefly can

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000 
that's set the new benchmark briefly can
we<00:04:57.120> see<00:04:57.300> more<00:04:57.479> a380s<00:04:58.020> coming<00:04:58.410> in<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:58.650> certainly

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
we see more a380s coming in it certainly

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.100 
we see more a380s coming in it certainly
