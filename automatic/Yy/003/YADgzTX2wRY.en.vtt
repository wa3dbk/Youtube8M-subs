 approximately 40 45 pesos each 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:13.650
 each one so here they have a 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.879
 little bit more gain 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.480
 because its separator that does not serve more than

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.220
 well there in battles that do not 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.930

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.650
 letters or the rarity of his letters but 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.799
 also of strategy a type of chess 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.140
 mixed with a card game also 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.269
 let's have another card game 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.890

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.090
