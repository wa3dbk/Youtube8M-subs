00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
double wheels now let's get started

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.150 
double wheels now let's get started
the<00:00:45.180> first<00:00:45.420> thing<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.890> lift

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the first thing you want to do is lift

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
the first thing you want to do is lift
your<00:00:47.370> train<00:00:47.610> cars<00:00:47.879> into<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.239> air<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.660> freeze

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
your train cars into the air and freeze

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.990 
your train cars into the air and freeze
them<00:00:50.690> next<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.230> axis<00:00:52.739> constraint<00:00:53.280> with

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
them next get your axis constraint with

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
them next get your axis constraint with
friction<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.629> zero<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.230> settings<00:00:55.920> at<00:00:56.129> zero

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
friction of zero all settings at zero

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.299 
friction of zero all settings at zero
and<00:00:58.010> for<00:00:59.010> each<00:00:59.160> wheel<00:00:59.460> base<00:01:00.980> shoot<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
and for each wheel base shoot it in the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.719 
and for each wheel base shoot it in the
middle<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.320> for<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.739> well<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
middle and for this one well put it

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.460 
middle and for this one well put it
somewhere<00:01:05.970> around<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.840> front<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> Train

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
somewhere around the front of the Train

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.350 
somewhere around the front of the Train
about<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:09.439> take<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.470> next<00:01:10.830> wheels<00:01:11.130> base<00:01:12.740> in

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
about here take your next wheels base in

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.340 
about here take your next wheels base in
middle<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:17.159> then<00:01:17.670> hid<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.330> somewhere<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
middle and then hid it somewhere in the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.969 
middle and then hid it somewhere in the
back<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> train<00:01:20.159> car<00:01:20.400> about<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:23.540> repeat

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
back of the train car about there repeat

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:41.860 
back of the train car about there repeat
for<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.009> second<00:01:26.430> train<00:01:26.610> car

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.670 

okay<00:01:42.870> good

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
okay good

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.050 
okay good
next<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.570> access<00:01:46.020> constraint<00:01:46.560> again

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
next get your access constraint again

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.520 
next get your access constraint again
but<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.300> time<00:01:48.360> set<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.500> friction<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.160> ten

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
but this time set your friction to ten

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.140 
but this time set your friction to ten
this<00:01:52.530> helps<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.010> will<00:01:53.280> stay<00:01:53.550> on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> rails<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
this helps the will stay on the rails a

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.880 
this helps the will stay on the rails a
little<00:01:54.180> better<00:01:54.620> especially<00:01:55.620> at<00:01:55.710> high<00:01:55.860> speed

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
little better especially at high speed

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.940 
little better especially at high speed
hit<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.190> middle<00:02:00.440> then<00:02:01.440> you'll<00:02:01.590> notice

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
hit it in the middle then you'll notice

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.910 
hit it in the middle then you'll notice
that<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.820> each<00:02:03.000> wheel<00:02:03.300> space<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:04.530> are<00:02:04.710> two

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
that in each wheel space there are two

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.920 
that in each wheel space there are two
contacts<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.800> two<00:02:07.800> over<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.720> you'll<00:02:09.720> want

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
contacts and two over here you'll want

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.360 
contacts and two over here you'll want
to<00:02:10.110> mount<00:02:10.290> your<00:02:10.440> wheels<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.220> bottom

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
to mount your wheels on the bottom

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.110 
to mount your wheels on the bottom
contact<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.330> each<00:02:12.540> wheel<00:02:12.780> space<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:14.120> then

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
contact of each wheel space and then

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.260 
contact of each wheel space and then
repeat<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.870> process<00:02:16.520> for<00:02:17.520> every<00:02:17.820> wheel<00:02:18.000> in

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
repeat that process for every wheel in

the<00:04:14.440> tracks<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:15.810> did<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.840> bad<00:04:17.080> job<00:04:17.109> with<00:04:17.560> that

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
the tracks I did a bad job with that

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.220 
the tracks I did a bad job with that
front<00:04:18.010> wheel<00:04:18.220> space<00:04:18.489> it's<00:04:18.730> quite<00:04:18.970> uneven<00:04:19.299> but

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
front wheel space it's quite uneven but

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.440 
front wheel space it's quite uneven but
that's<00:04:20.440> okay<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.880> we're<00:04:22.000> going<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.180> freeze

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
that's okay so we're going to freeze

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.530 
that's okay so we're going to freeze
that<00:04:22.720> one<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:23.170> then<00:04:23.290> just<00:04:24.120> put<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.360> over

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
that one and then just put that over

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.860 
that one and then just put that over
there<00:04:26.140> and<00:04:27.010> freeze<00:04:27.490> that<00:04:27.790> good<00:04:28.270> now<00:04:28.510> on<00:04:28.720> the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
there and freeze that good now on the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.340 
there and freeze that good now on the
tracks<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:30.370> I'm<00:04:30.460> going<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.640> freeze<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.150> one

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
tracks so I'm going to freeze that one

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:40.800 
tracks so I'm going to freeze that one
and<00:04:33.180> do<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.300> same<00:04:34.480> thing<00:04:34.840> for<00:04:35.260> this<00:04:35.380> one<00:04:39.810> late

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
and do the same thing for this one late

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.830 
and do the same thing for this one late
on<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> tracks<00:04:43.320> like<00:04:44.320> so<00:04:45.360> again<00:04:46.360> we'll<00:04:46.570> freeze

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
on the tracks like so again we'll freeze

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.140 
on the tracks like so again we'll freeze
that<00:04:47.050> one<00:04:47.350> and<00:04:47.620> fix<00:04:47.920> that<00:04:49.470> unfreeze<00:04:50.470> it

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
that one and fix that unfreeze it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:02.379 
that one and fix that unfreeze it
still<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.139> off

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.170 

there<00:05:03.389> we<00:05:03.509> go<00:05:03.660> that's<00:05:04.020> better<00:05:04.699> now<00:05:05.699> I'm<00:05:05.880> going

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
there we go that's better now I'm going

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.159 
there we go that's better now I'm going
to<00:05:06.360> do<00:05:06.509> is<00:05:07.080> take<00:05:07.410> this<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:08.150> drag<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:09.180> over<00:05:09.419> here

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
to do is take this and drag it over here

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.990 
to do is take this and drag it over here
just<00:05:10.380> like<00:05:10.530> that<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:12.139> freeze<00:05:13.139> that<00:05:13.410> in<00:05:13.590> place

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
just like that and freeze that in place

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.309 
just like that and freeze that in place
we've<00:05:15.000> got<00:05:15.240> a<00:05:15.270> good<00:05:15.479> amount<00:05:15.690> of<00:05:15.810> space<00:05:15.960> in

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
we've got a good amount of space in

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.290 
we've got a good amount of space in
between<00:05:16.349> here<00:05:16.949> so<00:05:17.300> what<00:05:18.300> we<00:05:18.419> want<00:05:18.599> to<00:05:18.750> do<00:05:18.949> is

between here so what we want to do is

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.930 
between here so what we want to do is
get<00:05:21.300> our<00:05:21.539> ball<00:05:22.380> socket<00:05:22.919> constraint<00:05:23.460> which<00:05:23.729> is

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
get our ball socket constraint which is

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.610 
get our ball socket constraint which is
right<00:05:24.120> below<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.509> axis<00:05:24.690> constraint<00:05:25.470> all

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620
