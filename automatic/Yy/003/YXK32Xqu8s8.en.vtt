on the deluge itself

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.820 
on the deluge itself
there's<00:00:29.970> forward<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.660> reverse<00:00:30.900> controls<00:00:31.500> on

there's forward and reverse controls on
this<00:00:31.980> wireless<00:00:32.520> remote<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.090> then<00:00:33.750> there's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
this wireless remote and then there's

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479 
this wireless remote and then there's
auger<00:00:34.200> direction<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.100> interesting<00:00:35.250> they

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
auger direction it's interesting they

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
auger direction it's interesting they
call<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.820> an<00:00:35.969> auger<00:00:36.210> which<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> kind<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
call this an auger which is the kind of

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.799 
call this an auger which is the kind of
drill<00:00:37.500> bit<00:00:37.739> basically<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.809> essentially

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
drill bit basically so it's essentially

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.270 
drill bit basically so it's essentially
drilling<00:00:40.230> its<00:00:40.350> way<00:00:40.500> through<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> gutter<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
drilling its way through the gutter I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.360 
drilling its way through the gutter I
was<00:00:42.149> excited<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> use<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.200> found<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:44.040> that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
was excited to use it and found out that

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.299 
was excited to use it and found out that
the<00:00:44.879> luge<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.510> actually<00:00:46.110> too<00:00:46.469> high<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> fit

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the luge was actually too high to fit

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
the luge was actually too high to fit
underneath<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.690> supports<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.920> gutter

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
underneath the supports for the gutter

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
underneath the supports for the gutter
so<00:00:50.460> very<00:00:50.670> important<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.510> download<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so very important that you download and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.220 
so very important that you download and
test<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.430> gutters<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.270> template

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
test your gutters with this template

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
test your gutters with this template
before<00:00:55.520> purchasing<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> other

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
before purchasing it you on the other

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.150 
before purchasing it you on the other
hand<00:00:57.719> had<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> great<00:00:58.109> time<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.739> had<00:00:59.039> an

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
hand had a great time with it I had an

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.740 
hand had a great time with it I had an
absolute<00:00:59.550> blast<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.180> learned<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.570> few

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
absolute blast but I learned a few

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
absolute blast but I learned a few
things<00:01:00.809> while<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.500> using<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
things while I was using it you have to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.539 
things while I was using it you have to
make<00:01:02.879> sure<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.320> auger<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> flipper

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
make sure that the auger and the flipper

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.950 
make sure that the auger and the flipper
and<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.939> whiskery<00:01:06.360> things<00:01:06.720> are

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and the little whiskery things are

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.469 
and the little whiskery things are
flinging<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> sludge<00:01:08.010> over<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> gutter<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
flinging the sludge over the gutter and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.210 
flinging the sludge over the gutter and
not<00:01:09.750> onto<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> roots<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.830> other<00:01:10.950> thing<00:01:11.189> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
not onto the roots the other thing that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.060 
not onto the roots the other thing that
I<00:01:11.369> learned<00:01:11.610> while<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.000> using<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:13.070> you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
I learned while I was using this is you

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.190 
I learned while I was using this is you
position<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:14.820> ladder<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.750> corners

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
position your ladder on the corners

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
position your ladder on the corners
because<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.830> only<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> retrieve<00:01:17.700> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
because you only have to retrieve this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.880 
because you only have to retrieve this
it<00:01:18.060> has<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> forward<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.840> back<00:01:19.110> motion<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it has a forward and back motion the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.660 
it has a forward and back motion the
other<00:01:20.009> thing<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.189> thought<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.460> interesting

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
other thing I thought was interesting

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
other thing I thought was interesting
functionally<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> will<00:01:22.439> pulverize

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
functionally is that it will pulverize

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
functionally is that it will pulverize
dry<00:01:23.400> leaves<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> gutter<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.930> not

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
dry leaves in the gutter so it's not

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.080 
dry leaves in the gutter so it's not
actually<00:01:25.470> physically<00:01:25.830> removing<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
actually physically removing all of the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.350 
actually physically removing all of the
debris<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.600> actually<00:01:27.960> breaking<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.380> down<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
debris but actually breaking it down to

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.429 
debris but actually breaking it down to
pieces<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.570> will<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.960> washed<00:01:31.170> down<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
pieces that will get washed down the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.770 
pieces that will get washed down the
gutter<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.670> next<00:01:32.880> rain<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.600> is

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
gutter with the next rain it is

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.710 
gutter with the next rain it is
waterproof<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.799> actually<00:01:35.420> run<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
waterproof and you can actually run a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.039 
waterproof and you can actually run a
hose<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> helps<00:01:39.000> runs<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.509> recharge<00:01:39.869> blow

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
hose and it helps runs on recharge blow

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
hose and it helps runs on recharge blow
batteries<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.340> charge<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> overnight

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
batteries you know charge it overnight

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.539 
batteries you know charge it overnight
it<00:01:42.450> probably<00:01:42.720> cuts<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.350> needed<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
it probably cuts the time needed for the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.330 
it probably cuts the time needed for the
job<00:01:44.930> down<00:01:45.930> by<00:01:46.229> 75%

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
job down by 75%

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.370 
job down by 75%
I'd<00:01:47.399> agree<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:48.840> fun<00:01:49.079> this

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I'd agree with you and it's fun this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.230 
I'd agree with you and it's fun this
