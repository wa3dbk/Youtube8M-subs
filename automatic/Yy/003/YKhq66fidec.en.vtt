guy<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.750> them<00:01:00.870> he's<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.590> damn

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
guy is one of them he's just so damn

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.920 
guy is one of them he's just so damn
strong<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> he's<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:03.180> fast<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> same

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
strong and he's very fast at the same

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500 
strong and he's very fast at the same
time<00:01:04.260> he<00:01:04.409> feels<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.830> way<00:01:05.100> out<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:06.090> lot<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
time he feels like way out but a lot of

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.390 
time he feels like way out but a lot of
force<00:01:06.810> not<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> lot<00:01:07.350> faster<00:01:07.680> he<00:01:07.770> feels<00:01:08.010> stronger

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
force not a lot faster he feels stronger

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
force not a lot faster he feels stronger
than<00:01:08.520> where<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.970> my<00:01:09.119> opinion<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.689> his

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
than where in my opinion and his

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
than where in my opinion and his
aggression<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.369> helps<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
aggression really helps because the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.990 
aggression really helps because the
shooting<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.780> devastating<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.799> well<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.430> when

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
shooting is devastating as well so when

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.670 
shooting is devastating as well so when
defenders<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.659> trying<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.170> off<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> ball

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
defenders are trying to get off the ball

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320 
defenders are trying to get off the ball
and<00:01:16.830> he's<00:01:17.220> under<00:01:17.549> pressure<00:01:17.580> he<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.180> unleash

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and he's under pressure he will unleash

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.060 
and he's under pressure he will unleash
a<00:01:18.630> shine<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.170> most<00:01:19.350> likely<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.890> in

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
a shine they will most likely to go in

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.679 
a shine they will most likely to go in
you<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> couple<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.119> times<00:01:21.330> where<00:01:21.509> he's

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
you see a couple of times where he's

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
you see a couple of times where he's
under<00:01:21.930> pressure<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.439> video<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> he<00:01:23.340> was

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
under pressure in this video and he was

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.789 
under pressure in this video and he was
still<00:01:23.670> score<00:01:24.000> goes<00:01:24.240> even<00:01:24.630> against<00:01:25.170> noia<00:01:25.409> so

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
still score goes even against noia so

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.770 
still score goes even against noia so
really<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> best<00:01:27.150> keepers<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
really one of the best keepers in this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
really one of the best keepers in this
