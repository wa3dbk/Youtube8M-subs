00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
okay this is my football gate tutorial

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.269 
okay this is my football gate tutorial
it's<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.080> second<00:00:04.440> version<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.830> made<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.130> first

know so I'm remaking it now no I got a
new<00:00:12.389> mic<00:00:13.009> so<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.219> game<00:00:14.340> we're<00:00:14.460> going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> be

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
new mic so the game we're going to be

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.019 
new mic so the game we're going to be
looking<00:00:14.910> at<00:00:15.179> these<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.690> wire<00:00:16.760> that's<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
looking at these in a wire that's on the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.480 
looking at these in a wire that's on the
gate<00:00:18.330> memory<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.800> toggle<00:00:20.279> edge

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
gate memory and it's the toggle edge

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.820 
gate memory and it's the toggle edge
triggered<00:00:21.150> there<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.810> also<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.199> tunnel<00:00:22.560> while<00:00:22.800> I

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
triggered there is also a tunnel while I

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.470 
triggered there is also a tunnel while I
drinking<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.609> don't<00:00:23.789> know<00:00:24.090> much<00:00:24.449> about

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
drinking but I don't know much about

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.779 
drinking but I don't know much about
that<00:00:24.750> I've<00:00:25.289> never<00:00:25.500> used<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.670> we're<00:00:26.760> just

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
that I've never used it so we're just

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.839 
that I've never used it so we're just
going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> use<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> tunnel<00:00:27.630> edge<00:00:27.750> triggered

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
going to use the tunnel edge triggered

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.770 
going to use the tunnel edge triggered
we're<00:00:29.849> also<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.359> need<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.570> button

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
we're also going to need a button

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.470 
we're also going to need a button
here<00:00:34.340> base<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.610> need<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> button<00:00:36.149> doesn't

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
here base just need a button doesn't

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.110 
here base just need a button doesn't
toggle<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.290> goes<00:00:37.469> from<00:00:37.710> zero<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.370> after<00:00:38.760> one

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
toggle just goes from zero and after one

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.840 
toggle just goes from zero and after one
went<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.680> for<00:00:40.680> us<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.920> need<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.280> constant<00:00:41.700> value

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
went on for us we need a constant value

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.389 
went on for us we need a constant value
with<00:00:42.329> two<00:00:42.809> values<00:00:43.020> I'm<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> use

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
with two values I'm just going to use

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.130 
with two values I'm just going to use
five<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.969> eighty<00:00:45.180> because<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.989> what's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
five and eighty because there what's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
five and eighty because there what's
there<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> we're<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.110> gonna<00:00:49.289> screen<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
there and we're just gonna screen so I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.850 
there and we're just gonna screen so I
can<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.340> what's<00:00:50.520> happening<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> how<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> look

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
can see what's happening so how I look

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.029 
can see what's happening so how I look
we<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> clock

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
we have the clock

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
we have the clock
this<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.430> best<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> tell<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.180> when<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this is best going to tell it when to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.080 
this is best going to tell it when to
toggle<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.620> send<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.910> will

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
toggle if we send a one to this it will

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.200 
toggle if we send a one to this it will
switch<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.199> toggle<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.710> values<00:01:02.210> only

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
switch it will toggle the values only

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
switch it will toggle the values only
when<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> changes<00:01:03.870> from<00:01:04.049> zero<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.619> if

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
when it changes from zero to a one if

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.280 
when it changes from zero to a one if
you<00:01:04.949> keep<00:01:05.519> sending<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.570> keep

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you keep sending it or one will keep

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.960 
you keep sending it or one will keep
flipping<00:01:07.619> backwards<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.100> forwards<00:01:08.400> it's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
flipping backwards or forwards it's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.910 
flipping backwards or forwards it's
going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.270> send<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> non<00:01:09.990> toggled<00:01:10.350> box<00:01:10.560> so

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
going to send up to a non toggled box so

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550 
going to send up to a non toggled box so
we<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.130> send<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.430> 1<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.970> then<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.080> value<00:01:13.439> on

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
we can send a 1 and then the on value on

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.140 
we can send a 1 and then the on value on
the<00:01:13.680> off<00:01:13.799> value<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> values<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:14.970> going

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the off value are the values it's going

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.920 
the off value are the values it's going
to<00:01:15.270> toggle<00:01:15.630> between<00:01:15.869> when<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.890> use<00:01:17.369> clock<00:01:18.030> now

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to toggle between when you use clock now

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.910 
to toggle between when you use clock now
it<00:01:19.140> starts<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:20.810> then<00:01:21.810> when<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> press<00:01:22.290> then

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it starts on then when you press then

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.170 
it starts on then when you press then
when<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.130> send<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.549> two<00:01:23.670> o'clock<00:01:23.939> by

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
when you send a one two o'clock by

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
when you send a one two o'clock by
pressing<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> button<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.960> our<00:01:25.110> case<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:26.100> will

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
pressing the button in our case it will

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.770 
pressing the button in our case it will
switch<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> off<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> again

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
switch to off when you do it again

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.200 
switch to off when you do it again
back<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> wrong<00:01:28.520> then<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.790> off<00:01:30.000> on

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
back at the wrong then it's just off on

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.740 
back at the wrong then it's just off on
off<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.530> I'm<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> send<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.729> five<00:01:34.220> off

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
off on I'm going to send one to five off

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.539 
off on I'm going to send one to five off
to<00:01:36.750> 80<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.939> we're<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.920> say<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.100> C

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
to 80 and then we're going to say that C

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.039 
to 80 and then we're going to say that C
start<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.240> five<00:01:42.540> which<00:01:42.990> was<00:01:43.170> our<00:01:43.460> value<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
start on five which was our value and

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.560 
start on five which was our value and
then<00:01:46.049> I'll<00:01:46.710> press<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:48.090> gone<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> 80

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
then I'll press that it's gone to 80

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.350 
then I'll press that it's gone to 80
back<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> five<00:01:49.740> 85<00:01:51.380> 85<00:01:52.520> that's<00:01:53.520> all<00:01:54.090> there<00:01:54.329> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
back to five 85 85 that's all there is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.899 
back to five 85 85 that's all there is
to<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.899> very<00:01:55.110> simple<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.700> just

to it it's very simple and you can just
use<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> stick<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.979> logic<00:01:59.909> or

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
use it you can if you stick in logic or

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:10.109 
use it you can if you stick in logic or
gate<00:02:01.130> with<00:02:02.130> logic<00:02:02.549> or<00:02:07.220> if<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.459> set<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> clock

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
gate with logic or if we set the clock

-<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.420> are<00:02:11.400> -<00:02:12.400> both<00:02:12.640> bosses<00:02:12.910> just<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.810> one<00:02:14.110> be

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
- you are - both bosses just a to one be

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.470 
- you are - both bosses just a to one be
to<00:02:14.470> another<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.760> can<00:02:15.879> also<00:02:16.000> change<00:02:16.269> these

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
to another you can also change these

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.100 
to another you can also change these
together<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:18.190> if<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:18.940> press<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.209> switch<00:02:19.959> to

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
together and if I press that switch to

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.020 
together and if I press that switch to
18<00:02:20.440> back<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.160> 5<00:02:21.370> press<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.450> 80<00:02:23.140> back<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.010> 5<00:02:24.250> so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
18 back to 5 press this 80 back to 5 so

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.740 
18 back to 5 press this 80 back to 5 so
both<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.360> them<00:02:25.660> can<00:02:25.900> toggle<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:27.549> value<00:02:28.180> so

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
both of them can toggle that value so

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.000 
both of them can toggle that value so
it's<00:02:28.870> good<00:02:28.989> for<00:02:29.019> ad<00:02:29.200> or<00:02:29.379> if<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.620> want<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.799> button

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
it's good for ad or if you want a button

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.780 
it's good for ad or if you want a button
on<00:02:30.190> either<00:02:30.310> side<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:33.099> code<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.430> can<00:02:33.489> just

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
on either side the code you can just

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.420 
on either side the code you can just
chain<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.750> oars<00:02:34.900> together<00:02:35.410> as<00:02:35.830> many<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.340> you

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
chain the oars together as many of you

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.930 
chain the oars together as many of you
want<00:02:37.709> that's<00:02:38.709> always<00:02:38.890> -<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:39.310> fairly<00:02:39.700> simple

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
want that's always - it's fairly simple

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.420 
want that's always - it's fairly simple
get<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:41.019> John<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.680> will<00:02:41.860> see<00:02:41.890> what<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.280> can

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
get this so John I will see what you can

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.730 
get this so John I will see what you can
build<00:02:42.610> it
