00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.450
 by heart it excites them thoroughly 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.600
 love that it's true that the pet shop there 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.220
 do not promise everything to you so it's 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.370
 a game box that caters to 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.450
 little girls 6 years old and over and that's 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.700

 yes we agree I did not 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.160
 of error I pay attention to what I 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.870
 mean because I have a 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.729
 professional a specialist next door 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.770
 right and well it's a room to 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.420
 customize a priori so it goes there 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.770
 have a lot of things in this box 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.390
 which is still quite important and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.420
 I want to see if we are not disappointed 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.330
 once opened it louvre yes 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.110
 and no yes I think that this is it 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:27.939
 decided 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:27.939
 [Music] 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.650
 no 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.580
 1 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.130
 and well here we have opened 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.270
 this box and we are not disappointed 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.690
 because there is still something 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.570
 in 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.100
 ah yes there is a first know 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.800
 of accessories a second a third 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.530
 with I imagine other little ones 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.510
 accessories put up that it must be the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.350
 outlines of the house or in any case a 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.880
 part of the house 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.780
 a lot of voices there from barnes bar 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.520
 things to ride again there is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.770
 fortunately or a leaflet 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.840
 explanatory I want to say because 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.950
 for moms who have a nice hand 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.190
 left as mine is good 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.380
 practice the instructions well that's it 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.620
 advertising that's a little paper 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.540
 who sees our little girls there 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.330
 the different shop parties they 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.560
 can find commercially ago 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.209
 a little download relay on apple 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.940
 store and all that and that's from ketchup 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.040
 well that's also what it's not very 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.440
 separately paramount and there is 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.420
 sure inside the box the two 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.390
 characters without this box 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.489
 would not exist to know blues bliss 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:52.080
 blythe by blythe of tears and he loved 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:55.350
 the funds how the petshop my eyes to 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.450
 not not at all but in fact 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.090
 it's not small dogs what is it? 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:06.989
 so these animals for company who 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.700
 points of agreement but who never barks the 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.430
 mother who understood nothing and me what I 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.989
 proposes to you is that we mount a 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.350
 little bit of all this and that we do the 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.880
 point behind on the playability of this 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.880
 wonderful play you agree 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.300
 and that's why we have mounted our 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.120
 blythe room of blythe pardon it's 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.210
 I have a little trouble with pet shop so 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.610
 we found inside we had seen 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.780
 just now the little pet shop 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.330
 there is blythe of course on his little 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.590
 pedestal mounting it took us how much 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.660
 of time marianne after yes 30 35 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.360
 minutes and I must say that at the end of 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.580
 this montage I think it's a toy 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.650
 which is very well finished which is pretty 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.690
 easy to assemble even if I'm not 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.990
 very gifted we still took 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.970
 many but we managed and then it's 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.160
 the result is still very nice 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.740
 so I will show you so 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.510
 inside the house and opens 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.250
 So here like this wood we were 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.799
 furnished and one entirely after you 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.810
 can obviously the child a little furnished 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.300
 exactly as it is 1 or place 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.920
 that he decided that's so you 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:31.910
 see there is a bed a table a lamp to 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.460
 a very design armchair and what is 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.960
 not bad is that we can totally 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.630
 customize this room 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.490
 so I explain the topo ah yes 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.260
 that's where you're right they know better 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.900
 that we in children so there by 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.180
 example you have a lamp on which 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.400
 we can then install the objects of 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.000
 customization are at are in front of me 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.650
 see it I have not detached them but if 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.640
 I've already made it staggered 3-1 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.240
 for example show how 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.930
 customize this lamp 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.540
 so here it is about installing 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.040
 these little dots on the lamp 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.660
 here but you can put 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.290
 all the colors there are blue ones 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.570
 roses of oranges of yellows 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.390
 you can even install them at 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.770
 inside the house because you 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.080
 see I do not know if you see him 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.760
 well but the windows are small 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.500
 holes in the small windows and so 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.050
 we can also install small 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.350
 decorations inside the room 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.930
 this is possible if 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.970
 there is also to them to see what you 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.590
 did it's really good here it is 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.600
 that yesterday you could have put all 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.300
 around so it's simple for the 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.860
 put back you lift the hood of the 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.310
 room because all rooms 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.870
 it's well known all have a hood 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.120
 anything here you are installing it 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.450
 on one of the hooks like this and hop 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.070
 and then I show you the result 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.620
 I do not know if it's very happy 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.340
 what I did I do not see 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.770
 inevitably that's better like that 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.570
 so we see that there is a small 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.040
 customization there what can we 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.410
 do we can do a lot of stuff 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.460
 ah yes if there are frames inside 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.260
 we hung with mariana then in 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.150
 tasks 1 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.000
 So that's done I need to raise 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:22.510
 death in the lily so here it is 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.530
 for example you can stick that's him or 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:29.110
 where the flowers like that put it on the 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.120
 frame and hop create a decoration 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.090
 custom is like that there are two 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.940
 frames in the house pet shop 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.690
 so that's nice so that's it then 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.310
 then there are plenty 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.020
 look I wanted my train anyway 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.280
 I do not have if we can do a close up 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.980
 my men there is a whole battery 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.590
 more colorful stickers than 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.390
 the others and we can really 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.930
 totally customize the windows of 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.810
 the house the railing of the house 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.280
 so here is stop it's rather 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.840
 it's pretty cool because it's a 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.700
 customization that is not too much 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.410
 complicated also for the child because 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.750
 sometimes it can be a little 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.580
 difficult and the room is not at all 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.780
 it's funny like once again that the 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.360
 house is mounted there is more than 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.400
 to play and it's nice me I like it and 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.400
 you do not like yes yes it gives 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.590
 want to play yeah good and well listen 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.630
 we will be a scale of 1 to 5 you would say 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.710
 how much star roof that would put 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:29.130
 how many canvases on words play 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:32.070
 five are without stars but it exists 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.320
 hop let's say 5 then this maxim 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.480
 this is in any case if you want it is 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.020
 and the blythe room was the 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.330
 blythe room of the pet shop a toy 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.340
 well listen to me that I find a lot of 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.170
 everything is a toy obviously that is not 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.930
 not a specially educational toy 

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:51.660
 although it's do it yourself so that 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:54.510
 is still appealing to their mind is 

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.940
 will say creative here and then that's it 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.710
 if you want to see other demos if 

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.060
