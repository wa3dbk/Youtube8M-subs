00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:15.110
 hi there , tungsten is the first 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:21.619
 Yaroslavl videobloger today decided 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:25.939
 get from the closet xbox 360 already 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.060
 probably the year is lying I thought that even 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.820
 the mice were in what condition 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.060
 normal or not the prefix was 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.070
 bought when they just appeared 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.860
 at first, the whales of the party were and not 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.010
 overheated and broke and this is the second 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:51.650
 the party is almost zero prefix and 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:54.340
 she didn't play at all very little hard 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.200
 drive here at 80 if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:04.850
 gigabyte do not even remember how many here 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:07.329
 drive so here it is this prefix like 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.520
 usually say so here it looks 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:21.969
 such an boxing prefix which 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:21.969
 lay in the closet a whole year steam 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.229
 all sorts of little books 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.490
 joystick, even were generally so here 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.170
 great they made manufacturers 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:56.759
 microsoft very comfortable joystick 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:59.399
 bodies whose they say well, you are one game 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.250
 I definitely went on this console to call 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.520
 of duty 2 it seems it was yes there where the germans 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.520
 on kill here I killed all the germans 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.010
 here we have a power supply 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:32.850
 heavy if on the head to somebody 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:34.500
 give it like that you can kill for sure but we 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.390
 because the network cable is us 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.590
 were looking for a network cable but ready 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:47.190
 network cable to see how much he 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:49.549
 meters and a fig as such a network 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.250
 there is probably a meter 2 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:56.180
 two meter though i have somewhere else 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.870
 In general, it will also allocate the same cable stella 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:04.860
 about five meters for 23 pieces like it was but 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:10.400
 they forge lost this adapter 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:14.030
 what to connect the converter skat 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.030
 on composites 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.209
 such composite cord welcomes 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.739
 a bailiff can and later shirt 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:38.870
 connect which is not included 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:41.220
 not a fig all in dust 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.819
 will have to do at least wipe 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.819
 Wet cloth still clean up 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:08.010
 such a paper headset headset in 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.209
 some games there on the network play 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:20.609
 something very good for some reason why she 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:21.530
 need as one earphone where the viper doesn't 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.510
 tours 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.510
 5 alien headset 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:37.819
 35k connector here will help 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:43.169
 called 2 and 5 or 15 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:45.139
 turn on head off i don't 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:05:00.270
 used in general, it is necessary 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:05:03.330
 throw this food electricity all 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:08.610
 nothing else was still check-check yet 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.419
 was something of a man not visible gears of 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.460
 war 2 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:20.270
 so I played a little king-kong front 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.270
 line drives all licensed 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:30.449
 downloaded from licensed torrents most 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:38.419
 license torrent here such disks still 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:38.419
 somewhere they were here all assassin creed 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.779
 main memories like i played 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.990
 in call of duty in the second part and passed 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.150
 him 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.569
 more so nothing special comes a 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:59.099
 another god played another game that is and 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:06:01.129
 Now this is not such a Siberian tor tor 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.599
 Games are also such memories 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:08.759
 stayed from this drive 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:14.340
 I started to play some kind of went the q 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:17.759
 generally such a psychedelic after 20 minutes 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:22.979
 the roof starts to go from such games such 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:25.740
 primitive such colors are acid in games 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:29.830
 I think so as it used to be played in all 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.400
 these games are in all sorts of golden xf 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:38.300
 eco dolphin sonic 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.610
 earthworm jim is still there a lot 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.530
 all sorts of games were good worn as 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.630
 played now for me it almost 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.230
 it is clear now how wildly these look 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.920
 games all 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:51.910
