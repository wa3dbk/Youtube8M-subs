00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 one month the printing of images of a few weeks has been the winner of the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:05.930
 prize 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.090
 most prestigious in the world with road works on the road was made 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.989
 during a mock rescue in the handling of the cupcake in west ham 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.359
 Its author is the Aragonese photographer 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.359
 ignacio meza ramón min 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.410
 Min Ferrando is also the inventor of an apparatus 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.170
 that can revolutionize aerial photography is the multi cotero an invention 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.479
 finger 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:36.379
 happy that powered by remote control and no longer by a gps can photograph 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.450
 from entire villages to inaccessible places 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.860
 its ease of use and its versatility promise to mark a before and after 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.810
 in the world of photography 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.820
 you have to put everything pointed because a device as sophisticated as this one 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.830
 you need to be careful to the smallest detail 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.490
 and once you have entered the camera and verified that everything is fine, you can 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.720
 take flight 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.790
 an Aragonese company has been in charge of developing 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.380
 we call this device multi coastal and it is capable of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.170
 spherical photographs and high-definition video recordings to more than 100 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.710
 meters high is capable of making recordings as spectacular as 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.080
 is 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.350
 it's not just that sometimes I do not think so 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.000
 but the other one does not 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.700
 the one known as exceptional case 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.440
 Ignacio and Ernesto have worked on this project for almost two years 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.550
 an invention that can mean a before and after in aerial photography 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.450
 the fundamental advantage that it has is that it can be lowered to very low height 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.390
 communicated but a plane light airs that fly very high 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.920
 here not here you can access your photos well from two meters from one meter 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.180
 height just the ones you want 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.000
 so 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.450
 the shoá a lot of versatility 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.060
 The advanced technology that includes the multi copper allows controlling the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.819
 excesses very accurately 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.139
 now we are receiving the data that the sensors of the device are not 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:04.110
 sending then we see all its all parameters 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.760
 In the height 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.950
 the satellites or pilots gps to see how are the engines and 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.929
 revolutions and the most important thing 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.690
 is the state of the batteries are already working in the next step 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.500
 with these virtual reality glasses are able to see the images that 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.189
 recorded in real time 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.519
 It's practically like flying live
