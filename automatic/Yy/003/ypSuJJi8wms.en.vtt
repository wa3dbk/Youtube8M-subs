00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.070
 some time ago I made a video where 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.860
 blamed mts is that they strongly 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.990
 administered subscriber in error connecting 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.900
 supposedly free services which 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.420
 suddenly become paid was 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.269
 certainly a lot of pleasant reviews 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.550
 that everything with mts him people are fine and if 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.150
 you goof and do not read into each 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.669
 small letter 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.649
 especially when you obviously want to fuck 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.589
 something without a sucker and life is bad 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.689
 Especially this skirmish delivered to me 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.460
 people first moved out but then with 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.450
 Squeak still admitted that MTS 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.830
 knocks 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.980
 but not even nayabyvaet and brings up it 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.230
 helpful to my question and not too 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.990
 MTS takes over a lot 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.770
 Hera got an answer something in the spirit of me 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.870
 even like strong strong inclinations 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.480
 to masochism in the ordinary man in the street 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.610
 Well, let me remind you that according to my 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.860
 Tariff I was supposed to 60 minutes 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.110
 free calls per day for calls 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.730
 to local mts or local city 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.439
 numbers 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.270
 I usually say a couple of minutes and then odd 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.590
 prostrepalsya as much as 38 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.850
 what have i got 16 rubles from 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.880
 allow them but I must have 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.030
 free hour decided to complain to mts 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.409
 all communication is better with this office 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.509
 lead in writing 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.659
 so I asked in writing 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.270
 clarify for what is a specialist and me 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.609
 clarified the general meaning of what they decided 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.579
 change this rule and now not 60 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:35.399
 minutes a day free deny a 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.579
 They reported this on their website and 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.679
 everything 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.569
 and warn in advance that in 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.749
 according to the law, telecom operator 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.939
 can change tariffs as he pleases 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:47.229
 but bad luck subscribers about this need 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.340
 report through the mass 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.130
 information 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.740
 so without thinking twice and once again 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.359
 not spent they took out recorded 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.240
 own website as a mass 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.549
 information on it and reported on 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.399
 fare changes 10 days before their 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.870
 taking effect and so that you don't get it 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.240
 fuck respected 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.520
 moments we emphasize once again that mts 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.640
 properly met the requirements 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.550
 Legislation warn in advance 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.760
 if you suddenly decide to sue Well 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.160
 only one thing is surprising 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.830
 free company 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.040
 send esemes and that sends them 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.050

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.390

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.240
 points or about the next lottery 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.370
 for some reason did not consider it necessary to send 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.220
 sns about really important event 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.850
 unilateral amendment of the contract with 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.610
 Subscribers Well, somehow, my hands did not reach but 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.730
 but we were asked to learn in advance about 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.980
 all changes on the phone that's all right 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.450
 quit sitting fucking and every day 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.540
 call reference pay 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.870
 and whether something has changed on my fare 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.480
 live and breathe it with equal mts am it me 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.990
 quickly noticed losing only 16 rubles 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.330
 and now I will take into account these changes and those who are not 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.640
 noticed how many millions 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.540
 they will bring mts being completely 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.790
 sure they still call for free but 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.670
 After all, they also reported on the site 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.200
 published think what the internet in 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.300
 the country uses less than half 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.820
 population and certainly several times less 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.920
 man than cell phones from them 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.489
 they did not conceal the change of essential 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.890
 conditions, we just do not really advertise them 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.890
 that worsened the conditions for consumers 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.620
 business model will kindle us like this 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.670
 fuck 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.670
 we bring up
