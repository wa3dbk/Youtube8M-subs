00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 I am currently in the train 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.140
 transilien who makes the link paris is 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.510
 compelling 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.099
 on board the train there are taken so we 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.019
 can use to feed 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.760
 devices like the portable roadster or 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.360
 cell phone camera for 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.010
 recharge 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.600
 and I wondered what tension in 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.369
 had in the catches since it's 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.750
 quite particular there is some of the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.880
 line that is powered by 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.589
 classic catenaries in twenty five thousand 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.240
 alternative flights so here we can 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.429
 imagine that there is simply a 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.779
 transformer between the catenary 25 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.730
 thousand volts and takes for the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.810
 feed 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.890
 I do not know how a train is done 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.370
 but we can assume that it was like 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.110
 so that's a simple method 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.699
 and for the parties where they drive without 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.469
 catenary it uses a motor to 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.850
 internal combustion in this situation 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.399
 we can wonder what tension we are going 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.449
 have bandaged taken since the solutions 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.660
 techniques that can be imagined 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.250
 it's either a couple alternator and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.079
 so mechanically to the motor to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.540
 combustion that will provide the tension 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.190
 in takes like in this car 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.630
 the problem is that if the speed of the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.340
 motor slightly we're going to have a 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.260
 frequency variation is so it will 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.150
 more than 50 hertz and then the second 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.130
 solution on me that would be I think of a 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.080
 inverter and if it's an inverter 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.820
 I wonder what is going to be the form of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.390
 the tension is what's going to be the spur 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.770
 tuxedo sinus and so will be able to check 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.090
 what voltage is going to have in prices 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.800
 I decided to board the train 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.180
 with a little material so I have 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.290
 brought my osteo scop who is 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.620
 besides right now powered by 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.810
 windows is taken 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.130
 masson of tension is actually 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.789
 House 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.310
 an incandescent lamp a power strip 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.840
 a ferromagnetic ballast for 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.299
 can do one load at a time 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.799
 resistive inductive there we are on the 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.090
 part of the line where we roll with the 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.070
 internal combustion engine 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.790
 I will connect the dark with the cias 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.050
 cup 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.350
 we will see what kind of tension we 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.350
 gets 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.080
 I will take channel 1 of 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.300
 the oscilloscope contention setting the 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.780
 caliber 5 flights by 17 years are 120 x 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.780
 this is not good 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.740
 then little suspense moment I send the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.290
 tension in the sky score across the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.290
 differential probe 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.290
 at 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.310
 and so here is the attention we get 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.349
 at the terminals of the catch of this train so 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.330
 a very nice solid signs and a 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.580
 extremely stable frequency 50 Hz 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.790
 finally if I adjust the coefficient of the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.790
 probe 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.680
 we see the claim of 133 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.150
 want effective if continued if we look 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.650
 well that is almost perfect it is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.170
 not quite there are a few small 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.750
 notch so I think it comes from a 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.130
 inverter 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.050
 and in addition seen the stability of the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.790
 frequency and there are some variations 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.840
 speed of our engine 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.450
 it is unthinkable that she comes 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.100
 directly from the small alternator 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.400
 cutting of the inverter to high 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.400
 frequency 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.280
 it's strange the quality of the tension has 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.880
 decreased at the same time as the engine has 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.790
 slowed to 6 gave me a little 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.870
 shapes and on its vertices there the 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.490
 train is almost stopped but hey 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.000
 internal combustion engine continues to 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.180
 turn we just saw what was giving 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.970
 the voltage I'm going to plug the lamp into 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.260
 series with strong magnetic ballast 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.330
 so I've already plugged up place we can 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.850
 see the current we feel the effect of 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.530
 high frequency parasites and we see there 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.000
 a strange phenomenon that I did not 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.730
 never seen before that is surely due to 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.520
 the presence of an inverter 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.960
 I have a charge victims 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.480
 so logically the current should be 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.220
 lagged behind so compared to 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.030
 attention 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.550
 only we see that the current in 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.060
 yellow starts exactly at the same time 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.610
 that the tension here happened to half of 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.690
 the tension page we see that the 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.780
 current is late 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.910
 and then come to the end of the period on 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.860
 sees that he is again in phase with 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.530
 the tension is a result enough 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.270
 amazing for now the train is rolling 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.050
 always without catenary so with the 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.250
 internal combustion engine 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.070
 and watch out for catch and always 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.400
 provided speak inverters we will see if 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.260
 when we go 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.000
 under the catenaries 25 min volts so 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.150
 in a few tens of kilometers the 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.709
 form of attention by has changed 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.569
 stay his dealer and we will always have the 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.790
 same tension his name is going to be fed 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.379
 through the catenaries and 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.720
 through a transformer 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.130
 step down and at that moment we should 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.789
 see the shape of the attention changed and 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.050
 should be I think more sinusoidal 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.150
 little parenthesis but who is always 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.650
 technical 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.770
 this job if I'm wrong it was 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.479
 delivered in 2008 a time when we were doing 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.970
 already enough attention to savings 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.400
 of energy and ecology is 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.199
 strangely its lighting is assured 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.919
 entirely by halogen lamps 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.900
 dicro hic it's not at all economical by 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.789
 compared to t5 tubes and even by 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.270
 compared to tubes of 8 and more 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.140
 it's a train that looks air conditioned 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.330
 so that means that when the 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.520
 air conditioning is on the road they 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.500
 spend even more energy because 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.910
 of the presence of these lamps since it 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.610
 is forced to absorb normal heat 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.830
 tunes plus the heat created by the 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.970
 lamps 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.650
 gold that would have a lot less if 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.390
 it was tubes it's really a 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.460
 choice that I find strange and he's going 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.830
 have to explain it to me and then to 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.140
 a few kilometers from Paris is and we 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.930
 so is surely fueled by the 25 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.580
 may he alternative vote catenary 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.410
 I kept an eye on lucio scop and 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.600
 I did not notice a change in 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.030
 of the form of the voltage so we 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.410
 be propelled by an explosion engine 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.600
 or feed directly from 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.360
 catenary solid alternative al 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.580
 it's always a UPS ml is in us 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.580
 which provides the voltage across 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.210
 taken from this train I almost want to 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.310
 say thank you sncf for providing us a 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.710
 tension on board a train that is when 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.820
 even of quite good quality 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.680
 I was expecting to have a lot more 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.490
 of harmonics something like 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.440
 pseudo sinus but the announced is when 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.900
 even quite clean there have been some 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.350
 variations and the frequency is very 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.150
 stable 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.810
 the rms value of the voltage is 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.810
 very stable too
