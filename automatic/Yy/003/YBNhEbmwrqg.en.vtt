00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the little square piece of like I don't

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.880 
the little square piece of like I don't
know<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.250> water

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
know what it is but it's like water

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.930 
know what it is but it's like water
testing<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.309> got<00:00:59.430> water<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
testing to see if you got water in it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.510 
testing to see if you got water in it
but<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:01.079> some<00:01:01.440> part<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.070> red

but if some part of it was red

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.910 
but if some part of it was red
so<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.670> decided<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> put<00:01:03.510> white<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.990 
then I got a little stuff on the side so
I<00:01:07.229> decided<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> use<00:01:07.830> nail<00:01:08.189> polish<00:01:08.610> remover<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
