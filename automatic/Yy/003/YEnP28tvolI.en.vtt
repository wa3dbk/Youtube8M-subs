screw up through your songs so if you
want<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> scrub<00:04:11.489> 22<00:04:12.329> minutes<00:04:12.629> you<00:04:12.900> can't<00:04:13.109> do

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
want to scrub 22 minutes you can't do

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.289 
want to scrub 22 minutes you can't do
that<00:04:13.439> at<00:04:13.680> all<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:14.879> it's<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.060> little<00:04:15.180> bit

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
that at all so it's a little bit

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.020 
that at all so it's a little bit
disappointing<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.489> way<00:04:17.579> around<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:17.970> is

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
disappointing so the way around that is

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.199 
disappointing so the way around that is
to<00:04:18.150> just<00:04:18.419> use<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.780> fast<00:04:19.590> forward<00:04:19.979> button<00:04:20.209> so

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
to just use the fast forward button so

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.339 
to just use the fast forward button so
you<00:04:21.269> get<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.570> where<00:04:21.690> you'd<00:04:21.810> like<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:21.989> start

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
you get to where you'd like to start

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.980 
you get to where you'd like to start
playing<00:04:22.530> music<00:04:26.090> also<00:04:27.090> when<00:04:27.389> fast<00:04:27.599> forwarding

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
playing music also when fast forwarding

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.180 
playing music also when fast forwarding
or<00:04:28.110> rewinding<00:04:28.530> your<00:04:28.650> music<00:04:28.919> while<00:04:29.039> that's

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
or rewinding your music while that's

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.430 
or rewinding your music while that's
playing<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.699> doesn't<00:04:30.000> sort<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.509> just<00:04:31.020> stops

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
playing it doesn't sort of it just stops

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.460 
playing it doesn't sort of it just stops
playing<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:31.919> while<00:04:32.070> you're<00:04:32.160> fast<00:04:32.400> forwarding

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
playing it while you're fast forwarding

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.350 
playing it while you're fast forwarding
would<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.560> be<00:04:34.620> nice<00:04:34.740> if<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:35.039> could<00:04:35.340> scrub<00:04:35.699> or

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
would it be nice if you could scrub or

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.999 
would it be nice if you could scrub or
listen<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.080> music<00:04:37.199> while<00:04:37.530> it's<00:04:37.770> fast

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
listen to the music while it's fast

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.770 
listen to the music while it's fast
forwarding<00:04:38.460> but<00:04:39.000> that's<00:04:39.240> just<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.479> way<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.720> is

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
forwarding but that's just the way it is

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.409 
forwarding but that's just the way it is
and<00:04:40.020> hopefully<00:04:40.110> we'll<00:04:40.500> see<00:04:40.530> more<00:04:41.070> options<00:04:41.419> for

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
and hopefully we'll see more options for
