working<00:00:51.629> inside<00:00:52.649> Oh<00:00:54.620> usually<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> paint<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
working inside Oh usually when I paint a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.290 
working inside Oh usually when I paint a
portrait<00:00:57.179> I'm<00:00:58.050> stalling<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.429> bit<00:00:59.640> until

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
portrait I'm stalling a little bit until

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.280 
portrait I'm stalling a little bit until
I<00:01:01.250> usually<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.429> mom<00:01:03.120> gets

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
I usually the mom gets

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.469 
I usually the mom gets
and<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:06.560> I<00:01:06.770> saw<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.640> little<00:01:08.030> bit<00:01:08.619> until<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:11.119> pose

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
and so I saw a little bit until the pose

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.510 
and so I saw a little bit until the pose
really<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:12.110> set<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.280> background

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
really that set and in the background

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.649 
really that set and in the background
you<00:01:13.850> don't<00:01:14.119> usually<00:01:14.690> want<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:16.540> lot<00:01:17.540> of

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
you don't usually want a lot of

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.620 
you don't usually want a lot of
brushstrokes<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:18.830> know<00:01:19.280> because<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.820> way

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
brushstrokes you know because the way

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.880 
brushstrokes you know because the way
that<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.020> create<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.770> feeling<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:23.890> this

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
that you create the feeling of this

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.460 
that you create the feeling of this
strong<00:01:25.790> Kairos<00:01:26.240> Bureau<00:01:26.710> light<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.550> you

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
strong Kairos Bureau light is that you

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.980 
strong Kairos Bureau light is that you
you<00:01:30.470> have<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.830> have<00:01:31.040> more<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.149> less<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.960> you

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
you have to have more and less so you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.150 
you have to have more and less so you
have<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.409> have<00:01:35.050> things<00:01:36.050> that<00:01:36.200> go<00:01:36.470> back<00:01:36.710> that

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
have to have things that go back that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.130 
have to have things that go back that
have<00:01:37.340> less<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.090> then<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.660> makes<00:01:38.990> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
have less and then and this makes the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.260 
have less and then and this makes the
background<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:41.509> then<00:01:42.380> more<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:44.060> come

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
background and and then more to come

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.570 
background and and then more to come
forward<00:01:44.539> so<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.990> strong<00:01:45.470> contrast<00:01:46.130> is<00:01:46.369> what

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
forward so that strong contrast is what

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.859 
forward so that strong contrast is what
creates<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.410> yellow<00:01:48.410> squirrel<00:01:49.600> effect<00:01:50.600> that

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
creates that yellow squirrel effect that

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.999 
creates that yellow squirrel effect that
light<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.289> shadow<00:01:51.500> effect<00:01:53.410> try<00:01:54.410> to<00:01:54.470> keep<00:01:54.800> the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
talking about today but but it's all you

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.530 
talking about today but but it's all you
know<00:03:25.440> relationships<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.700> thing<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.330> it's

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
know relationships is the thing so it's

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.770 
know relationships is the thing so it's
not<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:28.640> which<00:03:29.640> i<00:03:29.820> think<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.209> quite<00:03:30.480> often

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
not like which i think is quite often

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.540 
not like which i think is quite often
thought<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:33.260> people<00:03:34.260> think<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:34.920> terms<00:03:34.950> of

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.420 

there<00:03:38.550> being<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.970> correct<00:03:39.690> color<00:03:40.500> or<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.890> correct

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
there being a correct color or a correct

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.410 

I<00:04:55.400> think<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:56.670> was<00:04:56.940> such<00:04:57.240> an

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
I think that this was such an

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.360 
I think that this was such an
interesting<00:04:57.690> experience<00:04:58.320> because<00:04:59.040> I<00:04:59.220> can

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
interesting experience because I can

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.660 
interesting experience because I can
remember<00:04:59.640> now<00:04:59.940> over<00:05:00.330> 30<00:05:00.630> years<00:05:00.930> ago<00:05:01.110> when<00:05:01.560> I

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
remember now over 30 years ago when I

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.990 
remember now over 30 years ago when I
saw<00:05:02.670> David's<00:05:03.090> first<00:05:03.300> demonstration<00:05:04.170> and

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
saw David's first demonstration and

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.970 
saw David's first demonstration and
every<00:05:06.000> brush<00:05:06.360> stroke<00:05:06.390> that<00:05:06.870> he<00:05:06.930> did<00:05:07.350> seemed

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
every brush stroke that he did seemed

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.350 
every brush stroke that he did seemed
like<00:05:08.550> magic<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.870> was<00:05:10.140> measured<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:11.180> feel<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
like magic it was measured I feel the

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.170 
like magic it was measured I feel the
same<00:05:12.540> way<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.810> watching<00:05:13.710> Sheree<00:05:14.670> who

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
same way that watching Sheree who

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.400 
same way that watching Sheree who
obviously<00:05:15.540> is<00:05:16.050> far<00:05:17.010> surpassed<00:05:17.580> being<00:05:18.030> a

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
obviously is far surpassed being a

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.350 
obviously is far surpassed being a
student<00:05:19.410> but<00:05:19.770> in<00:05:20.070> one<00:05:20.370> sense<00:05:20.670> of<00:05:20.850> course<00:05:21.120> has

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
student but in one sense of course has

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.240 
student but in one sense of course has
been<00:05:21.630> my<00:05:21.900> greatest<00:05:22.730> greatest<00:05:23.730> student<00:05:24.240> and
