working on a saturn s-series this
happens<00:00:08.300> to<00:00:08.360> be<00:00:08.420> a<00:00:09.220> 1998<00:00:10.220> model<00:00:10.670> and<00:00:11.059> we<00:00:11.509> have<00:00:11.540> a

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
happens to be a 1998 model and we have a

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.749 
happens to be a 1998 model and we have a
check<00:00:11.960> engine<00:00:11.990> light<00:00:12.379> on<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.460> we're<00:00:13.580> going<00:00:13.700> to

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
check engine light on so we're going to

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:21.660 
check engine light on so we're going to
do<00:00:13.849> a<00:00:13.879> scan<00:00:14.440> see<00:00:15.440> what<00:00:15.559> we<00:00:15.679> find

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.560 

we<00:00:22.210> have<00:00:22.540> one<00:00:23.050> trouble<00:00:23.560> code<00:00:23.830> and<00:00:24.250> it's<00:00:24.670> a<00:00:24.990> p0

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
we have one trouble code and it's a p0

underneath the radiator now the first

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.280 
underneath the radiator now the first
thing<00:01:00.730> we're<00:01:00.880> going<00:01:00.970> to<00:01:01.030> do<00:01:01.210> is<00:01:01.420> remove<00:01:01.810> that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
thing we're going to do is remove that

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.370 
thing we're going to do is remove that
connection<00:01:03.280> electrical<00:01:04.059> connection<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.660> see

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
connection electrical connection and see

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.420 
connection electrical connection and see
what<00:01:06.160> it<00:01:06.430> looks<00:01:06.820> like<00:01:07.030> if<00:01:07.240> it's<00:01:07.390> dirty<00:01:08.009> if<00:01:09.009> it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
what it looks like if it's dirty if it

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.999 
what it looks like if it's dirty if it
looks<00:01:09.759> ok<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:11.080> next<00:01:11.350> thing<00:01:11.500> we're<00:01:11.619> going<00:01:11.740> to

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
looks ok the next thing we're going to

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.639 
looks ok the next thing we're going to
do<00:01:12.250> is<00:01:12.550> probe<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.690> electrical<00:01:14.140> connection

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
do is probe the electrical connection

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.370 
do is probe the electrical connection
and<00:01:14.830> see<00:01:15.100> if<00:01:15.340> we're<00:01:15.610> getting<00:01:15.790> voltage<00:01:16.479> from

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
and see if we're getting voltage from

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.180 
and see if we're getting voltage from
the<00:01:17.590> computer<00:01:18.130> down<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.759> sensor<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.950> if

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
the computer down to the sensor now if

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.910 
the computer down to the sensor now if
after<00:01:21.369> pulling<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.060> connector<00:01:22.570> off<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:23.440> looks

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
after pulling the connector off it looks

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.719 
after pulling the connector off it looks
dirty<00:01:25.200> now<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.409> could<00:01:26.680> be<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.890> problem<00:01:27.250> and

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
dirty now that could be a problem and

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.270 
dirty now that could be a problem and
what<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:28.690> could<00:01:28.900> do<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.290> take<00:01:29.530> some<00:01:29.710> contact

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
what you could do is take some contact

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.700 
what you could do is take some contact
cleaner<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:34.630> course<00:01:34.870> hold<00:01:35.320> that<00:01:35.530> down

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
cleaner and of course hold that down

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.430 
cleaner and of course hold that down
with<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:35.979> over<00:01:36.100> here<00:01:36.340> which<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:36.670> can<00:01:36.729> do<00:01:37.440> and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
with you over here which I can do and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.010 
with you over here which I can do and
spray<00:01:39.130> in<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.619> end<00:01:41.799> of<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.250> sensor

now<00:01:54.760> what<00:01:54.970> I'm<00:01:55.060> going<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.360> do<00:01:55.510> on<00:01:55.540> this<00:01:55.900> one<00:01:55.960> is

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
now what I'm going to do on this one is

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.690 
now what I'm going to do on this one is
I'm<00:01:56.860> going<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.159> check<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.390> voltage<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:59.700> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
I'm going to check the voltage and the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.149 
I'm going to check the voltage and the
resistance<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.320> sensor<00:02:02.560> next<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.950> we've

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.420 
I will try the the blue and white wire
here<00:02:45.570> we're<00:02:46.570> seeing<00:02:46.810> very<00:02:47.200> little<00:02:47.430> motion

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
here we're seeing very little motion

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.860 
here we're seeing very little motion
something<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.500> believe<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.870> low

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
something I believe that is the low

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.400 
something I believe that is the low
input<00:02:53.200> wire<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:55.060> red<00:02:55.240> wire<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.110> high

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
input wire and the red wire is the high

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.970 
input wire and the red wire is the high
input<00:02:57.040> wire<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:58.390> we<00:02:58.420> should<00:02:58.960> see<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.590> little

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
input wire so we should see a little

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.850 
input wire so we should see a little
higher<00:03:00.250> voltage<00:03:00.880> on<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.840> high<00:03:02.080> input<00:03:02.620> wire

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
higher voltage on the high input wire

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.280 
higher voltage on the high input wire
and<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.850> do<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.350> looks<00:03:05.590> good<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:07.290> now

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
and we do so that looks good so now

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.360 
and we do so that looks good so now
let's<00:03:08.530> check<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:09.120> resistance<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:11.770> sensor

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
let's check the resistance of the sensor

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.310 
let's check the resistance of the sensor
the<00:03:13.330> next<00:03:13.570> thing<00:03:13.660> we're<00:03:13.780> going<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.930> do<00:03:14.140> is

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
the next thing we're going to do is

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.180 
the next thing we're going to do is
check<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.620> resistance<00:03:15.520> of<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.540> sensor<00:03:17.190> now

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
check the resistance of the sensor now

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.170 
check the resistance of the sensor now
it's<00:03:18.520> it's<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.930> very<00:03:20.470> tight<00:03:20.830> place<00:03:21.730> up<00:03:21.970> there

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
it's it's in a very tight place up there

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.199 
it's it's in a very tight place up there
so<00:03:22.390> it's<00:03:22.510> very<00:03:22.690> difficult<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.890> get<00:03:24.790> your

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
so it's very difficult to get your

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.620 
so it's very difficult to get your
probes<00:03:26.140> from<00:03:26.470> your<00:03:26.880> multimeter<00:03:27.880> up<00:03:28.120> there<00:03:28.330> so

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
probes from your multimeter up there so

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.870 
probes from your multimeter up there so
what<00:03:29.320> you<00:03:29.470> need<00:03:29.740> is<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:32.160> connector<00:03:33.160> an<00:03:33.550> old

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
what you need is a connector an old

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.510 
what you need is a connector an old
connector<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:35.440> one<00:03:35.680> right<00:03:35.830> here<00:03:36.100> I've<00:03:36.250> taken

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
connector this one right here I've taken

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.520 
connector this one right here I've taken
off<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.090> crankshaft<00:03:37.630> position<00:03:37.810> sensor<00:03:38.080> but

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
off of a crankshaft position sensor but

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.380 
off of a crankshaft position sensor but
it's<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.770> same<00:03:39.010> connection<00:03:39.910> as<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.209> one

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
it's the same connection as that one

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.979 
it's the same connection as that one
right<00:03:40.570> there

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
right there

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.640 
right there
with<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.440> bunch<00:03:41.739> of<00:03:41.890> wire<00:03:42.130> on<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:43.480> we'll<00:03:44.410> take

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
with a bunch of wire on it so we'll take

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.890 
with a bunch of wire on it so we'll take
it<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:47.280> put<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.370> right<00:03:48.580> in<00:03:49.269> there<00:03:49.390> like<00:03:49.450> that

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
it and put it right in there like that

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.880 
it and put it right in there like that
and<00:03:50.410> now<00:03:51.130> we<00:03:51.550> can<00:03:52.830> take<00:03:53.830> our<00:03:54.070> multimeter<00:03:55.890> go

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
and now we can take our multimeter go

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.949 
and now we can take our multimeter go
down<00:03:57.130> here<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.700> 2000<00:03:58.660> ohms<00:03:58.810> scale<00:03:59.459> and<00:04:00.959> we

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
down here to the 2000 ohms scale and we

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:09.380 
down here to the 2000 ohms scale and we
want<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.470> take<00:04:02.709> one<00:04:03.070> lead

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.420 

put<00:04:10.390> that<00:04:10.599> on<00:04:12.030> one<00:04:13.030> wire<00:04:13.650> now<00:04:14.650> when<00:04:15.010> we<00:04:15.099> put<00:04:15.340> it

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
put that on one wire now when we put it

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.830 
put that on one wire now when we put it
on<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.790> other<00:04:15.940> one<00:04:16.120> what<00:04:16.269> we're<00:04:16.419> looking<00:04:16.810> for

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
on the other one what we're looking for

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.290 
on the other one what we're looking for
is<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:18.639> reading<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:19.450> range<00:04:19.720> of<00:04:20.019> 800<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:21.579> 1600

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
is a reading in the range of 800 to 1600

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:31.290 
is a reading in the range of 800 to 1600
ohms<00:04:22.960> Oh<00:04:29.130> black<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.340> see<00:04:30.490> this<00:04:30.669> one<00:04:30.910> is<00:04:31.030> out<00:04:31.150> of

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
ohms Oh black and see this one is out of

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.010 
ohms Oh black and see this one is out of
spec<00:04:31.889> we<00:04:32.889> got<00:04:33.780> 773<00:04:34.780> ohms<00:04:35.910> so<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:37.720> looks<00:04:37.930> like

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
spec we got 773 ohms so it looks like

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.210 
spec we got 773 ohms so it looks like
that<00:04:38.680> sensor<00:04:39.340> is<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.760> problem

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
that sensor is the problem

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.550 
that sensor is the problem
so<00:04:42.220> we'll<00:04:42.460> just<00:04:43.169> replace<00:04:44.169> that<00:04:45.990> now<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.169> remove

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
so we'll just replace that now to remove

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.930 
so we'll just replace that now to remove
the<00:04:47.740> sensor<00:04:48.220> you'll<00:04:49.210> need<00:04:49.419> a<00:04:50.160> 24<00:04:51.160> millimeter

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
the sensor you'll need a 24 millimeter

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.879 
the sensor you'll need a 24 millimeter
open<00:04:52.780> end<00:04:52.930> wrench<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.930> shouldn't<00:04:56.380> be<00:04:56.470> in<00:04:56.650> there

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
open end wrench it shouldn't be in there

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.409 
open end wrench it shouldn't be in there
too<00:04:57.280> hard<00:04:57.610> because<00:04:57.850> it's<00:04:58.090> a<00:05:00.510> plastic<00:05:02.190> shredded

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
too hard because it's a plastic shredded

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:10.440 
too hard because it's a plastic shredded
sensor<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.930> once<00:05:08.590> you<00:05:08.770> get<00:05:08.950> it<00:05:09.100> to<00:05:09.280> a<00:05:09.450> certain

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
sensor and once you get it to a certain

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.170 
sensor and once you get it to a certain
point<00:05:11.729> you<00:05:12.729> should<00:05:12.760> be<00:05:13.240> able<00:05:13.479> to<00:05:13.750> just<00:05:15.180> remove

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
point you should be able to just remove

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:24.690 
point you should be able to just remove
it<00:05:16.979> my<00:05:17.979> head<00:05:21.090> she's<00:05:22.090> just<00:05:22.419> about<00:05:22.630> out<00:05:22.870> now<00:05:23.640> so<00:05:24.640> I

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
it my head she's just about out now so I

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.360 
it my head she's just about out now so I
can<00:05:25.030> take<00:05:25.240> it<00:05:25.300> out<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.660> rest<00:05:25.780> of<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.080> way<00:05:26.370> my

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
can take it out the rest of the way my

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:38.760 
can take it out the rest of the way my
head

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:50.230 

there<00:05:39.770> we<00:05:39.889> go<00:05:48.729> after<00:05:49.729> you<00:05:49.789> get<00:05:49.940> your<00:05:50.090> new

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
there we go after you get your new

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.990 
there we go after you get your new

here the diagram look for the PCM B fuse
and<00:06:08.539> we're<00:06:08.930> going<00:06:09.139> to<00:06:09.259> remove<00:06:09.590> it<00:06:09.770> to<00:06:09.800> clear

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
and we're going to remove it to clear

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.890 
and we're going to remove it to clear
