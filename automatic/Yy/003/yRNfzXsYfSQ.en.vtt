in<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.479> accessories<00:01:54.990> package<00:01:55.380> everything

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
in this accessories package everything

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.760 
in this accessories package everything
comes<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.369> bag<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:57.770> one

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
comes in this bag as you can see one

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.959 
comes in this bag as you can see one
thing<00:01:58.979> i<00:01:59.070> always<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> look<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.759> when<00:01:59.880> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
thing i always like to look at when it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.940 
thing i always like to look at when it
comes<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.210> cpu<00:02:00.570> coolers<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.020> your<00:02:01.560> user's

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
comes to cpu coolers is your user's

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.319 
comes to cpu coolers is your user's
manual<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:03.439> looking<00:02:04.439> at<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:06.090> does

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
manual and looking at this one it does

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.819 
manual and looking at this one it does
have<00:02:06.509> diagrams<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.320> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.469> hard<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.649> see

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
have diagrams it's kind of hard to see

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.369 
have diagrams it's kind of hard to see
because<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.099> do<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.929> brightness<00:02:10.259> turned

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
because we do have the brightness turned

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.220 
because we do have the brightness turned
up<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.770> our<00:02:11.160> camera<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:11.940> there<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.270> a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
up on our camera here but there is a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.170 
up on our camera here but there is a
ton<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.680> information<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.370> has<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.879> full

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
ton of information here has a full

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.850 
ton of information here has a full
diagram<00:02:15.659> which<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:15.989> like<00:02:16.290> especially<00:02:16.680> when

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
diagram which I do like especially when

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.190 
diagram which I do like especially when
installing<00:02:17.280> coolers<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:18.090> they're<00:02:19.019> all

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
installing coolers because they're all

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.809 
installing coolers because they're all
different<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.099> never<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.489> what<00:02:20.730> you're

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
different and you never know what you're

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.460 
different and you never know what you're
going<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.510> know<00:02:21.629> find<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.200> everything

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
going to you know find and everything

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.160 
going to you know find and everything
like<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.830> then<00:02:23.069> we<00:02:23.190> do<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:24.170> enter

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
like that and then we do have enter

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
like that and then we do have enter
Max's<00:02:25.590> own<00:02:27.230> thermal<00:02:28.230> paste<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.739> there<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.129> you

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
Max's own thermal paste on there so you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.830 
Max's own thermal paste on there so you
do<00:02:29.430> have<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.700> included<00:02:30.450> which<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.690> always

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
do have that included which I always

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.900 
do have that included which I always
like<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.019> make<00:02:31.260> sure<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.620> do<00:02:31.769> have<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.040> with

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
like to make sure you do have that with

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.059 
like to make sure you do have that with
your<00:02:33.299> CPU<00:02:33.780> coolers<00:02:34.140> because<00:02:34.500> nobody<00:02:34.799> wants<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
your CPU coolers because nobody wants to

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.070 
your CPU coolers because nobody wants to
get<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.430> cooler<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:36.360> not<00:02:36.599> have<00:02:36.810> any

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
get a cooler and then not have any

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.589 
get a cooler and then not have any
thermal<00:02:37.680> paste<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.760> there<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.239> they<00:02:39.360> can't

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
thermal paste on there so they can't

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.809 
thermal paste on there so they can't
install<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.200> right<00:02:40.349> away<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.579> then<00:02:41.670> we

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
install it right away so and then we

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.460 
install it right away so and then we
have<00:02:41.970> all<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.209> our<00:02:42.659> mounting<00:02:43.049> systems<00:02:43.409> now

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
have all of our mounting systems now

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.920 
have all of our mounting systems now
this<00:02:43.590> supports<00:02:44.060> every<00:02:45.060> new<00:02:45.299> socket<00:02:45.599> through

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
this supports every new socket through

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.039 
this supports every new socket through
AMD<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:46.680> Intel<00:02:47.370> including<00:02:47.879> soccer<00:02:48.090> 2011<00:02:48.660> so

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
AMD and Intel including soccer 2011 so

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.119 
AMD and Intel including soccer 2011 so
you<00:02:49.110> shouldn't<00:02:49.379> have<00:02:49.440> any<00:02:49.530> issues<00:02:49.769> with

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
you shouldn't have any issues with

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.920 
you shouldn't have any issues with
compatibility<00:02:50.819> unless<00:02:51.599> you're<00:02:51.780> using

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
compatibility unless you're using

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.020 
compatibility unless you're using
something<00:02:52.349> that's<00:02:52.590> extremely<00:02:52.680> odd<00:02:53.549> or

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
something that's extremely odd or

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.509 
something that's extremely odd or
extremely<00:02:54.540> old<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.890> supports

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
extremely old so this supports

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.330 
extremely old so this supports
everything<00:02:56.819> that's<00:02:57.090> taking<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.390> look<00:02:57.569> at<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
everything that's taking a look at the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.339 
everything that's taking a look at the
cooler<00:02:59.849> itself<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.480> can<00:03:00.510> see<00:03:00.780> on<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.109> front

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
cooler itself you can see on the front

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.220 
cooler itself you can see on the front
we<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.910> 120-millimeter<00:03:02.910> fan<00:03:03.359> now<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.170> is

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
we have a 120-millimeter fan now this is

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.470 
we have a 120-millimeter fan now this is
a<00:03:04.410> fan<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:05.069> actually<00:03:05.609> if<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.879> remove<00:03:06.299> it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
a fan that actually if you remove it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.890 
a fan that actually if you remove it
which<00:03:07.049> I'll<00:03:07.170> do<00:03:07.290> at<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.500> end<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:08.549> actually<00:03:08.940> has

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
which I'll do at the end it actually has

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.009 
which I'll do at the end it actually has
controls<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.069> that<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.280> can<00:03:11.489> change<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
controls on it that you can change the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.619 
controls on it that you can change the
RPMs<00:03:13.799> again<00:03:14.609> I'll<00:03:14.700> go<00:03:14.819> over<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.030> at<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.450> end

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
RPMs again I'll go over that at the end

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.210 
RPMs again I'll go over that at the end
but<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.379> actually<00:03:16.500> pretty<00:03:16.799> cool<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:17.160> I

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
but that is actually pretty cool but I

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.530 
but that is actually pretty cool but I
would<00:03:17.400> have<00:03:17.489> just<00:03:17.519> like<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.819> simple<00:03:18.180> controller

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
would have just like a simple controller

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.479 
would have just like a simple controller
that<00:03:18.750> will<00:03:18.870> go<00:03:18.989> on<00:03:19.019> here<00:03:19.440> nobody<00:03:20.069> wants<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.370> go

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
that will go on here nobody wants to go

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.180 
that will go on here nobody wants to go
in<00:03:20.760> their<00:03:20.880> case<00:03:21.120> undo<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.260> fan<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.799> then

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
in their case undo the fan and then

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.220 
in their case undo the fan and then
actually<00:03:23.519> have<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.180> change<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.810> speed<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.169> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
actually have to change the speed of the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.379 
actually have to change the speed of the
fan<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.650> would<00:03:26.099> like<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.459> be<00:03:26.549> able<00:03:26.669> to<00:03:26.880> do<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.090> you

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
fan I would like to be able to do it you

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.819 
fan I would like to be able to do it you
know<00:03:27.510> right<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> controller<00:03:28.319> a<00:03:28.440> simple

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
know right on a controller a simple

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.550 
know right on a controller a simple
controller<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.280> here<00:03:29.549> would<00:03:30.209> be<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:31.139> to<00:03:31.319> find

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
controller on here would be just to find

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.319 
controller on here would be just to find
now<00:03:31.859> taking<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.310> look<00:03:32.430> how<00:03:32.579> thick<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.090> cooler

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
now taking a look how thick this cooler

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.629 
now taking a look how thick this cooler
is<00:03:33.419> it<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:34.169> a<00:03:34.200> single<00:03:34.709> tower<00:03:34.859> cooler<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.459> it's

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
is it is a single tower cooler so it's

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.970 
is it is a single tower cooler so it's
not<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:36.150> thick<00:03:36.690> whatsoever<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.650> it's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
not that thick whatsoever and it's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.789 
not that thick whatsoever and it's
actually<00:03:38.370> kind<00:03:38.639> of<00:03:38.790> light<00:03:39.060> as<00:03:39.299> well<00:03:39.739> so<00:03:40.739> you

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
actually kind of light as well so you

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.500 
actually kind of light as well so you
want<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.040> take<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.190> into<00:03:41.370> account<00:03:41.669> of<00:03:42.180> course

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
want to take that into account of course

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.270 
want to take that into account of course
and<00:03:42.780> then<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.470> can<00:03:43.620> take<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.799> look<00:03:43.980> at<00:03:44.130> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
and then you can take a look at the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.180 
and then you can take a look at the
design<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.209> heatsink<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:45.959> nice<00:03:46.950> thick

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
design of the heatsink here nice thick

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.069 
design of the heatsink here nice thick
heatsink<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.790> do<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.480> coating<00:03:48.930> on<00:03:49.049> it

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
heatsink I do like the coating on it

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.870 
heatsink I do like the coating on it
just<00:03:49.349> looks<00:03:49.620> nice<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:50.130> don't<00:03:50.609> know<00:03:50.700> if<00:03:50.819> our

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
just looks nice I don't know if our

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.240 
just looks nice I don't know if our
video<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.510> doing<00:03:51.989> this<00:03:52.109> justice<00:03:52.620> but<00:03:52.919> it<00:03:53.069> just

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
video is doing this justice but it just

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.610 
video is doing this justice but it just
looks<00:03:53.579> like<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:54.419> really<00:03:54.930> great<00:03:55.109> cooler<00:03:55.410> and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
looks like a really great cooler and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.099 
looks like a really great cooler and
then<00:03:55.709> on<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.889> top<00:03:56.389> you<00:03:57.389> can<00:03:57.540> see<00:03:57.599> we<00:03:57.930> have<00:03:58.079> the

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
then on the top you can see we have the

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.259 
then on the top you can see we have the
leper<00:03:58.470> logo<00:03:58.919> right<00:03:59.489> there<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.849> of<00:03:59.910> course<00:04:00.090> are

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
leper logo right there and of course are

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.629 
leper logo right there and of course are
protruding<00:04:01.230> heat<00:04:01.709> pipes<00:04:02.010> which<00:04:02.280> if<00:04:02.430> we<00:04:02.519> go

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
protruding heat pipes which if we go

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.759 
protruding heat pipes which if we go
down<00:04:02.669> to<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.000> base<00:04:03.299> nice<00:04:03.900> thick<00:04:04.200> base<00:04:04.440> and

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
down to the base nice thick base and

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.440 
down to the base nice thick base and
then<00:04:05.340> if<00:04:05.430> we<00:04:05.549> locate<00:04:05.700> we<00:04:05.940> do<00:04:06.030> have<00:04:06.120> our<00:04:06.180> sticker

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
then if we locate we do have our sticker

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.520 
then if we locate we do have our sticker
on<00:04:06.599> there<00:04:06.720> we'll<00:04:06.870> leave<00:04:07.019> it<00:04:07.109> on<00:04:07.200> there<00:04:07.319> for

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
on there we'll leave it on there for

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.490 
on there we'll leave it on there for
right<00:04:07.769> now<00:04:07.829> but<00:04:08.250> we<00:04:08.609> do<00:04:08.790> have<00:04:09.000> four<00:04:09.660> large<00:04:10.169> heat

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
right now but we do have four large heat

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.319 
right now but we do have four large heat
pipes<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.459> course<00:04:11.699> those<00:04:11.879> heat<00:04:12.090> pipes

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
pipes and of course those heat pipes

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.960 
pipes and of course those heat pipes
make<00:04:12.810> direct<00:04:13.440> contact<00:04:13.680> with<00:04:14.099> your<00:04:14.280> CPU<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:14.879> you

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
make direct contact with your CPU so you

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.909 
make direct contact with your CPU so you
can<00:04:15.090> see<00:04:15.269> right<00:04:15.299> here<00:04:15.569> our<00:04:15.959> base<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.530> actually

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
can see right here our base is actually

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.339 
can see right here our base is actually
made<00:04:17.070> up<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.940> bottom<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.539> our<00:04:18.870> heat<00:04:19.109> pipes

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
made up of the bottom of our heat pipes

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.459 
made up of the bottom of our heat pipes
so<00:04:19.949> that<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.459> said<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.390> do<00:04:21.810> better<00:04:22.140> heat

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
so that is said to do better heat

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.529 
so that is said to do better heat
transfer<00:04:22.979> so<00:04:23.130> instead<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.400> having<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.820> cpu<00:04:24.510> a

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
transfer so instead of having a cpu a

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.300 
transfer so instead of having a cpu a
full<00:04:24.840> cpu<00:04:25.229> block<00:04:25.260> with

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
full cpu block with

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.580 
full cpu block with
the<00:04:26.520> actual<00:04:26.850> heat<00:04:27.060> pipes<00:04:27.270> in<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.690> block<00:04:27.960> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
the actual heat pipes in the block the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.920 
the actual heat pipes in the block the
block<00:04:28.889> is<00:04:29.100> actually<00:04:29.430> made<00:04:29.610> up<00:04:29.730> of<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.210> base<00:04:30.660> of

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
block is actually made up of the base of

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.200 
block is actually made up of the base of
the<00:04:31.230> heat<00:04:31.410> pipes<00:04:31.700> as<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.820> can<00:04:32.940> see<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.150> of

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
the heat pipes as you can see and of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.250 
the heat pipes as you can see and of
course<00:04:33.389> those<00:04:33.510> heat<00:04:33.660> pipes<00:04:33.840> will<00:04:34.020> take<00:04:34.169> the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
course those heat pipes will take the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.770 
course those heat pipes will take the
heat<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.620> take<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.520> up<00:04:35.669> into<00:04:36.150> our<00:04:36.300> heat<00:04:36.480> sink

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
heat and take it up into our heat sink

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.740 
heat and take it up into our heat sink
and<00:04:36.960> then<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.680> course<00:04:37.770> our<00:04:38.160> fan<00:04:38.610> here<00:04:39.060> we'll<00:04:39.600> go

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
and then of course our fan here we'll go

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.650 
and then of course our fan here we'll go
ahead<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.100> cool<00:04:41.100> off<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.820> heat<00:04:42.210> sink<00:04:42.480> so

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
ahead and cool off that heat sink so

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.080 
ahead and cool off that heat sink so
very<00:04:43.169> cool<00:04:43.440> design<00:04:43.710> again<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.580> do<00:04:44.700> like<00:04:44.970> the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
very cool design again I do like the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.460 
very cool design again I do like the
coating<00:04:45.450> on<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.600> just<00:04:45.810> looks<00:04:45.960> great<00:04:46.200> and<00:04:46.380> like

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
coating on it just looks great and like

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.409 
coating on it just looks great and like
I<00:04:46.710> can<00:04:47.010> imagine<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.520> white<00:04:47.730> one<00:04:47.880> looks<00:04:48.090> just

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
I can imagine the white one looks just

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.300 
I can imagine the white one looks just
as<00:04:48.600> good<00:04:48.840> here<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.440> have<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.650> nice<00:04:49.830> black

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
as good here so you have that nice black

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.010 
as good here so you have that nice black
coating<00:04:50.669> on<00:04:50.790> everything<00:04:51.180> but<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.690> heat<00:04:51.810> pipes

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
coating on everything but the heat pipes

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.440 
coating on everything but the heat pipes
are<00:04:52.200> copper<00:04:52.590> as<00:04:52.740> well<00:04:52.919> as<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.130> base<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.910> heat

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
are copper as well as the base the heat

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.750 
are copper as well as the base the heat
sink<00:04:54.630> itself<00:04:54.960> is<00:04:55.169> made<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.950> aluminum<00:04:56.550> now<00:04:56.669> I'm

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
sink itself is made of aluminum now I'm

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.120 
sink itself is made of aluminum now I'm
going<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:56.940> go<00:04:57.000> ahead<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.419> take<00:04:58.110> off<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.830> fan

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
going to go ahead and take off the fan

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.830 
going to go ahead and take off the fan
here<00:04:59.490> see<00:04:59.850> how<00:04:59.940> easy<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.300> is<00:05:00.419> you<00:05:00.630> can<00:05:00.750> see

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
here see how easy that is you can see

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.900 
here see how easy that is you can see
these<00:05:00.960> fan<00:05:01.169> clips<00:05:01.410> just<00:05:01.979> come<00:05:02.310> right<00:05:02.520> off<00:05:02.580> so

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
these fan clips just come right off so

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.490 
these fan clips just come right off so
you<00:05:03.000> can<00:05:03.090> see<00:05:03.270> your<00:05:05.180> installation<00:05:06.180> or<00:05:06.500> taking

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
you can see your installation or taking

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.100 
you can see your installation or taking
this<00:05:07.590> apart<00:05:07.889> is<00:05:08.100> not<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:08.790> hard<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.720> if<00:05:09.870> we<00:05:09.930> go

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
this apart is not that hard and if we go

little rubber pieces there's four of

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.750 
little rubber pieces there's four of
them<00:05:52.140> and<00:05:52.470> what<00:05:53.070> those<00:05:53.220> are<00:05:53.430> actually<00:05:53.669> going

to<00:05:53.850> do<00:05:53.940> is<00:05:54.150> less<00:05:54.600> vibration<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:55.470> when<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.710> fan

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
to do is less vibration so when the fan

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.610 
to do is less vibration so when the fan
is<00:05:55.919> running<00:05:56.070> of<00:05:56.760> course<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:57.539> these<00:05:58.410> little

is running of course the these little
rubber<00:05:58.710> pieces<00:05:59.010> will<00:05:59.280> dampen<00:05:59.639> that<00:05:59.700> vibration

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
rubber pieces will dampen that vibration

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:01.879 
rubber pieces will dampen that vibration
and<00:06:00.690> another<00:06:01.440> thing<00:06:01.560> i<00:06:01.650> want<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.800> mention
