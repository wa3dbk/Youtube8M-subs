00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.100
 iomega i hope you are doing well in 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.810
 anyway me it's the great shape we get 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.900
 find today for a new 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.160
 episode of the mysteries of gta 5 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.380
 today we are going to talk about drilling 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.820
 and g3 or also called deep forage 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.250
 colas what is it will tell me 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.890
 you drilling and g3 is a drill 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.190
 carried out from 24 May 1970 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.660
 until 1989 in russia the purpose of this 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 drilling is to dig the most 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.320
 deeply possible in order to cross 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.820
 the rump perez and so access the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.070
 words to better understand his 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 composition and internal mechanisms 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.620
 of the head to remember that this is the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.140
 the deepest courage with 2262 meters 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.479
 deep by now let's talk 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.100
 rather of those who have an account on him 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.140
 or people said they heard 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.309
 voices coming from the deepest of the borehole and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.190
 others say it's the entrance to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.500
 hell are you wondering surely 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.460
 why am I talking about that? 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.320
 to see with gta 5 gt anyway you 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 surely know the career of GTA 5 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.440
 7 cases laughs and already figured in gta 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.210
 san andreas but was a little different 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.810
 so now we're going to look on 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.350
 google maps 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.030
 the equivalent to the career of GTA 5 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.320
 thanks to the coordinates 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.469
 we can see that it looks like a lot 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.869
 but a few more details 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.729
 details here now we are 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.920
 let's see the equivalent of that of gta 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.539
 San Andreas 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.300
 this has a pretty mysterious history of 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:47.090
 herel car 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.880
 because she tells children tells no 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.579
 in 2007 six miners were caught up to 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.770
 the interior and three firefighters tried 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.659
 to save them but were also caught 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.540
 by a kind of avalanche 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.540
 inside two 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.030
 of the mines quarry of the cadière 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.580
 and monruz inches and the sump in all 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.640
 this guys it's not that maké die 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.690
 all of them all dead but that's 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.630
 that bodies have never been 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.450
 found is still weird 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.170
 there was a lot of research during 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.860
 bad weather and the horns were not 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.620
 never found 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.480
 as of today in 2015 the courses 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.740
 have still not been found I do not 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.270
 do not know if you still need 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.640
 research or if they dropped 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.770
 but personally I find it very 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.140
 weird the heather pub in all this 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.460
 is that gta san andreas came out in 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.770
 2004 and we all know 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.050
 that gta san andreas when he places 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.570
 places when they do something 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.870
 they do not do anything for nothing 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.790
 eels under rock as they say so 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.380
 I find it odd especially that low to 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.750
 left I said gta san andreas is 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.510
 released in 2004 and these happened 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.130
 in 2007 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.550
 rockstar loves the paranormal we know 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.560
 all and as I said well we are 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.630
 even better than every suspicious place 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.900
 in the game hides something 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.640
 so as I said 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.890
 there is eel on eel under rock 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.950
 I do not know in any case I do not 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.060
 really do not know what to think 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.819
 I do not lie I ask myself a lot of 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.790
 questions but without necessarily without 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.170
 necessarily find logical answers 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.980
 respondents find but are not 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.450
 necessarily very logical so 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.530
 so here we go 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.280
 there is not necessarily 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.660
 great thing to say about that now this 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.470
 what I would like to know is what is 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.470
 what do you think about it? 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.870
 do you have any ideas is this 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.150
 that you have clues me very 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.430
 personally low right now I do not 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.930
 find nothing I really want to do 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.760
 I really wanted to get a shot 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.650
 on it because it's really very 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.060
 weird and above all was based on the 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.630
 reality and 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.270
 and so that's good, we noticed that 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.430
 well precisely in gta 5 we do not have the 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.690
 even the same mine 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.400
 finally the same career forgiveness because 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.470
 well I think that since that happened 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.080
 that they decided to change but 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.660
 why not directly remove the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.790
 whole career the worst is that 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.950
 now we can ask ourselves 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.260
 questions guys because if you 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.780
 realize 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.350
 the mine that is in gta finally the mine 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:35.139
 excuse me with mine the 4f that is 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.669
 who is in gta 5 in real life 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:41.229
 so the equivalent in real life 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.500
 it's a career that's very, very 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.580
 very very close to area 51 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.949
 so it's still weird because 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.030
 in gta san andreas zone 51 is 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.560
 find in f 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.039
 and here we know very well that the desert 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.030
 bryant does not have much in fact and ba 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.930
 it's still weird that 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.060
 we find a career of this place 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.250
 of 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.840
 one because there is very close to the area 51 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.230
 would that mean anything 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.440
 thing is that that would mean that he 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.820
 are UFOs we all know that area 51 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.610
 low 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.300
 we all believe and then we are sure 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.960
 than 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.819
 it hides incredible things from 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.780
 things that could change the world 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.330
 so personally now I do not 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.129
 do not know I do not know what to believe 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.139
 do not want to become paranoid in full 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.650
 video but it's true that it's really 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.919
 very weird 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.740
 especially if you go in this 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.419
 career in on google maps you 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.060
 can see that instead of having a 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.520
 little man when you go to see the 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.419
 route from this place instead of having a 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.199
 little guy you have a little 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.330
 Flying saucer 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.930
 it's a little hope that google earth 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.729
 google hertz sorry then so here's the 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.740
 guys tell me what are you in 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.840
 think frankly it's a mystery 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.510
 Great 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.410
 super mid-serious really very curious 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.949
 very weird here is anyway me I 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:10.440
 you have pretty much said everything about that 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.970
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.449
 see that these mysteries a little different 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.580
 others 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:19.520
 in any case guys I tell you to 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.520
 very soon and I still give you 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.650
 I thank you again for all this 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.300
 encouragement that you give that makes 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.460
 great fun and PC on all that I 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.000
 motivates him to continue his emissaries on 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.409
 gta 5 and then my videos what in all 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.449
 case guys I tell you to very 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.449
 soon and go ciao
