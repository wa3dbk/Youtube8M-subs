00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 the college dance program 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.650
 saint-anne is both a program 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.119
 very get up in the past but 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.910
 also that offers a beautiful 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.710
 complementarity or jazz dance and the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.970
 bora dance 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.500
 we also have the chance to offer our 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.480
 first and second round 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.850
 initiation to folk dance 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.850
 international and Flemish syco 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.809
 the holy goal of not knowing 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.910
 formally it is not very serious 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.910
 but to open to a sure quiet 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.809
 to open to a sportswoman that allows 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.809
 to inhibit now 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.250
 proof that if it pushes us is 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.430
 really a maximum it's the pressure 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.000
 then the same ones ask for a coach of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.890
 professional dance and thought 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.810
 killers that makes it on stage do not make 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.060
 that perform bison movements 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.009
 also the chance to show any 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.549
 the emotion behind the kia 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.549
 centricity 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.830
 to work as a team develops 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.470
 really who you are as a dancer 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.090
 I'm also discovering as 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.770
 personality in the way that dances 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.450
 in the way of tamesna react to the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.830
 group opposite we finish to react by 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.740
 report to critics also made for you 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.270
 so give the corner where I am 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.550
 when I started yet it's 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.670
 always what I guess 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.670
 he 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.830
 he 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.190
 and 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.370
 in 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.370
 Yes
