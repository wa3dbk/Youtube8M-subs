best players in the league I think he

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.279 
best players in the league I think he
does<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.510> fair<00:00:28.260> bit<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:29.480> light<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
does get a fair bit of light because of

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.049 
does get a fair bit of light because of
it<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.740> not<00:00:31.920> enough<00:00:31.980> because<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.640> really<00:00:32.910> think

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059
