Mouse and what you're looking at on the
screen<00:00:17.760> right<00:00:18.030> now<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:19.230> ergonomic<00:00:19.410> Mouse

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
screen right now is an ergonomic Mouse

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.570 
screen right now is an ergonomic Mouse
and<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> reason<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.539> because

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
and the reason I have this is because

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.480 
and the reason I have this is because
over<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.820> years<00:00:23.990> because<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.020> my<00:00:25.260> work<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
over the years because of my work on a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.210 
over the years because of my work on a
computer<00:00:26.970> everyday<00:00:27.510> 1012<00:00:28.410> hours<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.920> day

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
computer everyday 1012 hours a day

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.820 
computer everyday 1012 hours a day
I've<00:00:30.180> developed<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:30.990> bad<00:00:31.260> case<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
I've developed a really bad case of a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250 
I've developed a really bad case of a
tendinitis<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.609> my<00:00:32.940> wrist<00:00:33.390> area<00:00:33.569> in<00:00:33.929> my<00:00:34.019> hand

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
tendinitis on my wrist area in my hand

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.090 
tendinitis on my wrist area in my hand
and<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.969> joints<00:00:36.569> here<00:00:36.839> and<00:00:37.170> also<00:00:37.350> all<00:00:37.589> tendons

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and the joints here and also all tendons

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.200 
and the joints here and also all tendons
up<00:00:38.249> top<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:39.149> really<00:00:39.839> painful<00:00:40.199> so<00:00:40.760> I<00:00:41.760> had<00:00:42.030> to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
up top is really painful so I had to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.529 
up top is really painful so I had to
look<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.539> an<00:00:42.600> alternative<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.999> when<00:00:44.999> I<00:00:45.030> did

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
look for an alternative and when I did

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.180 
look for an alternative and when I did
some<00:00:45.780> research<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.319> the<00:00:46.469> internet<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.859> found

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
some research on the internet I found

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.319 
some research on the internet I found
out<00:00:47.339> that<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.670> actually<00:00:47.699> make<00:00:48.149> these

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
out that they actually make these

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.739 
out that they actually make these
ergonomic<00:00:48.929> Mouse<00:00:49.109> and<00:00:49.760> it's<00:00:50.760> helped<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> lot<00:00:51.269> so

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
ergonomic Mouse and it's helped a lot so

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.459 
ergonomic Mouse and it's helped a lot so
let<00:00:51.989> me<00:00:52.049> talk<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.229> little<00:00:52.350> bit<00:00:52.649> more<00:00:52.829> about<00:00:53.069> why

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
let me talk a little bit more about why

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.930 
let me talk a little bit more about why
the<00:00:55.469> design<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.190> look<00:00:56.429> so<00:00:56.579> different

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the design of this look so different

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.479 
the design of this look so different
than<00:00:57.089> a<00:00:57.239> traditional<00:00:57.839> mouse<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.309> bring

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
than a traditional mouse so if I bring

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.539 
than a traditional mouse so if I bring
in<00:00:59.639> a<00:00:59.850> regular<00:01:00.420> Mouse<00:01:00.569> and<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.829> put<00:01:02.069> my<00:01:02.159> hand<00:01:02.370> on

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
in a regular Mouse and I put my hand on

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.520 
in a regular Mouse and I put my hand on
it<00:01:02.579> you'll<00:01:02.819> notice<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.299> my<00:01:04.229> hand<00:01:04.409> position

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it you'll notice that my hand position

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.639 
it you'll notice that my hand position
is<00:01:05.009> pretty<00:01:05.430> much<00:01:05.519> parallel<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.289> table

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
is pretty much parallel to the table

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.870 
is pretty much parallel to the table
here<00:01:07.939> now<00:01:09.170> by<00:01:10.170> having<00:01:10.399> your<00:01:11.399> hand<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.759> this

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
here now by having your hand in this

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.190 
here now by having your hand in this
position<00:01:12.329> you<00:01:12.479> actually<00:01:12.780> put<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> lot<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
position you actually put a lot of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.249 
position you actually put a lot of
stress<00:01:13.469> on<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.829> wrist<00:01:14.670> area<00:01:15.079> because<00:01:16.079> you're

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
stress on the wrist area because you're

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950 
stress on the wrist area because you're
actually<00:01:16.500> rotating<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.219> hand<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:18.840> this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
actually rotating your hand to this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.560 
actually rotating your hand to this
position<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.649> flat<00:01:19.950> position<00:01:20.359> your<00:01:21.359> hand

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
position to this flat position your hand

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
position to this flat position your hand
naturally<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.350> comfortable<00:01:22.859> in<00:01:23.039> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
naturally is more comfortable in a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.690 
naturally is more comfortable in a
vertical<00:01:23.789> position<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:25.039> by<00:01:26.039> rotating<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
vertical position and by rotating it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.660 
vertical position and by rotating it
this<00:01:26.880> way<00:01:27.170> some<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.289> you<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.619> myself<00:01:28.859> might

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this way some of you like myself might

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.880 
this way some of you like myself might
have<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> problem<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:31.229> your<00:01:31.350> joints<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.799> your

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
have a problem with your joints and your

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.700 
have a problem with your joints and your
wrist<00:01:32.130> area<00:01:32.359> so<00:01:33.359> I<00:01:33.689> found<00:01:33.929> this<00:01:33.990> organ<00:01:34.320> ammos

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
wrist area so I found this organ ammos

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.980 
wrist area so I found this organ ammos
on<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> internet<00:01:35.429> and<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.600> kind<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> clever

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
on the internet and it's kind of clever

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.709 
on the internet and it's kind of clever
how<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.530> designed<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:38.909> they've

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
how they designed this because they've

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.870 
how they designed this because they've
taken<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.320> left<00:01:40.859> mouse<00:01:41.070> button<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.520> right

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
taken the left mouse button and right

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.440 
taken the left mouse button and right
mouse<00:01:42.030> button<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:43.880> they've<00:01:44.880> turned<00:01:45.149> this

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
mouse button and if they've turned this

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 
mouse button and if they've turned this
to<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.960> vertical<00:01:46.380> position<00:01:46.640> almost

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
to more of a vertical position almost

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.859 
to more of a vertical position almost
like<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.789> 45<00:01:48.179> degrees<00:01:48.539> and<00:01:49.399> by<00:01:50.399> doing<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.869> now

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
like a 45 degrees and by doing that now

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.830 
like a 45 degrees and by doing that now
when<00:01:52.289> I<00:01:52.320> put<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:52.590> hand<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.310> Mouse<00:01:53.579> my<00:01:54.570> hand

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
when I put my hand on this Mouse my hand

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.309 
when I put my hand on this Mouse my hand
is<00:01:54.960> almost<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.499> a<00:01:55.770> vertical<00:01:56.070> position<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.319> I

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
is almost in a vertical position and I

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.340 
is almost in a vertical position and I
noticed<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.950> after<00:01:59.939> using<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.319> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
noticed that after using this for a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.889 
noticed that after using this for a
couple<00:02:01.770> weeks<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.039> this<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.240> helped<00:02:03.509> help

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
couple weeks now this really helped help
