00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
first time and last but not least you

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.170 
first time and last but not least you
get<00:00:48.350> loads<00:00:49.010> of<00:00:49.190> these<00:00:49.370> gear<00:00:49.820> shifting

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
get loads of these gear shifting

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.060 
get loads of these gear shifting
elements<00:00:50.720> and<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.110> freerunning<00:00:51.620> red<00:00:51.829> gear

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
elements and the freerunning red gear

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.030 
elements and the freerunning red gear
wheels<00:00:52.370> as<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:54.290> see<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.680> model<00:00:54.950> is

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
wheels as you can see the model is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.020 
wheels as you can see the model is
extremely<00:00:55.489> big<00:00:55.970> so<00:00:56.899> we<00:00:57.170> needed<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.800> make<00:00:58.640> the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
extremely big so we needed to make the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.000 
extremely big so we needed to make the
boom<00:00:59.239> extendable<00:00:59.930> as<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.559> real-life

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
boom extendable as on the real-life

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.980 
boom extendable as on the real-life
machine<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.390> you<00:01:02.420> just<00:01:02.870> take<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:03.380> part<00:01:03.710> off

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:04.990 
machine so you just take this part off

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.459 
machine so you just take this part off
unplug<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.259> tip<00:01:07.219> of<00:01:07.429> the<00:01:07.729> boom<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.350> extend<00:01:09.350> it

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
unplug the tip of the boom and extend it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:14.919 
unplug the tip of the boom and extend it
like<00:01:09.619> this<00:01:12.369> it's<00:01:13.369> fairly<00:01:13.520> easy<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.119> makes<00:01:14.749> the

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
like this it's fairly easy and makes the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.879 
like this it's fairly easy and makes the
model<00:01:15.170> even<00:01:15.409> higher<00:01:16.149> and<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:18.170> can<00:01:18.380> customize

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:18.889 
model even higher and you can customize

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:21.010 
model even higher and you can customize
the<00:01:19.159> height<00:01:19.310> of<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.670> boom<00:01:19.819> however<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.780> want

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
the height of the boom however you want

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.499 
the height of the boom however you want
it<00:01:21.319> has<00:01:22.189> what<00:01:22.369> comes<00:01:22.639> with<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.909> manually

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509

change the direction of the function we
will<00:02:08.270> show<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.479> how<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.840> works<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:10.510> first<00:02:11.510> you

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
will show you how it works so first you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.600 
will show you how it works so first you
start<00:02:12.110> with<00:02:12.379> powering<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.220> batteries<00:02:13.549> on
