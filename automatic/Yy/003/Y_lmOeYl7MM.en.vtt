00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.550
 hi everyone selection Thursday 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.780
 how are you ok I'm pretty good so 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.720
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.700
 any new video on gta 5 solo 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 so to show you two colors 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.710
 so one of the subscriber called 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.300
 damien dubois in a dedication to you if 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.970
 you see this video is our color 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.740
 that I did but as soon as 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.629
 I actually finished the color of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.019
 damien so here we are at the 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.019

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.760
 here 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.890
 2 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.660
 we will go directly to the second 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.670
 color so paint main color 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.399
 metallized and you go get the blue 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.899
 dark 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:17.080
 I believe it must be not so far that 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:21.490
 this is dark blue j with a writing from 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.790
 torino red simply so then 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.380
 red torino victorino here it is so 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.760
 already the effect is quite nice 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.460
 so it's not finished so so here is 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.980
 in secondary colors but go there 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.780
 in metallized as always and you 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.780

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:50.700

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.870
 episodes of this series there a type of 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.020
 road you put what you want 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.510

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.200

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.800
