00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.450 

well<00:00:06.980> my<00:00:07.190> solution<00:00:07.819> is<00:00:08.120> to<00:00:08.600> use<00:00:08.630> five<00:00:09.530> basic

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
well my solution is to use five basic

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.240 
well my solution is to use five basic
shapes<00:00:10.790> the<00:00:11.420> oblong<00:00:11.900> the<00:00:12.110> square<00:00:12.500> the<00:00:12.980> circle

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
shapes the oblong the square the circle

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.630 
shapes the oblong the square the circle
the<00:00:13.879> oval<00:00:14.420> and<00:00:14.750> the<00:00:14.900> triangle<00:00:15.440> and<00:00:16.340> they<00:00:16.430> don't

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
the oval and the triangle and they don't

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.600 
the oval and the triangle and they don't
have<00:00:16.880> to<00:00:17.090> be<00:00:17.289> exactly<00:00:18.289> that<00:00:18.590> size<00:00:19.279> or<00:00:19.580> shape

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
have to be exactly that size or shape

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.589 
have to be exactly that size or shape
you<00:00:20.449> can<00:00:21.050> have<00:00:21.289> an<00:00:21.560> oblong<00:00:22.220> that's<00:00:22.910> very<00:00:23.330> long

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
you can have an oblong that's very long

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.370 
you can have an oblong that's very long
and<00:00:23.839> thin<00:00:24.140> that<00:00:24.500> way<00:00:24.769> or<00:00:25.039> that<00:00:25.820> way<00:00:26.380> and

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
and thin that way or that way and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.380 
and thin that way or that way and
similarly<00:00:28.220> with<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:28.519> triangle<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.240> could

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
similarly with the triangle you could

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.650 
similarly with the triangle you could
have<00:00:29.509> a<00:00:29.539> long<00:00:30.009> thin<00:00:31.009> triangle<00:00:31.759> like<00:00:31.910> that<00:00:31.939> or

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
have a long thin triangle like that or

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.310 
have a long thin triangle like that or
you<00:00:33.020> could<00:00:33.200> have<00:00:33.380> a<00:00:34.000> triangle<00:00:35.000> with<00:00:35.270> all<00:00:35.810> equal

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
you could have a triangle with all equal

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.830 
you could have a triangle with all equal
sides<00:00:36.350> like<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:37.550> doesn't<00:00:37.850> matter<00:00:38.239> each

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
sides like that it doesn't matter each

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.170 
sides like that it doesn't matter each
of<00:00:39.170> those<00:00:39.379> shapes<00:00:39.800> can<00:00:40.250> be<00:00:40.430> stretched<00:00:40.820> and

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
of those shapes can be stretched and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.569 
of those shapes can be stretched and
manipulated<00:00:41.899> in<00:00:41.989> whatever<00:00:42.199> way<00:00:42.469> you<00:00:42.530> want<00:00:42.860> to

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
manipulated in whatever way you want to

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.790 
manipulated in whatever way you want to
give<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.510> basic<00:00:45.020> framework<00:00:45.379> the

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
give you the basic framework the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.189 
give you the basic framework the
scaffolding<00:00:46.550> if<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:46.760> like<00:00:46.969> of<00:00:47.149> any<00:00:47.690> picture

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199

students all sorts of problems
you<00:00:56.899> can<00:00:57.079> use<00:00:57.260> a<00:00:57.289> whole<00:00:57.500> variety<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:58.160> basic

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
you can use a whole variety of basic

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.430 
you can use a whole variety of basic
shapes<00:00:58.940> for<00:00:59.059> instance<00:00:59.539> if<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.780> wanted<00:01:00.109> to<00:01:00.289> you

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
shapes for instance if you wanted to you

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.090 
shapes for instance if you wanted to you
to<00:01:00.800> do<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.309> fir<00:01:01.609> tree<00:01:01.640> then<00:01:02.890> nothing<00:01:03.890> more

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
to do a fir tree then nothing more

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.270 
to do a fir tree then nothing more
complicated<00:01:04.910> than<00:01:05.449> an<00:01:05.960> elongated<00:01:06.770> triangle

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
complicated than an elongated triangle

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.790 
complicated than an elongated triangle
and<00:01:07.490> perhaps<00:01:07.940> an<00:01:08.420> oblong<00:01:09.110> underneath<00:01:09.590> that

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
and perhaps an oblong underneath that

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.520 
and perhaps an oblong underneath that
gives<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.280> basic<00:01:10.700> shape<00:01:11.230> have<00:01:12.230> you<00:01:12.350> ever

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
gives you the basic shape have you ever

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.530 
gives you the basic shape have you ever
played<00:01:12.770> cards<00:01:13.340> in<00:01:13.460> your<00:01:13.490> life<00:01:13.760> I'm<00:01:14.150> sure<00:01:14.210> you

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
played cards in your life I'm sure you

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.840 
played cards in your life I'm sure you
must've<00:01:14.900> done<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.650> I'm<00:01:16.010> sure<00:01:16.220> some<00:01:16.610> time

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
must've done and I'm sure some time

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.080 
must've done and I'm sure some time
you'll<00:01:17.090> have<00:01:17.210> picked<00:01:17.450> up<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.750> ace<00:01:17.870> of<00:01:18.110> clubs

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
you'll have picked up the ace of clubs

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.500 
you'll have picked up the ace of clubs
and<00:01:20.090> what<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.660> ace<00:01:20.780> of<00:01:21.020> clubs<00:01:21.250> except

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
and what is the ace of clubs except

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.870 
and what is the ace of clubs except
three<00:01:23.510> circles<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.810> bit<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.170> triangle

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
three circles and a bit of a triangle

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.160 
three circles and a bit of a triangle
okay<00:01:28.880> let's<00:01:29.120> start<00:01:29.390> stretching<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.110> a

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
okay let's start stretching that a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.030 
okay let's start stretching that a
little<00:01:30.500> bit<00:01:30.650> let's<00:01:31.460> make<00:01:31.700> one<00:01:31.910> circle<00:01:32.480> here

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
little bit let's make one circle here

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.070 
little bit let's make one circle here
like<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:34.310> let's<00:01:34.610> make<00:01:35.000> one<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.420> bit<00:01:35.750> bigger

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
like that let's make one a bit bigger

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.060 
like that let's make one a bit bigger
here<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:38.030> one<00:01:38.300> somewhere<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:39.260> between<00:01:39.410> bigger

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
here and one somewhere in between bigger

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.640 
here and one somewhere in between bigger
than<00:01:40.250> that<00:01:40.370> but<00:01:40.550> smaller<00:01:40.940> than<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.410> start<00:01:42.410> to

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
than that but smaller than that start to

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.840 
than that but smaller than that start to
develop<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:44.350> little<00:01:45.350> bit<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.650> a<00:01:45.710> tree<00:01:46.010> so<00:01:46.820> that

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
develop a little bit of a tree so that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.840 
develop a little bit of a tree so that
it<00:01:47.360> really<00:01:47.660> is<00:01:47.930> starting<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.740> distorted<00:01:49.730> all

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
it really is starting to distorted all

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.730 
it really is starting to distorted all
sorts<00:01:50.180> of<00:01:50.210> directions<00:01:50.390> but<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.170> main<00:01:51.410> thing

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
sorts of directions but the main thing

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.310 
sorts of directions but the main thing
the<00:01:51.920> most<00:01:52.100> important<00:01:52.790> thing<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.330> that<00:01:53.930> it's

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
the most important thing is that it's

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.460 
the most important thing is that it's
starting<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.130> really<00:01:55.460> look<00:01:55.850> like<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:56.470> solitaire

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
starting to really look like a solitaire

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.840 
starting to really look like a solitaire
in<00:01:57.680> full<00:01:58.340> bloom<00:01:58.640> from<00:01:59.740> three<00:02:00.740> circles<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.640> a

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
in full bloom from three circles and a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.760 
in full bloom from three circles and a
bit<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.120> triangle<00:02:02.540> otherwise<00:02:03.140> known<00:02:03.470> as<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
bit of a triangle otherwise known as the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.359 
bit of a triangle otherwise known as the
ace<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:04.100> clubs

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.160 

now<00:02:07.369> here<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.760> one<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.149> always<00:02:08.300> causes<00:02:09.140> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
now here is one that always causes a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.470 
now here is one that always causes a
panic<00:02:09.590> with<00:02:09.770> students<00:02:10.399> when<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.120> put<00:02:11.300> this

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
panic with students when you put this

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.600 
panic with students when you put this
sort<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.780> thing<00:02:11.990> in<00:02:12.110> front<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.440> them<00:02:12.560> for<00:02:13.490> this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
sort of thing in front of them for this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.540 
sort of thing in front of them for this
one<00:02:13.850> I've<00:02:14.180> put<00:02:14.450> an<00:02:14.569> acetate<00:02:15.050> over<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.130> horse's

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
one I've put an acetate over the horse's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.180 
one I've put an acetate over the horse's
photograph<00:02:17.120> now<00:02:17.750> let's<00:02:18.020> just<00:02:18.260> concentrate<00:02:18.560> on

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
photograph now let's just concentrate on

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.740 
photograph now let's just concentrate on
some<00:02:19.430> big<00:02:19.700> shapes<00:02:20.560> there's<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.950> triangle

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
some big shapes there's a triangle

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.140 
some big shapes there's a triangle
there's<00:02:23.980> another<00:02:24.980> triangle<00:02:25.489> with<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> squared

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
there's another triangle with a squared

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.180 
there's another triangle with a squared
off<00:02:26.300> end<00:02:26.569> you've<00:02:27.560> got<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.709> little<00:02:27.950> bit<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.130> a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
off end you've got a little bit of a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.220 
off end you've got a little bit of a
triangle<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> underneath<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.930> belly

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
triangle for the underneath of the belly

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.979 
triangle for the underneath of the belly
and<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:30.920> you've<00:02:31.100> got<00:02:31.280> another<00:02:31.569> oblong<00:02:32.569> here

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
and then you've got another oblong here

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.290 
and then you've got another oblong here
like<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:34.790> then<00:02:35.030> come<00:02:35.330> down<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:37.090> yes<00:02:38.090> uh

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
like that we then come down to yes uh

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.810 
like that we then come down to yes uh
notice<00:02:38.989> of<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.230> triangle<00:02:39.650> oh<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.550> you've<00:02:40.640> also

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
notice of a triangle oh and you've also

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.940 
notice of a triangle oh and you've also
extended<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.590> leg<00:02:44.050> as<00:02:45.050> an<00:02:45.290> oblong<00:02:45.650> there

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
extended the leg as an oblong there

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.940 
extended the leg as an oblong there
another<00:02:46.880> short<00:02:47.510> oblong<00:02:48.019> there<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.739> knee

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
another short oblong there to the knee

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.250 
another short oblong there to the knee
and<00:02:49.280> all<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:50.120> short<00:02:50.390> well<00:02:50.600> almost<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.110> square

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
and all this short well almost a square

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.780 
and all this short well almost a square
and<00:02:51.920> then<00:02:52.280> finally<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.680> triangle<00:02:54.680> right<00:02:55.580> we've

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
and then finally a triangle right we've

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.150 
and then finally a triangle right we've
taken<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.209> photograph<00:02:56.420> away<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.319> even

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
taken the photograph away and even

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.979 
taken the photograph away and even
without<00:02:58.280> me<00:02:58.610> doing<00:02:58.819> anything<00:02:58.940> about<00:02:59.780> that

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
without me doing anything about that

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.410 
without me doing anything about that
picture<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.620> can<00:03:00.800> see<00:03:01.069> right<00:03:01.310> away<00:03:01.790> you've

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
picture you can see right away you've

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.559 
picture you can see right away you've
got<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.900> semblance<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:04.310> heavy<00:03:04.610> horse<00:03:05.060> and

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
got the semblance of a heavy horse and

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.590 
got the semblance of a heavy horse and
the<00:03:06.350> waist<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.100> mass<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.760> horse<00:03:08.060> all

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
the waist and the mass of that horse all

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.979 
the waist and the mass of that horse all
of<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.319> shapes<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:10.040> all<00:03:10.519> been<00:03:10.910> produced<00:03:11.750> in

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
of the shapes have all been produced in

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.390 
of the shapes have all been produced in
the<00:03:12.470> right<00:03:12.769> proportion<00:03:13.810> these<00:03:14.810> shapes<00:03:15.590> don't

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
the right proportion these shapes don't

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.900 
the right proportion these shapes don't
have<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.060> be<00:03:17.180> perfect<00:03:17.810> first<00:03:18.440> time<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:19.700> can

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
have to be perfect first time you can

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.650 
have to be perfect first time you can
change<00:03:20.840> them<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.440> mix<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.920> match<00:03:22.160> as<00:03:23.060> much<00:03:23.450> as

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
change them and mix and match as much as

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.860 
change them and mix and match as much as
you<00:03:23.840> want<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.290> as<00:03:24.440> much<00:03:24.470> as<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.980> need<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.250> so

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
you want to as much as you need to so

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.710 
you want to as much as you need to so
right<00:03:26.870> away<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:27.230> can<00:03:27.380> see<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.829> that<00:03:28.450> front<00:03:29.450> leg

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
right away I can see that that front leg

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.050 
right away I can see that that front leg
needs<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.799> be<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:31.010> little<00:03:31.190> bit<00:03:31.400> longer<00:03:31.640> now<00:03:31.880> you

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
needs to be a little bit longer now you

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.970 
needs to be a little bit longer now you
see<00:03:32.329> a<00:03:32.360> hope<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.840> can<00:03:32.989> see<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.380> need<00:03:33.650> for

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
see a hope you can see the need for

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.979 
see a hope you can see the need for
doing<00:03:34.880> these<00:03:35.000> quite<00:03:35.390> light<00:03:35.630> because<00:03:35.900> you're

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
doing these quite light because you're

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.069 
doing these quite light because you're
going<00:03:36.109> to<00:03:36.170> have<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.350> rub<00:03:36.560> these<00:03:38.079> construction

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
going to have to rub these construction

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.729 
going to have to rub these construction
lines<00:03:39.109> out<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:41.540> perhaps<00:03:41.930> needs<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.410> be<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.530> bit

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
lines out that perhaps needs to be a bit

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:43.870 
lines out that perhaps needs to be a bit
deeper<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.250> do<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.400> see<00:03:43.609> what's<00:03:43.790> happening

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
deeper but do you see what's happening

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.660 
deeper but do you see what's happening
I'm<00:03:44.450> not<00:03:44.989> worried<00:03:45.709> about<00:03:45.799> getting<00:03:46.280> him<00:03:46.400> in<00:03:46.519> the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
I'm not worried about getting him in the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.920 
I'm not worried about getting him in the
wrong<00:03:46.820> place<00:03:47.239> because<00:03:48.170> with<00:03:48.590> them<00:03:48.799> being

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
wrong place because with them being

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.990 
wrong place because with them being
construction<00:03:50.930> lines<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.530> know<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.880> they're

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
construction lines I know that they're

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.280 
construction lines I know that they're
going<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.180> get<00:03:53.269> rubbed<00:03:53.570> out<00:03:53.750> or<00:03:54.019> they're<00:03:54.140> going

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
going to get rubbed out or they're going

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.819 
going to get rubbed out or they're going
to<00:03:54.350> get<00:03:54.440> altered<00:03:54.920> as<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.400> need<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:56.799> right<00:03:57.799> now

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
to get altered as I need to right now

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.280 
to get altered as I need to right now
I'm<00:03:58.459> not<00:03:59.030> rubbing<00:03:59.329> all<00:03:59.630> these<00:03:59.840> lines<00:04:00.109> out

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
I'm not rubbing all these lines out

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.949 
I'm not rubbing all these lines out
completely<00:04:00.829> I'm<00:04:01.489> just<00:04:01.940> taking<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.510> bulk<00:04:02.780> of

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
completely I'm just taking the bulk of

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.440 
completely I'm just taking the bulk of
them<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:03.290> should<00:04:03.560> still<00:04:03.859> be<00:04:04.010> able<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.310> see<00:04:04.670> the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
them you should still be able to see the

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.380 
them you should still be able to see the
outline<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.290> horse<00:04:07.030> well<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.150> first

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
outline of the horse well the first

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.710 
outline of the horse well the first
thing<00:04:08.600> I'm<00:04:08.780> going<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.140> do<00:04:09.320> is<00:04:09.829> to<00:04:10.489> round<00:04:11.480> off

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
thing I'm going to do is to round off

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.850 
thing I'm going to do is to round off
the<00:04:11.900> ears

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
the ears

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.370 
the ears
you<00:04:13.520> can<00:04:13.700> see<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:14.090> now<00:04:14.300> I'm<00:04:14.510> able<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:15.050> very

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
you can see that now I'm able to very

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.020 
you can see that now I'm able to very
very<00:04:15.470> simply<00:04:16.720> draw<00:04:17.720> out<00:04:17.930> these<00:04:18.170> lines<00:04:18.650> in<00:04:19.130> a

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
very simply draw out these lines in a

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.980 
very simply draw out these lines in a
much<00:04:20.209> more<00:04:20.450> confident<00:04:21.140> manner<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:23.600> even<00:04:23.930> if

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
much more confident manner and even if

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.110 
much more confident manner and even if
it<00:04:24.110> is<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.560> little<00:04:24.980> bit<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.580> wrong<00:04:25.730> spots

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
it is in a little bit of the wrong spots

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.850 
it is in a little bit of the wrong spots
and<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:26.300> draw<00:04:26.570> something<00:04:26.960> slightly<00:04:27.290> wrong<00:04:27.530> it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
and you draw something slightly wrong it

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.980 
and you draw something slightly wrong it
