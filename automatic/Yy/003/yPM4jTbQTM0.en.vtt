00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.700
 good afternoon here we are a new 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.519
 video and as you see again on the map of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.959
 being if kids if I think it's the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.690
 fourth gameplay that I upload from this same 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.369
 map the truth is that in the end bored 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.560
 but even so he takes the example and in 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.390
 this map so you have to upload it there's no 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.330
 to go up days ago that I do not upload anything 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.039
 this map also but not like that 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.960
 It touches but good if I'm going to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.640
 say you see me using the msc with the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 silencer I told you that I would be testing 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.240
 weapons i would go testing mufflers i would go 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.769
 trying everything to injure me that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.270
 used a lot but I think with 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 silencer had not used it much 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
 I had still used it a little but 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.390
 not to get me to take out gameplays at 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.530
 better that you put a game 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.600
 as saying that try was with 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.220
 muffler not from good going decent 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.750
 I changed the other one and the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.060
 roll what in the end I decided to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.640
 try to get me a gameplay with her and 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.490
 it seems that left me as you see I have 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.530
 the lightning attack I carry helicopter 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.570
 took the shuar know that I uploaded a video 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.830
 already teaching the swarm shuar and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.870
 sorry the game I'm still wrong 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.250
 you know there is a video showing him the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.350
 first swarm to take me out so in 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.240
 This is obviously not sack me but good 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.009
 it's a pretty decent game 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.290
 good to comment what I want to talk 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.909
 and to tell you good that's not what has 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.240
 gone already trying some weapons and such and 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.680
 I wanted to climb 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.200
 as I was testing the weapons 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.909
 what do you think and all the good stuff 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.590
 what will I comment on first? 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.700
 that you see that I carry a gun now 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.710
 in the hand that would move the head 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.679
 the assault functions in this game is 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.289
 one thing that is totally 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.869
 unbalanced with submachine guns is not 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.659
 something that is exaggerated is impossible to win 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.340
 a 1 to 1 in k'ara k'ara with a person 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.119
 who carries a submachine gun if you carry a 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.429
 possible assault not like in war 3 that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.539
 you carry the cr and you had less 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.100
 possibilities to kill but you had 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.690
 some not in this game you do not have 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.060
 no chance of winning someone 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.860
 Have a submachine gun or obviously 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.409
 many a lot of media I have killed 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.310
 people with such an assault rifle 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.799
 looked like a person who is pretty much 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.720
 of your level playing the call of duty 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.310
 it's hard enough to kill him for saying 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.360
 impossible is the game in which the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.649
 Assault rifles are more 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.080
 unbalanced that's why you have not seen 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.849
 who has not yet seen only a gameplay 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.440
 with an assault rifle on my channel if not 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.760
 I'm wrong with the m 8 and if you have not 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.510
 seen no gameplay with a rifle 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.489
 assault not 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.140
 that soon I bring you gameplays with 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.480
 assault rifles but I also have 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.769
 I want to climb some and put on 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.060
 batteries with them but good I have them 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.760
 tried and the truth is that the only thing 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.409
 I used to be super nervous because 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.849
 I saw people shoot and shoot 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.220
 and shot and they did not die the group kills me 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.110
 this is me I think he hit three hundred 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.970
 bullets and then came the death chamber and 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.890
 It seems that I have not hit almost any 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.599
 impressive but it does not follow 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.760
 silenced is very noticeable also in 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.709
 weapons especially in the msc m is is 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.000
 note very much silencer once you 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.890
 you shoot a muffler then the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.530
 tests with grip itself 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.180
 gun and they say my mother little difference 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.859
 to the muffler that's not worn but 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.840
 well I said that I said I would try the 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.220
 weapons I would say that they seem to me and the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.840
 I really do not end this weapon if I have 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.900
 to put on a submachine gun with a silencer 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.730
 I prefer a lot before putting the mp7 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.079
 you know it was 17 because it's the one that most 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.209
 like with muffler I already said it when 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.260
 followed example and with her and if I have to 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.430
 give me some coincidence of what 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.840
 I prefer m precision or submachine guns 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.599
 It is always better to take them with 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.069
 silencer since if you play as a game 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.760
 I see that I do not stop moving around 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.069
 the map entering houses 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.019
 without stopping without stopping at any time 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.400
 it is always better to carry the silencer and 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.640
 that the enemies do not know where you are 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.010
 when you shoot obviously if you do not carry 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.329
 ghost or coldblooded in this game 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.760
 then you will also see on the radar 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.860
 but they do not always have eggs in the air 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.060
 they do not always have grape uvb it's so 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.099
 they do not always see you and it's always better 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.720
 to be able to wear a silencer and not 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.250
 see though sometimes this happens not you 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.629
 You put me in the town hall for me 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.340
 put a shot that bends you 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.200
 legs but they are not things that happen like that 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.610
 that nothing wanted to tell you that this weapon 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.140
 I quite like but still 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.870
 It does not end, it does not end with me 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.640
 muffler I prefer before the emt 7 and 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.260
 nothing kids wanted to tell you the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.000
 gameplay is ending a game 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.680
 pretty fast duel per team is 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.240
 something that I liked very much because 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.910
 teams that you know that their gameplay 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.340
 in this in this game in the black ops 2 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.750
 where you can not get out so much 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.400
 easily as on the other bikes already 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.800
 that the other ways can get you things 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.060
 with the objectives but I'm still going to 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.440
 keep going up town by teams that 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.600
 they are broken when you can get 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.860
 quite fast games like this one and 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.500
 nothing kids, I hope you have been purple 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.320
 you know, I'm going to keep uploading videos 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.970
 of white all butt you know that not me 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.380
 with whites 2 and still you will have your 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.910
 assault rifles that you told me 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.110
 more than one of the comments has not 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.550
 said still mother has said more than one 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.870
 of the comments that you want 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.760
 place with the assault rifles like this 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.320
 that you will have a video 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.700
 also explaining it of the athleti if you go 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.080
 using betis that because now 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.880
 they use many you think is piggy 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.310
 but I think it's a piggy 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.200
 use betis if you use them to 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.480
 but if you use them in a way 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.520
 tactics could be said in quotes 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.660
 It's not like I use them in both 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.590
 Last gameplays where I am 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.360
 using then 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.240
 I do not seem like a guard, but not a 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.580
 chair or a comment just for 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.860
 explain that but good 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.440
 focused more than anything on explaining it from 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.090
 Betis and still not bad 32 to 3 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.950
 pretty quickie kids I hope that you 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.320
 I have purple already you know I like favorites 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.040
 the video helps a lot and see you in 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.760
 the next video kids 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.760
 entity
