00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:05.370
 It is impressive to know what science studies are currently 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.580
 they are throwing 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.180
 proven experiments that are outdated could not be taken in 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.729
 count as something real 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:13.199
 and is that nowadays 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.589
 a Japanese doctor named masaru emoto to challenge her geniuses and scientists 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.669
 consistorials that seem to be taken out of a fairy tale is known for 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.050
 all that water has special and healing properties such as that 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.269
 they use the priests to bless for performing an exorcism 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.290
 but what is the difference from one peg to another without it being 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.280
 altered its molecular structure 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.670
 and in what way if you are you palpable with visible for your preparation 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.870
 only one question that was asked on a motorbike for which I use water from different 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.880
 parts of the world 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.860
 I started this experiment by freezing samples and taking pictures of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.480
 through a microscope of the small crystals that formed 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.870
 his surprise was greater 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.720
 When noticing the variations of the structure, the further away from the 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.930
 man had been brought from the water the photograph shows a surprising 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.840
 incomparable beauty 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.020
 ponce lakes some 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.730
 the state is not a mere loan concept of 1 500 in 1 150 thousand 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.450
 components inside the water 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.520
 indicated that they are constantly condemning experiments have been made 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.380
 where they have exposed settlement to that 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 words inti emotions 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 see for yourself the big difference 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.820
 It is shocking to know that water could form beautiful paintings as soon as possible 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.520
 to be photographed a prayer was made 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.870
 if he played a classical piece of music, he was probably given words 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.450
 kind as thank you very much and quite the opposite when it was more decided the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.710
 feelings the emotions that we suffer 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.180
 I understand that we are exposed every day they affect us terribly to 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.400
 our country 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.819
 it is necessary that we learn to three years 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.819
 Positive thinking in two weeks will be fine 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.119
 the negative feelings and emotions 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.119
 they make us feel more and more manifested 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:23.340
 no doubt 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.459
 that nature continues to surprise human capacity 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.629
 Well, if we take into account that our body is composed of 70 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.139
 cent of the vital fluid 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.369
 imagine how much it can cause in the body 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:37.899
 Everything that surrounds us 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.029
 we take daily
