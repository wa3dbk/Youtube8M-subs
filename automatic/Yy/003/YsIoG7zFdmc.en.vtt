00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.869 
language in their home they don't have
any<00:03:00.560> other<00:03:00.799> culture<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.340> their<00:03:01.459> home<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:01.790> if

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
any other culture in their home and if

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.030 
any other culture in their home and if
they<00:03:02.030> do<00:03:02.090> have<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.629> it's<00:03:02.780> particularly<00:03:03.530> only

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
they do have it it's particularly only

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.460 
they do have it it's particularly only
in<00:03:04.129> their<00:03:04.340> schools<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.900> think<00:03:05.930> they<00:03:06.260> lose

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
in their schools and I think they lose

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.140 
in their schools and I think they lose
that<00:03:06.680> sense<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:07.069> identity<00:03:07.519> they<00:03:07.790> don't<00:03:08.000> know

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
that sense of identity they don't know

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.990 
that sense of identity they don't know
where<00:03:08.390> they<00:03:08.659> belong<00:03:09.049> in<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.709> circle<00:03:10.159> and<00:03:10.489> I

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
where they belong in the circle and I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.210 
where they belong in the circle and I
hope<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.109> kids<00:03:12.349> will<00:03:13.180> understand<00:03:14.180> that

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
hope that the kids will understand that

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.039 
hope that the kids will understand that
their<00:03:16.220> culture<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.909> good<00:03:17.299> their<00:03:17.629> culture

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
their culture is good their culture

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.990 
their culture is good their culture
should<00:03:18.769> be<00:03:18.829> something<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.489> they<00:03:19.730> are<00:03:19.819> very

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
should be something that they are very

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.170 
should be something that they are very
proud<00:03:20.359> of<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.840> not<00:03:21.620> just<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.400> generality

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
proud of and not just in that generality

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.539 
proud of and not just in that generality
but<00:03:23.420> really<00:03:24.319> connect<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.129> their<00:03:25.250> heart

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
but really connect it to their heart

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.500 
but really connect it to their heart
that's<00:03:26.510> my<00:03:26.750> job<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.470> connect<00:03:27.970> teaching<00:03:28.970> to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
that's my job to connect teaching to

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.660 
that's my job to connect teaching to
their<00:03:29.659> mind<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.139> their<00:03:30.230> heart<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.489> as

their mind and their heart so that as

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.750 
their mind and their heart so that as
