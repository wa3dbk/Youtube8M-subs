trying to get my accuracy up a little
bit<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> i<00:01:01.800> know<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.219> obviously<00:01:02.670> going

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
bit and i know this is obviously going

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
bit and i know this is obviously going
to<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> skill<00:01:03.390> link<00:01:03.600> thing<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.799> out

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
to be the skill link thing and it out

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.740 
to be the skill link thing and it out
speeds<00:01:05.309> me<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.610> hits<00:01:05.760> me<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.000> tail<00:01:06.299> whip<00:01:06.510> so

speeds me and hits me with tail whip so

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.649 
speeds me and hits me with tail whip so
that's<00:01:06.960> obviously<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.890> take<00:01:08.280> my<00:01:08.540> far<00:01:09.540> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.320 
that's obviously going to take my far it
down<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.080> I've<00:01:10.170> got<00:01:10.350> no<00:01:10.850> I've<00:01:11.850> read<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.180> got

down so I've got no I've read just got

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.630 
down so I've got no I've read just got
nothing<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.750> health<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.229> defense<00:01:13.619> okay<00:01:14.580> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
nothing in health for defense okay so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.359

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
he's a life all of their obvious ly so I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
he's a life all of their obvious ly so I
bring<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.820> my<00:01:18.000> clink<00:01:18.750> clang<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:21.150> resist

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
bring in my clink clang to resist

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.899 
bring in my clink clang to resist
because<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.900> know<00:01:21.960> he<00:01:22.229> doesn't<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:23.490> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
because I know he doesn't have much that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.730 
because I know he doesn't have much that
can<00:01:24.000> actually<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.720> anything<00:01:25.110> really<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.439> me<00:01:25.650> at

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
can actually do anything really to me at

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
can actually do anything really to me at
all<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.060> know<00:01:27.119> he's<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> swap<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.960> or

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
all and I know he's going to swap out or

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
all and I know he's going to swap out or
go<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> u-turn<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.460> gives<00:01:30.090> me

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
go for a u-turn there so this gives me

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.910 
go for a u-turn there so this gives me
the<00:01:30.329> opportunity<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.960> go<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> gear<00:01:31.590> grind

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the opportunity to go for a gear grind

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.640 
the opportunity to go for a gear grind
on<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.490> switch<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650

on the switch that's really all this
thing<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:36.710> at<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:37.770> anyway<00:01:38.570> unfortunately

actually had a steel gym on there to

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.550 
actually had a steel gym on there to
power<00:02:06.119> out<00:02:06.240> gear<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.869> really<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.320> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
power out gear on I do really want to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.969 
power out gear on I do really want to
actually<00:02:08.060> use<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.770> break<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
actually use that up just to break the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.670 
actually use that up just to break the
substitute<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> thought<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:13.080> thought

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
substitute so I thought I thought

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.750 
substitute so I thought I thought
I could<00:02:13.829> break<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.159> with<00:02:14.219> a<00:02:14.280> week<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:14.640> move

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
I could break it with a week and move

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.979 
I could break it with a week and move
but<00:02:14.909> unfortunately<00:02:15.359> you<00:02:15.420> didn't<00:02:15.629> it's<00:02:15.750> quite

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
but unfortunately you didn't it's quite

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.830 
but unfortunately you didn't it's quite
tanky<00:02:16.500> even<00:02:16.890> with<00:02:17.040> plus<00:02:17.280> two<00:02:17.579> so<00:02:17.909> I<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.599> for<00:02:18.810> two

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
tanky even with plus two so I go for two

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.649 
tanky even with plus two so I go for two
wild<00:02:19.439> charges<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.370> try<00:02:20.609> to<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:21.030> while<00:02:21.239> charges

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
wild charges to try to to while charges

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.209 
wild charges to try to to while charges
are<00:02:21.750> obviously<00:02:21.989> going<00:02:22.109> to<00:02:22.170> break<00:02:22.409> it<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.739> knew

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
are obviously going to break it I knew

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.740 
are obviously going to break it I knew
at<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> start<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.879> he'd<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.120> carrying<00:02:24.719> a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
at the start that he'd be carrying a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.729 
at the start that he'd be carrying a
hidden<00:02:24.989> power<00:02:25.170> fire<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.629> so<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:28.170> was<00:02:28.319> cool<00:02:28.530> I

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
hidden power fire and so that was cool I

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.009 
hidden power fire and so that was cool I
was<00:02:29.069> just<00:02:29.159> hoping<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:30.180> was<00:02:30.569> just<00:02:30.689> hoping<00:02:30.840> you

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
was just hoping I was just hoping you

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.080 
was just hoping I was just hoping you
didn't<00:02:31.290> use<00:02:31.409> it<00:02:31.439> I<00:02:32.340> guess<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.819> was<00:02:32.909> kind<00:02:32.939> of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
didn't use it I guess it was kind of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.300 
didn't use it I guess it was kind of
wishful<00:02:33.209> thinking<00:02:33.689> so<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.469> misk<00:02:34.680> misk<00:02:34.769> elite

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
wishful thinking so that misk misk elite

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.670 
wishful thinking so that misk misk elite
gonna<00:02:35.519> cost<00:02:35.819> me<00:02:36.000> getting<00:02:36.510> rid<00:02:36.629> executor<00:02:37.500> or

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
gonna cost me getting rid executor or

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.599 
gonna cost me getting rid executor or
doing<00:02:38.219> heavy<00:02:38.430> damage<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:38.909> it<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.329> least<00:02:39.359> and<00:02:40.609> so

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
doing heavy damage to it at least and so

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.429 
doing heavy damage to it at least and so
yeah<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.969> was<00:02:42.060> my<00:02:42.150> second<00:02:42.480> Pokemon<00:02:42.810> down

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
yeah that was my second Pokemon down

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.229 
yeah that was my second Pokemon down
there<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:43.889> things<00:02:44.250> were<00:02:44.459> looking<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:45.030> little

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
there so things were looking a little

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.500 
there so things were looking a little
bit<00:02:46.040> shabby<00:02:47.040> at<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.370> point<00:02:47.609> in<00:02:47.669> the<00:02:47.760> match<00:02:47.909> so

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
bit shabby at this point in the match so

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.979 
bit shabby at this point in the match so
that<00:02:49.109> I<00:02:49.470> basically<00:02:50.459> bring<00:02:50.609> in<00:02:50.730> my<00:02:50.989> Metagross

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
that I basically bring in my Metagross

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.110 
that I basically bring in my Metagross
my<00:02:52.950> hair<00:02:53.220> across<00:02:53.459> how<00:02:53.879> did<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.060> get

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
my hair across how did I get

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.210 
my hair across how did I get
that<00:02:54.359> mixed<00:02:54.599> up<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.319> I'm<00:02:55.620> obviously<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:56.069> going

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
that mixed up so I'm obviously is going

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.280 
that mixed up so I'm obviously is going
to<00:02:56.280> switch<00:02:56.489> there<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.000> goes<00:02:57.419> into<00:02:57.750> his<00:02:57.870> rocker

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
to switch there and goes into his rocker

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.869 
to switch there and goes into his rocker
which<00:02:58.590> probably<00:02:59.040> wasn't<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.430> best<00:02:59.489> play

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
which probably wasn't the best play

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.330 
which probably wasn't the best play
there<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:00.480> my<00:03:01.200> megahorn<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.859> going<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.189> do

shot<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.769> it's<00:03:29.189> not<00:03:29.370> very<00:03:29.519> effective<00:03:29.729> anyway

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
shot that it's not very effective anyway

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.449 
shot that it's not very effective anyway
ghanta<00:03:30.870> horde<00:03:31.620> here<00:03:31.769> knowing<00:03:32.069> he'll<00:03:32.250> probably

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
ghanta horde here knowing he'll probably

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.949 
ghanta horde here knowing he'll probably
use<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.699> fighting<00:03:33.209> move<00:03:33.359> or<00:03:33.540> something<00:03:33.810> like

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
use a fighting move or something like

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.770 
use a fighting move or something like
that<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.239> worked<00:03:36.389> out<00:03:36.510> pretty<00:03:36.569> well

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
that and so that worked out pretty well

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.809 
that and so that worked out pretty well
I<00:03:37.049> throw<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.829> substitute<00:03:38.250> here<00:03:38.400> thinking<00:03:38.760> you

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
I throw the substitute here thinking you

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.520 
I throw the substitute here thinking you
may<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.150> for<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.329> switch<00:03:39.599> he<00:03:40.169> goes<00:03:40.319> for<00:03:40.470> a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
may go for a switch he goes for a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.110 
may go for a switch he goes for a
foresight<00:03:40.949> there<00:03:41.129> so<00:03:41.340> that's<00:03:41.549> kind<00:03:41.909> of<00:03:41.970> cool

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
foresight there so that's kind of cool

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.210 
foresight there so that's kind of cool
so<00:03:42.509> he's<00:03:42.689> kind<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.959> making<00:03:43.290> his<00:03:43.470> moves<00:03:43.739> he<00:03:44.009> goes

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
so he's kind of making his moves he goes

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.640 
so he's kind of making his moves he goes
 on<00:03:44.639> I<00:03:44.879> that's<00:03:45.419> pretty<00:03:45.659> cool<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.349> goes<00:03:46.530> to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
 on I that's pretty cool so goes to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.469 
 on I that's pretty cool so goes to
the<00:03:46.709> sucker<00:03:46.889> punch<00:03:47.009> there<00:03:47.430> because<00:03:48.030> keep<00:03:48.359> on

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
the sucker punch there because keep on

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.119 
the sucker punch there because keep on
tops<00:03:48.689> got<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.900> lot<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.079> priority<00:03:49.620> moves<00:03:49.859> and

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
tops got a lot of priority moves and

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.039 
tops got a lot of priority moves and
breaks<00:03:51.060> myself<00:03:51.419> of<00:03:51.509> the<00:03:51.569> creep<00:03:51.780> doesn't

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
breaks myself of the creep doesn't

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.210 
breaks myself of the creep doesn't
really<00:03:52.169> matter<00:03:52.379> because<00:03:52.560> hard<00:03:52.949> it's<00:03:53.099> got

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
really matter because hard it's got

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.979 
really matter because hard it's got
terrible<00:03:53.549> defense<00:03:53.790> i<00:03:54.000> go<00:03:54.299> for<00:03:54.449> the<00:03:54.509> sludge<00:03:54.720> one

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
terrible defense i go for the sludge one

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.390 
terrible defense i go for the sludge one
there<00:03:55.169> yes<00:03:55.349> i'm<00:03:55.560> running<00:03:55.799> sailaja<00:03:56.009> bottom<00:03:56.310> of

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
there yes i'm running sailaja bottom of

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.409 
there yes i'm running sailaja bottom of
this<00:03:56.489> just<00:03:56.879> because<00:03:57.180> it's<00:03:57.720> stabbed<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:59.419> it

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
this just because it's stabbed and it

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.599 
this just because it's stabbed and it
has<00:04:01.049> very<00:04:01.439> very<00:04:01.470> poor<00:04:01.859> coverage<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.400> that's

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
has very very poor coverage so that's

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.490 
has very very poor coverage so that's
the<00:04:02.699> only<00:04:02.759> so<00:04:03.299> predicting<00:04:03.870> his<00:04:03.989> Sucker<00:04:04.229> Punch

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
the only so predicting his Sucker Punch

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.800 
the only so predicting his Sucker Punch
here<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.739> go<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.280> sub<00:04:05.540> substitute<00:04:06.540> and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
here I go for the sub substitute and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.610 
here I go for the sub substitute and
which<00:04:07.739> was<00:04:07.919> good<00:04:08.099> play<00:04:08.250> by<00:04:08.430> me<00:04:08.609> there<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.620> he's

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
which was good play by me there and he's

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.229 
which was good play by me there and he's
kind<00:04:10.979> of<00:04:11.099> he<00:04:11.459> could<00:04:11.639> have<00:04:11.729> stayed<00:04:11.970> in<00:04:12.120> and

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
kind of he could have stayed in and

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.819 
kind of he could have stayed in and
broken<00:04:12.540> my<00:04:12.659> substitute<00:04:13.199> with<00:04:13.290> sucker<00:04:13.530> punch

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
broken my substitute with sucker punch

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.460 
broken my substitute with sucker punch
or<00:04:14.299> he<00:04:15.299> could<00:04:15.449> have<00:04:15.569> swapped<00:04:15.780> out<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.109> he<00:04:16.199> swaps

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
or he could have swapped out so he swaps

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.800 
or he could have swapped out so he swaps
out<00:04:16.650> pretty<00:04:17.609> ting<00:04:17.820> my<00:04:18.000> sludge<00:04:18.359> wave<00:04:18.539> again

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
out pretty ting my sludge wave again

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.649 
out pretty ting my sludge wave again
goes<00:04:19.019> into<00:04:19.259> cover<00:04:19.440> line<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.209> that's<00:04:21.209> cool<00:04:21.599> I

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
goes into cover line and that's cool I

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:22.830 
goes into cover line and that's cool I
guess<00:04:21.779> but

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
guess but

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.470 
guess but
I<00:04:23.040> still<00:04:24.040> have<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.490> shall<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.940> know<00:04:25.000> i<00:04:25.120> still<00:04:25.210> have

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
I still have I shall I know i still have

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.730 
I still have I shall I know i still have
Shadow<00:04:25.750> Ball<00:04:25.930> which<00:04:26.110> might<00:04:26.290> be<00:04:26.320> that

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
Shadow Ball which might be that

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.710 
Shadow Ball which might be that
effective<00:04:27.040> against<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.639> but<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:28.060> still<00:04:28.540> does

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
effective against it but it still does

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.390 
effective against it but it still does
very<00:04:28.960> very<00:04:29.020> heavy<00:04:29.290> damage<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.949> considering

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
very very heavy damage to it considering

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.490 
very very heavy damage to it considering
it's<00:04:30.550> not<00:04:30.699> very<00:04:30.820> effective<00:04:31.060> so<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:32.380> I'm

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
it's not very effective so and I'm

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.680 
it's not very effective so and I'm
behind<00:04:32.680> my<00:04:32.979> substitute<00:04:33.520> as<00:04:33.639> well<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.180> get<00:04:34.570> the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
behind my substitute as well I get the

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.540 
behind my substitute as well I get the
special<00:04:35.440> defense<00:04:35.680> drop<00:04:35.949> as<00:04:36.070> well<00:04:36.250> so<00:04:36.430> that's

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
special defense drop as well so that's

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.310 
special defense drop as well so that's
cool<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.360> next<00:04:37.510> shadow<00:04:37.960> but<00:04:38.199> we'll

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
cool so the next shadow but we'll

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.960 
cool so the next shadow but we'll
probably<00:04:38.770> nearly<00:04:39.130> take<00:04:39.340> him<00:04:39.490> out<00:04:39.639> so<00:04:39.820> he's

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
probably nearly take him out so he's

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.450 
probably nearly take him out so he's
kind<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.600> forced<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.020> switch<00:04:41.229> there<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:42.250> goes

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
kind of forced to switch there it goes

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.129 
kind of forced to switch there it goes
back<00:04:42.699> into<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.090> cincy<00:04:43.479> no<00:04:43.630> predicting<00:04:44.050> my

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
back into the cincy no predicting my

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.379 
back into the cincy no predicting my
shadow<00:04:44.440> ball<00:04:44.650> which<00:04:45.639> is<00:04:45.790> cool<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.240> probably

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
shadow ball which is cool I probably

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.080 
shadow ball which is cool I probably
should<00:04:46.540> have<00:04:46.660> gone<00:04:46.840> for<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.610> sludge<00:04:48.610> bomb<00:04:48.820> but

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
should have gone for a a sludge bomb but

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.610 
should have gone for a a sludge bomb but
just<00:04:49.510> in<00:04:49.630> case<00:04:49.660> he<00:04:49.810> wanted<00:04:50.139> to<00:04:50.199> get<00:04:50.260> rid<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.440> it

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
just in case he wanted to get rid of it

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.950 
just in case he wanted to get rid of it
I<00:04:50.800> went<00:04:51.520> for<00:04:51.639> the<00:04:51.729> Shadow<00:04:51.970> Ball<00:04:52.150> yeah<00:04:52.330> so<00:04:52.780> he

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
I went for the Shadow Ball yeah so he

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.110 
I went for the Shadow Ball yeah so he
breaks<00:04:53.139> my<00:04:53.440> substitute<00:04:54.010> with<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.190> skill<00:04:54.880> link

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
breaks my substitute with a skill link

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.710 
breaks my substitute with a skill link
and<00:04:55.330> rock<00:04:56.169> glass<00:04:56.410> which<00:04:56.800> was<00:04:57.419> yeah<00:04:58.419> good<00:04:58.630> plan

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
and rock glass which was yeah good plan

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.140 
and rock glass which was yeah good plan
here's<00:04:59.020> part<00:04:59.260> there<00:04:59.440> yeah<00:05:00.400> Down<00:05:00.850> Goes<00:05:00.880> my

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
here's part there yeah Down Goes my

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.450 
here's part there yeah Down Goes my
harness<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.660> was<00:05:01.990> 53<00:05:02.620> down<00:05:02.830> at<00:05:03.070> this<00:05:03.190> point

could get rid of it as off finally with
my<00:06:16.510> flamethrower<00:06:16.810> being<00:06:17.260> my<00:06:17.490> probably<00:06:18.490> the

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
my flamethrower being my probably the

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.129 
my flamethrower being my probably the
best<00:06:18.700> move<00:06:18.849> i've<00:06:19.000> got<00:06:19.150> on<00:06:19.270> this<00:06:19.389> thing<00:06:19.539> so<00:06:19.960> in

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
best move i've got on this thing so in

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.469 
best move i've got on this thing so in
comes<00:06:20.260> hitmontop<00:06:20.710> and<00:06:21.210> he<00:06:22.210> gets<00:06:22.389> the

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
comes hitmontop and he gets the

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:23.969 
comes hitmontop and he gets the
intimidate<00:06:22.990> off<00:06:23.110> which<00:06:23.289> doesn't<00:06:23.650> matter<00:06:23.800> at

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
intimidate off which doesn't matter at

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.510 
intimidate off which doesn't matter at
all<00:06:24.539> he<00:06:25.539> goes<00:06:25.570> i<00:06:26.070> actually<00:06:27.070> thought<00:06:27.220> he'd<00:06:27.400> go

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
all he goes i actually thought he'd go

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.839 
all he goes i actually thought he'd go
for<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:27.760> sucker<00:06:28.000> punch<00:06:28.120> there<00:06:28.539> because

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
for the sucker punch there because

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.999 
for the sucker punch there because
like<00:06:30.849> I<00:06:31.059> I<00:06:31.479> just<00:06:32.289> thought<00:06:32.409> he<00:06:32.559> would<00:06:32.739> but

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.009 
like I I just thought he would but

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.449 
like I I just thought he would but
that's<00:06:33.249> kind<00:06:33.729> of<00:06:33.879> I<00:06:34.179> guess<00:06:34.709> yeah<00:06:35.709> anyway<00:06:36.249> but

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:36.459 
that's kind of I guess yeah anyway but

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
that's kind of I guess yeah anyway but
he<00:06:36.549> wouldn't<00:06:36.729> have<00:06:36.879> taken<00:06:36.999> me<00:06:37.209> out<00:06:37.329> with<00:06:37.419> a

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
he wouldn't have taken me out with a

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:40.229 
he wouldn't have taken me out with a
sucker<00:06:37.689> punch<00:06:37.929> anyway<00:06:38.519> because<00:06:39.519> it<00:06:39.759> has<00:06:39.879> very

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:40.239 
sucker punch anyway because it has very

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:43.049 
sucker punch anyway because it has very
very<00:06:40.269> nice<00:06:40.709> based<00:06:41.709> of<00:06:41.919> it<00:06:42.039> so<00:06:42.519> the<00:06:42.639> since<00:06:42.879> then

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:43.059 
very nice based of it so the since then

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:44.849 
very nice based of it so the since then
it<00:06:43.179> gets<00:06:43.299> out<00:06:43.809> sped<00:06:44.169> so<00:06:44.349> I'm<00:06:44.439> basically<00:06:44.619> just

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:44.859 
it gets out sped so I'm basically just

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:49.709 
it gets out sped so I'm basically just
sweeping<00:06:45.369> here<00:06:45.549> it's<00:06:46.139> basically<00:06:47.139> GG<00:06:48.029> I<00:06:49.029> was

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719 
sweeping here it's basically GG I was

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.989 
sweeping here it's basically GG I was
give<00:06:49.839> enough<00:06:50.079> I<00:06:50.229> was<00:06:50.409> given<00:06:50.699> an<00:06:51.699> opportunity

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:51.999 
give enough I was given an opportunity
