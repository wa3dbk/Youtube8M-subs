they're<00:01:19.009> separated<00:01:19.909> by<00:01:20.469> degree<00:01:21.469> of

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
they're separated by degree of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.770 
they're separated by degree of
difficulty<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.030> one's<00:01:23.240> easy<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.630> make

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
difficulty so this one's easy to make

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.779 
difficulty so this one's easy to make
this<00:01:24.020> one's<00:01:24.289> intermediate<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.460> one's<00:01:25.670> an

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
this one's intermediate this one's an

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.050 
this one's intermediate this one's an
