00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
may watch any other guys 17 hi

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.750 
may watch any other guys 17 hi
alright<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.140> we're<00:00:49.380> heading<00:00:49.920> down<00:00:50.070> win<00:00:50.370> just

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
alright so we're heading down win just

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.420 
alright so we're heading down win just
as<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.030> were<00:00:51.150> before<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.070> we're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
as we were before and we're going to the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.820 
as we were before and we're going to the
circuit<00:00:53.940> best<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> feel<00:00:55.290> for<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.590> when

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
circuit best to get a feel for it when

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.890 
circuit best to get a feel for it when
years<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> simulator<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.600> did<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
years just like a simulator you did to

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.750 
years just like a simulator you did to
simulate<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.350> detail<00:00:58.770> how<00:00:58.920> long<00:00:59.100> ago<00:00:59.280> that<00:01:00.620> the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
simulate a detail how long ago that the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.400 
simulate a detail how long ago that the
government<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.629> enjoy<00:01:03.900> okay

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
government can really enjoy okay

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.090 
government can really enjoy okay
okay<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:06.570> power<00:01:06.869> set<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.350> syrup<00:01:07.710> which

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
okay so the power set in syrup which

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
okay so the power set in syrup which
what<00:01:08.340> you'd<00:01:08.520> hoped<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> wasn't<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.630> lap

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
what you'd hoped that it wasn't is lap

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.969 
what you'd hoped that it wasn't is lap
30<00:01:10.320> passes<00:01:11.160> for<00:01:11.340> flaps<00:01:11.580> 30<00:01:11.820> looked<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.240> about

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
30 passes for flaps 30 looked like about

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
30 passes for flaps 30 looked like about
1.07<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.490> by<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.700> way<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.090> reducing<00:01:15.899> now

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
1.07 now one by the way is reducing now

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.410 
1.07 now one by the way is reducing now
so<00:01:16.800> just<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.550> us<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> coast<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.390> little

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so just get us off the coast a little

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
so just get us off the coast a little
bit<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.550> still<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.020> what

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
bit and I still do have that is so what

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.910 
bit and I still do have that is so what
regional<00:01:22.920> automobile<00:01:24.200> just<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.320> lemon<00:01:25.530> zest

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
regional automobile just like lemon zest

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560 
regional automobile just like lemon zest
going<00:01:26.040> down<00:01:26.310> cigarette<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.210> any<00:01:27.330> other

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
going down cigarette so do any other

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.530 
going down cigarette so do any other
guys<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.009> big<00:01:29.160> 737

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.249 

it's<00:01:34.020> quite<00:01:34.259> interesting<00:01:34.700> who<00:01:35.700> know<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.259> all

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it's quite interesting who know that all

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.050 
it's quite interesting who know that all
the<00:01:37.500> other<00:01:37.680> guys<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.130> we've<00:01:38.640> been<00:01:38.759> training

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the other guys that we've been training

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
the other guys that we've been training
today<00:01:39.330> they're<00:01:40.020> very<00:01:40.259> experienced<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
today they're very experienced on the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.310 
today they're very experienced on the
Seven<00:01:41.430> Dwarfs<00:01:41.670> server<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.240> Brian<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.110> think

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
Seven Dwarfs server one Brian I think

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
Seven Dwarfs server one Brian I think
has<00:01:43.409> been<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> most<00:01:44.369> since<00:01:44.729> cause<00:01:44.970> his

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
has been one of the most since cause his

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.800 
has been one of the most since cause his
licences<00:01:46.049> operon<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:47.420> he's<00:01:48.420> probably<00:01:48.540> got

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
licences operon or now he's probably got

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.749 
licences operon or now he's probably got
a<00:01:48.840> lot<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.049> thousands<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.890> towers<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.399> here

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
a lot of thousands of towers on here

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.380 
a lot of thousands of towers on here
Andre<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:52.049> from<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> a340<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.940> previously

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
Andre is from the a340 but previously

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.980 
Andre is from the a340 but previously
was<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.049> 737<00:01:55.850> but<00:01:56.850> Sir<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.330> he's<00:01:57.509> he's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
was on the 737 but Sir so he's he's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.450 
was on the 737 but Sir so he's he's
probably<00:01:58.110> got<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> little<00:01:58.500> bit<00:01:58.649> more<00:01:58.740> work<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
probably got a little bit more work to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.340 
probably got a little bit more work to
do<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.970> we're<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.720> little<00:02:00.960> make<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
do so we're going to do a little make a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.120 
do so we're going to do a little make a
few<00:02:01.680> more<00:02:01.860> circuits<00:02:02.369> today<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.939> Andre<00:02:03.390> but

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
few more circuits today with Andre but

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.649 
few more circuits today with Andre but
as<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.429> said<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.729> him<00:02:05.819> it's<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.479> big

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
as I just said to him it's just a big

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.309 
as I just said to him it's just a big
737<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.420> know<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.750> when<00:02:10.229> we

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
737 and we see the you know as when we

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.830 
737 and we see the you know as when we
come<00:02:10.530> round<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.489> same<00:02:11.760> technique<00:02:12.660> as

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
come round it's the same technique as

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.250 
come round it's the same technique as
with<00:02:13.049> a<00:02:13.080> 737<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.489> 340<00:02:15.209> different<00:02:15.840> technique

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
with a 737 the a 340 different technique

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.509 
with a 737 the a 340 different technique
but<00:02:16.709> he's<00:02:16.799> done<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.130> before

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
but he's done it before

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.610 
but he's done it before
so<00:02:17.970> I've<00:02:18.060> got<00:02:18.239> every<00:02:18.690> confidence<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.500> he

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
so I've got every confidence that he

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.920 
so I've got every confidence that he
will<00:02:19.650> be<00:02:19.890> able<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.130> do<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.819> us<00:02:20.910> today<00:02:23.930> right

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
will be able to do it for us today right

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.500 
will be able to do it for us today right
hopping<00:02:25.530> out<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:26.120> how<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.180> doing<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.450> time

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
hopping out here how we doing on time

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.050 
hopping out here how we doing on time
we're<00:02:27.870> fine<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.500> go<00:02:28.620> around<00:02:28.769> now<00:02:29.069> get<00:02:29.910> out

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
we're fine we can go around now get out

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.670 
we're fine we can go around now get out
here<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:30.959> go<00:02:32.810> 107<00:02:33.810> alive<00:02:34.049> that's<00:02:34.440> good

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
here we go 107 alive that's good
