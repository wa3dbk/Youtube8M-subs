there's<00:03:06.030> also<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.959> I'll<00:03:16.109> shoot<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.980> rest<00:03:17.220> of

there's also and I'll shoot the rest of

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.400 
there's also and I'll shoot the rest of
them<00:03:17.579> I<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.420> got<00:03:18.600> out<00:03:18.750> show<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.200> engine

I believe you can pull some pins up

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.069 
I believe you can pull some pins up
there<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.549> it<00:03:29.670> will<00:03:29.790> let<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.239> allow<00:03:30.569> you<00:03:30.630> to

your<00:03:48.890> voltage<00:03:49.640> average<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:52.480> believe<00:03:53.480> this<00:03:54.140> is

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
your voltage average I believe this is

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.430 
your voltage average I believe this is
overheat<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.220> hydraulic<00:03:56.170> can't<00:03:57.170> remember
