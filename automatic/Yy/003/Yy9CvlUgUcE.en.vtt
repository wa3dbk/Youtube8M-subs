00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.859 
fighting targets I think also really
very<00:01:56.459> unique<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.789> different<00:01:57.239> way<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.390> get<00:01:57.630> into

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
very unique a different way to get into

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.300 
very unique a different way to get into
the<00:01:58.020> episode<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.619> stuff<00:01:58.800> like<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.039> whole

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the episode and stuff like this whole

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.460 
the episode and stuff like this whole
typical<00:01:59.729> previously<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.539> bullshit<00:02:01.140> um

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
typical previously you know bullshit um

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.680 
typical previously you know bullshit um
it<00:02:02.099> was<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.280> different<00:02:02.729> way<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:02.970> doing<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
it was a different way of doing that and

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.210 
it was a different way of doing that and
um<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.349> know<00:02:04.410> that's<00:02:04.619> cool<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:05.099> hopefully

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
um you know that's cool and hopefully

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.370 
um you know that's cool and hopefully
they<00:02:05.520> have<00:02:06.360> different<00:02:06.599> ways<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.259> know

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
they have different ways of you know

they have different ways of you know
going<00:02:07.560> into<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:08.250> current<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:09.090> situations<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
going into the current in situations and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.170 
going into the current in situations and
episodes<00:02:10.259> later<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:12.000> cool

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
episodes later on but really cool

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.700 
episodes later on but really cool
opening<00:02:12.720> very<00:02:13.410> different

back into the battle of targets I think

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.970 
back into the battle of targets I think
targets<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.080> this<00:02:56.260> fight<00:02:56.470> was<00:02:56.590> actually<00:02:56.890> the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
targets in this fight was actually the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.550 
targets in this fight was actually the
longest<00:02:57.130> fight<00:02:57.550> I've<00:02:57.670> seen<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.110> series<00:02:59.410> so

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
longest fight I've seen in the series so

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.610 
longest fight I've seen in the series so
far<00:02:59.590> um<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.460> know<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.810> brand<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.200> Jojo

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
far um I know you and the brand of Jojo

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.410 
far um I know you and the brand of Jojo
I<00:03:02.830> wasn't<00:03:03.070> that<00:03:03.340> long<00:03:03.580> this<00:03:04.150> one<00:03:04.330> probably

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
I wasn't that long this one probably

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.110 
I wasn't that long this one probably
been<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.870> longest<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.530> fight<00:03:06.520> I've<00:03:06.730> seen<00:03:06.940> so

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
been the longest a fight I've seen so

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.990 
been the longest a fight I've seen so
far<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:08.560> said<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:09.280> wasn't<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.670> don't<00:03:09.820> think

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
far and it said it wasn't I don't think

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.810 
far and it said it wasn't I don't think
it's<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.210> best<00:03:10.390> fight<00:03:10.780> but<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.440> think<00:03:12.400> Jojo

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
it's the best fight but I think Jojo

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.430 
it's the best fight but I think Jojo
really<00:03:13.120> stepped<00:03:13.390> up<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.750> especially<00:03:14.110> ones

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
really stepped up and especially ones

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.410 
really stepped up and especially ones
that<00:03:14.530> we<00:03:14.770> died<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.010> course<00:03:15.340> definitely<00:03:16.030> gave

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
that we died of course definitely gave

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.920 
that we died of course definitely gave
him<00:03:16.660> his<00:03:16.870> um<00:03:17.170> his<00:03:17.650> deep<00:03:18.370> pass<00:03:18.640> overdrive<00:03:19.330> and

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
him his um his deep pass overdrive and

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.510 
him his um his deep pass overdrive and
he<00:03:20.050> pretty<00:03:20.230> much<00:03:20.350> came<00:03:20.620> super<00:03:20.890> Sam<00:03:21.160> for<00:03:21.400> like
