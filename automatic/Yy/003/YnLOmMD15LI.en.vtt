I'm not going to bother with showing you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.590 
I'm not going to bother with showing you
that<00:02:12.980> at<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.700> moment<00:02:14.830> there's<00:02:15.830> some

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
that at the moment there's some

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.500 
that at the moment there's some
advertising<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:21.010> some<00:02:22.010> colored<00:02:22.310> gels<00:02:22.580> there

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
advertising and some colored gels there

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.660

is<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.660> clear<00:02:23.900> diffuser<00:02:24.380> although<00:02:25.010> personally

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
is a clear diffuser although personally

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.370 
is a clear diffuser although personally
I<00:02:25.850> think<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.150> sits<00:02:26.450> too<00:02:26.690> closely<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
I think this sits too closely to the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.770 
I think this sits too closely to the
LEDs<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.709> be<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.069> any<00:02:28.280> use<00:02:28.430> whatsoever<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.630> all

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
LEDs to be of any use whatsoever and all

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.420 
LEDs to be of any use whatsoever and all
it<00:02:29.959> does<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.260> rob<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.560> about<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.920> stop<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.400> light

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
it does is rob you about a stop of light

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.840 
it does is rob you about a stop of light
if<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.300> do<00:02:32.510> want<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.950> diffuse<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.190> LEDs<00:02:34.550> then

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
if you do want to diffuse the LEDs then

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.240 
if you do want to diffuse the LEDs then
I<00:02:35.170> suggest<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.440> something<00:02:36.830> like<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:36.980> shoot

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
I suggest you something like a shoot

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.780 
I suggest you something like a shoot

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
through Rolly

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.750 
through Rolly

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
or maybe a reflective Rolly or if

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.770

3200 K we have blue and red filters
which<00:02:50.780> are<00:02:50.870> great<00:02:51.049> for<00:02:51.200> doing<00:02:51.489> sort<00:02:52.489> of

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
the light would probably reduce as well

can<00:04:41.680> see<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.100> light<00:04:42.220> does<00:04:42.430> get<00:04:42.610> brighter<00:04:45.480> go

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
can see the light does get brighter go

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.220 
can see the light does get brighter go
back<00:04:46.690> into<00:04:46.840> manual<00:04:47.140> mode<00:04:47.790> this<00:04:48.790> button<00:04:49.230> will

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
back into manual mode this button will

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.900 
back into manual mode this button will
tell<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.590> how<00:04:51.040> much<00:04:51.160> battery<00:04:51.550> life<00:04:51.580> you've

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
tell you how much battery life you've

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.000 
tell you how much battery life you've
got<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.270> right<00:04:52.479> now<00:04:52.690> we're<00:04:52.930> at<00:04:52.990> about<00:04:53.050> 50%<00:04:53.590> on

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
got and right now we're at about 50% on

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:01.680 
got and right now we're at about 50% on
this<00:04:54.160> battery<00:04:58.169> there's<00:04:59.169> an<00:04:59.350> SOS<00:04:59.800> mode<00:05:00.690> where

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
this battery there's an SOS mode where

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.630 
this battery there's an SOS mode where
the<00:05:01.900> light<00:05:02.110> will<00:05:02.290> flush<00:05:02.890> out<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.250> Morse<00:05:03.430> code

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
the light will flush out the Morse code

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.300 
the light will flush out the Morse code
for<00:05:03.700> SOS<00:05:04.620> probably<00:05:05.620> not<00:05:05.740> something<00:05:06.040> I'm<00:05:06.160> going

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
for SOS probably not something I'm going

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.200 
for SOS probably not something I'm going
to<00:05:06.370> use<00:05:06.490> on<00:05:06.640> a<00:05:06.940> video<00:05:07.240> set<00:05:08.820> you'll<00:05:09.820> also<00:05:09.910> do<00:05:10.150> it

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
to use on a video set you'll also do it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:18.500 
to use on a video set you'll also do it
at<00:05:10.300> two<00:05:10.450> different<00:05:10.600> speeds<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.710> after<00:05:14.950> that

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.110 

you<00:05:19.510> know<00:05:19.600> it's<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.900> really<00:05:20.080> well-made<00:05:20.530> unit

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
you know it's a really well-made unit

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:29.580 
you know it's a really well-made unit
the<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.540> gel<00:05:22.750> itself<00:05:23.370> slides<00:05:24.370> in<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.850> side<00:05:28.590> so

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
the the gel itself slides in the side so

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.230 
the the gel itself slides in the side so
now<00:05:29.710> that's<00:05:29.890> converted<00:05:30.400> from<00:05:30.550> daylight<00:05:30.910> to

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
now that's converted from daylight to

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.370 
now that's converted from daylight to
tungsten<00:05:33.210> they're<00:05:34.210> easy<00:05:34.360> to<00:05:34.510> put<00:05:34.720> in<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:34.900> out

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.720 

the<00:05:38.380> main<00:05:38.500> question<00:05:38.890> most<00:05:39.070> people<00:05:39.160> have<00:05:39.580> is

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
the main question most people have is

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.930 
the main question most people have is
well<00:05:39.910> how<00:05:40.360> bright<00:05:40.600> is<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:40.900> and<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:42.520> we<00:05:42.670> did<00:05:42.790> some

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
well how bright is it and so we did some

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.570 
well how bright is it and so we did some
testing<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:44.130> using<00:05:45.130> a<00:05:46.560> sekonic<00:05:47.560> l35<00:05:48.190> 8<00:05:48.370> light

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
testing and using a sekonic l35 8 light

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.780 
testing and using a sekonic l35 8 light
meter<00:05:48.870> we<00:05:49.870> found<00:05:50.170> that<00:05:50.380> in<00:05:51.340> another<00:05:51.580> wise

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
meter we found that in another wise

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.750 
meter we found that in another wise
darkroom<00:05:52.330> where<00:05:52.510> this<00:05:52.750> was<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.080> only<00:05:53.230> light

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
darkroom where this was the only light

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:01.260 
darkroom where this was the only light
at<00:05:54.760> 3<00:05:55.600> feet<00:05:55.870> or<00:05:56.140> roughly<00:05:56.170> 1<00:05:56.680> meter<00:05:58.260> ISO<00:05:59.260> 800<00:06:00.270> at

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
at 3 feet or roughly 1 meter ISO 800 at

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.610 
at 3 feet or roughly 1 meter ISO 800 at
one<00:06:01.570> fiftieth<00:06:01.960> of<00:06:02.050> a<00:06:02.110> second

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
one fiftieth of a second

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.880 
one fiftieth of a second
we<00:06:02.920> got<00:06:03.070> about<00:06:03.190> F<00:06:03.550> 7.1<00:06:04.540> as<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.530> light<00:06:05.680> reading

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
we got about F 7.1 as the light reading

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.240 
we got about F 7.1 as the light reading
so<00:06:06.840> using<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:07.930> inverse<00:06:08.200> square<00:06:08.350> law<00:06:08.680> you

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
so using the inverse square law you

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.320 
so using the inverse square law you
should<00:06:09.400> be<00:06:09.460> able<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:09.610> figure<00:06:09.910> out<00:06:10.030> from<00:06:10.240> that

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
should be able to figure out from that

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.570 
should be able to figure out from that
roughly<00:06:11.230> what<00:06:11.680> you'll<00:06:11.950> get<00:06:12.100> at<00:06:12.310> different

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
roughly what you'll get at different

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.930 
roughly what you'll get at different
distances<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.600> ISO<00:06:14.290> settings<00:06:14.710> so<00:06:14.980> again<00:06:15.670> ISO

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
distances and ISO settings so again ISO

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.860 
distances and ISO settings so again ISO
800<00:06:16.510> 150th<00:06:17.260> of<00:06:17.350> a<00:06:17.410> second<00:06:17.770> we<00:06:17.950> got<00:06:18.070> F<00:06:18.280> 7.1<00:06:19.150> at

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
800 150th of a second we got F 7.1 at

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.010 
800 150th of a second we got F 7.1 at
about<00:06:20.140> 3<00:06:20.410> feet<00:06:20.620> so<00:06:21.030> it's<00:06:22.030> not<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.540> brightest

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
about 3 feet so it's not the brightest

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.200 
about 3 feet so it's not the brightest
