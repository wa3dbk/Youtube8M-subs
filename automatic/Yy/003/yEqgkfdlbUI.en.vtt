00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello modern man all 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.549
 spends more and more time 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.970
 screen monitor both at work and 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.890
 houses 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 given this fact of particular importance 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.340
 acquire security issues for 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.009
 organs of vision during prolonged stay 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.480
 behind the screen and at least very important 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.279
 after long work behind the monitor 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.380
 provide greater comfort for the eyes and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.210
 less fatigue is no secret that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.699
 modern liquid crystal screen 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.500
 inherent lack of significantly affecting 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.960
 on there i'm a suit known as shimmer 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.699
 image flickering in essence flickering 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.949
 there are fluctuations in the brightness level of the backlight 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.200
 monitor in a certain enough 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.059
 short time even 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.219
 such flicker is indistinguishable by organs 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.440
 view and strictly speaking most people 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.239
 no longer notice flicker if the frequency 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.550
 brightness fluctuations above 50 hertz 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.079
 long work for such a monitor can 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 cause eye strain and even 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.520
 headache is the main cause of flicker 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.110
 images of modern jacques monitor as 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.910
 should be obsessive file backlit 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.710
 is integral to last 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.000
 time constructive feature is the same to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.520
 the vast majority of panels 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.559
 modern monitors this technology 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.570
 backlight brightness control same to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.700
 panels known as pulse width 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.369
 modulation and deprive let's talk about not 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.659
 more simply principle 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.909
 work than is fast 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.070
 turning off the backlight node the same to 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.869
 backlight control panels 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.150
 exercise period fixed 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.770
 frequency up to several kilohertz 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.869
 this is changing the activity of inclusion 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.000
 highlighting corresponding changes in 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.830
 activities off the backlight so 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.689
 way of flying and adjusting the brightness 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.210
 your monitor at 100 percent 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.430
 the brightness of the shindo fact is not needed and not 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.680
 It is running in each of the periods of illumination 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.450
 included all the time further as far as 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.130
 and user brightness control in 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.320
 downward on time 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.570
 backlight shortens the time when 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.159
 backlight off increases then 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.740
 there is relatively speaking the width decreases 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.750
 pulse including the backlight and at 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 low levels of flicker brightness are often 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.439
 becomes distinguishable for example when 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.790
 brightness levels less than fifty 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.070
 percent for one period 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.020
 control backlight turned off great 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.369
 part of the time then the inevitable 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.530
 flicker or flickering 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.790
 This is especially noticeable on the LED 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.310
 backlight due to low 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.719
 inertia LEDs glow it 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.209
 cold cathode lights 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.750
 the flicker effect on them here bones less 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.370
 noticeable 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.930
 since the lamp possess much more 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.719
 long after the glow 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.209
 smooth out the flicker effect beyond that 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.680
 low monitor brightness 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.849
 adjust cars maybe observable 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.579
 user on various artifacts 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.290
 images are especially noticeable with fast 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.269
 moving views horizontally 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.099
 for example when reading from the screen 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.989
 it may be blurred from the text and 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.689
 the appearance of colored halos on contrasting 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.280
 objects moreover outwardly artificial 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.379
 light sources such as 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.359
 fluorescent lights can cause 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.370
 artifacts caused by interference and 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.129
 light sources out of this situation 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.930
 often you only increase one 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.079
 monitor brightness up to one hundred percent 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.250
 agree not always comfortable 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.290
 easiest way to check 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.970
 the presence of the control scheme backlight 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.700
 the monitor is use 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.629
 ordinary domestic fan 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.239
 fan must be installed 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.439
 directly in front of the monitor screen 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.329
 after turning on when looking at the screen 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.340
 through the rotating blades will 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.109
 observed strobe effect and 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.450
 conspicuous naked times 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.489
 below to the panel and you can turn on the camera 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.889
 your mobile phone and send 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.349
 her on your phone camera monitor also 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.819
 will show screen flicker whether there is 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.199
 alternatives shim free from 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.959
 the above disadvantages 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.489
 answer bank you want you offer 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.530
 technology called flicker free 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.720
 literally free from blinking 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.519
 unlike spike technology based 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.290
 direction led backlight with 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.959
 using DC voltage measurement 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.370
 current 10 min in this way in the monitor 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.590
 banks and backlight brightness adjustable 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.599
 non temporal quantization one hundred percent 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.759
 brightness a change in supply voltage 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.590
 LEDs that glows continuously 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.449
 but with user controlled brightness 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.970
 despite the somewhat more complex 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:50.459
 knicker hardware implementation 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.470

 brightness values set them 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.500
 users get rid of possible 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.109
 eye fatigue problems and 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.129
 headache or at least 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.349
 provide more comfort when 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.209
 long-term work behind the monitor 1 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.299

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.020
 and now also flicker- free 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.940
 and by the end of 2013, banks are planning 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.260
 transfer the entire model range to 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.750
 flicker free technology 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.790
 banks and flicker free small change 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.170
 in the design of the backlight a big step in
