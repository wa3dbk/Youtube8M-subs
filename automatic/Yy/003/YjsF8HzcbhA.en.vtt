minutes basic role-playing what is it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.969 
minutes basic role-playing what is it
it's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.400> straight<00:01:08.850> percentile<00:01:09.750> system<00:01:10.380> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it's a straight percentile system that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.160 
it's a straight percentile system that
is<00:01:11.190> you<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> target<00:01:12.360> number<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> skill

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
is you have a target number for a skill

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.590 
is you have a target number for a skill
you<00:01:13.619> roll<00:01:13.890> D<00:01:14.100> percentile<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you roll D percentile and you have to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.109 
you roll D percentile and you have to
get<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.869> skill<00:01:16.200> or<00:01:16.320> under<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.010> succeed<00:01:17.430> lower

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.750 
get that skill or under to succeed lower
is<00:01:18.450> better<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.860> prices<00:01:20.310> right<00:01:20.520> how's

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
is better it's not prices right how's

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.359 
is better it's not prices right how's
that<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.240> over<00:01:21.360> lowest<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.290> better<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.130> oh

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
that going over lowest is better so oh
