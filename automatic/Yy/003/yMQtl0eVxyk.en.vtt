00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 As the title suggests, this time 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.330
 no news to be there again 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.429
 merely opinion my opinion to one 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.900
 theme that issue throughout the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.940
 against media jumps 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.790
 it is not the pope but it is 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.690
 something that many of us may have 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.320
 most likely without it 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.660
 to know 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.869
 within the last days do not know 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.220
 and have eaten weeks 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.619
 Horse meat now determined 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.660
 in england has started in france 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.990
 continue to brag that lasagna 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.050
 emerged ready lasagna as 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.870
 content not cattle axa had but 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 for the most part, minced meat 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.800
 although it was not so well declared 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.079
 I think I have no one there 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.850
 but you bought her with horse meat 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.360
 apart from that, of course, that works 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.520
 Not 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.660
 it has to show what's in it 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.160
 and it was next to it would be 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.420
 beef the german 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.340
 Minister of Agriculture ilse aigner 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.989
 but said a few days ago oh yes 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.640
 Of course this is a problem in these 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.530
 countries, but here in germany 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.030
 that does not happen that's why it affects 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 neither do we and that's why I drive 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.780
 also not to the meeting of the ministers 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.739
 this one spoke like you 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.409
 can continue 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.299
 now it's definitely out there 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.510
 in germany problems with 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.150
 horse meat even in lassan for example 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.270
 have real and rewe admitted that in 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.630
 Never brand your own brand Yes 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.000
 for example, also puts here slowly 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.759
 that at least parts of it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.530
 horse meat could have been in it 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.079
 because the supplier for this 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 Rehabilitate horse meat was responsible 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.340
 this has delivered wrong too 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.720
 German supermarkets supplied 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.310
 or German manufacturers 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.930
 and of course that's the conversation 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.909
 now also big in germany and many 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.979
 I have marked meat on it 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.290
 ate without knowing it 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.360
 That's the background as I said 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.710
 I'm sure you would notice and I thought 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 me there would again quite like short 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.340
 to get rid of my opinion 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.780
 on this topic because many of me too 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
 have written and said what you think 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.090
 I like you to make it very short 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.820
 So I have to say I want that already 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.400
 a little funny because I am 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.310
 meat eater and as a meat eater white 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.020
 I honestly not what 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.000
 in which is what I buy there if 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.650
 I buy a bratwurst or if I am 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.560
 in monaco consuming meat sausage 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.150
 I especially want meat cheese 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.370
 do not know what's in there because it is 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.080
 yes, there are a lot of waste 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.820
 also every quantity is processed 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.440
 pure ingredients 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.080
 any other chemical things 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.780
 and at the end badly good and if I am 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.770
 I would know what's in there 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.239
 probably do not eat anymore and 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.590
 I can imagine that some of 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.300
 Also vegetarian or vegetarian 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.190
 maybe even vegan 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.480
 because they have noticed what's in there 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.480
 is meat so there 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.600
 like I said it does not matter 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.740
 white does not make me hot but that's why 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 we do not need us about it 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.730
 get upset when this comes out 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.320
 Of course it is not cool that 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.280
 Horses were found because 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.950
 it does not belong there 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.110
 but if it is like that then you can too 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.940
 You do not need to do anything now 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.620
 Do not complain and, above all, you have to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.150
 Now do not think you will fall soon 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.490
 Dead because you ate this meat 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.990
 because her meat is cooked now 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.190
 not so bad so the 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.600
 commands lovers i want that yourself 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.400
 To call for horses to slaughter and 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.660
 but to eat it would be the salami 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.660
 he eats for example a well-known of 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.040
 the cashier and other horses products 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.730
 are also used in other foods 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.620
 processed 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.570
 that's why it's not bad at all 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.970
 it is natural to eat horses meat 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.770
 a bit disgusting thought i would 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.480
 not necessarily one now 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.209
 grab horse when I'm hungry 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.620
 but it's nothing bad at all 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.540
 and that's why it is not 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.400
 for example, about rotten meat that one 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.080
 then bad example that ill 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.760
 but it 's just easy 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.530
 other meat that is now as 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.970
 kangaroo meat would be in it 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.260
 that tastes the way well promote 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.150
 eat meat should try it 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.950
 I think that's delicious 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.570
 you do not need to be big 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.519
 Excite about it and even say that 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.900
 eu minister who say well we can 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.720
 Do not do that much now 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.280
 it was wrong but declared it 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.660
 if there was nothing harmful in it 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.400
 Of course, now it comes out that too 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.330
 even horses rotten meat was for it 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.000
 the case is a bit more 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.709
 but different from the huge scandal 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.850
 I think I speak absolutely 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.500
 exaggerated 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.140
 First, as I said you have to anyway 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.090
 not what are such meat products 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.520
 is in it and second is horse meat 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.220
 it's not really that bad 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.220
 for the people who say I eat though 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.350
 pig and cow and so what would be 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.120
 I would never eat like that 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.190
 I would rather jump off the cliff 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.630
 because I also have five horses myself 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.919
 or maybe there it is 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.360
 a bit different but stored 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.130
 in this case, too 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.080
 In Germany, it has been so far 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.040
 those products where it suspects 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.140
 there is for it 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.520
 really so minimal in there but that 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.590
 was not a bad conscience 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.940
 So that's my opinion there I would 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.970
 even something self-critical as I said 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.250
 I still eat meat but I can 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.600
 understand him though vegetarians say 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.160
 look what is in there everything is in the 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.750
 I would like to blame yours now 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.300
 opinion makes you panic you have 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.430
 or do you generally care? 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.370
 he says like me, what I do not know 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.440
 Do not make me hot or yes you say 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.940
 because of this it is different now 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.490
 immediately no meat at all so 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.350
 I would have your opinion on this scandal 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.980
 really like to know 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.300
 interest 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.340
 tomorrow there will be again in the studio 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.170
 at this point on friday last day 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.680
 in the week and I hope we see each other 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.160
 there again 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.160
 bye bye
