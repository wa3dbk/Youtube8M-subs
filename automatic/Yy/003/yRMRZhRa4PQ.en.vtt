HIMEPCY! hi girls~

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.600
I’ve done clear and natural "Back To School" teenager School Makeup today

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.860
am I cute? (sorry! I mean, just hair style XD)

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:31.360
I used finger instead of brush so students could do easily and I used cheap road shop cosmetic products

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.240
Let's start "Back To School" teenager School Makeup Tutorial now!

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:49.860
For teenager skin Makeup, I recommend B.B cream or cushion type product that is easy to use

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.320
but this product (INNISFREE WINTER COUSHION) is,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.600
not good for meT.T

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.760
If you buy some base makeup products, test on your skin

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:13.520
Centrally on the nose, apply it as if you are putting it inwardly and blending the lines of the outer part, 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:30.040
so the face won’t look too much white that you could finish natural skin Makeup

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:47.240
I’m going to use brown color eyeliner because brown looks more natural than black

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.980
Don’t make the eye line too long or that goes upward

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.580
For students, it is better not to fill the waterline for the health of the eyes

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.400
but I'm not teenager and student, so I'll fill waterline lol

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:50.180
Apply bright shading shadow on the whole eyes with finger

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.520
You should make it light so the eyes won’t look dull

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:07.940
Using brown shading shadow, apply one more time on the double eyelid line,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.940
Using brown shading shadow, apply one more time on the double eyelid line,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:35.640
And put it on the cotton bub to apply on the triangle zone of underline

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:47.440
With bright ivory shadow without pearl, lightly apply on the inner part and under the eye

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:10.100
For teenage student Makeup, I don’t recommend using mascara because it is not good for eyes and it doesn’t make you look natural

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.980
I recommend maskara fixer or clear maskara

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.420
they make eyelash fix upward

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:42.820
But if you want to use it, just apply very lightly right on the pupil part

00:04:45.050 --> 00:05:01.790
Tidy your brown cleanly and fill the empty part then draw natural arch shape eyebrow

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:11.260
It is natural to match the eyebrow color with hair color

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.060
Most Korean teenage students like straight shape eyebrow

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:24.634
I'll apply pink blursher

00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:25.134
smile~

00:05:25.134 --> 00:05:27.354
apply blursher round on cheek

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:44.880
With the pink tint that has similar color with your lips, 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:55.720
apply from the inner part and widen it to the whole lip

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:16.180
This is teenager student Makeup that I made naturally as possible as I could using pink and brown color

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.020
