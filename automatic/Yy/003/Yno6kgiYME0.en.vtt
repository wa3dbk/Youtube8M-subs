00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.270 

this<00:03:31.810> spine<00:03:32.200> actually<00:03:32.590> looks<00:03:32.799> pretty<00:03:33.069> good

this spine actually looks pretty good

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.610 
this spine actually looks pretty good
doesn't<00:03:33.730> mean<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.239> not<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.569> spinal<00:03:35.200> issue<00:03:35.349> but

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
doesn't mean it's not a spinal issue but

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.729 
doesn't mean it's not a spinal issue but
there's<00:03:35.859> nothing<00:03:36.219> obvious<00:03:37.290> with<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.319> severe

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
there's nothing obvious with a severe

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.309 
there's nothing obvious with a severe

brain or spinal injury ruled out it's

brain or spinal injury ruled out it's
likely<00:03:41.709> Wiggles<00:03:42.040> was<00:03:42.219> born<00:03:42.489> with<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> genetic

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
likely Wiggles was born with a genetic

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.000 
likely Wiggles was born with a genetic
defect<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.810> affects<00:03:44.260> his<00:03:44.650> neurological

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
defect that affects his neurological

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.300 
defect that affects his neurological
system<00:03:46.439> but<00:03:47.439> he's<00:03:47.590> stable

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
system but he's stable

system but he's stable
so<00:03:48.819> Mike<00:03:49.030> gives<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.450> go-ahead<00:03:49.629> for<00:03:50.019> adoption

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
so Mike gives the go-ahead for adoption

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.490 
so Mike gives the go-ahead for adoption
I<00:03:50.819> think<00:03:51.819> what<00:03:52.030> he<00:03:52.120> has<00:03:52.359> is<00:03:52.930> gonna<00:03:53.319> be<00:03:53.469> a

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
I think what he has is gonna be a

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.300 
I think what he has is gonna be a
permanent<00:03:54.099> issue<00:03:54.639> with<00:03:54.969> him<00:03:55.950> but<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.099> goal

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
permanent issue with him but the goal

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.159 
permanent issue with him but the goal
will<00:03:57.459> be<00:03:57.489> that<00:03:57.730> he<00:03:57.819> can<00:03:57.999> learn<00:03:58.569> to<00:03:58.629> cope<00:03:59.139> with

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
will be that he can learn to cope with

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.569 
will be that he can learn to cope with
what<00:03:59.889> he<00:03:59.980> has<00:04:00.189> and<00:04:00.609> adjust<00:04:01.239> accordingly

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
what he has and adjust accordingly

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.259 
what he has and adjust accordingly
