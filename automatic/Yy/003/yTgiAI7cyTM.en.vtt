00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.780
 a new video memory card a video 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.429
 short enough to introduce you very 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.710
 simply the smart ice app 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.470
 for xbox one so an application that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.970
 allow you to mercy piaf small 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.580
 sound effects that will allow you to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.769
 take remote control of your 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.689
 your xbox with your phone at 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.039
 see who has several 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.930
 many advantages to that so we'll 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.240
 so here is the xbox ounce ice marc 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.170
 will launch the application then first 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.739
 thing that will do that we launch 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.149
 application is to connect so there 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.530
 he will tell us the xbox one that 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.090
 find on his network so me the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.550
 mine I called them xbox oued smar 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.469
 ice cream so we will be able to launch evox 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.170
 one plate this son of john plato for the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.149
 sorry thank you stone for being here for me 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.260
 support 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.730
 so here he is he found he connects 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.579
 do not learn too much too long 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.230
 normally bouygues games in the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.730
 console 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.550
 I think he will come from the network 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.079
 special his voice very high bailly 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.070
 connect back again so here we see 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.260
 So here we are 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.799
 the application in the menu of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.159
 application 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.420
 then we will see that we find there it is 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.180
 the application at last application that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.790
 I launched the recency and the last 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.049
 applications that I launched to the plug 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.159
 good then that's it I think it's done 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.110
 to sell us things to the fullest 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.420
 those voices there you see that the plug not 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.009
 awesome I had not seen they had 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.299
 that stiff jeans buy next but 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.909
 pin that correspond to the pins 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.829
 of our profile on your xbox live 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.970
 here we go to see the menus 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.130
 right now here 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.689
 then we have the welcome menu that finally 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.600
 the welcome that allows to return on 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.490
 the home of my friends application so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.930
 I can go and see who is connected 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.070
 so list of friends we also 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.560
 so here we are in favorites me 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.640
 do not care about me, I'm going to see friends 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.830
 here we go all but all my contacts 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.140
 who are there so that's it that allows 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.640
 so a very nice thing we'll see 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.820
 also with the two applications these 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 concrete if I sent a message on foot 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.400
 stone m6 well I'm doing a sent 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 message to her seek this information 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.320
 not terrible reputation odd have 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.450
 helped a not so good web reputation that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.350
 put me pages sent a message there 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.390
 what's interesting is that I 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.070
 to be able to type I am sent so there I 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.350
 send you a guide you have and send yourself 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.370
 often messages of what is 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.930
 interesting is that we have draft 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.370
 take his joystick to thelex 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.080
 parallel choose the help we sent 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.120
 we have like a real keyboard 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.030
 like a sms so that's it's a big 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.459
 more when this support to this application 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.320
 then we have the successes 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.820
 following the newspapers I do you 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.550
 it will serve if you are at home it serves 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.930
 I think I'm staying in your kitchen 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.950
 you can say ok I want to go see the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.880
 success while I go to eat 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.430
 but it's not necessarily very useful 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.200
 it's a little gadget 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.970
 So here is the refugee saq not play 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.670
 but here it is 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.230
 then challenge her to separate display 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.610
 motors sold girl assassin's creed who 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.750
 is proposed say how long there is 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.799
 not that there is not that there is 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.630
 other places other young people at all goes 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.620
 and who is fighting the drive in anger not 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.690
 how could they do something that 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.739
 would have xynthia be 27 days of ride there 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.030
 34 players will have to come in 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.650
 effect of being too much done and therefore during 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.690
 34 days you will see the possibility 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.510
 okay very well who is very well ben 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.980
 you see thank you so it's the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.680
 pins there we will be able to handle the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.820
 pins beyond the xbox so the in 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.019
 does it's the apps it's like 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.150
 on windows 8 years the applications we 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.530
 wants to have pinned some by the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.180
 messages like the messages we have 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.290
 sent and the settings that we're not going 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.610
 go see it's not very interesting 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.720
 so we will go back to the reception so a 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.049
 interesting thing i'm going to you 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.010
 show for example if I run skype 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:33.360
 there he tells me auxi remote control cat he 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.640
 do not want to start because he's already 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.040
 launched on 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.690
 1 / / enhancers I first launched 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.980
 youtube for example read on xbox live 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.420
 here is kind under tube what makes 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.569
 hey there he opens youtube on mike 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.980
 goodson so that's not bad there 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.090
 now I'm going to go out I 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.500
 will launch and skype since that's it 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.209
 that I wanted to see earlier I want 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.470
 relaunch skype read on xbox live lo 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.850
 so there every time we click on to 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.080
 read in feast he will switch on the right 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.310
 application or launched if it is not 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.740
 not launched and we saw the time to 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.600
 latency but because the application 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.870
 was already open so it plays 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.410
 a lot 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.700
 so we have this panel that serves as 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.660
 remote control there we see it if I move 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.610
 it moves 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.980
 here I can ride I can go see 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.730
 what happens to the left right I 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.290
 the xy b buttons that are there if I 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.519
 click on the main screen in full 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.239
 middle this is the button so by 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.660
 example I will go to see stone 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.070
 minnelli I'm doing here I see that's it 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.060
 we had a discussion there are very few 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.080
 time I told you at the lake and talent you 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.430
 answered me yes vianne here is a 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.110
 very interesting discussion it's 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.000
 miss it here we can we can 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.500
 choose to call launch the video here 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.669
 good this is again we can 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.620
 do it with the joystick no it's not 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.180
 it does not bring anything but what 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.590
 will mostly be interesting like for 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.330
 send private messages that's going to be 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.290
 I want to do that there I have a keyboard 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:47.150
 who appears and I can I can tell you 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.260
 aulas that spreads talent because I 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.510
 did the lake went from seconds to 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.270
 talent talent lackey and I send it to you 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.919
 and we see that here it appears his part 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.820
 immediately his henchmen to me I 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.900
 find it really interesting 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.950
 I have a little question while you 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.930
 trainings they were asking what you 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.979
 can switch unonthone phone and the 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.270
 keyboard not his way to the room so that 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.100
 does not work while it is htc 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.660
 wannehain so that's it should work 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.080
 I am in rotation mode 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.310
 automatic but it does not do it six 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.240
 month that's a big big plus a 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.550
 since it's true that I was a 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.600
 big gap that I had on my xbox I 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.560
 did not know the smart app 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.720
 ice cream I had I had never 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.160
 leaned over and is actually ben here 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 thanks to that we can type 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.539
 messages as easily as with a 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.520
 keyboard see that a sms 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.600
 so this is for your info this 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.139
 application that wanted to find on 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.080
 android on 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.879
 ios is on the shelves so that's 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.300
 the windows phone estimate at the top 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.560
 anyway the story then came out that's 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.870
 true is on the shelves it's very 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.580
 practice to see it on a tablet 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.710
 I found it rather come to 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.909
 do it so that's maybe it can be a 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.529
 little gadget which is especially very very 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.060
 interesting I find it's the keyboard 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.289
 in addition we have thanks to his talent and 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.370
 women as long as it will be updated 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.930
 by the way, because more and more things 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.979
 more interesting evolution and in 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.650
 function of the games there might be 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.449
 possibilities to the following 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.729
 the games quite so here is a 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.349
 application if you have the same xbox 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.389
 which seems to me ultimately indispensable 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.340
 to be able to send messages 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.199
 easily without taking the lead with 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.189
 a controller a very good controller but 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.319
 that does not send messages 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:13.710
 very easily it's free and it's 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.960
 free 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.240
 Thank you, Pierre, for filming with 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.009
 your very handsome to phone it is I you 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.400
 see you soon on memory card for 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.400
 videos
