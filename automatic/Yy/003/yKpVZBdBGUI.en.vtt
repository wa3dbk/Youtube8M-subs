what that's it that's exactly how I cord
my<00:06:51.139> videos<00:06:51.500> make<00:06:51.830> sure<00:06:52.340> your<00:06:52.759> TV<00:06:53.270> volume<00:06:53.780> is

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
my videos make sure your TV volume is

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.710 
my videos make sure your TV volume is
like<00:06:54.139> not<00:06:54.830> all<00:06:54.889> the<00:06:55.280> way<00:06:55.430> up<00:06:55.669> but<00:06:55.940> pretty<00:06:56.360> hard

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
like not all the way up but pretty hard

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.390 
like not all the way up but pretty hard
to<00:06:57.020> the<00:06:57.139> point<00:06:57.349> where<00:06:57.680> you're<00:06:57.800> here<00:06:58.070> the<00:06:58.190> game

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
to the point where you're here the game

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.300 
to the point where you're here the game
too<00:06:58.789> because<00:06:59.750> you<00:07:00.410> know<00:07:00.560> your<00:07:00.710> voice<00:07:00.949> is<00:07:01.130> going

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
too because you know your voice is going

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.700 
too because you know your voice is going
to<00:07:01.370> take<00:07:01.550> up<00:07:01.729> much<00:07:01.940> most<00:07:02.720> of<00:07:02.930> the<00:07:03.050> input<00:07:03.440> so

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
to take up much most of the input so

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.990 
to take up much most of the input so
that's<00:07:03.889> why<00:07:04.070> you<00:07:04.130> have<00:07:04.340> to<00:07:04.460> turn<00:07:04.639> up<00:07:04.849> the

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
that's why you have to turn up the

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.089 
that's why you have to turn up the
volume<00:07:05.330> of<00:07:05.419> the<00:07:05.510> TV<00:07:05.960> a<00:07:06.169> little<00:07:06.770> louder<00:07:06.919> than

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:07.099 
volume of the TV a little louder than

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.460 
volume of the TV a little louder than
what<00:07:07.370> you'd<00:07:07.520> be<00:07:07.669> used<00:07:07.909> to<00:07:08.060> used<00:07:08.840> to<00:07:08.960> whatever

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
what you'd be used to used to whatever

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.550 
what you'd be used to used to whatever
but<00:07:10.130> you<00:07:10.400> know<00:07:10.580> that's<00:07:10.789> okay<00:07:11.180> it's<00:07:12.110> no<00:07:12.320> big

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
but you know that's okay it's no big

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.110 
but you know that's okay it's no big
deal<00:07:12.590> if<00:07:12.979> you<00:07:13.099> hurt<00:07:13.250> your<00:07:13.370> ears<00:07:13.550> a<00:07:13.639> little<00:07:13.729> bit

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
deal if you hurt your ears a little bit

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.149 
deal if you hurt your ears a little bit
it'll<00:07:14.510> be<00:07:14.659> all<00:07:14.780> right<00:07:14.810> because<00:07:15.139> the<00:07:15.440> video<00:07:15.770> the

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:16.159 
it'll be all right because the video the

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:17.800 
it'll be all right because the video the
game<00:07:16.370> or<00:07:16.550> sound<00:07:16.820> like<00:07:17.060> you<00:07:17.300> have<00:07:17.479> it<00:07:17.510> on<00:07:17.690> your

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
game or sound like you have it on your

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.450 
game or sound like you have it on your
normal<00:07:18.199> volume<00:07:18.530> that's<00:07:18.650> retarded<00:07:18.949> but<00:07:19.280> that

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
normal volume that's retarded but that

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.010 
normal volume that's retarded but that
is<00:07:19.580> how<00:07:19.729> it<00:07:19.789> is<00:07:19.940> I<00:07:20.210> don't<00:07:20.720> know<00:07:20.780> how<00:07:20.870> much<00:07:20.960> time

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.020 
is how it is I don't know how much time

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.839 
is how it is I don't know how much time
I've<00:07:21.409> taken<00:07:21.650> but<00:07:21.979> hopefully<00:07:22.340> not<00:07:22.370> too<00:07:22.669> much

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:22.849 
I've taken but hopefully not too much

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:25.659 
I've taken but hopefully not too much

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:25.669 
and once that's over we'll just exit out

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:31.290 
and once that's over we'll just exit out
