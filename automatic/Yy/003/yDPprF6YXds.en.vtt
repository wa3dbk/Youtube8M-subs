00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 welcome apples today i will tell 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.850
 you about a rather convenient way 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.710
 share files between and devices and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.080
 mac computers using the app 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.519
 insta neck 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.460
 let's start by transferring data from the computer to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.160
 drag and drop device 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.529
 file on the application icon after that 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.090
 devices will be searched for 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.550
 born was found an application 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.949
 need to run on it after selecting 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.310
 the host and the device will begin the transfer 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.500
 file transfer is carried out by 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.110
 Wi-Fi network, respectively, copying 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
 happens pretty quickly progress on 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.370
 mobile device is displayed as 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.850
 strings a on a computer are circular 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.980
 charts on the status panel as you see 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.700
 With the help of Insta you can move cher on 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.110
 and the device is absolutely any type of file 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.270
 You can transfer not only photos and videos 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.910
 but also text documents pdf files 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.800
 archives d packs and so on by 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.870
 application no restriction on extension 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.379
 files, respectively, can be sent and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.210
 accept any file you only need to have 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.700
 application on and device using 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.170
 which one can open it like you 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.030
 understand the service can fully 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 function even on devices without 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.640
 jailbreak hacking device will only expand 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.729
 opportunities to discover specific 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.350
 file types the application on the computer does not 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.720
 has its own interface you 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.490
 only work with icon and menu status 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.040
 on and device 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.409
 The app contains three tabs on 1 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.659
 All received files are on the second 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 media files from the gallery and the third one contains 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.619
 application settings to 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.600
 transfer file from first or second 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.369
 tab is enough to delay on it 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.950
 finger and drag on available 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.720
 device on the right of the computer 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.130
 uploaded files will be saved in 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.770
 the folder selected in the application settings 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.619
 and their list will be displayed in 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.360
 context menu on the transmitted type 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.549
 There are also no device site files. 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.979
 restrictions a few words about the settings 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.960
 applications on the computer they are called 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.579
 from the context menu corresponding 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.070
 points you can specify the parameters 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.009
 autorun sound settings as well 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 folder for saved files 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.750
 application is able to work with buffer 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.550
 exchange 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.050
 so any copied file can 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.050
 immediately transfer to an accessible device 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.570
 Now I'll show you how it works inst hr 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.540
 when transferring data between mobile 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.460
 devices enough to transfer any 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.320
 file from the list already received or from 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.540
 galleries on the list of available devices 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.730
 with the first data transfer between 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.290
 devices will be asked to make them 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.420
 trusted after that will not 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.300
 transfer confirmation required 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.310
 there are no files here either 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.290
 restrictions on the type of files being transferred 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.790
 if you want to transfer a file from some 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.620
 external program or cloud 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.820
 data storage is enough to click 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.770
 open button in 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.800
 and choose program insta scarf after 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.690
 This will appear in the left panel as well. 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.480
 carried out the discovery taken 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.830
 files of the corresponding application 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.650
 just click the open pool button and 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.270
 choose the necessary program 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.800
 besides the ability to open the received file 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.430
 in a third-party application, you can 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.620
 to copy 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.050
 open in gallery or print on 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.830
 the printer any file can be sent by 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.600
 email or save to the cloud 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.190
 to open specific file types 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.930
 for example deep archives required 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.600
 jailbreak and installed file 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.380
 manager ai file now I'll tell you 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.730
 one more advantage inst hr 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.980
 the service is able to work not only by 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.380
 Wi-Fi network and via bluetooth 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.820
 This means that you can use it. 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.650
 sharing files not only 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.870
 devices that are in one 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.570
 networks can be used for this under 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.070
 forgotten protocol for implementation 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.750
 transfer operations 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.980
 need to activate bluetooth on 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.090
 both devices and run insher cher 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.220
 when the device will find each other 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.900
 it is enough to perform the same actions as 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.730
 and when transferring data via wifi 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.970
 Of course the download speed will be 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.830
 a little slower until the file is 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.709
 boot I will tell you more about one 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.630
 features inst hr all the files that you 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.610
 are taking place on the first 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.709
 panels of your application 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.290
 naturally they consume a place in 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.570
 device memory after you 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.550
 open and copy a file in any 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.730
 third-party application can be removed 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.430
 from insher cher same thing can be done 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.729
 if you save a photo gallery or 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.550
 video also note that when 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.860
 data transfer to and application devices 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.930
 can 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.479
 minimize but do not turn off the panel 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.819
 Multitasking loading while not 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.159
 will interrupt however note that 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.949
 multitasking vs works certain 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:39.620
 way if the application will hang 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.810
 background long time the system itself 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.370
 will complete it and unload from memory when 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.889
 this data transfer is natural 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.780
 will stop the same thing happen if 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.020
 put the device to sleep or 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.300
 turn off the screen keep in mind that when 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.259
 transferring large files is worth keeping 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.819
 the application is open and does not collapse it 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.620
 when working with the program and noticed more 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.199
 single function by applications specified 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.379
 the author is the ability to resume files 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.389
 when the connection is broken, it can 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.370
 happen if you accidentally turned off 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.289
 any of the devices or it turned into 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.409
 sleep mode when the application is minimized 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.419
 experience p however correct before loading 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.150
 files does not always work so better 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.080
 do not interrupt data transfer 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.449
 now talk about a few more 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.039
 features of ines tr at the very 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.659
 device note that 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.360
 the program can work as a base 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.490
 viewer of various file types when 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.080
 click on the icon of the received video or 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.659
 the music file will start it 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.370
 You can also play 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:41.949
 view but not edit 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.949
 accepted documents text and pdf-files 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.660
 painfully interesting distribution model 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.320
 inst hr there are two application options 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.680
 free and paid which costs 99 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.180
 cents free version of the application 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.650
 has full functionality however 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.650
 contains embedded ads 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.660
 any time for the same 33 rubles you can with 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.050
 using the built-in purchase to improve 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:16.950
 its up to a paid psx application you can 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.060
 download absolutely free 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.889
 don't forget to share yours 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.139
 comments and likes for video a
