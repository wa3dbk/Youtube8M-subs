00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
is adjustable you can slide this up or

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.380 
is adjustable you can slide this up or
down<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.840> use<00:00:52.199> these<00:00:52.379> clamps<00:00:52.710> as

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
down and you just use these clamps as

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.930 
down and you just use these clamps as
necessary<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.829> move<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.010> once<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.640> place

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
necessary to move it once it's in place

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.220 
necessary to move it once it's in place
then<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.480> ahead<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.780> connect<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
then you go ahead and you connect this

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.299 
then you go ahead and you connect this
to<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> shop<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.199> turn<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.469> but

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
rid of 95% of them so off to check back

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.620

later<00:02:12.540> let's<00:02:13.540> turn<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.840> back<00:02:14.020> on<00:02:15.480> all<00:02:16.480> right

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
you can already see it starting to slow

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.900 
you can already see it starting to slow
down

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910

when<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.180> did<00:04:41.300> this<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.840> actually<00:04:42.370> have<00:04:43.370> an

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
when I did this I actually have an

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.580 
when I did this I actually have an
abundance<00:04:43.910> of<00:04:44.030> caution<00:04:44.440> sealed<00:04:45.440> the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
abundance of caution sealed the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.990 
abundance of caution sealed the
container<00:04:45.979> up<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.370> let<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.580> sit<00:04:46.790> in<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:46.970> Sun

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
container up and let it sit in the Sun

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.110 
container up and let it sit in the Sun
for<00:04:47.210> two<00:04:47.540> weeks<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:48.220> that<00:04:49.220> was<00:04:49.460> actually<00:04:49.639> much

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
for two weeks and that was actually much

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.170 
for two weeks and that was actually much
more<00:04:50.330> disgusting<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.229> was<00:04:51.470> basically<00:04:51.979> a

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
more disgusting that was basically a

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.120 
more disgusting that was basically a
protein<00:04:53.180> shake<00:04:55.180> but<00:04:56.180> we<00:04:56.960> have<00:04:57.140> none<00:04:57.440> coming<00:04:57.919> in

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
protein shake but we have none coming in

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.270 
protein shake but we have none coming in
coming<00:04:58.340> out<00:04:58.610> seems<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.330> have<00:04:59.479> worked<00:05:00.100> this<00:05:01.100> I

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
coming out seems to have worked this I

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.040 
coming out seems to have worked this I
think<00:05:01.490> is<00:05:01.610> way<00:05:01.970> more<00:05:02.180> effective<00:05:02.330> than<00:05:02.930> when

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
think is way more effective than when

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.890 
think is way more effective than when
you<00:05:03.140> spray<00:05:03.380> chemicals<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:04.750> obviously<00:05:05.750> we're

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
you spray chemicals and obviously we're

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.000 
you spray chemicals and obviously we're
not<00:05:05.960> spraying<00:05:06.290> chemicals<00:05:06.410> so<00:05:06.830> I'm<00:05:06.890> not

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
not spraying chemicals so I'm not

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.610 
not spraying chemicals so I'm not
worried<00:05:07.280> about<00:05:07.400> my<00:05:07.550> family<00:05:07.729> so<00:05:09.850> that's<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:11.090> and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
worried about my family so that's it and

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.860 
worried about my family so that's it and
that's<00:05:12.620> me
