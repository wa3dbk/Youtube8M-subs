pin<00:00:04.680> clock<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.400> device<00:00:06.000> that's<00:00:06.029> been

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
pin clock this is a device that's been

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.540 
pin clock this is a device that's been
subsidized<00:00:06.870> by<00:00:07.080> projects<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> very

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
subsidized by projects and is a very

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.549 
subsidized by projects and is a very
unique<00:00:08.880> clock<00:00:09.150> as<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.480> can<00:00:09.630> see<00:00:09.809> here<00:00:10.050> because

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
unique clock as you can see here because

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.020 
unique clock as you can see here because
it's<00:00:10.710> very<00:00:10.830> similar<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.250> those<00:00:11.460> toys<00:00:11.759> where

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
it's very similar to those toys where

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.209 
it's very similar to those toys where
you<00:00:12.120> put<00:00:12.300> your<00:00:12.389> hand<00:00:12.690> behind<00:00:12.870> he<00:00:13.259> pin<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.130> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
you put your hand behind he pin and it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.220 
you put your hand behind he pin and it
actually<00:00:14.370> imprints<00:00:15.000> what's<00:00:15.450> ever<00:00:15.630> behind<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
actually imprints what's ever behind it

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.660 
actually imprints what's ever behind it
and<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.470> same<00:00:16.650> thing<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.890> going<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.160> here

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and the same thing is going on here

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.490 
and the same thing is going on here
except<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.180> actually<00:00:18.570> pins<00:00:18.900> displaying

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
except you have actually pins displaying

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.560 
except you have actually pins displaying
the<00:00:19.590> time<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.160> whenever<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.880> time<00:00:21.090> changes

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the time and whenever the time changes

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.730 
the time and whenever the time changes
the<00:00:21.779> pins<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.050> automatically<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the pins are automatically going to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.500 
the pins are automatically going to
change<00:00:22.980> configuration<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.300> motor

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
change configuration and the motor

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.150 
change configuration and the motor
inside<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:24.990> going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> push<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.619> individual

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
inside it's going to push out individual

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.429 
inside it's going to push out individual
pin<00:00:26.369> by<00:00:26.609> pin<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:27.449> actually<00:00:27.990> display<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
pin by pin to actually display the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
pin by pin to actually display the
correct<00:00:28.740> time<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.250> pull<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.060> pin<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
correct time and pull in the pin that is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.479 
correct time and pull in the pin that is
no<00:00:30.660> longer<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.170> use<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> very<00:00:32.279> unique

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
no longer in use and it's a very unique

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.850 
no longer in use and it's a very unique
and<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:32.969> very<00:00:33.540> interesting<00:00:33.960> device<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and very very interesting device now the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.510 
and very very interesting device now the
first<00:00:35.070> thing<00:00:35.190> we're<00:00:35.280> gonna<00:00:35.399> talk<00:00:35.489> about

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
first thing we're gonna talk about

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.560 
first thing we're gonna talk about
though<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> price

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
though is the price

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.950 
though is the price
now<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.620> pin<00:00:37.920> clock<00:00:38.129> by<00:00:38.309> Daka<00:00:38.670> costs<00:00:39.090> $100

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
now the pin clock by Daka costs $100

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170 
now the pin clock by Daka costs $100
that<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.320> an<00:00:40.469> extremely<00:00:41.040> high<00:00:41.370> price<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.969> our

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that is an extremely high price in our

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.850 
that is an extremely high price in our
opinions<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.989> pay<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.469> something<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
opinions to pay for something like a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.100 
opinions to pay for something like a
clock<00:00:44.160> yes<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.149> cool<00:00:45.450> very<00:00:45.809> geeky

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
clock yes it's a very cool very geeky

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.869 
clock yes it's a very cool very geeky
way<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> display<00:00:46.800> your<00:00:46.860> time<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.670> definitely

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
way to display your time it's definitely

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.060 
way to display your time it's definitely
a<00:00:48.180> conversation<00:00:48.420> starter<00:00:49.170> piece<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.890> have

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
a conversation starter piece if you have

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.680 
a conversation starter piece if you have
the<00:00:50.219> money<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.520> burn<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.910> certainly<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.300> unique

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the money to burn it certainly is unique

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.020 
the money to burn it certainly is unique
but<00:00:52.320> otherwise<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.309> don't<00:00:53.430> think<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.850> you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
but otherwise we don't think it's you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330 
but otherwise we don't think it's you
know<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> best<00:00:54.590> way<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.620> spend<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.160> hundred

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
know the best way to spend a hundred

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.560 
know the best way to spend a hundred
dollars<00:00:56.730> certainly

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
dollars certainly

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.970 
dollars certainly
now<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> other<00:00:58.140> disappointing<00:00:58.710> factors

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
now the other disappointing factors

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.069 
now the other disappointing factors
device<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.460> quite<00:00:59.699> heavy<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.300> quite<00:01:00.629> large<00:01:00.809> as

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
device is quite heavy and quite large as

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.959 
device is quite heavy and quite large as
you<00:01:01.170> might<00:01:01.289> expect<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.760> don't<00:01:02.910> have

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you might expect so if you don't have

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.340 
you might expect so if you don't have
too<00:01:03.149> much<00:01:03.270> desk<00:01:03.539> space<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:04.019> something

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
too much desk space is something

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
too much desk space is something
something<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> concern<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
something to be of a concern of now the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.880 
something to be of a concern of now the
actual<00:01:06.630> pin<00:01:06.869> part<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> actually<00:01:07.439> protected<00:01:07.799> by

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
actual pin part is actually protected by

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770 
actual pin part is actually protected by
a<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.189> hard<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> very<00:01:08.790> refined<00:01:09.119> plastic<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
a very hard and very refined plastic you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
a very hard and very refined plastic you
can<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.770> can't<00:01:11.070> actually<00:01:11.220> put

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
can see here so you can't actually put

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
can see here so you can't actually put
your<00:01:11.580> fingers<00:01:11.880> behind<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.540> actually<00:01:12.630> move

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
your fingers behind it and actually move

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.719 
your fingers behind it and actually move
the<00:01:13.110> clock<00:01:13.320> by<00:01:13.740> accident<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.340> something<00:01:14.549> like

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the clock by accident or something like

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.880 
the clock by accident or something like
that<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.720> you'll<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.470> two<00:01:16.680> very

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that and you'll have just two very

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.080 
that and you'll have just two very
simple<00:01:17.130> buttons<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.610> top<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.939> device

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
simple buttons on the top of the device

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.940 
simple buttons on the top of the device
displaying<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:18.720> minutes<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.650> hours

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
displaying your minutes and your hours

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.109 
displaying your minutes and your hours
when<00:01:20.100> you're<00:01:20.189> first<00:01:20.340> setting<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> pin

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
when you're first setting up the pin

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.670 
when you're first setting up the pin
clock<00:01:21.390> which<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.259> takes<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.530> while

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
clock which actually takes a while

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.960 
clock which actually takes a while
because<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:23.250> through<00:01:23.490> every<00:01:23.759> pin

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
because you have to go through every pin

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.940 
because you have to go through every pin
configuration<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.380> takes<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.770> while<00:01:25.920> for

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
configuration and it takes a while for

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.320 
configuration and it takes a while for
the<00:01:26.189> device<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.549> actually<00:01:26.640> change<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.240> know

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the device to actually change you know

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
the device to actually change you know
the<00:01:27.360> clock<00:01:27.659> otherwise<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.799> works<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.189> well

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the clock otherwise it works pretty well

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.980 
the clock otherwise it works pretty well
as<00:01:29.729> far<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:29.939> timekeeping<00:01:30.509> goes<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.840> don't

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
as far as timekeeping goes you don't

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.510 
as far as timekeeping goes you don't
have<00:01:31.079> any<00:01:31.229> date<00:01:31.530> settings<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.250> basically

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
have any date settings it's basically

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.130 
have any date settings it's basically
just<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.820> clock<00:01:33.060> setting<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:33.900> far<00:01:34.079> as

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
just a clock setting but as far as

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.539 
just a clock setting but as far as
accuracy<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.680> concerned<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.159> actually<00:01:35.430> is

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
accuracy is concerned it actually is

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.880 
accuracy is concerned it actually is
very<00:01:35.850> very<00:01:36.060> accurate<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.869> might<00:01:37.439> expect<00:01:37.740> you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
very very accurate you might expect you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800 
very very accurate you might expect you
know<00:01:37.979> turning<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.610> pins<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.600> using

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
know turning the pins and you know using

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.390 
know turning the pins and you know using
the<00:01:39.960> motor<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> pull<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> pins<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the motor to pull in the pins and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.319 
the motor to pull in the pins and
putting<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.700> might<00:01:41.909> take<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> little

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
putting it out might take a little

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.090 
putting it out might take a little
longer<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> device<00:01:43.619> automatically

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
longer but the device automatically

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.649 
longer but the device automatically
takes<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.460> into<00:01:44.579> consideration<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.540> that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
takes that into consideration so that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.300 
takes that into consideration so that
the<00:01:45.780> speeds<00:01:46.079> are<00:01:46.259> still<00:01:46.470> fairly<00:01:46.590> accurate<00:01:47.130> and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the speeds are still fairly accurate and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.580 
the speeds are still fairly accurate and
it<00:01:47.790> tells<00:01:47.970> time<00:01:48.060> very<00:01:48.659> accurate<00:01:49.049> even<00:01:49.200> after<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it tells time very accurate even after a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.639 
it tells time very accurate even after a
while<00:01:50.570> it's<00:01:51.570> interesting<00:01:51.990> also<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.290> you

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
while it's interesting also because you

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.560 
while it's interesting also because you
know<00:01:52.710> pins<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.759> gravity<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.450> gonna

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
know pins are like gravity so it's gonna

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.450 
know pins are like gravity so it's gonna
are<00:01:54.930> affected<00:01:55.560> by<00:01:55.649> gravity<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.340> gonna

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
are affected by gravity so you're gonna

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
are affected by gravity so you're gonna
be<00:01:56.579> able<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.290> make<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> pins

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
be able to you know make the pins

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.530 
be able to you know make the pins
disappear<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.399> make<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> pins<00:01:59.880> come<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.329> all

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
disappear and make the pins come out all

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.929 
disappear and make the pins come out all
at<00:02:00.689> once<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:02.130> very<00:02:02.250> interesting<00:02:02.549> it's

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
at once so it's very interesting it's

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.520 
at once so it's very interesting it's
very<00:02:03.149> easy<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.390> move<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.899> you've<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.380> are

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
very easy to move so you've if you are

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.109 
very easy to move so you've if you are
an<00:02:04.710> environment<00:02:05.189> where<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.670> shaky

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
an environment where it's very shaky

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.940 
an environment where it's very shaky
perhaps<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.600> car<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> be

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
perhaps on a car it's not going to be

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.619 
perhaps on a car it's not going to be
the<00:02:08.009> most<00:02:08.129> accurate<00:02:08.550> clock<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.509> if

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the most accurate clock out there but if

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.190 
the most accurate clock out there but if
you're<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.929> stable<00:02:10.140> environment<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.709> like

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
you're in a stable environment like like

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.350 
you're in a stable environment like like
the<00:02:11.319> home<00:02:11.860> thus<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.640> large<00:02:12.819> size<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.300> the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
the home thus the large size and the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.910 
the home thus the large size and the
fussy<00:02:13.660> rubber<00:02:13.840> feet<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:14.440> gonna<00:02:14.590> work<00:02:14.770> pretty

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
fussy rubber feet it's gonna work pretty

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.589 
fussy rubber feet it's gonna work pretty
well<00:02:15.069> now<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.760> case<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.300> know<00:02:16.390> I've

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
well now in case you know I've

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.360 
well now in case you know I've
accidentally<00:02:17.080> reset<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.560> time<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:17.830> can't<00:02:18.190> see

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
accidentally reset the time I can't see

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.490 
accidentally reset the time I can't see
it<00:02:18.489> anymore<00:02:18.700> I'm<00:02:19.000> now<00:02:19.660> very<00:02:20.019> worried<00:02:20.410> because

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
it anymore I'm now very worried because

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.780 
it anymore I'm now very worried because
I<00:02:20.650> can't<00:02:20.830> see<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:20.980> time<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.400> can<00:02:21.489> just<00:02:21.640> press

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
I can't see the time you can just press

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.130 
I can't see the time you can just press
the<00:02:21.849> minutes<00:02:22.239> button<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.660> top<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:22.959> gonna

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
the minutes button on the top it's gonna

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.229 
the minutes button on the top it's gonna
automatically<00:02:23.500> come<00:02:23.739> out<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.640> o'clock<00:02:24.910> one

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
automatically come out one o'clock one

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.360 
automatically come out one o'clock one
time<00:02:25.480> at<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.629> time<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.349> it's<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.560> very<00:02:26.769> cool<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.099> can

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
time at a time so it's a very cool I can

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.330 
time at a time so it's a very cool I can
a<00:02:27.400> very<00:02:27.580> unique<00:02:28.060> user<00:02:28.630> interface<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.920> it's

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
a very unique user interface and it's

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.890 
a very unique user interface and it's
very<00:02:30.550> fun<00:02:30.760> doing<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.180> but<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.599> definitely

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
very fun doing that but it definitely

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.780 
very fun doing that but it definitely
put<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.470> know<00:02:32.590> plays<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.950> toll<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.489> battery

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
put you know plays a toll on the battery

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.790 
put you know plays a toll on the battery
no<00:02:33.940> doubt<00:02:34.090> but<00:02:34.390> it's<00:02:34.540> very<00:02:35.140> fun<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.530> do<00:02:35.620> this

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
no doubt but it's very fun to do this

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.990 
no doubt but it's very fun to do this
with<00:02:36.040> friends<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.430> family<00:02:36.700> they're<00:02:36.849> always

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
with friends and family they're always

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.720 
with friends and family they're always
in<00:02:37.269> awe<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.690> wonder<00:02:38.170> now<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.769> course<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.489> pen

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
in awe and wonder now of course the pen

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.220 
in awe and wonder now of course the pen
it<00:02:39.970> might<00:02:40.120> look<00:02:40.269> like<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.599> surrounding

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
it might look like the surrounding

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.229 
it might look like the surrounding
components<00:02:42.099> of<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.310> clock<00:02:42.519> are<00:02:42.640> also<00:02:42.819> pins

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
components of this clock are also pins

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.940 
components of this clock are also pins
but<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.780> only<00:02:43.930> movable<00:02:44.349> parts<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.769> pins

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
but the only movable parts of the pins

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.770 
but the only movable parts of the pins
are<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.430> actual<00:02:45.730> time<00:02:45.970> component<00:02:46.299> you<00:02:46.540> can't

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
are the actual time component you can't

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.539 
are the actual time component you can't
actually<00:02:46.959> accidentally<00:02:47.560> move<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:48.160> outside

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
actually accidentally move the outside

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.220 
actually accidentally move the outside
parts<00:02:48.849> which<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.239> something<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.930> take<00:02:50.019> note<00:02:50.049> of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
parts which is something to take note of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.680 
parts which is something to take note of
but<00:02:50.829> again<00:02:50.860> overall<00:02:51.250> it's<00:02:51.579> it's<00:02:52.209> camouflage

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
but again overall it's it's camouflage

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.670 
but again overall it's it's camouflage
pretty<00:02:53.019> well<00:02:53.849> one<00:02:54.849> knowings<00:02:55.750> annoyance<00:02:56.410> ahead

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
pretty well one knowings annoyance ahead

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.289 
pretty well one knowings annoyance ahead
of<00:02:56.769> this<00:02:56.920> device<00:02:57.160> was<00:02:57.340> it's<00:02:57.730> very<00:02:57.970> loud<00:02:58.239> when

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
of this device was it's very loud when

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.970 
of this device was it's very loud when
it<00:02:58.630> actually<00:02:58.930> changes<00:02:59.319> time<00:02:59.590> you'll<00:02:59.829> notice

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
it actually changes time you'll notice

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.890 
it actually changes time you'll notice
this<00:03:00.220> whenever<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.640> changes<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:01.120> minute<00:03:01.750> it's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
this whenever it changes a minute it's

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.720 
this whenever it changes a minute it's
gonna<00:03:01.959> go<00:03:02.230> clock<00:03:02.769> it's<00:03:03.069> gonna<00:03:03.160> go<00:03:03.310> tick<00:03:03.519> tick

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
gonna go clock it's gonna go tick tick

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.490 
gonna go clock it's gonna go tick tick
tick<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.750> pins<00:03:04.959> are<00:03:05.079> going<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.260> be<00:03:05.319> pulled

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
tick and the pins are going to be pulled

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.229 
tick and the pins are going to be pulled
in<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.860> out<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.250> if<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.430> are<00:03:06.610> in<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.760> very<00:03:06.849> quiet

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
in and out so if you are in a very quiet

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.759 
in and out so if you are in a very quiet
environment<00:03:07.420> like<00:03:07.989> in<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.170> library<00:03:08.560> or

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
environment like in a library or

something<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.489> gonna<00:03:09.700> be<00:03:09.849> quiet

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
something this is gonna be quiet

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.550 
something this is gonna be quiet
distracting<00:03:10.959> because<00:03:11.049> whenever<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.530> changes

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
distracting because whenever it changes

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920 
distracting because whenever it changes
a<00:03:11.860> minute<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.370> makes<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.910> pretty<00:03:13.120> large<00:03:13.510> noise

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
a minute it makes a pretty large noise

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.240 
a minute it makes a pretty large noise
that<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.290> can't<00:03:14.500> get<00:03:14.680> rid<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:14.980> that's

that you can't get rid of that's

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.520 
that you can't get rid of that's
something<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.700> note<00:03:15.900> otherwise<00:03:16.900> again<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.290> very

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
something to note otherwise again a very

something to note otherwise again a very
unique<00:03:17.980> clock<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.459> built<00:03:18.880> very<00:03:19.150> solidly<00:03:19.510> out

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
unique clock it's built very solidly out

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.509 
unique clock it's built very solidly out
of<00:03:19.780> plastic<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.350> pretty<00:03:20.650> heavy<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:21.280> can<00:03:21.400> see

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
of plastic it's pretty heavy you can see

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.129 
of plastic it's pretty heavy you can see
a<00:03:21.549> darker<00:03:21.880> logo<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.299> back<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> bottom

here actually takes this kind of

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.280 
here actually takes this kind of
proprietary<00:03:37.060> battery<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:37.810> not<00:03:37.959> like<00:03:38.139> your

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
proprietary battery it's not like your

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.250 
proprietary battery it's not like your
double-a<00:03:38.620> battery<00:03:38.980> because<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.549> device

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
double-a battery because the device

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.509 
double-a battery because the device
reasonably<00:03:41.260> drains<00:03:41.680> up<00:03:41.859> at<00:03:42.069> your<00:03:42.190> battery

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
reasonably drains up at your battery

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.729 
reasonably drains up at your battery
power<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.880> lot<00:03:43.180> faster<00:03:43.690> than<00:03:43.900> traditional

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
power a lot faster than traditional

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.680 
power a lot faster than traditional
clocks<00:03:45.370> out<00:03:45.609> there<00:03:45.910> because<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.269> has<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.480> pull

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
clocks out there because it has to pull

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.559 
clocks out there because it has to pull
in<00:03:46.930> pins<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.650> then<00:03:47.980> push<00:03:48.160> out<00:03:48.310> pins<00:03:48.670> using<00:03:49.510> a

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
in pins and then push out pins using a

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.120 
in pins and then push out pins using a
template<00:03:49.959> system<00:03:50.170> which<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.650> can<00:03:50.769> only<00:03:50.799> assume

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
template system which I can only assume

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.009 
template system which I can only assume
is<00:03:51.519> quite<00:03:51.880> draining<00:03:52.209> on<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.540> battery

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
is quite draining on the battery

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.289 
is quite draining on the battery
so<00:03:53.230> let's<00:03:53.380> reset<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.709> again<00:03:54.099> and<00:03:54.310> check<00:03:55.150> out

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
so let's reset it again and check out

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.059 
so let's reset it again and check out
the<00:03:55.420> time<00:03:55.660> again<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.109> otherwise<00:03:56.560> it's<00:03:56.980> a

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
the time again so otherwise it's a

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.259 
the time again so otherwise it's a
pretty<00:03:57.250> interesting<00:03:57.459> clock<00:03:57.849> you<00:03:58.030> know<00:03:58.060> it

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
pretty interesting clock you know it

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.750 
pretty interesting clock you know it
works<00:03:58.510> as<00:03:58.720> advertised<00:03:59.319> but<00:03:59.889> it<00:04:00.069> has<00:04:00.250> its<00:04:00.459> down

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
works as advertised but it has its down

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.160 
works as advertised but it has its down
flaws<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.269> flaws<00:04:01.450> but<00:04:01.690> at<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.840> end<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:02.049> the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
flaws and flaws but at the end of the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.050 
flaws and flaws but at the end of the
day<00:04:02.319> if<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:02.859> do<00:04:03.040> think<00:04:03.250> this<00:04:03.340> is<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.519> super<00:04:03.849> cool

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
day if you do think this is a super cool

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.259 
day if you do think this is a super cool
device<00:04:04.900> I'd<00:04:05.500> say<00:04:05.709> go<00:04:05.920> with<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.250> as<00:04:06.849> long<00:04:07.060> as<00:04:07.180> you

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
device I'd say go with it as long as you

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.030 
device I'd say go with it as long as you
know<00:04:07.359> that<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.750> costs<00:04:08.079> $100<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:08.859> are

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
know that it costs $100 and you are

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.379 
know that it costs $100 and you are
willing<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.430> shop<00:04:09.639> about<00:04:09.849> money<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.269> get

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
willing to shop about money to get

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.420 
willing to shop about money to get
something<00:04:10.599> that's<00:04:10.810> kind<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.349> more<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:12.040> piece

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
something that's kind of more of a piece

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.699 
something that's kind of more of a piece
of<00:04:12.579> style<00:04:12.849> rather<00:04:13.480> than<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.780> substance<00:04:14.169> so

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
of style rather than the substance so
