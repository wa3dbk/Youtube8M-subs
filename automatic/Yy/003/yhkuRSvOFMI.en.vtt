all<00:00:04.319> right<00:00:04.470> now<00:00:04.620> it's<00:00:04.770> time<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:04.950> put<00:00:05.220> together

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
all right now it's time to put together

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.660 
all right now it's time to put together
the<00:00:06.290> refrigeration<00:00:07.290> cycle<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:07.950> how<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.490> all

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
the refrigeration cycle and how this all

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.910 
the refrigeration cycle and how this all
these<00:00:09.030> components<00:00:09.360> work<00:00:09.690> together<00:00:09.840> before<00:00:10.800> we

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
these components work together before we

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.200 
these components work together before we
do<00:00:11.010> let's<00:00:11.219> just<00:00:11.309> head<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> little<00:00:11.849> bit<00:00:12.000> about

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
do let's just head a little bit about

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.049 
do let's just head a little bit about
the<00:00:12.540> refrigerant<00:00:13.049> metering<00:00:13.380> device<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
the refrigerant metering device and

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.829 
the refrigerant metering device and
there<00:00:15.059> are<00:00:15.210> several<00:00:15.420> different<00:00:15.809> kinds

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
there are several different kinds

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.330 
there are several different kinds
they're<00:00:16.260> outlined<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.740> your<00:00:16.830> book<00:00:17.070> there's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
they're outlined in your book there's

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.220 
they're outlined in your book there's
supplementary<00:00:17.970> information<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.960> each<00:00:19.199> one

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
supplementary information about each one

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.060 
supplementary information about each one
in<00:00:19.529> detail

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
in detail

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.820 
in detail
but<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.880> need<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.180> know<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:22.080> it

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
but what you do need to know is that it

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.189 
but what you do need to know is that it
controls<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.090> flow<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.810> sub-cooled

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
controls the flow of the sub-cooled

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.750 
controls the flow of the sub-cooled
liquid<00:00:25.230> from<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> condenser<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
liquid from the condenser going to the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.689 
liquid from the condenser going to the
evaporator<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.170> basically<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
evaporator and and basically it is a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.110 
evaporator and and basically it is a
restriction<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.800> what<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.520> restriction

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
restriction and what that restriction

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.490 
restriction and what that restriction
does<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.750> putting<00:00:33.989> your<00:00:34.079> thumb<00:00:34.649> over<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
does is like putting your thumb over the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.740 
does is like putting your thumb over the
your<00:00:37.500> hose<00:00:37.800> your<00:00:38.309> garden<00:00:38.670> hose<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.480> pressure

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
your hose your garden hose the pressure

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
your hose your garden hose the pressure
builds<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.260> behind<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:41.190> there's<00:00:41.340> very

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
builds up behind but then there's very

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.900 
builds up behind but then there's very
low<00:00:41.940> pressure<00:00:42.270> after<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.469> sprays<00:00:43.800> past<00:00:44.640> your

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
low pressure after it sprays past your

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.330 
low pressure after it sprays past your
thumb<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.360> that's<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.140> happens<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
thumb and that's what happens with a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.139 
thumb and that's what happens with a
metering<00:00:48.270> device<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.440> takes<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.149> high

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
metering device is it takes the high

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.830 
metering device is it takes the high
pressure<00:00:51.480> liquid<00:00:52.640> refrigerant<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.090> drops

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
pressure liquid refrigerant and drops

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.209 
pressure liquid refrigerant and drops
the<00:00:55.110> pressure<00:00:55.350> down<00:00:55.620> below<00:00:55.890> its<00:00:56.039> boiling

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the pressure down below its boiling

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.750 
the pressure down below its boiling
point

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
point

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.990 
point
and<00:00:56.879> that's<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:57.840> starts<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> cause<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.000> heat

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and that's what starts to cause the heat

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.910 
and that's what starts to cause the heat
transfer<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> happen<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> evaporator

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
transfer to happen in the evaporator

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.080 
transfer to happen in the evaporator
coil<00:01:02.510> now<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.640> diagram<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.760> comes

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
coil now this is a diagram that comes

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
coil now this is a diagram that comes
from<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.479> book<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:07.350> got<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.799> 3<00:01:08.100> or<00:01:08.220> 4

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
from your book it's got about a 3 or 4

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.410 
from your book it's got about a 3 or 4
page<00:01:09.080> description<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.939> what<00:01:11.939> we're<00:01:12.119> looking

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
page description of what we're looking

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.200 
page description of what we're looking
at<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.049> we're<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:14.000> break<00:01:15.000> this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
at here so we're going to break this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.450 
at here so we're going to break this
down<00:01:15.270> piece<00:01:16.110> by<00:01:16.140> piece<00:01:16.350> let's<00:01:17.009> blow<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.280> up

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
down piece by piece let's blow it up

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.140 
down piece by piece let's blow it up
just<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.790> bit

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
just a bit

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.380 
just a bit
alright<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> metering<00:01:21.630> device<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:24.030> just

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
alright so metering device this just

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.780 
alright so metering device this just
shows<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.659> restriction<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.799> this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
shows the restriction this this

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
shows the restriction this this
designates<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.630> metering<00:01:28.049> device<00:01:28.380> whether<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
designates a metering device whether it

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.440 
designates a metering device whether it
be<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.000> piston<00:01:30.780> fixed<00:01:31.110> orifice<00:01:31.619> cap<00:01:31.920> tube<00:01:32.159> or

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
be a piston fixed orifice cap tube or

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.569 
be a piston fixed orifice cap tube or
TXV<00:01:33.500> that's<00:01:34.500> our<00:01:34.710> metering<00:01:35.070> device<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.460> we're

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
TXV that's our metering device and we're

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.149 
TXV that's our metering device and we're
going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> start<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:36.680> as<00:01:39.049> the

it on there it's going to read 40
degrees<00:02:20.360> Fahrenheit<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.379> can<00:02:21.530> verify

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
degrees Fahrenheit and you can verify

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.500 
degrees Fahrenheit and you can verify
this<00:02:22.099> by<00:02:23.680> taking<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.980> look<00:02:25.010> at<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.640> pressure

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
this by taking a look at the pressure

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.710 
this by taking a look at the pressure
temperature<00:02:26.780> chart<00:02:27.260> for<00:02:27.440> r22<00:02:28.129> so<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.540> is

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
temperature chart for r22 so this is

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.890 
temperature chart for r22 so this is
here's<00:02:30.650> our<00:02:30.799> r22<00:02:31.489> pressure<00:02:32.390> temperature

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
here's our r22 pressure temperature

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.180 
here's our r22 pressure temperature
chart<00:02:33.819> we<00:02:34.819> are<00:02:35.120> at<00:02:35.950> 69<00:02:36.950> psi<00:02:37.519> G<00:02:38.860> which<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:39.890> right

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
chart we are at 69 psi G which is right

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.339 
chart we are at 69 psi G which is right
about<00:02:40.400> here<00:02:40.510> which<00:02:41.510> spring<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:41.930> right<00:02:42.170> between

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
about here which spring is right between

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.259 
about here which spring is right between
the<00:02:42.680> 40<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.190> 50<00:02:43.640> degree

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
the 40 and 50 degree

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.740 
the 40 and 50 degree
I'm<00:02:44.840> sorry<00:02:45.110> 40<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.620> 41<00:02:45.950> degree<00:02:46.430> mark<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
I'm sorry 40 and 41 degree mark on the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.140 
I'm sorry 40 and 41 degree mark on the
refrigeration<00:02:49.150> pressure<00:02:50.150> temperature<00:02:50.390> chart

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
refrigeration pressure temperature chart

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.640 
refrigeration pressure temperature chart
so<00:02:53.150> that's<00:02:53.569> how<00:02:53.720> we<00:02:53.780> know<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:54.349> 40

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
so that's how we know that it's 40

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.470 
so that's how we know that it's 40
degrees<00:02:54.680> anytime<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.640> put<00:02:55.790> your<00:02:55.940> gauges<00:02:56.150> on

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
degrees anytime you put your gauges on

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.180 
degrees anytime you put your gauges on
you<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:57.590> how<00:02:57.769> you're<00:02:57.890> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.069> be<00:02:58.129> able

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
you that's how you're going to be able

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.069 
you that's how you're going to be able
to<00:02:58.310> tell<00:02:58.519> what<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> temperature<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.390> the

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
to tell what the temperature of the

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.069 
to tell what the temperature of the
refrigerant<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.709> now<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.629> one<00:03:02.810> thing<00:03:02.989> to

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
refrigerant is now the one thing to

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.880 
refrigerant is now the one thing to
remember<00:03:03.319> when<00:03:03.680> we<00:03:03.859> are<00:03:04.569> talking<00:03:05.569> about<00:03:05.900> the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
remember when we are talking about the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.229 
remember when we are talking about the
pressure<00:03:07.129> temperature<00:03:07.400> chart<00:03:07.879> and<00:03:07.970> I've<00:03:08.030> said

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
pressure temperature chart and I've said

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.039 
pressure temperature chart and I've said
this<00:03:08.269> before<00:03:08.510> but<00:03:08.989> it<00:03:09.829> bears<00:03:10.400> saying<00:03:10.670> again

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
this before but it bears saying again

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.069 
this before but it bears saying again
the<00:03:12.049> pressure<00:03:12.290> temperature<00:03:13.099> chart<00:03:13.640> only

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
the pressure temperature chart only

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.440 
the pressure temperature chart only
works<00:03:15.079> when<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.430> refrigerant<00:03:16.579> is<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:17.269> its

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
works when the refrigerant is in its

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.520 
works when the refrigerant is in its
saturated<00:03:17.900> temperature<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.650> as<00:03:19.450> saturation

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
saturated temperature and as saturation

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.860 
saturated temperature and as saturation
temperature<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.950> pressures<00:03:22.579> so<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:25.430> only

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
temperature and pressures so that only

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.580 
temperature and pressures so that only

don't forget that this is one is in this

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.670 
don't forget that this is one is in this
when<00:03:49.430> we're<00:03:49.549> talking<00:03:49.700> about<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:51.470> pressure

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
when we're talking about the pressure

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.190 
when we're talking about the pressure
temperature<00:03:52.190> chart<00:03:52.489> and<00:03:52.609> refrigerant<00:03:53.200> that

temperature chart and refrigerant that

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.990 
temperature chart and refrigerant that

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
means it's in the saturated State that's

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.390 
means it's in the saturated State that's
where<00:03:56.209> if<00:03:56.419> you<00:03:56.540> add<00:03:56.750> heat<00:03:57.440> in<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:57.950> case<00:03:58.220> and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
where if you add heat in this case and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.949 
where if you add heat in this case and
the<00:03:58.459> evaporator<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.209> going<00:03:59.389> to<00:03:59.450> change<00:03:59.690> state

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
the evaporator is going to change state

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:00.970 
the evaporator is going to change state
from<00:04:00.139> liquid<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.590> vapor

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
from liquid to vapor

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.569 
from liquid to vapor
alright<00:04:01.819> let's<00:04:02.000> follow<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:02.419> around<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:04.489> at

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
alright let's follow this around so at

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.759 
alright let's follow this around so at
this<00:04:04.669> point<00:04:04.940> we're<00:04:05.090> at<00:04:05.150> 75<00:04:05.690> percent<00:04:05.769> liquid

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
this point we're at 75 percent liquid

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.050 
this point we're at 75 percent liquid
and<00:04:07.129> 25<00:04:07.519> percent<00:04:07.760> vapor<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:09.379> fan<00:04:09.819> indoor<00:04:10.819> fan

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
and 25 percent vapor the fan indoor fan

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.030 
and 25 percent vapor the fan indoor fan
is<00:04:11.239> blowing<00:04:11.569> the<00:04:11.660> return<00:04:11.989> air<00:04:12.169> across<00:04:12.560> the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
is blowing the return air across the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.129 
is blowing the return air across the
coil<00:04:13.790> that's<00:04:14.030> what<00:04:14.239> this<00:04:14.329> designates<00:04:14.900> right

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
coil that's what this designates right

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.349 
coil that's what this designates right
here<00:04:15.349> and<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:16.760> refrigerant<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.329> flowing

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
here and the refrigerant is flowing

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.300 
here and the refrigerant is flowing
through<00:04:17.840> here<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.260> as<00:04:18.349> it<00:04:18.560> does<00:04:18.739> it's<00:04:18.919> boiling

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
through here and as it does it's boiling

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.170 
through here and as it does it's boiling
off<00:04:19.459> down<00:04:20.739> through<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.890> evaporator<00:04:22.640> coil

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
off down through the evaporator coil

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.320 
off down through the evaporator coil
and<00:04:24.270> as<00:04:25.160> it<00:04:26.160> gets<00:04:26.490> down<00:04:26.699> here<00:04:26.759> to<00:04:28.490> 0.44<00:04:29.490> we're

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
and as it gets down here to 0.44 we're

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.110 
and as it gets down here to 0.44 we're
about<00:04:30.949> 50/50<00:04:31.949> at<00:04:32.039> this<00:04:32.250> point<00:04:32.550> so<00:04:32.759> we're<00:04:32.910> still

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
about 50/50 at this point so we're still

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.700 
about 50/50 at this point so we're still
in<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.270> saturated<00:04:33.690> state<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:34.320> we've<00:04:34.440> given

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
in the saturated state but we've given

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.650 
in the saturated state but we've given
up<00:04:34.889> a<00:04:35.009> lot<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.250> heat<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.639> this<00:04:35.910> refrigerant<00:04:36.449> and

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.450 
up a lot of heat to this refrigerant and
if<00:04:37.229> you<00:04:37.350> could<00:04:37.560> put<00:04:37.740> your<00:04:37.860> thermometer<00:04:38.070> on

if you could put your thermometer on
there<00:04:38.580> again<00:04:38.850> it's<00:04:39.030> still<00:04:39.270> 40<00:04:39.690> degrees

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
there again it's still 40 degrees

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.249 
there again it's still 40 degrees

because it's in the saturated State 68
psi<00:04:43.800> G<00:04:44.070> we<00:04:44.699> know<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.060> 48<00:04:45.419> degrees<00:04:45.870> in<00:04:46.110> the

psi G we know it's 48 degrees in the

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.180 
psi G we know it's 48 degrees in the
coil<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.990> refrigerant<00:04:49.500> continues<00:04:49.889> down

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
through the coil it's boiling boiling

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.629 
through the coil it's boiling boiling
boiling<00:04:52.320> changing<00:04:52.770> state<00:04:53.009> from<00:04:53.220> liquid<00:04:53.280> to

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
vapor and the coil is designed so that

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.580 
vapor and the coil is designed so that
as<00:04:57.210> we<00:04:57.539> get<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:58.729> near<00:04:59.729> the<00:04:59.759> end<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.270> coil

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
as we get to near the end of the coil

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.529 
as we get to near the end of the coil
all<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.800> refrigerant<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:02.430> boiled<00:05:02.759> off<00:05:02.910> before

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
all the refrigerant is boiled off before

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.460 
all the refrigerant is boiled off before
it<00:05:03.630> leaves<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.740> coil<00:05:05.099> and<00:05:05.360> at<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:07.139> point

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
it leaves the coil and at that point

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.960 
it leaves the coil and at that point
we're<00:05:07.650> starting<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:08.009> pick<00:05:08.160> up<00:05:08.250> super<00:05:08.639> heat<00:05:08.789> and

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
we're starting to pick up super heat and

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.460 
we're starting to pick up super heat and
we<00:05:09.060> drop<00:05:09.360> off<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.930> pressure<00:05:10.139> temperature

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
we drop off the pressure temperature

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.490 
we drop off the pressure temperature
chart<00:05:11.009> that<00:05:11.550> we<00:05:11.669> looked<00:05:11.880> at<00:05:12.030> earlier<00:05:12.449> and<00:05:12.630> now

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
chart that we looked at earlier and now

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.990 
chart that we looked at earlier and now
we<00:05:13.560> have<00:05:14.009> just<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:16.430> refrigerant<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.610> vapor

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
we have just a refrigerant in the vapor

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.320 
we have just a refrigerant in the vapor
State<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.430> so<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.550> can't<00:05:20.759> change<00:05:21.030> state

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
State and so it can't change state

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.540 
State and so it can't change state
anymore<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:21.960> any<00:05:22.169> heat<00:05:22.470> that's<00:05:22.710> added<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.400> this

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
anymore so any heat that's added to this

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.790 
anymore so any heat that's added to this
is<00:05:25.160> called<00:05:26.160> sensible<00:05:26.970> heat<00:05:27.150> and<00:05:27.389> now<00:05:28.110> if<00:05:28.470> you

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
is called sensible heat and now if you

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.620 
is called sensible heat and now if you
put<00:05:29.010> your<00:05:29.099> thermometer<00:05:29.310> down<00:05:29.820> here<00:05:30.150> on<00:05:30.300> the

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
put your thermometer down here on the

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.350 
put your thermometer down here on the

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
that you can measure now 50 degrees
