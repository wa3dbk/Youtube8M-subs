00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.800

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.199

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.460

 guitarist honored artist of Russia 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:32.309
 summer in the country left to be translated into 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:35.640
 cottage stuff trailer great idea but he 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.649
 it is dangerous and why find out with 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.210
 kontravariynoy instructor training 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.030
 good morning Sasha to the truck every year 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.780
 summer residents and lovers of extreme sports 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 sports 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.870
 for the first time in the life of the machine does not cling to the trailer 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.079
 having an idea of ​​how it is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.649
 drove dangerously with a trailer when they are not 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.840
 thunderstorm 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.969
 but in fact it is not difficult need 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.339
 just remember that with your trailer 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.820
 the car is longer still the trailer is prone to 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.250
 drift 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 reluctantly stops and may 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.190
 to harm 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.410
 but already the car and difficult to say 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.500
 You can also park the trailer manually. 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.170
 this trailer starts to carry literally 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 out of the blue and the driver does not have time 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.429
 nothing to fix 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.539
 just 5 seconds and repentant trailer with 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:27.030
 load turns over and up to yourself here 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.520
 this flip why sharply restructured 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.560
 or even just to the braked skid then 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.070
 coping is not difficult but i'm not sure what 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.079
 I can 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.530
 but now and check which one of you 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.810
 summer resident go straight ahead you turn and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.670
 do not damage your car to the finish 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.759
 permitted speed of seven hundred meters an hour 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.189
 I know the least 20 is usually exactly there 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.189
 okay so all okay dreams 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:04.290
 so turn back speed 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.290
 kestrel format break folded in half 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.920
 Well, here you go to the dacha wing in 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.290
 bumper trailer load lost what i did 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.540
 not so well first of all too much 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.400
 pressed his left eye to the left and 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.490
 friend turning a car with a trailer 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.370
 wider so leave in a turn 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.570
 lateral spacing is greater that is if 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.970
 I turn left 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.580
 I go along the arc to the right and vice versa 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.190
 there was also a skid he could tip over 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.660
 yes you performed the most common 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.660
 the error began to slow down 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.560
 in turn and the trailer of such maneuvers is not 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.320
 forgives taking turns with a trailer 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.530
 need at a stable speed without lowering and 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.860
 doesn't boost otherwise he will drag you in 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.750
 side so slowed down and turned a 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.520
 if after all the trailer starts to wind from 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.740
 side to side 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.790
 all you just need to press the gas 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.820
 enter the turn 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.570
 click on with no and no drift and 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.580
 all you do well is that 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.310
 Anything else you advise beginner 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.110
 machinists road train keep your distance 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.270
 many trailers simply do not have brakes 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.430
 so the braking distance is natural 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.830
 longer and much and let's check 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.820
 accelerates to 70 kilometers per hour and 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.630
 about entry 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.630
 start to slow down 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.069
 wow 8 meters difference and remember that 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.500
 on a car with a trailer you need to brake 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:47.140
 smoothly as possible what else for once 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:47.140
 ask so go to the turn immediately 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.870
 applause if your trailer is not 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.939
 hurry with him you are not a racer 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.310
 and the gardener go through the turns of the rules 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:05.560
 take care of your wings and watch home 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.560
