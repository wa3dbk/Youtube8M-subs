for<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> summer<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.490> thought<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:12.000> was<00:00:12.179> as

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
for the summer so I thought this was as

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
with the cast Shannon and James I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.450 
with the cast Shannon and James I
decided<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> screaming<00:00:24.990> head<00:00:25.230> pose<00:00:25.500> now

the<00:00:26.519> way<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.939> did<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.349> waited<00:00:29.010> until

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the way we did this is I waited until

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.150 
the way we did this is I waited until
Shannon<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.210> James<00:00:30.630> had<00:00:30.869> applied<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.590> uniform

the<00:00:40.739> back<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.100> my<00:00:41.280> head<00:00:42.020> but<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.079> waited<00:00:43.320> till<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the back of my head but I waited till a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.360 
the back of my head but I waited till a
it<00:00:43.829> hit<00:00:44.040> complete<00:00:44.940> coverage<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.480> my<00:00:45.660> head<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
it hit complete coverage of my head and

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
it hit complete coverage of my head and
then<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.430> opened<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:48.270> mouth<00:00:48.480> once<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.260> alginate

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
then I opened my mouth once the alginate

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
then I opened my mouth once the alginate
was<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.760> set<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> way<00:00:51.449> I

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
was just about to set and the way I

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.319 
was just about to set and the way I
gauged<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> kept<00:00:53.460> some<00:00:53.640> alginate<00:00:54.149> on

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
gauged this was I kept some alginate on

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.630 
gauged this was I kept some alginate on
my<00:00:54.600> hand<00:00:55.020> from<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.530> original<00:00:55.980> batch<00:00:56.190> there

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
my hand from the original batch there

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.369 
my hand from the original batch there
and<00:00:57.120> when<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> felt<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> start<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> little

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and when I felt it start to get a little

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.639 
and when I felt it start to get a little
gummy<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.820> 880<00:01:00.539> formula<00:01:01.140> does<00:01:01.350> right

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
gummy as the 880 formula does right

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
gummy as the 880 formula does right
before<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> sets<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.420> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.750> gummy

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
before it sets at that kind of gummy

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
before it sets at that kind of gummy
stage<00:01:04.470> that's<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> opened<00:01:05.580> my<00:01:05.700> mouth<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
stage that's when I opened my mouth to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.740 
stage that's when I opened my mouth to
assume<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.990> screaming<00:01:07.710> head<00:01:07.890> pose<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.450> Q

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

eight<00:01:12.060> minute<00:01:12.360> working<00:01:12.720> time<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:14.280> wanted

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
eight minute working time so we wanted

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.190 
eight minute working time so we wanted
to<00:01:14.610> wait<00:01:14.790> till<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> end<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.720> working

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to wait till the end of that working

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.590 
to wait till the end of that working
time<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.740> me<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> pose<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
time for me to do the pose so that I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200

cast process in much greater detail but

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.050 
cast process in much greater detail but
this<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.040> give<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.460> idea<00:01:44.579> how<00:01:44.820> we

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
this will just give you an idea how we

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.499 
this will just give you an idea how we
can<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> screaming<00:01:46.799> head<00:01:47.040> pose<00:01:47.340> by<00:01:48.060> timing

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
can do a screaming head pose by timing

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.109 
can do a screaming head pose by timing
the<00:01:48.720> alginate<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> pose<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the alginate so we we do the pose or a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.240 
the alginate so we we do the pose or a
dynamic<00:01:51.810> expression<00:01:52.170> right<00:01:52.710> before<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
dynamic expression right before the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.880 
dynamic expression right before the
alginate<00:01:53.670> sets<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> good<00:01:55.020> tip<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.649> for

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
alginate sets so a good tip there is for

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
alginate sets so a good tip there is for
your<00:01:56.070> subject<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.299> handful<00:01:57.840> of

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
your subject to have a handful of

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.410 
your subject to have a handful of
alginate<00:01:58.350> where<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> feel<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.820> begin<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
alginate where they can feel it begin to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.030 
alginate where they can feel it begin to
set<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.869> their<00:02:01.020> hands<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.649> when<00:02:01.890> they

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
set in their hands and that's when they

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.359 
set in their hands and that's when they
know<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.549> time<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.969> assume<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.540> expression

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
know it's time to assume the expression

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.960 
know it's time to assume the expression
