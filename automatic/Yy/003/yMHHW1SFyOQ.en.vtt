00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.710
 summer rush 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.250
 heat can iphone shoot the entry 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:28.619

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:31.320
 hi no one let's go cooking hello everyone 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.100
 that's what we cook gazpacho for today 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 cold spanish soup at first we took 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.820
 baguette cut it on toast and stuck 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.230
 in the oven the remaining fighter was ground on 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.360
 little pieces we heated the water and 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.489
 threw in the tomatoes without heart 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.520
 to peel off 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.129
 so further we are using cleaning for 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.890
 vegetables cleaned cucumbers and Bulgarian 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.780
 pepper leave them also by say yes and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.140
 i'm coughing all carbon zinc 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.480
 smooth 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.909
 then we all got rid of this dakar 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.689
 chili pepper and garlic went there too 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.389
 up here it even went shredded 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.420
 ice ice and water now you got 

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:17.399
 brown on and let's punch not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.789
 We will grind this thing to do 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.789
 gazpacho 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.270
 greens take further discretion possible 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.880
 just for the beauty of a couple of twigs and you can 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.680
 that something that is well suited to 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.170
 tomatoes 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.880
 why do you think brown 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:45.920
 guess for while eat the toast under salt 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:50.020
 and now you can add lime juice 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.399
 i will add some olive oil we 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.360
 put some basil or parsley and 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.520
 actually we can stick everything 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:05.940
 warmer and gazpacho 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:08.540
 ready to eat eat 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.540
