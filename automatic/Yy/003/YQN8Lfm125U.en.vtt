00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
and that was pretty much all for the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.830 
and that was pretty much all for the
game<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.670> didn't<00:02:30.150> create<00:02:30.390> anything

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840

talking one wide and that was pretty

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.220 
talking one wide and that was pretty
much<00:02:35.520> all<00:02:35.850> where's<00:02:36.120> my<00:02:36.270> opponent<00:02:36.810> he<00:02:36.990> had<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
us just as the other game and luckily I

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.870 
us just as the other game and luckily I
didn't<00:02:46.230> concede<00:02:46.530> anyone<00:02:46.980> because<00:02:47.640> he<00:02:47.730> could

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
didn't concede anyone because he could

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.460 
didn't concede anyone because he could
easily<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.270> gotten<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> ghola<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> thing

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
he had going against me and that meant I

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.840
