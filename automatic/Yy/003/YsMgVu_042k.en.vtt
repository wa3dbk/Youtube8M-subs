00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.500 
my crochet blog I'm going to crochet a
chain<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.680> with<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.070> filet<00:00:17.369> crochet

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
chain here and with the filet crochet

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.960 
chain here and with the filet crochet
you<00:00:18.510> start<00:00:18.840> off<00:00:19.020> with<00:00:19.320> seven<00:00:21.320> five<00:00:22.320> six<00:00:23.070> seven

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
you start off with seven five six seven

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.290 
you start off with seven five six seven
and<00:00:24.119> that's<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.779> your<00:00:25.109> first<00:00:26.300> square

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and that's going to be your first square

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.450 
and that's going to be your first square
there<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.140> then<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.380> would<00:00:28.500> move<00:00:28.800> over<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
there and then you would move over and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.640 
there and then you would move over and
then<00:00:29.580> make<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:29.910> double<00:00:30.240> crochet<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.019> then

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
then make your double crochet and then

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:42.390 
then make your double crochet and then
you<00:00:32.369> continue<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.300> increments<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.200> three

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.180 

I'm<00:00:43.090> not<00:00:43.300> going<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:43.600> make<00:00:43.780> this<00:00:44.050> real<00:00:44.710> big

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
I'm not going to make this real big

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.620 
I'm not going to make this real big
because<00:00:45.820> it's<00:00:46.600> kind<00:00:46.990> of<00:00:47.110> like<00:00:47.340> coloring

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
because it's kind of like coloring

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.330 
because it's kind of like coloring
that's<00:00:49.630> what<00:00:49.870> filet<00:00:50.200> crochet<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.920> because

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
that's what filet crochet is because

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.180 
that's what filet crochet is because
you're<00:00:51.520> just<00:00:51.760> simply<00:00:52.180> filling<00:00:52.630> in<00:00:52.870> blocks<00:00:53.320> so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
you're just simply filling in blocks so

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.950 
you're just simply filling in blocks so
I'm<00:00:54.310> going<00:00:54.550> to<00:00:54.640> move<00:00:55.000> over<00:00:55.180> here<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:55.780> count

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
I'm going to move over here and count

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.980 
I'm going to move over here and count
one<00:00:56.260> two<00:00:56.500> three<00:00:56.700> four<00:00:57.700> five<00:00:58.150> six<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.900> the
