00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
optical image stabilization which is

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.210 
optical image stabilization which is

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
sweet both have memory stick and SD card

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.910 
sweet both have memory stick and SD card
support<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.170> can<00:01:36.290> use<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.500> media<00:01:36.619> you

support so you can use the media you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.920 
support so you can use the media you
already<00:01:37.220> own<00:01:37.340> got<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:37.760> two<00:01:38.390> main<00:01:38.570> differences

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
already own got it two main differences

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.800 
already own got it two main differences
between<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.650> DVD<00:01:40.040> 3<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.580> DV<00:01:40.939> 5<00:01:41.240> alright

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
between the DVD 3 and the DV 5 alright

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.780 
between the DVD 3 and the DV 5 alright
so<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.020> get<00:01:42.140> up<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.380> 10<00:01:42.740> times<00:01:43.040> optical<00:01:43.760> zoom

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
so you get up to a 10 times optical zoom

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.660 
so you get up to a 10 times optical zoom
on<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.210> DVD<00:01:44.659> 3<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.229> up<00:01:45.290> to<00:01:45.409> 20<00:01:45.860> times<00:01:46.040> digital

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
on the DVD 3 and up to 20 times digital

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.539 
on the DVD 3 and up to 20 times digital
zoom<00:01:46.909> on<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.570> DV<00:01:47.930> 5<00:01:48.200> then<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.500> DV<00:01:48.650> 5<00:01:48.979> also<00:01:49.280> is

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
zoom on the DV 5 then the DV 5 also is
