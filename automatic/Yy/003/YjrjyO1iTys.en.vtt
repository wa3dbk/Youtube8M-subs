00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.810
 yo everyone knows facson use 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.739
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:42.790
 boxing of man and burn 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.210
 so here I finally got it close 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.210
 three weeks 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:57.250
 the byrne ps3 controller so I'm going to 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:01:03.270
 to hit the road in clips 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:07.330
 I would have slipped it up like this 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.350
 a duplicate tube of course go vat 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.759
 did not happen like that she was 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.300
 much more packaged but I checked 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:18.990
 before that's the market so here's a 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:21.640
 little box all this very simple dÃ©boite 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.160
 the paper of the bill and a 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.680
 guarantee and cold baubles that you 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.750
 allow you to adjust your controller 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:36.970
 so here is happy very simple this is the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.990
 same as the other the other I had 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.290
 tried to do it myself with 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.070
 someone you will buy a pallet kit 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.650
 of someone to do it herself and 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.450
 medium terms had heaps fair are you 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.920
 really well and frozen caught them 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.920
 xxl joysticks and paddles 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.480
 here we are so I paid 95 euros 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.430
 it's not really the same as what 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.530
 I would not have done it like that myself 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.460
 took it like that so bout after I 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.720
 am from right is frankly I 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.290
 was expecting a lot of simple we do not 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.580
 beyond the grip and the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.200
 success to do because success in 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.760
 use all succeed all my shoots 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.060
 live but no no not even so that's it 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.320
 I find it very nice 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.750
 days ago I was soon made there is no 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.450
 great difference was made in 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.760
 the same a little label the Haitian 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:50.410
 byrne you see you see not be the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:51.790
 lec barely separate so let's say 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.640
 this is a briefcase warranted 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.170
 byrne and all that so there is more 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.360
 so here we are for a small 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.910

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.680

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.370
