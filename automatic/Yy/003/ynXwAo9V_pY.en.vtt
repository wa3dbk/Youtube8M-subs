00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
tell us how significant a discovery is

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.420 
tell us how significant a discovery is
this<00:00:32.960> well<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.140> has<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> potential<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.309> very

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
this well it has a potential to be very

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.060 
this well it has a potential to be very
significant<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:37.110> right<00:00:37.230> now<00:00:37.290> until<00:00:37.800> we

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
significant but for right now until we

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.060 
significant but for right now until we
do<00:00:38.219> further<00:00:38.489> analyses<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.920> can

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
do further analyses I think all we can

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.940 
do further analyses I think all we can
say<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.820> cool<00:00:42.649> well<00:00:43.649> professor

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
say is it's really cool well professor

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.830 
say is it's really cool well professor
as<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.579> understand<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.450> was<00:00:45.629> sort<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
as I understand it this this was sort of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.200 
as I understand it this this was sort of
an<00:00:45.960> accidental<00:00:46.440> discovery<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.190> had<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> split

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
an accidental discovery you had to split

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.610 
an accidental discovery you had to split
one<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> bones<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.020> half<00:00:49.200> because<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> was

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
one of the bones in half because it was

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.200 
one of the bones in half because it was
simply<00:00:49.860> too<00:00:50.100> big<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.579> into<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> helicopter

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
simply too big to get into a helicopter

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
simply too big to get into a helicopter
and<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:52.289> splitting<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> bone<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.309> suddenly

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and in splitting the bone you suddenly

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.189 
and in splitting the bone you suddenly
realized<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> had<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> soft<00:00:54.690> tissue<00:00:54.809> on

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
realized you had this soft tissue on

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.170 
realized you had this soft tissue on
your<00:00:55.350> hands<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.890> correct<00:00:56.160> well<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
your hands is that correct well it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.170 
your hands is that correct well it
wasn't<00:00:57.329> quite<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:58.050> sudden<00:00:58.500> he<00:00:58.920> they<00:00:59.879> had<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
wasn't quite that sudden he they had to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.849 
wasn't quite that sudden he they had to
split<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> bone<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.020> field<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.620> was

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
split the bone in the field as was

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.160 
split the bone in the field as was
reported<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> got<00:01:03.359> back<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> lab

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
reported and when it got back to the lab

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.520 
reported and when it got back to the lab
and<00:01:04.700> carry<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.060> began<00:01:06.330> preparing<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.170> she

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and carry on so began preparing it she

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.830 
and carry on so began preparing it she
reserved<00:01:07.950> some<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> fragments<00:01:09.210> for

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
reserved some of the fragments for

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.020 
reserved some of the fragments for
chemical<00:01:10.560> analyses<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.670> treated

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
chemical analyses and so it was treated

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
chemical analyses and so it was treated
slightly<00:01:12.240> different<00:01:12.810> than<00:01:13.110> most<00:01:13.619> dinosaur

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
slightly different than most dinosaur

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
slightly different than most dinosaur
bone<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> field<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.960> amazing<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
bone is in the field it's not amazing to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.140 
bone is in the field it's not amazing to
find<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:16.979> kind<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.310> soft<00:01:17.549> tissue<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
find this kind of soft tissue in a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.850 
find this kind of soft tissue in a
fossil<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.810> old<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> soft

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
fossil this old and what can the soft

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.940 
fossil this old and what can the soft
tissue<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.490> tell<00:01:20.700> us<00:01:20.850> well<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> it's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
tissue really tell us well it is it's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.100 
tissue really tell us well it is it's
very<00:01:23.250> amazing<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:24.030> utterly<00:01:24.689> shocking

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
very amazing it's utterly shocking

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.990 
very amazing it's utterly shocking
actually<00:01:25.770> because<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.250> flies<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> face<00:01:26.820> of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
actually because it flies in the face of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.880 
actually because it flies in the face of
everything<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.869> understand<00:01:28.439> about<00:01:28.619> how

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
everything that we understand about how

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.460 
everything that we understand about how
tissues<00:01:29.340> themselves<00:01:29.490> degrade<00:01:30.290> it's<00:01:31.290> not

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
tissues themselves degrade it's not

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.840 
tissues themselves degrade it's not
something<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> any<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.340> us<00:01:32.520> could<00:01:32.820> ever

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
something that any one of us could ever

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.069 
something that any one of us could ever
predict<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:33.479> hope<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.900> that

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
predict or hope for and I think that

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.740 
predict or hope for and I think that
it's<00:01:37.229> important<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> remember<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.750> we

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
it's important to remember that we we

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's important to remember that we we
don't<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.350> sure<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> still<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.430> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
don't know for sure what it still is it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.090 
don't know for sure what it still is it
looks<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.360> blood<00:01:42.990> vessels<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.829> looks

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
looks like blood vessels and it looks

a<00:01:54.780> word<00:01:55.290> comes<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> us<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.969> capillary

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
structure or something that you've

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.709 
structure or something that you've

but<00:02:30.950> for<00:02:31.130> right<00:02:31.250> now<00:02:31.310> that's<00:02:31.730> not<00:02:31.820> something

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
but for right now that's not something

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.270 
but for right now that's not something
that<00:02:32.450> we<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.690> address<00:02:32.930> how<00:02:33.320> big<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> t-rex<00:02:34.040> are

sue that's on display in Chicago it's it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
was significantly smaller but it was

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.050 
was significantly smaller but it was
also<00:02:45.200> significantly<00:02:45.860> older<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.610> if<00:02:46.880> I'm

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
also significantly older and if I'm

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.030 
also significantly older and if I'm
remembering<00:02:47.330> what<00:02:47.870> jack<00:02:48.080> told<00:02:48.110> me<00:02:48.440> correctly

remembering what jack told me correctly

remembering what jack told me correctly
it<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.610> first<00:02:49.850> appearance<00:02:50.270> of

it is the first appearance of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.690 
it is the first appearance of
Tyrannosaurus<00:02:51.110> Rex<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:52.040> therefore<00:02:52.580> it's

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
Tyrannosaurus Rex is so therefore it's

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.790 
Tyrannosaurus Rex is so therefore it's
the<00:02:52.780> geologically<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.080> oldest<00:02:54.440> t-rex

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
the geologically it's the oldest t-rex

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
that would be my guess now it's

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
getting the DNA from the dinosaur is

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.110 
getting the DNA from the dinosaur is
actually<00:03:19.430> probably<00:03:19.730> going<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.910> be<00:03:20.000> the

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
actually probably going to be the

actually probably going to be the
easiest<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.810> that's<00:03:20.959> not<00:03:21.110> something<00:03:21.500> we're

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
easiest and that's not something we're

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.610 
easiest and that's not something we're
anywhere<00:03:21.830> close<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.370> doing<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:23.660> once<00:03:24.260> once<00:03:24.530> you

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
anywhere close to doing so once once you

anywhere close to doing so once once you
get<00:03:24.770> the<00:03:24.890> DNA<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.580> will<00:03:25.760> be<00:03:25.970> fragmented<00:03:26.660> and

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
get the DNA it will be fragmented and

get the DNA it will be fragmented and
chewed<00:03:27.590> up<00:03:27.740> into<00:03:28.010> little<00:03:28.100> tiny<00:03:28.250> pieces<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.240> so

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
chewed up into little tiny pieces and so

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.180 
chewed up into little tiny pieces and so
you'd<00:03:30.020> have<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.260> figure<00:03:30.380> out<00:03:30.560> how<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:30.890> put<00:03:31.160> all

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
you'd have to figure out how to put all

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.949 
you'd have to figure out how to put all
those<00:03:31.430> pieces<00:03:31.670> together<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.540> then<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.810> have

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
those pieces together and then you have

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.750 
those pieces together and then you have
to<00:03:33.080> figure<00:03:33.350> out<00:03:33.500> exactly<00:03:33.680> what<00:03:34.250> order<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:34.610> put

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
to figure out exactly what order to put

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.850 
to figure out exactly what order to put
them<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.270> then<00:03:35.930> you'd<00:03:36.110> have<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.410> figure<00:03:36.709> out

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
them in then you'd have to figure out

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.740 
them in then you'd have to figure out
how<00:03:37.070> many<00:03:37.130> chromosomes<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.030> dinosaur<00:03:38.540> had

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
how many chromosomes that dinosaur had

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.360 
how many chromosomes that dinosaur had
and<00:03:39.020> make<00:03:39.140> sure<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.470> all<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.890> genes<00:03:40.130> are

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
and make sure that all of the genes are

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.860 
and make sure that all of the genes are
arranged<00:03:40.760> correctly<00:03:40.880> on<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.300> chromosomes

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
arranged correctly on the chromosomes

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.120 
arranged correctly on the chromosomes
and<00:03:42.020> that's<00:03:42.230> just<00:03:42.500> for<00:03:42.650> starters

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
and that's just for starters

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.340 
and that's just for starters
well<00:03:43.700> you've<00:03:43.820> anticipated<00:03:44.540> my<00:03:44.660> next<00:03:44.690> question

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
well you've anticipated my next question

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.800 
well you've anticipated my next question
and<00:03:45.470> let's<00:03:46.160> assume<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:46.940> can<00:03:47.150> do<00:03:47.390> all<00:03:47.630> of

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
and let's assume that you can do all of

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.449 
and let's assume that you can do all of
that<00:03:47.989> sort<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.320> thing<00:03:48.470> what<00:03:48.680> might<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.160> learn

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
that sort of thing what might you learn

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.110 
that sort of thing what might you learn
from<00:03:49.850> dinosaur<00:03:50.540> DNA<00:03:51.310> well<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.520> know<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.670> think

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
from dinosaur DNA well you know I think

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.970 
from dinosaur DNA well you know I think
it's<00:03:53.300> it's<00:03:53.570> really<00:03:53.989> exciting<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.650> learn

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
it's it's really exciting to learn

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.340 
it's it's really exciting to learn
things<00:03:55.370> like<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:56.600> guys<00:03:56.720> have<00:03:56.930> probably<00:03:57.200> heard

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
things like you guys have probably heard

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.620 
things like you guys have probably heard
of<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.590> idea<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:58.100> molecular<00:03:58.280> clocks<00:03:58.970> which<00:03:59.450> is

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
of the idea of molecular clocks which is

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.470 
of the idea of molecular clocks which is
a<00:03:59.660> way<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.290> taking<00:04:00.860> particular<00:04:01.520> fragments<00:04:02.360> of

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
a way of taking particular fragments of

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.660 
a way of taking particular fragments of
DNA<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.080> comparing<00:04:03.620> them<00:04:03.739> across<00:04:03.980> taxa<00:04:04.580> to

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
DNA and comparing them across taxa to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.510 
DNA and comparing them across taxa to
get<00:04:04.820> an<00:04:04.940> idea<00:04:05.300> of<00:04:05.540> how<00:04:05.720> quickly<00:04:06.340> DNA<00:04:07.340> might

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
get an idea of how quickly DNA might

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.940 
get an idea of how quickly DNA might
mutate<00:04:07.670> or<00:04:08.060> change<00:04:08.230> now<00:04:09.230> we<00:04:09.650> have<00:04:09.830> the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
mutate or change now we have the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.680 
mutate or change now we have the
opportunity<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.730> do<00:04:10.880> that<00:04:11.060> with<00:04:11.420> something

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
opportunity to do that with something

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.030 
opportunity to do that with something
that's<00:04:11.870> actually<00:04:12.260> anchored<00:04:12.440> in<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.830> fossil

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
that's actually anchored in the fossil

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.040 
that's actually anchored in the fossil
record<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:13.760> that's<00:04:13.940> one<00:04:14.209> potential<00:04:14.630> really

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
record so that's one potential really

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.630 
record so that's one potential really
exciting<00:04:15.680> thing<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:15.980> might<00:04:16.130> come<00:04:16.340> of<00:04:16.459> this

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
exciting thing that might come of this

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.550 
exciting thing that might come of this
and<00:04:16.880> one<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.930> exciting<00:04:18.020> things<00:04:18.320> about

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
and one of the exciting things about

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.900 
and one of the exciting things about
this<00:04:18.799> discovery<00:04:19.160> correct<00:04:19.549> me<00:04:19.669> if<00:04:19.760> I'm<00:04:19.880> wrong

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
this discovery correct me if I'm wrong

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.909 
this discovery correct me if I'm wrong
is<00:04:20.270> the<00:04:20.720> fact<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:21.169> this<00:04:21.350> stuff<00:04:21.590> was

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
is the fact that this stuff was

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.670 
is the fact that this stuff was
fossilized<00:04:22.700> as<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.120> was<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.600> 70<00:04:24.110> million<00:04:24.320> years

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
fossilized as it was of 70 million years

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.310 
fossilized as it was of 70 million years
old<00:04:24.950> you<00:04:25.430> don't<00:04:25.580> expect<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:26.000> find<00:04:26.090> soft<00:04:26.570> tissue

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
old you don't expect to find soft tissue

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.160 
old you don't expect to find soft tissue
not<00:04:27.860> at<00:04:28.010> all<00:04:28.100> no<00:04:28.790> it's<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.690> without<00:04:29.930> really

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
not at all no it's it without really

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.080 
not at all no it's it without really
shocking<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:31.070> yet<00:04:31.280> they're<00:04:31.430> sort<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.640> rewrite

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
shocking so yet they're sort of rewrite

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.120 
shocking so yet they're sort of rewrite
the<00:04:32.240> book<00:04:32.420> as<00:04:32.570> far<00:04:32.600> as<00:04:32.870> fossilization<00:04:33.500> goes<00:04:33.890> I

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
the book as far as fossilization goes I

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.790 
the book as far as fossilization goes I
assume<00:04:34.790> well<00:04:35.330> that's<00:04:35.720> that's<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.410> exciting

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
assume well that's that's the exciting

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.620 
assume well that's that's the exciting
part<00:04:37.160> for<00:04:37.250> me<00:04:37.490> I've<00:04:37.850> always<00:04:38.000> been<00:04:38.360> very

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
part for me I've always been very

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.560 
part for me I've always been very
intrigued<00:04:38.990> by<00:04:39.230> how<00:04:39.530> how<00:04:40.430> things<00:04:40.850> changed<00:04:41.390> and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
intrigued by how how things changed and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.600 
intrigued by how how things changed and
going<00:04:41.810> from<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:42.080> living<00:04:42.440> being<00:04:42.710> to<00:04:43.040> part<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:43.550> the

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
going from a living being to part of the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.780 
going from a living being to part of the
rock<00:04:43.790> record<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.980> like<00:04:45.980> I<00:04:46.100> said<00:04:46.160> a<00:04:46.370> lot<00:04:46.580> of<00:04:46.610> our

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
rock record and like I said a lot of our

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.450 
rock record and like I said a lot of our
science<00:04:47.390> doesn't<00:04:47.720> allow<00:04:48.170> for<00:04:48.560> this<00:04:48.770> all<00:04:49.130> of

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
science doesn't allow for this all of

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.740 
science doesn't allow for this all of
the<00:04:49.550> chemistry<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.150> all<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.600> molecular

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
the chemistry and all of the molecular

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.780 
the chemistry and all of the molecular
breakdown<00:04:51.310> experiments<00:04:52.310> that<00:04:52.430> we've<00:04:52.580> done

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
breakdown experiments that we've done

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.820 
breakdown experiments that we've done
don't<00:04:53.150> allow<00:04:53.390> for<00:04:53.600> this<00:04:53.750> so<00:04:53.960> if<00:04:54.140> this<00:04:54.590> material

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
don't allow for this so if this material

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.010 
don't allow for this so if this material
turns<00:04:55.370> out<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.700> be<00:04:55.730> actual<00:04:56.240> remnants<00:04:56.690> of<00:04:56.840> the

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
turns out to be actual remnants of the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.260 
turns out to be actual remnants of the
dinosaur<00:04:57.530> then<00:04:58.280> yes<00:04:58.580> I<00:04:58.790> think<00:04:58.850> we<00:04:59.060> will<00:04:59.210> have

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
dinosaur then yes I think we will have

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.780 
dinosaur then yes I think we will have
to<00:04:59.540> do<00:04:59.660> some<00:04:59.990> certainly<00:05:00.950> rethinking<00:05:01.490> of<00:05:01.610> some

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
to do some certainly rethinking of some

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.160 
to do some certainly rethinking of some
of<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:01.940> basics<00:05:02.360> of<00:05:02.540> the<00:05:02.720> model<00:05:03.080> of

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
of the basics of the model of

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.740 
of the basics of the model of
fossilization<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:04.790> know<00:05:04.880> Mary<00:05:05.120> Mary<00:05:05.540> when<00:05:05.720> I

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
fossilization you know Mary Mary when I

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.420 
fossilization you know Mary Mary when I
was<00:05:05.930> reading<00:05:06.200> about<00:05:06.530> this<00:05:06.710> story<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.130> was

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
was reading about this story I was

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.070 
was reading about this story I was
amazed<00:05:07.730> that<00:05:07.880> in<00:05:08.120> some<00:05:08.360> of<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.510> capillaries

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
amazed that in some of the capillaries

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.810 
amazed that in some of the capillaries
when<00:05:09.290> you<00:05:09.380> went<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:10.220> pull<00:05:10.490> them<00:05:10.700> they

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
when you went to to pull them they

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.700 
when you went to to pull them they
snapped<00:05:11.150> right<00:05:11.450> back<00:05:11.660> are<00:05:12.020> you<00:05:12.140> amazed<00:05:12.470> at<00:05:12.620> the

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
snapped right back are you amazed at the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.710 
snapped right back are you amazed at the
quality<00:05:12.860> of<00:05:13.250> these<00:05:13.430> remains<00:05:13.790> absolutely

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
quality of these remains absolutely

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.680 
quality of these remains absolutely
seven<00:05:15.380> million<00:05:15.650> years<00:05:15.800> old<00:05:16.190> huh<00:05:16.430> it's<00:05:16.940> it<00:05:17.330> just

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
seven million years old huh it's it just

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.750 
seven million years old huh it's it just
doesn't<00:05:18.290> seem<00:05:18.500> possible<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:19.190> yes<00:05:19.520> you<00:05:19.730> can

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
doesn't seem possible but yes you can

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.700 
doesn't seem possible but yes you can
actually<00:05:20.090> take<00:05:20.510> the<00:05:20.660> vessels<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.320> they<00:05:21.440> do

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
actually take the vessels and they do

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.430 
actually take the vessels and they do
have<00:05:22.120> internal<00:05:23.120> components<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.050> so<00:05:24.170> you<00:05:24.230> can

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
have internal components and so you can

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.110 
have internal components and so you can
take<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.620> probe<00:05:24.980> and<00:05:25.220> kind<00:05:25.460> of<00:05:25.550> squeeze<00:05:25.880> those

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
take a probe and kind of squeeze those

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.360 
take a probe and kind of squeeze those
things<00:05:26.420> out<00:05:26.630> into<00:05:26.840> solution<00:05:27.560> and<00:05:28.010> of<00:05:28.190> the

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
things out into solution and of the

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.580 
things out into solution and of the
vessels<00:05:28.730> are<00:05:28.850> fine<00:05:29.060> it's<00:05:29.450> just<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.990> can't

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
vessels are fine it's just I can't

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.530 
vessels are fine it's just I can't
explain<00:05:30.950> it<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.430> be<00:05:31.550> honest<00:05:31.940> I'm<00:05:32.060> very<00:05:32.090> cool

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540
