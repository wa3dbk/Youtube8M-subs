really really original as well I'm sure
you<00:01:30.329> guys<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.630> guess<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.079> does<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
you guys can guess what it does but it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.310 
you guys can guess what it does but it
explodes<00:01:32.400> inda<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> those<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:33.960> everywhere

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
explodes inda and those go everywhere

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.160 
explodes inda and those go everywhere
now<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:35.150> conveniently<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.600> anvils<00:01:37.020> do

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
now very very conveniently the anvils do

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.480 
now very very conveniently the anvils do
not<00:01:37.320> land<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> ground<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:38.340> don't

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
not land on the ground so they don't

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
not land on the ground so they don't
really<00:01:38.610> lagg<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.299> world<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.409> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
really lagg up your world or kind of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.260 
really lagg up your world or kind of
fill<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.920> ton<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> space<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.210> don't

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
fill up a ton of space and I don't

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
fill up a ton of space and I don't
really<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.659> where<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:43.049> go<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:44.100> they

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
really know where they go I think they

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149 
really know where they go I think they
kind<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.090> into<00:01:45.680> into<00:01:46.680> nowhere<00:01:47.070> they

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
kind of just go into into nowhere they

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.469 
kind of just go into into nowhere they
just<00:01:47.310> kind<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.610> fall<00:01:47.820> through<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> world<00:01:48.329> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
just kind of fall through the world and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.999 
just kind of fall through the world and
that's<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> end<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.960> them<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.649> don't

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that's the end of them so you don't

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.080 
that's the end of them so you don't
really<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.399> worry<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.729> them<00:01:50.939> they're

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
really have to worry about them they're

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.429 
really have to worry about them they're
really<00:01:51.210> just<00:01:51.420> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> funny<00:01:51.960> enough<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
really just kind of funny enough but I

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.889 
really just kind of funny enough but I
think<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.579> remember<00:01:54.360> correctly

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
think they do if I do remember correctly

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.020 
think they do if I do remember correctly
as<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.200> kill<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.799> every<00:01:56.100> freaking<00:01:56.579> mob<00:01:56.790> in

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
as they kill like every freaking mob in

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.609 
as they kill like every freaking mob in
their<00:01:57.149> path<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.840> let's<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.229> ahead<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.409> try

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
their path so let's go ahead and try

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.170 
their path so let's go ahead and try
this<00:01:58.680> one<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:59.009> time<00:01:59.070> I'm<00:01:59.759> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> put<00:02:00.060> down

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
this one more time I'm going to put down

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.429 
this one more time I'm going to put down
a<00:02:00.240> lot<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.509> piggies<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.170> we're<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
a lot of piggies here and we're going to

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.109 
a lot of piggies here and we're going to
see<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.680> these<00:02:01.770> anvils<00:02:02.280> crush<00:02:02.700> them<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:02.969> their

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
see if these anvils crush them on their

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.190 
see if these anvils crush them on their
way<00:02:03.240> down<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.810> should<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.020> really

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
way down so this should be really

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
way down so this should be really
interested<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:04.920> funny<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.850> without

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
interested in really funny so without

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570 
interested in really funny so without
further<00:02:06.299> ado<00:02:06.719> let's<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.890> kind<00:02:08.520> of

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
further ado let's see if this kind of

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.940 
further ado let's see if this kind of
works<00:02:08.759> out<00:02:08.910> how<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.479> will<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.950> okay

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
works out how I think it will and okay

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.500 
works out how I think it will and okay
please<00:02:11.250> no<00:02:11.370> no<00:02:11.580> please<00:02:11.819> don't<00:02:12.060> fall<00:02:12.209> down<00:02:12.330> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
please no no please don't fall down that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.280 
please no no please don't fall down that
hole<00:02:12.660> okay<00:02:13.140> here<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:13.379> go

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
hole okay here we go

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.679 
hole okay here we go
yeah<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.430> kills<00:02:15.610> every<00:02:15.939> mob<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.299> its<00:02:16.420> path

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
yeah so it kills every mob in its path

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.660 
yeah so it kills every mob in its path
which<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:16.989> really<00:02:17.319> funny<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:17.860> if<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.459> guys<00:02:18.579> are

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
which is really funny so if you guys are

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.360 
which is really funny so if you guys are
getting<00:02:18.819> chased<00:02:19.150> by<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.659> a<00:02:19.689> big<00:02:20.220> group<00:02:21.220> of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
getting chased by like a big group of

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.619 
getting chased by like a big group of
like<00:02:21.489> zombies<00:02:21.909> or<00:02:22.030> something<00:02:22.299> you<00:02:22.360> can<00:02:22.450> put

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
like zombies or something you can put

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.910 
like zombies or something you can put
down<00:02:22.750> really<00:02:22.989> fast<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.409> just<00:02:23.500> keep<00:02:23.709> running

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
down really fast and just keep running

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.559 
down really fast and just keep running

you so that's really cool next what we
got<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.180> chemical<00:02:28.720> explosive<00:02:29.560> that's

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
got is the chemical explosive that's

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.220 
got is the chemical explosive that's
coming<00:02:30.069> in<00:02:30.189> at<00:02:30.280> number<00:02:30.340> four<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.049> I'm<00:02:32.049> gonna

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
coming in at number four and I'm gonna

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.869 
coming in at number four and I'm gonna
stand<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:32.799> here<00:02:32.860> because<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.459> really<00:02:33.670> does

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
chemicalized I guess but the particle

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.619 
chemicalized I guess but the particle
effects<00:02:39.400> are<00:02:39.549> completely<00:02:40.030> awesome<00:02:40.239> as<00:02:40.510> you

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
effects are completely awesome as you

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.410 
effects are completely awesome as you
guys<00:02:40.750> know<00:02:40.989> I<00:02:41.019> love<00:02:41.260> my<00:02:41.440> particles<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.420> that's

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
guys know I love my particles and that's

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.089 
guys know I love my particles and that's
kind<00:02:43.629> of<00:02:43.659> why<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.810> chose<00:02:44.079> that<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.709> do<00:02:44.890> get

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
kind of why I chose that but you do get

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.830 
kind of why I chose that but you do get
the<00:02:45.159> effect<00:02:45.549> if<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.760> particles<00:02:46.299> do<00:02:46.480> happen<00:02:46.810> to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
the effect if the particles do happen to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.750 
the effect if the particles do happen to
hit<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.200> I'm<00:02:47.859> not<00:02:47.980> getting<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.340> effect<00:02:48.579> right

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
hit you I'm not getting the effect right

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.860 
hit you I'm not getting the effect right
now<00:02:48.879> because<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.060> don't<00:02:49.209> want<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.390> get<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.599> makes

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
now because I don't want to get it makes

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.170 
now because I don't want to get it makes
you<00:02:49.959> like<00:02:50.109> all<00:02:50.260> dizzy<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.739> stuff<00:02:51.099> but<00:02:51.340> you're

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
you like all dizzy and stuff but you're

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.550 
you like all dizzy and stuff but you're
going<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.359> get<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> lot<00:02:52.629> of<00:02:52.750> effects<00:02:53.109> that<00:02:53.349> makes

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
going to get a lot of effects that makes

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.069 
going to get a lot of effects that makes
it<00:02:53.709> kind<00:02:53.829> of<00:02:53.950> hard<00:02:54.099> to<00:02:54.190> walk<00:02:54.400> around<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:55.079> it

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
it kind of hard to walk around and it

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.690 
it kind of hard to walk around and it
does<00:02:56.379> pretty<00:02:56.620> much<00:02:56.709> kill<00:02:56.980> every<00:02:57.220> mob<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.579> its

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
does pretty much kill every mob in its

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.460 
does pretty much kill every mob in its
path<00:02:58.000> as<00:02:58.239> well<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.019> that's<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.319> chemical

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
path as well so that's the chemical

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.009 
path as well so that's the chemical
explosive<00:03:00.280> already<00:03:01.150> coming<00:03:01.450> in<00:03:01.629> at<00:03:01.780> number

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
explosive already coming in at number

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.449 
explosive already coming in at number
three<00:03:02.200> we've<00:03:02.349> got<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.650> antimatter

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
three we've got the antimatter

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.069 
three we've got the antimatter
explosives<00:03:04.209> now<00:03:04.329> this<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.599> probably<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:04.959> do

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
explosives now this is probably to do

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.390 
explosives now this is probably to do
some<00:03:05.260> damage<00:03:05.590> here<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:05.859> we're<00:03:06.010> going<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.190> make

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
some damage here so we're going to make

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.479 
some damage here so we're going to make
our<00:03:06.519> way<00:03:06.670> back<00:03:07.260> because<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.530> pry<00:03:08.859> will<00:03:09.129> destroy

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
our way back because it pry will destroy

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.339 
our way back because it pry will destroy
a<00:03:09.519> bunch<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.849> our<00:03:09.970> land<00:03:10.209> right<00:03:10.389> here<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:11.200> here

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
a bunch of our land right here so here

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.349 
a bunch of our land right here so here
we<00:03:11.440> go<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.920> counter<00:03:12.549> is<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.639> little<00:03:12.970> bit<00:03:13.090> longer

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
we go the counter is a little bit longer

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.819 
we go the counter is a little bit longer
than<00:03:13.599> most<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.989> other<00:03:14.170> bombs<00:03:14.409> because<00:03:14.709> it

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
than most of the other bombs because it

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.360 
than most of the other bombs because it
does<00:03:15.010> kind<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.340> do<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:15.519> big<00:03:16.680> explosion<00:03:17.680> if<00:03:18.280> you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
does kind of do a big explosion if you

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.280 
does kind of do a big explosion if you
want<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.609> call<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.879> that<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.569> here<00:03:19.750> we<00:03:19.840> go<00:03:20.049> and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
want to call it that so here we go and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.110 
want to call it that so here we go and
it<00:03:20.650> does<00:03:20.799> take<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.010> couple<00:03:21.310> seconds<00:03:21.669> to<00:03:21.819> load<00:03:22.030> it

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
it does take a couple seconds to load it

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.110 
it does take a couple seconds to load it
up<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.620> there<00:03:23.620> we<00:03:23.829> go<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.069> pretty<00:03:24.609> darn<00:03:24.879> big

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
up and there we go a pretty darn big

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.770 
up and there we go a pretty darn big
hole<00:03:25.389> and<00:03:26.699> yeah<00:03:27.699> it's<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.090> pretty<00:03:28.269> big<00:03:28.389> critter

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
hole and yeah it's a pretty big critter

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.420 
hole and yeah it's a pretty big critter
you<00:03:28.930> got<00:03:29.109> right<00:03:29.290> there<00:03:29.319> so<00:03:29.799> if<00:03:29.889> you<00:03:29.980> guys<00:03:30.099> want

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
you got right there so if you guys want

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.740 
you got right there so if you guys want
to<00:03:30.489> kind<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:30.760> blow<00:03:30.970> up<00:03:31.120> someone's<00:03:31.419> house<00:03:31.599> now

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
to kind of blow up someone's house now

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.270 
to kind of blow up someone's house now
this<00:03:31.870> would<00:03:31.989> be<00:03:32.079> really<00:03:32.319> funny<00:03:32.530> if<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:33.129> guys

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
this would be really funny if you guys

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.740 
this would be really funny if you guys
installed<00:03:33.730> this<00:03:33.940> on<00:03:34.150> one<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.359> your<00:03:34.480> friends

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
installed this on one of your friends

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.629 
installed this on one of your friends
computers<00:03:35.199> and<00:03:35.410> just<00:03:35.440> placed<00:03:36.099> it<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:36.430> right

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
computers and just placed it like right

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.119 
computers and just placed it like right
in<00:03:36.790> his<00:03:36.910> house<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:38.470> know<00:03:38.560> did<00:03:38.799> this<00:03:38.949> he

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
in his house and you know did this he

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.619 
in his house and you know did this he
comes<00:03:39.250> back<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.819> computer<00:03:40.150> wherever<00:03:40.569> he

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
comes back to the computer wherever he

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.449 
comes back to the computer wherever he
was<00:03:40.810> after<00:03:41.169> you<00:03:41.260> guys<00:03:41.349> installed<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:41.949> and<00:03:42.099> he

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
was after you guys installed it and he

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.189 
was after you guys installed it and he
sees<00:03:42.669> this<00:03:42.849> where<00:03:43.120> his<00:03:43.239> house<00:03:43.389> was<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.720> that

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
sees this where his house was that that

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.930 
sees this where his house was that that
would<00:03:44.319> be<00:03:44.410> pretty<00:03:44.530> funny<00:03:44.889> and<00:03:45.099> um<00:03:45.609> if<00:03:45.849> you

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
would be pretty funny and um if you

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.369 
would be pretty funny and um if you
recorded<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.389> and<00:03:46.629> put<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.900> on<00:03:46.989> YouTube<00:03:47.260> I'm

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
recorded that and put it on YouTube I'm

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.189 
recorded that and put it on YouTube I'm
sure<00:03:47.590> do<00:03:47.919> pretty<00:03:48.160> well<00:03:48.250> but<00:03:48.870> yeah<00:03:49.870> that's

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
sure do pretty well but yeah that's

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.849 
sure do pretty well but yeah that's
pretty<00:03:50.470> funny<00:03:50.769> next<00:03:51.699> what<00:03:51.790> we<00:03:51.879> got<00:03:52.030> is<00:03:52.239> the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
pretty funny next what we got is the

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.289 
pretty funny next what we got is the
anti-gravitational<00:03:54.030> explosive<00:03:55.030> this<00:03:55.180> is

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
anti-gravitational explosive this is

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.580 
anti-gravitational explosive this is
probably<00:03:55.540> one<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.690> my<00:03:55.810> favorites<00:03:56.260> because<00:03:56.410> it

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
probably one of my favorites because it

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.680 
probably one of my favorites because it
does<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.799> lot<00:03:56.889> of<00:03:57.040> cool<00:03:57.310> stuff<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.000> all<00:03:58.209> the

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
does a lot of cool stuff and the all the

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.839 
does a lot of cool stuff and the all the
blocks<00:03:58.959> kind<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.349> float<00:03:59.590> into<00:03:59.919> the<00:03:59.949> air<00:04:00.190> so

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
blocks kind of float into the air so

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.039 
blocks kind of float into the air so
let's<00:04:00.970> go<00:04:01.090> ahead<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.359> watch<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:01.690> one<00:04:01.750> right

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
let's go ahead and watch this one right

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.199 
let's go ahead and watch this one right
here<00:04:02.379> as<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.680> makes<00:04:02.980> its<00:04:03.220> way<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.609> it<00:04:03.849> does

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
here as it makes its way and it does

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.420 
here as it makes its way and it does
lift<00:04:04.419> you<00:04:04.690> up<00:04:04.720> as<00:04:04.989> well<00:04:05.019> and<00:04:05.379> whoa<00:04:05.590> for<00:04:06.280> some

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
lift you up as well and whoa for some

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.490 
lift you up as well and whoa for some
reason<00:04:06.699> it<00:04:06.819> like<00:04:06.909> splits<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.569> sand<00:04:07.870> into<00:04:08.199> kind

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
reason it like splits the sand into kind

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.960 
reason it like splits the sand into kind
of<00:04:08.560> weird<00:04:08.799> little<00:04:08.980> blocky

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
of weird little blocky

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.629 
of weird little blocky
particle<00:04:10.780> my<00:04:10.930> bobbers<00:04:11.349> that's<00:04:11.560> weird<00:04:11.889> doesn't

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
particle my bobbers that's weird doesn't

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.979 
particle my bobbers that's weird doesn't
really<00:04:12.699> do<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.090> with<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.329> other<00:04:13.449> blocks<00:04:13.750> but

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
really do that with the other blocks but

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.960 
really do that with the other blocks but
that's<00:04:14.229> really<00:04:14.590> cool<00:04:14.859> but<00:04:15.489> as<00:04:15.609> you<00:04:15.729> guys<00:04:15.819> can

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
that's really cool but as you guys can

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.099 
that's really cool but as you guys can
tell<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.299> would<00:04:16.449> do<00:04:16.599> this<00:04:16.750> with<00:04:16.900> all<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.019> other

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
tell it would do this with all the other

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.750 
tell it would do this with all the other
blocks<00:04:17.500> so<00:04:17.739> if<00:04:17.799> you<00:04:17.919> had<00:04:18.159> dirt<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.549> would<00:04:18.639> have

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
blocks so if you had dirt it would have

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.460 
blocks so if you had dirt it would have
dirt<00:04:19.000> blocks<00:04:19.299> flying<00:04:19.659> up<00:04:19.780> into<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.169> air

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
dirt blocks flying up into the air

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.730 
dirt blocks flying up into the air
sooo<00:04:21.220> yeah<00:04:21.780> already<00:04:22.780> guys<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.320> last<00:04:23.470> but<00:04:23.650> not

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
sooo yeah already guys and last but not

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.710 
sooo yeah already guys and last but not
least<00:04:23.980> we've<00:04:24.130> got<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.460> red<00:04:24.670> matter<00:04:24.940> explosive

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
least we've got the red matter explosive

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.080 
least we've got the red matter explosive
now<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:26.050> is<00:04:26.230> my<00:04:26.350> favorite<00:04:26.680> explosive<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.730> it

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
now this is my favorite explosive and it

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.820 
now this is my favorite explosive and it
really<00:04:28.420> is<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.690> close<00:04:29.080> runner-up<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:29.710> the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
really is a close runner-up to the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.740 
really is a close runner-up to the
explosives<00:04:30.460> plus<00:04:30.700> mod<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.150> in<00:04:31.240> terms<00:04:31.510> of

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
explosives plus mod and in terms of

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.930 
explosives plus mod and in terms of
effects<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.440> all<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.400> kind<00:04:33.610> of<00:04:33.700> stuff<00:04:33.790> so

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
effects and all that kind of stuff so

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.810 
effects and all that kind of stuff so
without<00:04:34.240> further<00:04:34.420> ado<00:04:34.860> number<00:04:35.860> one<00:04:36.070> explosive

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
without further ado number one explosive

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.000 
without further ado number one explosive
in<00:04:36.940> my<00:04:37.060> opinion<00:04:37.480> in<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.690> ICBM<00:04:38.290> mod<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.770> red

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
in my opinion in the ICBM mod is the red

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.340 
in my opinion in the ICBM mod is the red
matter<00:04:39.760> explosive<00:04:40.570> right<00:04:40.750> here<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.230> some

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
matter explosive right here that some

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.560 
matter explosive right here that some
super<00:04:41.800> cool<00:04:41.950> effects<00:04:42.340> and<00:04:42.580> that's<00:04:42.700> so<00:04:43.120> awesome

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
super cool effects and that's so awesome

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.870 
super cool effects and that's so awesome
and<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:44.770> essentially<00:04:45.160> just<00:04:45.280> keeps<00:04:45.460> picking<00:04:45.790> up

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
and it essentially just keeps picking up

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.550 
and it essentially just keeps picking up
blocks<00:04:46.150> until<00:04:46.360> it<00:04:46.570> gets<00:04:46.690> too<00:04:46.840> powerful<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.500> I

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
blocks until it gets too powerful and I

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.110 
blocks until it gets too powerful and I
think<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.890> just<00:04:48.010> goes<00:04:48.220> into<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.670> ground<00:04:48.940> of

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
think it just goes into the ground of

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.850 
think it just goes into the ground of
your<00:04:49.150> worlds<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:49.780> then<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.140> disappears<00:04:50.620> into

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
your worlds and then it disappears into

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.130 
your worlds and then it disappears into
the<00:04:50.950> air<00:04:51.160> once<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.760> has<00:04:51.910> gained<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.480> think

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
the air once it has gained I think

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.400 
the air once it has gained I think
thirty<00:04:53.410> five<00:04:54.360> stacks<00:04:55.360> of<00:04:55.630> blocks<00:04:55.870> I<00:04:56.080> believe

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
thirty five stacks of blocks I believe

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.770 
thirty five stacks of blocks I believe
something<00:04:57.100> like<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:57.640> it's<00:04:58.480> just<00:04:58.660> going

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
something like that and it's just going

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.060 
something like that and it's just going
to<00:04:58.840> keep<00:04:59.050> digging<00:04:59.230> into<00:04:59.410> your<00:04:59.650> world<00:04:59.890> that

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
to keep digging into your world that

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.620 
to keep digging into your world that
really<00:05:00.280> does<00:05:00.460> do<00:05:00.670> a<00:05:00.700> lot<00:05:00.790> of<00:05:00.940> grief<00:05:01.270> in<00:05:01.450> so

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
really does do a lot of grief in so

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.420 
really does do a lot of grief in so
watch<00:05:01.750> out<00:05:01.960> for<00:05:02.110> this<00:05:02.230> one<00:05:02.290> if<00:05:02.680> you<00:05:03.040> guys<00:05:03.160> don't

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
watch out for this one if you guys don't

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.740 
watch out for this one if you guys don't
want<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.610> destroy<00:05:03.940> your<00:05:04.090> world<00:05:04.150> but<00:05:04.510> it<00:05:04.600> has<00:05:04.720> a

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
want to destroy your world but it has a

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.930 
want to destroy your world but it has a
really<00:05:05.140> cool<00:05:05.320> kind<00:05:05.890> of<00:05:05.920> bluish<00:05:06.310> effect<00:05:06.730> right

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
really cool kind of bluish effect right

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.460 
really cool kind of bluish effect right
here<00:05:07.000> along<00:05:07.510> with<00:05:07.540> like<00:05:07.780> some<00:05:07.990> rays<00:05:08.260> of<00:05:08.440> light

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
here along with like some rays of light

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.370 
here along with like some rays of light
and<00:05:08.860> if<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:09.430> get<00:05:09.580> below<00:05:09.760> it<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.990> kind<00:05:11.260> of

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
and if you get below it the kind of

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.930 
and if you get below it the kind of
effect<00:05:11.740> goes<00:05:11.950> away<00:05:12.250> which<00:05:12.430> is<00:05:12.550> kind<00:05:12.760> of<00:05:12.790> weird

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
effect goes away which is kind of weird

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.640 
effect goes away which is kind of weird
but<00:05:13.150> if<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.300> get<00:05:13.419> above<00:05:13.510> it<00:05:13.780> it<00:05:14.080> still<00:05:14.500> looks

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
but if you get above it it still looks

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.800 
but if you get above it it still looks
pretty<00:05:14.770> cool<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.370> it's<00:05:16.180> just<00:05:16.390> like<00:05:16.510> a<00:05:16.540> big

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
pretty cool and it's just like a big

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.720 
pretty cool and it's just like a big
black<00:05:17.200> hole<00:05:17.530> in<00:05:17.770> your<00:05:17.860> world<00:05:18.130> sucking<00:05:18.520> in<00:05:18.640> all

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
black hole in your world sucking in all

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.730 
black hole in your world sucking in all
the<00:05:18.880> blocks<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.419> once<00:05:20.200> it's<00:05:20.350> done<00:05:20.500> with<00:05:20.620> it

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
the blocks and once it's done with it

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.930 
the blocks and once it's done with it
stage<00:05:20.980> right<00:05:21.280> here<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:21.669> luck<00:05:21.760> eventually

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
stage right here and luck eventually

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.180 
stage right here and luck eventually
makes<00:05:22.390> its<00:05:22.540> way<00:05:22.570> into<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.900> ground<00:05:23.140> and<00:05:23.560> kind

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
makes its way into the ground and kind

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.040 
makes its way into the ground and kind
of<00:05:24.250> makes<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.490> big<00:05:24.700> cave<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.360> then<00:05:25.450> goes<00:05:25.840> into

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
of makes a big cave and then goes into

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.720 
of makes a big cave and then goes into
the<00:05:26.140> air<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:26.440> disappears<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.160> it's<00:05:27.490> really

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
the air and disappears and it's really

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.210 
the air and disappears and it's really
cool<00:05:27.910> it<00:05:28.000> goes<00:05:28.180> on<00:05:28.330> for<00:05:28.510> a<00:05:28.540> long<00:05:28.600> time<00:05:29.050> and<00:05:29.320> it's

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
cool it goes on for a long time and it's

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.610 
cool it goes on for a long time and it's
just<00:05:30.280> pretty<00:05:30.880> awesome<00:05:31.200> explosive<00:05:32.200> if<00:05:32.320> you<00:05:32.470> ask

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
just pretty awesome explosive if you ask

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.760 
just pretty awesome explosive if you ask
me<00:05:32.919> so<00:05:33.400> yeah<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.330> pretty<00:05:34.419> much<00:05:34.600> wraps<00:05:34.960> up<00:05:35.320> the

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
me so yeah that pretty much wraps up the

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.909 
ICBM mod hopefully you guys did enjoy it
it<00:05:40.330> was<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.810> little<00:05:40.930> bit<00:05:41.140> different<00:05:41.560> than<00:05:41.800> the
