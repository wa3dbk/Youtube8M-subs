push out the push out this I'm doing on

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.710 
push out the push out this I'm doing on
one<00:00:26.250> hand<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:29.150> yeah<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.390> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
one hand so I can yeah it's kind of a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.330 
one hand so I can yeah it's kind of a
mess<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:30.929> now<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.289> uh<00:00:31.560> get<00:00:32.130> all<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
mess right now but uh get all the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.479 
mess right now but uh get all the
connections<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.800> like<00:00:34.800> -<00:00:36.350> yeah<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.430> took

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
connections in like - yeah that I took

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.639 
connections in like - yeah that I took
the<00:00:38.760> ground<00:00:39.000> wires<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.540> stripped<00:00:40.200> him<00:00:40.260> extra

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the ground wires I stripped him extra

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.720 
the ground wires I stripped him extra
long<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:42.739> twisted<00:00:43.739> them<00:00:43.860> together<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
long I twisted them together and I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.569 
long I twisted them together and I
loosened<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:46.050> nut<00:00:46.320> wrap<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.190> around<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
loosened this nut wrap them around and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.130 
loosened this nut wrap them around and
tighten<00:00:47.850> them<00:00:48.030> back<00:00:48.239> down<00:00:49.610> resistors<00:00:50.610> are<00:00:50.820> in

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
tighten them back down resistors are in

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.010 
tighten them back down resistors are in
all<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.410> clips<00:00:52.649> around

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
all the clips around

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.260 
all the clips around
everything's<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.680> taped<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:56.820> shattered

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
everything's I taped all my shattered

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.549 
everything's I taped all my shattered
connections<00:00:57.809> make<00:00:58.079> sure<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.410> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
connections make sure you do that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.590 
connections make sure you do that
otherwise<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.219> ground<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.640> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
otherwise you're going to ground up you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.050 
otherwise you're going to ground up you
will<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.550> have<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.670> work<00:01:02.989> go<00:01:03.989> ahead<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.800 

there's<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:10.400> there's<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.850> tailing<00:01:14.810> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
there's and there's the tailing the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.980 
there's and there's the tailing the
breakline<00:01:16.550> there's<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.850> bird<00:01:18.000> flying<00:01:18.270> blind

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
breakline there's the bird flying blind

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:29.260 
breakline there's the bird flying blind
you<00:01:19.729> there's<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:23.300> turn<00:01:24.300> circle<00:01:25.250> left<00:01:26.869> right

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
you there's a turn circle left right

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.600 
you there's a turn circle left right
alright<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.720> guess<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.369> put<00:01:32.580> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
alright I guess that's it just put it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.740 
alright I guess that's it just put it
back<00:01:32.759> together<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.149> don't<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.630> need

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
back together I don't think you need

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.889 
back together I don't think you need
instructions<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.440> how<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.649> do<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.899> hope

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
instructions on how to do that and hope

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.240 
instructions on how to do that and hope
this<00:01:37.080> helps

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.719
