00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.460
 we are in the bottaia the most important place in the cellar and place where 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.909
 red wines and some white wines are aged to mature 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.159
 the types of barrels are 3 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.279
 there are 45 pole barrels for large sizes 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.679
 then there are barrels from 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.679
 500 liters which are called porn 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.370
 finally perhaps the best-known barrels the most famous in the world by 225 liters 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.130
 which are the famous barriques 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.410
 the best wood for our wines 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.960
 is the pyromaniac 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.819
 all 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.620
 the types of barrels that we have just listed are made with one with 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:54.850
 this material 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.290
 in which it comes from three main basins 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 in the world that is the oak of American origin 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.320
 in oak of Eastern European Labonia 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.580
 or more 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.440
 us mobile the best qualitatively speaking that error coming from 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.520
 France 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.130
 the barrels and barriques 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 what santa margherita chosen are only all exclusively and of origin 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.030
 French 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.390
 how much is the life cycle 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.520
 of a barrel 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.520
 a barrel can last many years 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.390
 or it may simply last for some cycles for some steps 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.820
 this is a choice 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.800
 a choice of the new according to the project that lies according to the wine I wanted 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.040
 well 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 glee obviously a new bike 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.230
 will release the aromatic substances proper to the wood inna to an extent 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.230
 more weather a barrel that has suffered 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.090
 several steps 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.540
 several fines - substance 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.360
 until not many years ago there is the wine was put to refine in the barrels 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.299
 in late spring 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.639
 elvira was already clean enough that it had already undergone malolactic fermentation 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.909
 today it is the trend 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.019
 and that of refining new wines immediately after maceration 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:27.109
 so that the malolactic fermentation takes place in wood fermentation 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.589
 malolactic is nothing but 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.609
 ok the transformation of the malic site which is an acid 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.709
 quite strong in lactic acid with weaker acid 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.089
 which makes the wine 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.899
 more balanced softer more beautiful bile 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:45.719
 and finally, how long and the refinement, the duration and the refinement 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.489
 obviously it depends on the characteristics of the wine 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.759
 and above all from the result that does not want to obtain it 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:58.139
 to do this during the phase of awarding the maturation in 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.769
 wood the winemaker 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.870
 will proceed to continuous continuous tasting with wise tiger 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.949
 ee then went to wrath decided that 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:14.619
 maturation and an optimal moment has arrived ideal time will proceed 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.869
 assembly 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:20.399
 of the various wines contained in the various types of barrels 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.019
 now therefore we proceed to the assembly which is a phase 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.779
 crucial is fundamental because 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.320
 and the same plan 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.320
 which is contained in the large barrel rather than in the small barrels 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:38.619
 because it matured in a different way and therefore the oenologist decides in which 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:40.009
 proportion 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:42.849
 and these wines must be mixed 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.849
 the goal of santa maria rita is to obtain wines 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.079
 deconstructed wines with rich personalities 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.920
 where the note given by the finally wood is present diamond 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.449
 good complexity 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:56.679
 but 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:59.859
 100 a deb has never prevaricate on photo
