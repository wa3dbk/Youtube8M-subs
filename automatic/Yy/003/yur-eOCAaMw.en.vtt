00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.680
 the thrash bear running a super tips on the fort 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.219
 It may seem 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.560
 it's a breeze 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.560
 easy to taste 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.480
 not funny 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.429
 as possible 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.109
 noise in the suspension 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 when it has been given to the police who drew new 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.950
 we thought 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.860
 just met strange has even made success the mechanical car of space center 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.320
 between nothing wrong tap 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 so the tip here is the battery of the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.540
 but you can avoid missing a battery because we already removed the drummer 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.870
 but the battery 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.200
 a low battery exists this course that are here 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.890
 swimming let's see I'll show you the cpdc dpdc 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.200
 that goal 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 the account portal 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.080
 everything got worse 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.810
 the pickup detonated Kyoto 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.260
 this course itself 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 the cable broke here at this point 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.180
 this defect here is also the same 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.220
 in the strong fiesta is also opposed to exposing itself 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.370
 is the next paralamas 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.850
 this statement of reasons in such a way as to break the deadline 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.930
 actually the defect 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.240
 coaching operated 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.610
 another tip very well in the game 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.990
 is this the position that is watching here a round kick in the river 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.190
 second sting's are here 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.000
 a piece of aluminum apart 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.190
 Low bernanke 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.920
 the last one is Kyoto 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 the least she finishes 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040
 and picking up the fall 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.090
 devilder from here 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.049
 but I can assume as this is part 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.309
 and end up taking a vibration 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:13.419
 and you swear 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.419
 that this vibration here 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.489
 eptc serve or imax 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.650
 You swear and let it go. 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.459
 this car here 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.459
 strong cited volksbad too 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.640
 that has this model of costinha that every year in fact coutinho helton 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.959
 hence elected 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.420
 There is a rubber and prevention position with the nike boot 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.289
 electronic and soul 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:48.579
 but pretty cool work avoids past weak engine coat does not irritate 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.670
 This one can run away, what's the tip for you on the continent? 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.779
 in the field what breaks 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.329
 the bass fishbone 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.889
 it is pretty hard 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.539
 How is the new car? 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.539
 The tip is for you to have the power. 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.629
 yes but not another car if you subscribe 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.399
 a proof that the car 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.589
 and getting hot 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.929
 but cristina from our channel 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:17.609
 you may have the luck of the little total 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.609
 I know the networks portal version on twitter 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.869
 and I saw the questions is the website is good 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.869
 it's only one scared 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:35.709
 other tracks
