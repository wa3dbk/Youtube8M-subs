it's<00:00:42.070> important<00:00:42.610> to<00:00:42.730> me<00:00:42.970> to<00:00:43.690> have<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.900> scope

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
it's important to me to have a scope

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.170 
it's important to me to have a scope
that<00:00:44.230> functions<00:00:45.160> well<00:00:45.220> there<00:00:45.580> if<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:45.790> talk<00:00:46.000> to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
that functions well there if you talk to

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.000 
that functions well there if you talk to
the<00:00:46.239> manufacturers<00:00:46.900> they<00:00:47.140> say<00:00:47.379> you<00:00:47.739> got<00:00:47.890> to

look<00:00:48.129> through<00:00:48.340> your<00:00:48.430> scopes<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:49.000> really

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
look through your scopes to really

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.830 
look through your scopes to really
determine<00:00:50.290> what<00:00:51.070> sets<00:00:51.370> them<00:00:51.489> apart<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:52.540> how

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
determine what sets them apart and how

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.330 
determine what sets them apart and how
good<00:00:53.110> they<00:00:53.260> really<00:00:53.290> are<00:00:53.790> at<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.850> store

light gets dim the Nikon master is it's

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.840 
light gets dim the Nikon master is it's
a<00:02:41.820> pretty<00:02:42.030> good<00:02:42.270> scope<00:02:42.510> overall<00:02:43.610> only<00:02:44.610> thing

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
a pretty good scope overall only thing

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.930 
a pretty good scope overall only thing
with<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.959> as<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.620> light<00:02:46.830> fades<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.730> get

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
with it is as the light fades you get

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.540 
with it is as the light fades you get
really<00:02:48.450> finicky<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:49.440> far<00:02:49.770> as<00:02:49.920> your<00:02:50.130> parallax

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
really finicky as far as your parallax

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.850 
really finicky as far as your parallax
adjustment<00:02:50.730> goes<00:02:51.270> if<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:51.990> not<00:02:52.200> spot-on<00:02:53.570> and

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
adjustment goes if it's not spot-on and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.830 
adjustment goes if it's not spot-on and
you<00:02:55.860> can<00:02:56.100> hardly<00:02:56.250> see<00:02:56.400> through<00:02:56.720> actually<00:02:57.720> it's

a pretty good step up in that is the
