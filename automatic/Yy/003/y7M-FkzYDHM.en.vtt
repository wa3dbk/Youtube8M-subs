growth<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.630> your<00:00:30.779> foot<00:00:31.080> how<00:00:31.230> long<00:00:31.439> now<00:00:31.969> that's

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
growth on your foot how long now that's

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.649 

I<00:00:44.190> guess<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.339> stick<00:00:45.789> of<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:45.999> burn<00:00:46.210> should<00:00:46.570> be

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
I guess the stick of the burn should be

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.930 
I guess the stick of the burn should be
the<00:00:46.780> worst<00:00:46.989> part<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.890> scraping<00:00:48.640> should

the worst part the scraping should

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.050 
the worst part the scraping should
shouldn't<00:00:49.629> be<00:00:49.809> too<00:00:49.989> painful
