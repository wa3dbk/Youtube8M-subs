it's<00:01:11.370> extremely<00:01:12.150> calm<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.840> much<00:01:13.110> more

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it's extremely calm it's much more

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.860 
it's extremely calm it's much more
zen-like<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.760> basically<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.570> hear<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
zen-like and basically all you hear is

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.080 
zen-like and basically all you hear is
air<00:01:16.140> which<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.770> surprising<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.580> at<00:01:17.760> 200

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.450 

basically<00:01:23.900> every<00:01:24.200> year<00:01:24.440> we<00:01:24.620> need<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:24.920> create<00:01:25.190> a

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
basically every year we need to create a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.310 
basically every year we need to create a
new<00:01:25.490> motorcycle<00:01:26.150> that's<00:01:26.659> better<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.080> faster

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
new motorcycle that's better and faster

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.230 
new motorcycle that's better and faster
than<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.740> previous<00:01:28.130> year<00:01:28.280> we're<00:01:28.760> not<00:01:28.909> here

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
than the previous year we're not here

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.719 
than the previous year we're not here
simply<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.800> make<00:01:30.800> motorcycles<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:31.520> aren't

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
simply to make motorcycles that aren't

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.580 
simply to make motorcycles that aren't
aesthetic<00:01:32.120> as<00:01:32.240> well<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.080> part<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.440> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
aesthetic as well that is part of the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.770 
aesthetic as well that is part of the

engineering and problem-solving DNA to
us<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.800> starts<00:01:37.100> with<00:01:37.190> sketches<00:01:38.800> Michael

comes to us with these beautiful

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.330 
comes to us with these beautiful
sketches<00:01:41.690> of<00:01:42.110> his<00:01:42.259> visions<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.800> how<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:43.190> should

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
sketches of his visions of how it should

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.230 
sketches of his visions of how it should
work<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.940> look<00:01:44.270> colors<00:01:45.160> shapes<00:01:46.160> and<00:01:46.550> we've

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
work and look colors shapes and we've

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.380 
work and look colors shapes and we've
got<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.479> take<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.660> and<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:49.040> in<00:01:49.729> all<00:01:50.119> the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
got to take that and and in all the

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.600 
got to take that and and in all the
aerodynamics<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.440> mechanical<00:01:52.009> forces<00:01:52.400> that

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
aerodynamics and mechanical forces that

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.900 
aerodynamics and mechanical forces that
we<00:01:52.729> then<00:01:52.910> have<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.150> deal<00:01:53.630> with<00:01:53.780> on<00:01:53.900> a<00:01:53.930> bike<00:01:54.200> the

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
we then have to deal with on a bike the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.090 
we then have to deal with on a bike the
path<00:01:55.910> of<00:01:56.240> being<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.780> trailblazer<00:01:57.050> I<00:01:57.619> would<00:01:57.890> say

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
path of being a trailblazer I would say

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.590 
path of being a trailblazer I would say
is<00:01:58.310> more<00:01:58.460> difficult<00:01:58.670> regardless<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.509> the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
is more difficult regardless of the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.570 
is more difficult regardless of the
product<00:01:59.840> if<00:02:00.560> it's<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.009> product<00:02:01.280> that's

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
product if it's a product that's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.600 
product if it's a product that's
replacing<00:02:02.000> something<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:03.170> legacy<00:02:03.680> it's<00:02:04.310> even

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
replacing something of legacy it's even

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.120 
replacing something of legacy it's even
more<00:02:04.729> difficult<00:02:05.140> it's<00:02:06.140> not<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:06.560> we<00:02:06.740> can<00:02:06.920> call

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
more difficult it's not like we can call

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.710 
more difficult it's not like we can call
the<00:02:07.280> companies<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.789> making<00:02:08.090> pistons<00:02:08.270> for<00:02:08.690> a

they've done over the last 50 years and
asked<00:02:19.310> them<00:02:19.430> how<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.910> we<00:02:20.030> apply<00:02:20.269> that<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
asked them how can we apply that to the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.920

know<00:03:34.220> I've<00:03:34.310> been<00:03:34.340> thinking<00:03:34.610> about<00:03:34.700> the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
know I've been thinking about the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.850 
know I've been thinking about the
suspension<00:03:35.690> on<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.020> bike<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.530> want<00:03:36.710> to<00:03:36.770> do

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
suspension on the bike and I want to do

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.850 
suspension on the bike and I want to do
something<00:03:37.070> novel<00:03:37.520> I'd<00:03:37.730> like<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.210> look<00:03:38.510> into

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
something novel I'd like to look into

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.260 
something novel I'd like to look into
taking<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.070> springs<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.460> dampers<00:03:40.640> and

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
taking the springs and dampers and

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.030 
taking the springs and dampers and
moving<00:03:41.540> them<00:03:41.660> up<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:42.170> where<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.650> tank<00:03:42.860> would

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
moving them up to where the tank would

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.130 
moving them up to where the tank would
be<00:03:43.160> in<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> normal<00:03:43.580> motor<00:03:43.730> cycle<00:03:44.180> because<00:03:44.600> we

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
be in a normal motor cycle because we

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.290 
be in a normal motor cycle because we
don't<00:03:45.290> have<00:03:45.380> gas<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.040> really<00:03:46.790> gonna<00:03:46.910> put<00:03:47.150> that

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
don't have gas so really gonna put that

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.400 
don't have gas so really gonna put that
right<00:03:47.510> so<00:03:47.720> when<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:47.990> talked<00:03:48.200> about<00:03:48.260> putting

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
right so when we talked about putting

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.600 
right so when we talked about putting
the<00:03:48.680> suspension<00:03:49.160> up<00:03:49.250> there

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
the suspension up there

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.700 
the suspension up there
the<00:03:49.790> SolidWorks<00:03:50.390> software<00:03:50.600> really<00:03:51.320> helped<00:03:51.590> us

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
the SolidWorks software really helped us

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.820 
the SolidWorks software really helped us
to<00:03:52.060> approach<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.240> very<00:03:53.390> quickly<00:03:53.690> we<00:03:54.560> started

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
to approach it very quickly we started

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.140 
to approach it very quickly we started
with<00:03:54.920> just<00:03:55.100> basic<00:03:55.430> sketches<00:03:55.640> figuring<00:03:56.060> out

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
with just basic sketches figuring out

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.870 
with just basic sketches figuring out
can<00:03:56.360> we<00:03:56.390> get<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:57.380> geometry<00:03:57.710> to<00:03:58.100> work<00:03:58.280> can<00:03:58.790> we

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
can we get the geometry to work can we

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.730 
can we get the geometry to work can we
get<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.180> forces<00:03:59.600> to<00:03:59.780> work<00:03:59.900> our<00:04:00.260> bike

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
get the forces to work our bike

no<00:04:02.930> way<00:04:03.110> we<00:04:03.290> could<00:04:03.440> have<00:04:03.500> done<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:03.860> without<00:04:04.100> the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
no way we could have done it without the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.880 
no way we could have done it without the
tools<00:04:05.090> that's<00:04:05.960> all<00:04:06.230> works<00:04:06.440> brought<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.800> the

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
tools that's all works brought to the

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.960 
tools that's all works brought to the
table<00:04:07.100> there's<00:04:07.850> just<00:04:08.030> no<00:04:08.150> way<00:04:09.850> SolidWorks<00:04:10.850> has

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
table there's just no way SolidWorks has

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.260 
table there's just no way SolidWorks has
allowed<00:04:11.870> us<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:12.290> basically<00:04:12.800> go<00:04:13.760> down<00:04:13.790> this

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
allowed us to basically go down this

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.229 
allowed us to basically go down this
clean<00:04:14.510> cheap<00:04:14.780> path<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:16.370> come<00:04:16.880> out<00:04:17.030> on<00:04:17.060> the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
clean cheap path and come out on the

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.479 
clean cheap path and come out on the
other<00:04:17.359> side<00:04:17.510> of<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:17.989> with<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.560> bike<00:04:18.830> that<00:04:19.040> that

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
other side of it with a bike that that

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.039 
other side of it with a bike that that
literally<00:04:19.970> goes<00:04:20.120> together<00:04:20.510> first<00:04:20.780> right

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
literally goes together first right

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.879 
literally goes together first right
which<00:04:21.710> is<00:04:21.859> amazing

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
which is amazing

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.510 
which is amazing
the<00:04:23.400> last<00:04:23.639> two<00:04:23.879> years<00:04:24.650> we<00:04:25.650> had<00:04:25.830> virtually<00:04:26.250> no

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
the last two years we had virtually no

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.909 
the last two years we had virtually no
testing<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.419> bikes<00:04:27.650> never<00:04:28.650> saw<00:04:28.830> the

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
testing and the bikes never saw the

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.300 
testing and the bikes never saw the
light<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.490> day<00:04:29.759> until<00:04:30.449> they<00:04:31.020> were<00:04:31.219> taking<00:04:32.219> out

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
light of day until they were taking out

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.890 
light of day until they were taking out
the<00:04:32.400> crates<00:04:32.669> on<00:04:32.849> the<00:04:32.969> Isle<00:04:33.060> of<00:04:33.090> Man<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.569> think

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
the crates on the Isle of Man I think

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.200 
the crates on the Isle of Man I think
it's<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.110> testament<00:04:34.469> to<00:04:34.939> basically<00:04:35.939> the

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
it's a testament to basically the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.659 
it's a testament to basically the
ability<00:04:36.419> of<00:04:36.780> our<00:04:36.900> team<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:38.009> using<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.460> tools

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
ability of our team and using the tools

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.760 
ability of our team and using the tools
that<00:04:38.849> we<00:04:38.939> have<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:39.240> SolidWorks<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:40.500> we<00:04:40.620> can

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
that we have like SolidWorks that we can

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.950 
that we have like SolidWorks that we can
actually<00:04:40.919> have<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.310> much<00:04:41.490> faith<00:04:41.939> in<00:04:42.210> parts

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
actually have that much faith in parts

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.779 
actually have that much faith in parts
that<00:04:43.080> never<00:04:43.289> been<00:04:43.439> tested<00:04:43.710> handed<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.759> a
