get achievements I recommend not putting
anyone<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:51.989> co-op<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.920> you're<00:00:53.579> doing<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.000> random

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
anyone in co-op if you're doing a random

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.020 
anyone in co-op if you're doing a random
co-op<00:00:54.890> until<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.100> last<00:00:56.280> chapter<00:00:56.850> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
co-op until the last chapter and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.209 
co-op until the last chapter and
therefore<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> achievement

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
therefore you can get the achievement

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.430 
therefore you can get the achievement
much<00:00:59.969> easier<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.960> you're<00:01:01.050> doing<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
much easier if you're doing this with a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.840 
much easier if you're doing this with a
friend<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:02.039> could<00:01:02.129> play<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> game<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
friend you could play the game all the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.880 
friend you could play the game all the
way<00:01:02.879> through<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> find<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.650> more

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
way through but I find it a lot more

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.580 
way through but I find it a lot more
easier<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.489> pay<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> whole<00:01:06.150> game<00:01:06.299> by<00:01:06.420> yourself

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
easier to pay the whole game by yourself

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.899 
easier to pay the whole game by yourself
until<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.799> last<00:01:08.460> mission<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.950> have

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
until the last mission and then have

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.609 
until the last mission and then have
someone<00:01:12.619> join<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:14.100> game<00:01:15.350> because<00:01:16.350> most<00:01:16.530> the

carrying a bunch of assault rifles in

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.990 
carrying a bunch of assault rifles in
because<00:02:24.650> what<00:02:24.830> he'll<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.280> he'll<00:02:25.459> jump<00:02:25.670> onto

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
because what he'll do is he'll jump onto

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.970 
because what he'll do is he'll jump onto
these<00:02:26.510> platforms<00:02:26.810> out<00:02:27.170> here<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.920> can

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
these platforms out here and you can

these platforms out here and you can
just<00:02:28.129> shoot<00:02:28.579> them<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:29.209> way<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.019> assault

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
just shoot them this way and the assault

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.430 
just shoot them this way and the assault
rifles<00:02:30.620> are<00:02:31.450> great<00:02:32.450> because<00:02:32.599> you<00:02:32.750> can<00:02:32.930> shoot

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
rifles are great because you can shoot

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.380 
rifles are great because you can shoot
them<00:02:33.590> faster<00:02:34.099> and<00:02:34.340> i<00:02:34.849> probably<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.180> best

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
them faster and i probably the best

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:43.720 
them faster and i probably the best
long-range<00:02:36.079> weapon<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:42.579> that's<00:02:43.579> the<00:02:43.700> only

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
long-range weapon and that's the only

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.809 
long-range weapon and that's the only
advice<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.329> can<00:02:44.360> say<00:02:45.040> impact<00:02:46.040> hammers<00:02:46.459> and

which<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.739> combine<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.069> katana<00:02:59.060> and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
which is to combine the katana and

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.740 
which is to combine the katana and
sickle<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.160> also<00:03:01.549> a<00:03:01.819> really<00:03:02.239> good<00:03:02.359> weapon<00:03:02.630> to

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
sickle is also a really good weapon to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.860 
sickle is also a really good weapon to
use<00:03:02.780> against<00:03:03.049> this<00:03:03.139> guy<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:05.150> doesn't<00:03:05.630> beat<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
use against this guy it doesn't beat the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.129 
use against this guy it doesn't beat the
impact<00:03:06.200> hammer<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:06.859> if<00:03:07.130> you're<00:03:07.750> its<00:03:08.750> wings

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
impact hammer but if you're its wings

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.900 
impact hammer but if you're its wings
faster<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:10.220> doesn't<00:03:10.489> do<00:03:10.549> as<00:03:10.700> much<00:03:10.730> damage

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
faster but it doesn't do as much damage

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.159 
faster but it doesn't do as much damage
so<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:12.769> up<00:03:12.889> to<00:03:13.069> your<00:03:13.190> personal<00:03:13.310> preference

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
so it's up to your personal preference

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.470 
so it's up to your personal preference
and<00:03:15.169> plus<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.620> can<00:03:15.769> always<00:03:16.549> refresh<00:03:17.209> your

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
impact cameras because he'll spawn some

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.780 
impact cameras because he'll spawn some
hazard<00:03:20.840> units<00:03:21.160> along<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.310> way<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.730> I
