asking<00:00:15.000> me<00:00:15.089> how<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.360> change<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> rear

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
asking me how do you change the rear

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.720 
asking me how do you change the rear
shocks<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.720> TCR<00:00:18.720> 21<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> same<00:00:20.670> as

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
shocks on the TCR 21 if it's the same as

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.009 
shocks on the TCR 21 if it's the same as
a<00:00:21.000> TCR<00:00:21.480> 11<00:00:22.369> put<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.519> been<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.269> Steen's<00:00:24.600> first

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
a TCR 11 put the been on Steen's first

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.120 
a TCR 11 put the been on Steen's first
so<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.769> room<00:00:25.890> underneath

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
so you can get a bit of room underneath

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.910 
so you can get a bit of room underneath
here<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.109> you<00:00:28.109> actually<00:00:28.349> undo<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
here and you actually undo it from the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:40.940 
here and you actually undo it from the
bottom<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> van<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:38.719> uh<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.350> easiest<00:00:40.680> way

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
bottom of the van and uh the easiest way

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.459 
bottom of the van and uh the easiest way
to<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.520> access<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:43.170> hand

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
to get access this is to the right hand

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:54.500 
to get access this is to the right hand
side<00:00:43.910> for<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.440> inside<00:00:46.860> vehicle<00:00:53.510> see

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the nut data EFT undo sorry about the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.479 
the nut data EFT undo sorry about the
footage<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.949> little<00:01:01.949> bit<00:01:02.070> tricky

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
footage it's a little bit tricky

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
footage it's a little bit tricky
anyway<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:06.659> easiest<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> from

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
anyway the easiest way is to do it from

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.050 
anyway the easiest way is to do it from
this<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> front<00:01:08.729> side<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:10.110> springs<00:01:10.439> side

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
this at the front side the springs side

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.530 
this at the front side the springs side
get<00:01:12.060> your<00:01:12.210> hand<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.540> there<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:17.330> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.450> get

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
get your hand up there and you can get

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.399 
get your hand up there and you can get
to<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.780> top<00:01:18.990> nut<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.380> quite<00:01:19.619> easy<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:22.229> I'm

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
to that top nut there quite easy and I'm

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.830 
to that top nut there quite easy and I'm
the<00:01:22.530> passenger<00:01:22.740> side<00:01:23.360> take<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> spare

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the passenger side take it the spare

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:35.380 
the passenger side take it the spare
tire<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:26.540> it's<00:01:28.400> relatively<00:01:29.400> much<00:01:30.150> easier

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.730 

it's<00:01:36.390> much<00:01:36.570> easier<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.110> access<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it's much easier to get access to the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.260 
it's much easier to get access to the
top<00:01:37.890> nut<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> shock<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:40.790> we<00:01:41.790> might<00:01:42.090> need

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
top nut of the shock and we might need

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
top nut of the shock and we might need
to<00:01:42.390> put<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.750> customized<00:01:43.229> shocks<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> bed

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
to put some customized shocks in the bed

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.340 
to put some customized shocks in the bed
anyway<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.430> um<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.119> might<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.990> good<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.259> it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
anyway so um I might just good that it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.060 
anyway so um I might just good that it
gave<00:01:46.470> me<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.740> far<00:01:46.890> I'm<00:01:46.979> under<00:01:47.189> urine<00:01:47.549> do<00:01:48.450> that

undo the nut drop the spare wheel out

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.040 
undo the nut drop the spare wheel out
then<00:02:14.070> you'll<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:14.310> easy<00:02:14.520> access<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.540> shock

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
then you'll get easy access to the shock

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.310 
then you'll get easy access to the shock
absorber<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> top<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:18.080> yeah<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.230> the

absorber on the top and yeah and the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.940 
absorber on the top and yeah and the
right<00:02:19.440> hand<00:02:19.620> side<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> little<00:02:20.190> bit<00:02:20.310> harder

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
right hand side is a little bit harder

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.880 
right hand side is a little bit harder
and<00:02:23.330> that's<00:02:24.330> reverse<00:02:24.720> if<00:02:24.960> you're<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.620> America

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and that's reverse if you're in America

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.220 
and that's reverse if you're in America
or<00:02:26.250> somewhere<00:02:26.490> you're<00:02:27.360> driving<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> left-hand

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
or somewhere you're driving a left-hand

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.930 
or somewhere you're driving a left-hand
drive<00:02:28.440> then<00:02:28.680> reverse<00:02:29.370> what<00:02:29.550> I'm<00:02:29.640> saying

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
drive then reverse what I'm saying

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.080 
drive then reverse what I'm saying
basically<00:02:30.180> from<00:02:31.110> other<00:02:31.350> side<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.060> see

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
basically from other side you can see

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.030 
basically from other side you can see
that<00:02:33.360> sound<00:02:33.630> writing<00:02:34.020> easy<00:02:34.200> but<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:34.920> all

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that sound writing easy but it's all

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.650 
that sound writing easy but it's all
done<00:02:35.220> from<00:02:35.370> underneath<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.910> car<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.510> don't

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
done from underneath the car you don't
