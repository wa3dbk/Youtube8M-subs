00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 In this class today we will teach how to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.240
 to create a 24 by 12 art for inserts 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.219
 sure that they will be creased in 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.330
 turning into a 12 by 12 closed 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.799
 Perfect 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.949
 come on first they will have to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.210
 create a file thousand file 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.350
 size 24 by 12 the mayor 300 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.740
 resolution depends on rgb 8 bit background 6 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.960
 can leave transparent even ok 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.260
 perfect now you have done that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.719
 create the right margin lines 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.450
 for no text to be cut off the image 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.879
 also perfect ensuring that the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.660
 printing is done in a perfect way 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.850
 come on and you guys go to the bar 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.520
 tools saw Uruguay's first I 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.320
 I will set the values ​​to horizontal 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.320
 would be 0 25 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.500
 and now how tall she is 12 she 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:13.310
 I would be 11 and 75 right. 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.070
 good now we go there upright will 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.940
 put 0 25 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.940
 would be here 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.409
 Perfect 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.970
 as she has 24 extension will be 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.490
 23.75 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.280
 perfect good now done it to us 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.820
 will put that border is the part 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.440
 central would be where the crease is going 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.660
 it would be 12 perfect vertical good done 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.770
 This we're going to add more is now 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:54.120
 a vertical guide line that would be in the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.120
 information of 11 points 75 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.920
 and creating one that would be 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.160
 12.25 perfect 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.240
 well done it is already delimited that the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.990
 useful area is to place the texts and 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.710
 images would be this small quadrant 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.030
 bounded by the guide lines 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.320
 and this one from here 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:30.210
 however you can use is the entire space of the 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:34.500
 art 12 by 24 24 by 12 to put the 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:38.640
 your certain background that would be in the case is a 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.620
 texture such a photo but it is the living area 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.040
 even for text and image not to 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.530
 occur the cut would be within these 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.740
 perfect squares I've already put here a 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.890
 background for you to understand better and 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.440
 here in this picture would be 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.440
 inserted the perfect text 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.140
 text would be inserted 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.500
 within that square rectangle 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.500
 by the way 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.540
 ready you can put the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.060
 text that you want here only 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.689
 the part of the left that 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:30.829
 would be the one that I am inserting the text 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:30.829
 would be the back of the image 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:42.549
 and that part would be the front part 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.549
 of the image of the insert alias perfect 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:50.230
 always have to pay attention to 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.610
 this is not to occur in certain versions 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.280
 good 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.930
 done this you will insert the images 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.040
 text that you want 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:04.299
 You can send us a psd or even 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:09.640
 even a jotapeg an already closed image 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:14.379
 perfect perfect pdf done this is just you 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:18.760
 saved file file 6 without bias 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.630
 is you choose the saved location and send us 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.300
 Perfect 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.990
 I hope I have helped simplified it to 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.830
 way to create a certain art 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.970
 I believe you will not have 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.699
 difficulties 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.850
 perfect good and that's it until the next 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.850
