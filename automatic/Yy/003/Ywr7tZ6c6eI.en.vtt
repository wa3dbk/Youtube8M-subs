00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
the big wheel bearing as you can see

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.500 
the big wheel bearing as you can see
we've<00:03:27.800> got<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.040> wheel<00:03:28.220> carrier<00:03:28.550> before<00:03:29.390> we

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
we've got the wheel carrier before we

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.750 
we've got the wheel carrier before we
put<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.810> on<00:03:29.930> just<00:03:29.959> make<00:03:30.440> sure<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.680> fill<00:03:30.950> up<00:03:31.010> with

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
once your arms on the small wheel

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.790 
once your arms on the small wheel
bearing<00:03:51.660> goes<00:03:51.840> on<00:03:54.140> then<00:03:55.140> after<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.620> we'll

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
bearing goes on then after that we'll

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:15.059 
bearing goes on then after that we'll
put<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.130> small<00:03:56.370> washer<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:59.370> then<00:04:00.330> your<00:04:00.510> nut

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:21.820 

you
