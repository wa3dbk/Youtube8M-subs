00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:08.490
 hi everybody with you and today you 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.920
 tell and show how to install and 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.690
 set up such a plugin called din 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.849
 map this translates as dynamic 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.710
 card and eventually you will see 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.250
 about here is such a thing you will 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.250
 see in browser pages when typing 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.649
 certain ip and port you be 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.410
 see your online dynamic map 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:30.270
 server and I'll explain to you right now 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.730
 do the first to do it go on 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.200
 the tank. decided to find samghin map he just 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 called from 6 letters and so she 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.510
 called without any additions 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.969
 Click on Don and then find the version 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.219
 for for our version we pump like 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.859
 see here it is suitable for versions 152 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.289
 so for our version it fits 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.559
 we have a completely clean server that is 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.260
 no plugins here just created the world 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:04.110
 there we throw on the shagin map 19 and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 we start our server we wait for loading we wait 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.660
 progruzki genma and all we have in 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.210
 basically ready now close the console 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.630
 and go to the plugins folder and we 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.850
 there was one mapo folder and here we can 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.770
 set it up first of all 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.690
 warn that one map works 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.340
 only with open port that is for 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.170
 you use it 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.030
 will have to open port 1238 123 or 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.860
 other any other and write it in 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.840
 settings let's say I show you now 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970
 where is that port where is it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.910
 set up a web server here as you can see 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.530
 here you are by default 8123 we can 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.140
 let's change and add at the end 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.980
 place of the 3rd century four and i will show later 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.050
 what it looks like 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.660
 further to us what if you want to 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.580
 site display exactly hd textures 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.590
 I use me and for tips here 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.830
 such a site called banks 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.140
 point ru wikipedia and here we change to 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.340
 very near the top here is this defect 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.170
 template 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.420
 the suffix shaft spring high cut is obtained 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.190
 us and the texture will be a little bit at least 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.160
 better before 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.349
 further if you want to chat you 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.569
 you could write in Russian to you 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.330
 will have to change one such thing with i 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.150
 I'll find how 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.040
 it looks and we find such a line by 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.570
 name ki relexa port and here field 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.790
 we change natra that is, we will write this 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:32.260
 something in the chat then she will be 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:34.450
 everything is displayed normally and in 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.650
 Principle dreams settings we made now 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.200
 we need to do 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.120
 return to start the server and go to yourself 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.850
 maykravta we slept about this some 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.700
 incomprehensible island let's prescribe gay 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.890
 mod 1 and build something in order 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.040
 so for clarity so let's 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.190
 let's build somebody just incomprehensible 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:03.310
 anything red so we can 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:05.140
 then see in principle and it will come down 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.000
 let's add more to understand all this 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.000
 let's say green 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.650
 so that it was bulk and everything and now 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.680
 we need to enter a command called 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.269
 one magician forrender and he starts 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.410
 render our world and he will render 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.810
 just show the part that 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.860
 we got it right here 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.430
 this island 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.019
 and where was the hour before and as you can see 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.630
 here he writes that we are in the process of this 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.459
 it turns out right now it is a flat world renders and 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.420
 that is, the top view you will only 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.959
 flat space see all the blocks in 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.280
 principle, this render quickly passes 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.959
 more pass much different render 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.850
 which is called su space this 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.880
 get render 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.250
 exactly the three-dimensional view that is how 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.900
 you saw here on this picture now you 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.840
 now and wait a bit so she all 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.510
 trends once and in general how you see 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.150
 carefully wrote the render of world fashion 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.739
 In principle, our map is supposed to 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.250
 be ready and now move on 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:12.540
 link go to lokalkhost 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:17.260
 8 and in how we changed ne-8 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.989
 124 well according to the standard goes 1238 123 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.430
 but we are at 4 and now something we will 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.979
 because most likely you will see this 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.000
 2D map view from above as you can see 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.770
 on the quality of textures and wait on top 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.590
 very well seen because put 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.740
 this value in the settings so on y 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.090
 us here 2 pro sleeping piece of plot there 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.310
 where apparently for the first time have slept 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.410
 there are some such flaws sharp 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.420
 lines okay, this happens next we 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.220
 can go to the three-dimensional view we will 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.530
 all see a three-dimensional view of how his 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.630
 here the pieces of the world are circumcised because he 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.220
 not glorified and let him go on 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.780
 the place where we are now that is 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.330
 this is this island as you can see all 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.790
 very excellent quality everything is visible and 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.710
 mine is very very cool here that 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.840
 also such a piece as you can see 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.310
 she looks all can increase there 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.990
 let the ducks then houses incomprehensible but 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.570
 when the increase has come down of course the quality 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.950
 pictures but not directly much worse 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.600
 but still a little worse but everything 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.600
 equals very cool it all looks 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.480
 the plugin is very, very interesting will 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.830
 what is the world and little slept 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.590
 have you got a big server with 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.500
 the big world what it says there 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.940
 in general there will be a very big world and 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.710
 tom will be a lot of interesting fucking 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.190
 there is almost no building on this map 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.419
 in general, there is still one kind of world 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.850
 us Kiev world 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.229
 it can be disabled at construction sites but I 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.180
 didn't do that because i like 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.090
 what it looks like i am just for you what 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.620
 show this mapping of underground caves 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.570
 how the video is delivered in our region 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.220
 I remember such caves here 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.910
 even under us somewhere there is a reason 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.360
 dig we'll see it don't know it 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.979
 probably even cheater looks like 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.690
 It is very unlikely to have someone this special will 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.740
 use but still it is such 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.620
 a small plus to somewhere here should 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.040
 be a cave but find her probably the most 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.680
 easy task 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.760
 and we found her but somewhere sheâ€™s about 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.520
 below us I do not know how it is like that 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:18.340
 understand so well let's let's dig 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:20.650
 any side but dad we found 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.810
 the cave which was well though rather all 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.550
 it may not be the case where we are 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.320
 so once the cave who wanted to go 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.180
 we found here a cave let's say 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.010
 way but it's still not the easiest 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.690
 image well and as you see here's a class here 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.970
 this map of caves is very, very cool 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.060
 the video is done but so that's traced 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.140
 every bering can be seen and can even be on it 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.740
 be guided if you are allowed 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.720
 got lost 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.670
 This of course a bit cheater on but all 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.800
 as if it were not very big 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.810
 familiar orphan class looks like this 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.790
 very very cool i like it and in 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.500
 In general, here's a plug-in genma pet 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.180
 Basically the basic settings here are what 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.610
 if you want to know more detailed 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.130
 settings go to minecraft here this 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.930
 a link 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.760
 Wikipedia you throw off here and in more detail 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.990
 settings but in general then again 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.420
 I remind you that this plugin works 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.040
 only open port or if it will 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.930
 closed port will only see this 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.610
 card you other no one will see and 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.800
 such a cool plugin 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:15.120
 subscribe put likes I hope 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.120
 someone was useful in general then
