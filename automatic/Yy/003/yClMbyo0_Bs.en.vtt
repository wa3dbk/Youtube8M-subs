like a dark dark iced tea I suppose is
the<00:02:32.010> best<00:02:32.220> way<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.370> describe<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:36.079> let's<00:02:37.079> give

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the best way to describe it let's give

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.000 
the best way to describe it let's give
this<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.379> try

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
this a try

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.820 
this a try
the<00:02:38.219> monster<00:02:38.849> rehab

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830

anyways<00:02:45.080> let's<00:02:45.350> give<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.650> try<00:02:45.860> find<00:02:46.400> out

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
anyways let's give this a try find out

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:56.500 
anyways let's give this a try find out
what<00:02:46.760> it's<00:02:46.910> like<00:02:54.040> hmm<00:02:55.040> that's<00:02:55.250> nice<00:02:55.550> it's<00:02:56.330> not

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
what it's like hmm that's nice it's not

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.780 
what it's like hmm that's nice it's not
carbonated<00:02:57.170> which<00:02:57.950> generally<00:02:58.460> with<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.640> a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
carbonated which generally with the a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.970 
carbonated which generally with the a
lot<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.240> these<00:02:59.330> monster<00:02:59.780> rehab<00:03:00.590> drinks<00:03:00.860> them

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
lot of these monster rehab drinks them

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.080 
lot of these monster rehab drinks them
tend<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.280> be<00:03:01.340> carbonated<00:03:01.910> anyways<00:03:04.090> it's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
tend to be carbonated anyways it's

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.750 
tend to be carbonated anyways it's
almost<00:03:05.240> like<00:03:05.390> an<00:03:05.510> orange<00:03:05.660> punch<00:03:05.990> I<00:03:06.760> don't

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
almost like an orange punch I don't

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.510 
almost like an orange punch I don't
taste<00:03:07.910> any<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.210> the<00:03:08.420> energy<00:03:09.160> ingredients<00:03:10.160> that

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
taste any of the energy ingredients that

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.150 
taste any of the energy ingredients that
is<00:03:10.760> usually<00:03:10.970> found<00:03:11.600> on<00:03:11.960> energy<00:03:12.410> drinks<00:03:12.710> so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
is usually found on energy drinks so

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.750 
is usually found on energy drinks so
that's<00:03:13.310> always<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.670> plus<00:03:13.910> as<00:03:14.240> well<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:15.760> suppose

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
that's always a plus as well I suppose

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.560 
that's always a plus as well I suppose
also<00:03:17.060> by<00:03:17.360> some<00:03:17.660> stretch<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:19.340> comparison<00:03:20.030> it

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
also by some stretch of a comparison it

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.420 
also by some stretch of a comparison it
kind<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.230> also<00:03:21.440> tastes<00:03:21.860> like<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.100> orange

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
kind of also tastes like the orange

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.610 
kind of also tastes like the orange
drink<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:22.970> get<00:03:23.090> at<00:03:23.209> McDonald's<00:03:23.300> is<00:03:23.900> that

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
drink that you get at McDonald's is that

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.350 
drink that you get at McDonald's is that
a<00:03:24.650> really<00:03:24.860> good<00:03:25.070> example<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.700> be<00:03:25.790> using<00:03:26.090> spot

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
a really good example to be using spot

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.110 
a really good example to be using spot
probably<00:03:26.870> not<00:03:27.170> but<00:03:27.950> that's<00:03:28.010> all<00:03:28.400> spot<00:03:28.760> has<00:03:28.940> to

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
probably not but that's all spot has to

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.510 
probably not but that's all spot has to
work<00:03:29.270> with<00:03:29.450> right<00:03:29.750> about<00:03:29.990> now<00:03:30.170> it's<00:03:30.520> actually

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
work with right about now it's actually

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.280 
work with right about now it's actually
quite<00:03:31.760> nice<00:03:31.910> it's<00:03:32.300> not<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:32.750> much<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:33.140> would<00:03:33.260> say

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
quite nice it's not so much I would say

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.680 
quite nice it's not so much I would say
in<00:03:33.560> orange<00:03:33.920> juice<00:03:34.400> as<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:35.300> tastes<00:03:35.450> more<00:03:35.630> like

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
in orange juice as it tastes more like

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.410 
in orange juice as it tastes more like
just<00:03:36.050> an<00:03:36.200> orange<00:03:36.560> drink<00:03:37.190> perhaps<00:03:37.910> also

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
just an orange drink perhaps also

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.960 
just an orange drink perhaps also
similar<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.140> Sunny<00:03:39.560> D<00:03:39.920> it'd<00:03:40.459> be<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.760> that

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
similar to a Sunny D it'd be that that

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.610 
similar to a Sunny D it'd be that that
doesn't<00:03:41.300> have<00:03:41.450> as<00:03:41.540> much<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.930> tang<00:03:42.350> and

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
doesn't have as much of the tang and

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.460 
doesn't have as much of the tang and
taste<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.570> but<00:03:44.570> overall<00:03:44.810> it's<00:03:45.110> actually

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
taste to it but overall it's actually

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.370 
taste to it but overall it's actually
pretty<00:03:45.800> good<00:03:46.040> indeed<00:03:47.019> this<00:03:48.019> would<00:03:48.170> be<00:03:48.260> ideal

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380
