 now that my epr cream is frozen 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.490
 to attack chocolate I'm going 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.490

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.430
 I have my first puff pastry 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.820

 in that I am but watch out if I 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.780
 will leave two inches free 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.820

 on it's time to put the bean 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.580
 and then you have to put it on the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.960
 so we will have less chance of 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.350
 to fall on when cutting the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.049
