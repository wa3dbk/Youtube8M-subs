00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.320 

okay<00:00:01.920> we're<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.939> look<00:00:03.030> at<00:00:03.179> how<00:00:03.270> to

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
okay we're going to look at how to

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.390 
okay we're going to look at how to
multiply<00:00:03.689> mixed<00:00:04.080> numbers<00:00:04.259> now<00:00:04.920> what<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.279> mean

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
multiply mixed numbers now what we mean

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.670 
multiply mixed numbers now what we mean
by<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:06.060> what<00:00:06.660> if<00:00:06.810> we<00:00:06.899> had<00:00:07.049> three<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
by that is what if we had three and a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.020 
by that is what if we had three and a
half<00:00:08.480> multiplied<00:00:09.480> by<00:00:10.050> four<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.429> quarter

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
half multiplied by four and a quarter

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.580 
half multiplied by four and a quarter
let's<00:00:12.420> just<00:00:12.599> keep<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.870> numbers<00:00:13.200> nice<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
let's just keep the numbers nice and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.709 
let's just keep the numbers nice and
easy<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.370> we<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.849> understand<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
easy so that it we can understand the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.870 
easy so that it we can understand the
method<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.320> then<00:00:16.890> once<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.490> know<00:00:17.580> how<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.730> do

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
method and then once you know how to do

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.179 
method and then once you know how to do
the<00:00:18.000> method<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.990> use<00:00:19.020> harder<00:00:19.800> numbers

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the method you can use harder numbers

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.540 
the method you can use harder numbers
and<00:00:20.570> just<00:00:21.570> do<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> same<00:00:22.050> way<00:00:22.250> now<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.430> you

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
and just do it the same way now if you

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
and just do it the same way now if you
haven't<00:00:23.730> done<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> watch<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> video<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
haven't done the watch the video and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.410 
haven't done the watch the video and
either<00:00:25.590> converting<00:00:26.250> mixed<00:00:27.029> numbers<00:00:27.390> to

either converting mixed numbers to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.660 
either converting mixed numbers to
top-heavy<00:00:27.810> fractions<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.670> multiplying

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
top-heavy fractions or multiplying

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
top-heavy fractions or multiplying
fractions<00:00:29.970> then<00:00:30.570> please<00:00:30.869> go<00:00:31.050> watch<00:00:31.199> those

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
fractions then please go watch those

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.340 
fractions then please go watch those
videos<00:00:31.439> first<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.719> if<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.750> think<00:00:34.020> you're<00:00:34.260> okay

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
videos first or if you think you're okay

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.979 
videos first or if you think you're okay
with<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.030> follow<00:00:36.329> along<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.750> me

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
with this then just follow along with me

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.740 
with this then just follow along with me
work<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.200> me<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> harder<00:00:38.879> work<00:00:39.480> now

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
work with me this is a harder work now

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.770 
work with me this is a harder work now
right<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.000> you've<00:00:42.090> got<00:00:42.210> three<00:00:42.510> halves

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
right so if you've got three halves

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.319 
right so if you've got three halves
times<00:00:43.620> by<00:00:43.860> four<00:00:44.190> quarters<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:44.760> three<00:00:45.090> halves

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
times by four quarters or three halves

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930 
times by four quarters or three halves
of<00:00:45.570> four<00:00:46.020> quarters<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.309> first<00:00:47.610> thing<00:00:47.850> we

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
of four quarters the first thing we

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
of four quarters the first thing we
recommend<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.870> convert<00:00:49.469> them<00:00:49.680> both<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
recommend you do is convert them both to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.880 
recommend you do is convert them both to
top-heavy<00:00:50.670> fractions<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.230> three<00:00:52.440> twos<00:00:52.620> are

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
top-heavy fractions so three twos are

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.910 
top-heavy fractions so three twos are
six<00:00:53.129> plus<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> top<00:00:54.710> seven<00:00:55.710> halves

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
six plus the one on the top seven halves

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.099 
six plus the one on the top seven halves
this<00:00:56.550> fractions<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> same<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.660> expressed

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
this fractions the same just expressed

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.619 
this fractions the same just expressed
in<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> different<00:00:58.649> way<00:00:58.770> four<00:00:59.489> quarters<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.449> four

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
in a different way four quarters or four

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.929 
in a different way four quarters or four
four<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> sixteen<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.309> top<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:03.080> 17

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
four to sixteen at the one on top is 17

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.429 
four to sixteen at the one on top is 17
quarters<00:01:06.710> now<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.950> more<00:01:08.040> multiplying<00:01:09.439> we

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
quarters now one more multiplying we

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.289 
quarters now one more multiplying we
have<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> multiply<00:01:11.369> fractions<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
have to multiply fractions we have to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.969 
have to multiply fractions we have to
multiply<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> denominators<00:01:13.409> together<00:01:13.530> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
multiply the denominators together and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
multiply the denominators together and
the<00:01:14.159> numerators<00:01:14.670> together<00:01:14.820> we've<00:01:15.570> looked<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the numerators together we've looked to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
the numerators together we've looked to
see<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.530> stage<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.830> anything<00:01:17.100> cancels

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
see at this stage of anything cancels

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.210 
see at this stage of anything cancels
and<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> can't<00:01:18.259> that's<00:01:19.259> explained<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and it can't that's explained it on the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.039 
and it can't that's explained it on the
other<00:01:20.400> video<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.299> now<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> do

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
other video so now we just have to do

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.539 
other video so now we just have to do
the<00:01:22.140> multiplication<00:01:22.369> two<00:01:23.369> fours<00:01:23.640> are<00:01:24.020> eight

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
the multiplication two fours are eight

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.700 
the multiplication two fours are eight
now<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.119> can't<00:01:27.390> work<00:01:27.540> out<00:01:27.780> seven<00:01:28.200> lots<00:01:28.560> of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
now if you can't work out seven lots of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.060 
now if you can't work out seven lots of
17<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.579> 17<00:01:29.790> lots<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.479> seven<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.110> head<00:01:31.350> then

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
17 or 17 lots of seven in your head then

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.280 
17 or 17 lots of seven in your head then
you<00:01:32.100> need<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> use<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.540> grid<00:01:33.720> method<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you need to use the grid method and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.789 
you need to use the grid method and
there's<00:01:34.860> nothing<00:01:35.189> wrong<00:01:35.400> doing<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.799> it's

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
there's nothing wrong doing that it's

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.310 
there's nothing wrong doing that it's
better<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.400> check<00:01:39.119> rather<00:01:39.659> than<00:01:39.960> guess

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
better that you check rather than guess

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.080 
better that you check rather than guess
and<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> wrong<00:01:41.310> okay<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:43.140> we've<00:01:43.290> got<00:01:43.320> here

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
and get it wrong okay so we've got here

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:54.410 
and get it wrong okay so we've got here
10<00:01:45.090> +<00:01:45.329> 7<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.810> 17<00:01:46.500> x<00:01:47.540> 7<00:01:48.540> +<00:01:50.149> 7<00:01:51.149> sevens<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.810> 49<00:01:53.420> 7

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
10 + 7 is 17 x 7 + 7 sevens are 49 7

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.560 
10 + 7 is 17 x 7 + 7 sevens are 49 7
times<00:01:54.659> by<00:01:54.899> 10<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.409> 70<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:57.020> then<00:01:58.020> we've<00:01:58.200> got<00:01:58.460> 70<00:02:00.979> +

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
times by 10 is 70 so then we've got 70 +

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.630 
times by 10 is 70 so then we've got 70 +
49

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
49

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.869 
49
so<00:02:05.640> 9s<00:02:06.000> go<00:02:06.119> into<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:07.500> notice<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.950> 9<00:02:08.160> +<00:02:08.429> 0

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
so 9s go into and now notice like 9 + 0

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.720 
so 9s go into and now notice like 9 + 0
is<00:02:09.090> 9<00:02:09.360> +<00:02:09.629> 7<00:02:10.349> plus<00:02:10.860> 4<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.520> 11

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
is 9 + 7 plus 4 is 11

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.289 
is 9 + 7 plus 4 is 11
so<00:02:14.730> there's<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.239> hundred<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.519> nineteen<00:02:17.519> over

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
so there's a hundred and nineteen over

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:26.839 
so there's a hundred and nineteen over
eight<00:02:20.780> okay<00:02:22.700> now<00:02:23.750> how<00:02:24.750> many<00:02:25.549> eighths<00:02:26.549> are

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
eight okay now how many eighths are

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.030 
eight okay now how many eighths are
there<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.299> 119<00:02:28.109> because<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:28.620> you're<00:02:28.739> given

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
there in 119 because if you're given

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.800 
there in 119 because if you're given
being<00:02:29.280> given<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.670> question<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.269> a<00:02:30.329> mixed

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
being given the question as a mixed

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.170 
being given the question as a mixed
number<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.500> probably<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> good<00:02:32.250> idea<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:33.030> give

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
number it's probably a good idea to give

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
number it's probably a good idea to give
the<00:02:33.329> answer<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> mixed<00:02:34.049> number<00:02:34.319> if<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.189> is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the answer as a mixed number if this is

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.020 
the answer as a mixed number if this is
an<00:02:35.430> exam

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
an exam

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.670 
an exam
you've<00:02:36.329> probably<00:02:36.540> got<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.139> utmost<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
you've probably got the utmost of the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.229 
you've probably got the utmost of the
marks<00:02:37.950> by<00:02:38.099> now<00:02:38.280> but<00:02:38.489> it's<00:02:38.700> not<00:02:38.849> just<00:02:39.030> about

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
marks by now but it's not just about

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.149 
marks by now but it's not just about
getting<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.659> ready<00:02:39.750> for<00:02:39.870> exams<00:02:40.079> we<00:02:40.920> need<00:02:41.069> to

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
getting you ready for exams we need to

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.949 
getting you ready for exams we need to
give<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> answers<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.209> correct<00:02:42.480> way<00:02:42.569> and

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
give the answers in the correct way and

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.780 
give the answers in the correct way and
it's<00:02:43.319> probably<00:02:43.560> easier<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.069> understand<00:02:44.489> mixed

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
it's probably easier to understand mixed

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.259 
it's probably easier to understand mixed
numbers<00:02:45.090> anyway<00:02:45.889> okay<00:02:46.889> so<00:02:47.120> we're<00:02:48.120> going<00:02:48.209> to

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
numbers anyway okay so we're going to

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.509 
numbers anyway okay so we're going to
look<00:02:48.389> into<00:02:48.750> how<00:02:49.260> many<00:02:49.500> 8-step<00:02:50.340> are<00:02:50.549> in<00:02:51.409> 119<00:02:52.519> now

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
look into how many 8-step are in 119 now

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.830 
look into how many 8-step are in 119 now
there's<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.819> couple<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.150> methods<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.689> go

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
there's a couple of methods you can go

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.050 
there's a couple of methods you can go
up<00:02:55.049> you're<00:02:55.230> eight<00:02:55.349> times<00:02:55.650> table<00:02:56.189> or<00:02:56.639> you<00:02:56.909> could

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
up you're eight times table or you could

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.819 
up you're eight times table or you could
start<00:02:57.299> at<00:02:57.480> 80<00:02:57.689> because<00:02:58.260> that's<00:02:58.439> your<00:02:58.560> tenth

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
start at 80 because that's your tenth

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.929 
start at 80 because that's your tenth
and<00:02:59.099> add<00:02:59.189> on<00:02:59.310> eight<00:02:59.549> each<00:02:59.730> time<00:03:00.919> okay<00:03:01.939> but

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
and add on eight each time okay but

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.490 
and add on eight each time okay but
that's<00:03:03.060> probably<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.810> harder<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.349> two

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
that's probably the harder of the two

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.890 
that's probably the harder of the two
methods<00:03:04.889> because<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.879> just<00:03:06.000> takes<00:03:06.180> longer<00:03:06.719> and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
methods because it just takes longer and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.860 
methods because it just takes longer and
remember<00:03:07.859> fractions<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.639> division<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.569> we<00:03:09.599> can

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
remember fractions of division so we can

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.099 
remember fractions of division so we can
say<00:03:10.079> how<00:03:10.469> many<00:03:10.650> eighths<00:03:10.919> go<00:03:11.549> into<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.269> hundred

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
say how many eighths go into a hundred

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.250 
say how many eighths go into a hundred
and<00:03:13.290> nineteen<00:03:14.510> okay<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.689> then<00:03:15.810> following<00:03:16.109> a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
and nineteen okay and then following a

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.670 
and nineteen okay and then following a
method<00:03:16.579> how<00:03:17.579> many<00:03:17.810> there's<00:03:18.810> none<00:03:19.019> in<00:03:19.169> one<00:03:19.440> so

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
method how many there's none in one so

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.649 
method how many there's none in one so
we<00:03:19.799> carry<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.250> one<00:03:20.430> into<00:03:20.699> eleven<00:03:21.030> how<00:03:21.510> many

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
we carry that one into eleven how many

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.869 
we carry that one into eleven how many
eighths<00:03:21.870> are<00:03:22.109> though<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.379> eleven<00:03:22.879> well

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
eighths are though in eleven well

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.909 
eighths are though in eleven well
there's<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.090> whole<00:03:24.389> one<00:03:24.659> and<00:03:25.400> what's<00:03:26.400> left<00:03:26.669> over

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
there's a whole one and what's left over

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:34.369 
there's a whole one and what's left over
nine<00:03:28.919> ten<00:03:29.280> eleven<00:03:29.729> three<00:03:32.780> okay<00:03:33.780> how<00:03:34.169> many

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
nine ten eleven three okay how many

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.289 
nine ten eleven three okay how many
eighths<00:03:34.470> are<00:03:34.709> there<00:03:34.829> in<00:03:34.919> 39<00:03:35.579> now<00:03:35.819> if<00:03:36.150> you're

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
eighths are there in 39 now if you're

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.330 
eighths are there in 39 now if you're
not<00:03:36.419> sure<00:03:36.919> right<00:03:37.919> amount<00:03:38.250> 8<00:03:38.629> 16<00:03:39.629> 24<00:03:40.439> and<00:03:40.949> again

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
not sure right amount 8 16 24 and again

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.099 
not sure right amount 8 16 24 and again
it's<00:03:41.489> better<00:03:41.639> that<00:03:41.759> you<00:03:42.379> thirty<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:44.780> forty<00:03:45.780> so

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
it's better that you thirty to forty so

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.659 
it's better that you thirty to forty so
it's<00:03:46.229> better<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.859> actually<00:03:47.069> work<00:03:47.459> it

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
it's better that you actually work it

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.399 
it's better that you actually work it
out<00:03:47.790> then<00:03:48.030> guess<00:03:48.359> there's<00:03:48.870> no<00:03:48.989> marks<00:03:49.259> for

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
out then guess there's no marks for

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.929 
out then guess there's no marks for
guessing<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.979> if<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.430> don't<00:03:50.639> know<00:03:50.759> you<00:03:50.819> eight

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
guessing and if you don't know you eight

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.640 
guessing and if you don't know you eight
times<00:03:51.180> table<00:03:51.569> be<00:03:51.659> honest<00:03:51.959> with<00:03:52.109> yourself<00:03:52.470> or

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
times table be honest with yourself or

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.409 
times table be honest with yourself or
so<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:52.949> wasn't<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> screen<00:03:53.639> be<00:03:54.060> honest

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
so it wasn't on the screen be honest

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:55.640 
so it wasn't on the screen be honest
with<00:03:54.540> yourself<00:03:54.629> write<00:03:55.139> them<00:03:55.290> out<00:03:55.379> here<00:03:55.590> they

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
with yourself write them out here they

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.939 
with yourself write them out here they
are<00:03:55.769> look<00:03:55.889> 8<00:03:56.099> 16<00:03:56.639> 24<00:03:57.000> 32<00:03:57.150> 40<00:03:57.629> anyone<00:03:58.560> eight<00:03:58.769> each

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
are look 8 16 24 32 40 anyone eight each

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.259 
are look 8 16 24 32 40 anyone eight each
time<00:03:59.930> now<00:04:00.930> 32<00:04:01.889> so<00:04:02.280> that's<00:04:02.459> four<00:04:02.939> so<00:04:03.209> there's

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
time now 32 so that's four so there's

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:09.909 
time now 32 so that's four so there's
four<00:04:03.629> whole<00:04:03.870> ones<00:04:04.139> and<00:04:05.299> what's<00:04:06.299> left<00:04:06.509> over<00:04:07.459> its

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
four whole ones and what's left over its

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.819 
four whole ones and what's left over its
732<00:04:10.919> difference<00:04:11.790> between<00:04:11.970> 39<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.419> 37<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.709> it's

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
732 difference between 39 and 37 so it's

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.089 
732 difference between 39 and 37 so it's
14<00:04:14.220> whole<00:04:14.400> ones<00:04:14.669> plus<00:04:15.090> 7<00:04:15.449> left<00:04:15.599> over<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.979> it's

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
14 whole ones plus 7 left over so it's

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.599 
14 whole ones plus 7 left over so it's
14<00:04:17.579> whole<00:04:17.880> ones<00:04:18.180> now<00:04:19.049> in<00:04:19.380> when<00:04:20.280> you're<00:04:20.400> younger

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
14 whole ones now in when you're younger

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.769 
14 whole ones now in when you're younger
you<00:04:20.880> might<00:04:21.060> have<00:04:21.209> got<00:04:21.329> away<00:04:21.419> with<00:04:21.510> saying

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:21.779 
you might have got away with saying

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:26.030 
you might have got away with saying
remainder<00:04:22.349> 7<00:04:22.849> now<00:04:24.050> now<00:04:25.050> will<00:04:25.229> you

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
remainder 7 now now will you

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.640 
remainder 7 now now will you
in<00:04:26.130> looking<00:04:27.060> at<00:04:27.120> GCSE<00:04:27.600> what<00:04:28.230> other<00:04:28.380> women

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
in looking at GCSE what other women

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.350 
in looking at GCSE what other women
writing<00:04:28.950> remainder<00:04:29.370> seven<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:30.060> can<00:04:30.240> write

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
writing remainder seven you can write

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.960 
writing remainder seven you can write
that<00:04:30.480> as<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.630> fraction<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.560> that's<00:04:31.710> seven<00:04:32.160> over

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
that as a fraction so that's seven over

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.250 
that as a fraction so that's seven over
eight<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:34.410> 14<00:04:34.950> and<00:04:35.130> 7/8<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.750> remainder

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
eight so 14 and 7/8 so the remainder

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.160 
eight so 14 and 7/8 so the remainder
divided<00:04:37.830> over<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.280> top<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.580> this<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:39.170> is

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
divided over the top of this this is

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.960 
divided over the top of this this is
your<00:04:40.260> numerator<00:04:40.650> this<00:04:41.250> user<00:04:41.460> denominator

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
your numerator this user denominator

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.390 
your numerator this user denominator
will<00:04:42.630> give<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:42.870> your<00:04:43.050> answer<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.100> final

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
will give you your answer so the final

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.710 
will give you your answer so the final
answer<00:04:44.430> is<00:04:44.730> 14<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.560> 7/8<00:04:46.560> if<00:04:47.550> you're<00:04:48.540> working

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
answer is 14 and 7/8 if you're working

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.330 
answer is 14 and 7/8 if you're working
in<00:04:48.840> decimals<00:04:49.350> we<00:04:49.470> were<00:04:49.590> asked<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.920> I'll<00:04:50.070> give

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
in decimals we were asked to I'll give

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.310 
in decimals we were asked to I'll give
this<00:04:50.460> question<00:04:50.790> as<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.940> fraction<00:04:51.330> if<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.930> asked

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
this question as a fraction if you asked

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.170 
this question as a fraction if you asked
to<00:04:52.530> work<00:04:52.680> in<00:04:52.830> decimals<00:04:53.310> then<00:04:53.760> this<00:04:53.910> is<00:04:54.030> when

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
to work in decimals then this is when

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.960 
to work in decimals then this is when
you<00:04:54.330> would<00:04:54.420> actually<00:04:54.750> write<00:04:55.020> 7<00:04:55.830> here<00:04:56.730> and

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
you would actually write 7 here and

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.610 
you would actually write 7 here and
carry<00:04:57.420> on<00:04:57.600> from<00:04:57.630> there<00:04:58.050> but<00:04:58.260> we're<00:04:58.590> not

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
carry on from there but we're not

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.800 
carry on from there but we're not
working<00:04:59.130> in<00:04:59.220> fractions<00:04:59.700> so<00:05:00.210> it's<00:05:00.330> good<00:05:00.510> tip

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
working in fractions so it's good tip

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.150 
working in fractions so it's good tip
that<00:05:01.230> when<00:05:01.350> you're<00:05:01.470> actually<00:05:01.620> doing<00:05:01.920> division

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
that when you're actually doing division

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.890 
that when you're actually doing division
and<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.550> mind<00:05:03.330> if<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.540> answers<00:05:03.810> in

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
and that mind if the answers in

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.960 
and that mind if the answers in
fractions<00:05:04.380> whatever<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.250> remainder<00:05:05.550> is<00:05:05.820> when

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
fractions whatever the remainder is when

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.760 
fractions whatever the remainder is when
you<00:05:06.060> get<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.360> this<00:05:06.510> point<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:07.020> can<00:05:07.380> write<00:05:07.530> over

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
you get to this point you can write over

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.650 
you get to this point you can write over
the<00:05:07.920> thing<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.280> were<00:05:08.370> devising<00:05:08.670> by<00:05:09.000> dividing

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
the thing you were devising by dividing

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.920 
the thing you were devising by dividing
by<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.430> you've<00:05:11.430> got<00:05:11.700> an<00:05:11.880> answer<00:05:12.060> expressed<00:05:12.750> as

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
by and you've got an answer expressed as

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.310 
by and you've got an answer expressed as
fractions<00:05:15.440> so<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.910> harder<00:05:17.910> bigger<00:05:18.660> numbers<00:05:19.170> if

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
fractions so a harder bigger numbers if

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.060 
fractions so a harder bigger numbers if
they<00:05:19.350> don't<00:05:19.620> cancel<00:05:19.890> but<00:05:21.230> it<00:05:22.230> builds<00:05:22.770> on<00:05:22.890> all

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
they don't cancel but it builds on all

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.620 
they don't cancel but it builds on all
the<00:05:23.340> building<00:05:23.700> blocks<00:05:23.910> that<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.150> should<00:05:24.450> have

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
the building blocks that you should have

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.920 
the building blocks that you should have
so<00:05:24.840> far<00:05:25.140> on<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.710> other<00:05:25.890> videos<00:05:26.570> now<00:05:27.570> try<00:05:27.870> some

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
so far on the other videos now try some

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.770 
so far on the other videos now try some
and<00:05:28.350> if<00:05:29.070> you<00:05:29.550> can't<00:05:29.820> do<00:05:30.000> them<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.360> you<00:05:30.630> can

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
and if you can't do them and you can

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.480 
and if you can't do them and you can
always<00:05:30.900> check<00:05:31.230> by<00:05:31.440> using<00:05:31.620> your<00:05:31.770> calculator<00:05:32.010> by

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
always check by using your calculator by

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
always check by using your calculator by
the<00:05:32.550> way<00:05:32.730> see<00:05:32.790> if<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.030> get<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.270> correct

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
the way see if you get the correct

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.690 
the way see if you get the correct
answer<00:05:33.630> and<00:05:34.080> if<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.650> can't<00:05:34.950> do<00:05:35.100> them<00:05:35.280> then

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
answer and if you can't do them then

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.050 
answer and if you can't do them then
come<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.390> ask<00:05:36.600> for<00:05:36.870> help
