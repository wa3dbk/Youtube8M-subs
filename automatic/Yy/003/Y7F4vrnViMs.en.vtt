00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.080
 they are a good time today 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.690
 we will consider the control system 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.710
 tire pressure from a reputable company 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
 whistler 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.609
 namely pressure control system in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.890
 tires Hitler ts 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.619
 104 rubles I think to list the merits 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.869
 and it does not make sense but for those who still 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.429
 not yet aware of using the sensor 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.009
 tire pressure monitoring system can be 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.770
 reduce fuel consumption reduce risk 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.620
 when driving and accordingly extend 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.469
 the life of your tires well, what now 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 let's go through the configuration and so 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.899
 complete set of pressure control system 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.840
 whistler's tire consists of 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.289
 warranty card 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.289
 user manual 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.469
 non-slip mat 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.469
 the device itself 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.730
 pressure indicator 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.430
 you can pay attention to what he 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.430
 size is very small compact 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:23.670
 batteries for gum sensors for 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.670
 sensor wrench fixing sensor machine 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.420
 cigarette lighter power device and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.550
 the sensors themselves 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.850
 notice the sensors on them 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.660
 indicated the letter p p p p p p p that is 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.369
 sensor installation on the front right 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.940
 front left rear right rear 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.270
 left 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.920
 and now let's consider in more detail 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.050
 What are these sensors in the room? 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.140
 and so are the sensors 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.330
 look like this sit safely 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.650
 on the wheel will not be anything podtravlivaet 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.220
 all the manufacturer has provided 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.220
 two-part constant 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.720
 remove the cap and put the battery 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.380
 which is included and everything 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.270
 actually the cottage is ready to work 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.930
 well now let's see how 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.340
 the system works if you can 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.770
 self-install 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.780
 system if rts 104 rub 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.430
 full installation of sensors and receiver 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.380
 device will not take you much time 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.780
 and will not require any special 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.240
 knowledge wireless sensors and receivers 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.410
 jack up display is designed considering 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.080
 the possibilities of their easy and fast 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.210
 driver installation will appreciate 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.770
 possibility to have one set of sensors 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.260
 which can be used on several 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.210
 tire set also if you 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.280
 exploit several cars you 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.740
 can quickly rearrange the system with 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.110
 one on the other after installation 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.770
 sensors according to the instructions you can 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.530
 see the real picture of what is happening 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:06.550
 the image you see on the display 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.370
 This data shows sensors and 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.140
 it is displayed in pounds per square 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.400
 inch and all familiar and native bars 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.240
 here you can see the picture and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.710
 accordingly increase any less 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.560
 pressure in your wheels if pressure 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.270
 jumping increases or decreases 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.260
 the system alerts you with a beep 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:36.090
 indicator display to this way 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.530
 looks like a 14-disc sensor 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.960
 I never needed balancing 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.610
 but on the site the same tip posterity 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.590
 rights on 13 disks after installation 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.870
 sensors needed balancing when 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.990
 speeds of 100 doses to the subway per hour 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.390
 beat the wheel I had nothing like that 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:01.030
 like I think that many of the same 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.440
 because the sensors are light 10 grams 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.440
 will not play a big role
