00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.060 

we<00:01:00.620> shut<00:01:00.829> these<00:01:00.980> doors<00:01:01.219> shut<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:01.969> looks<00:01:02.210> like

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.410 

awesome<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:07.360> back

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:23.830 

and<00:01:13.750> then<00:01:13.930> down<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.290> other<00:01:14.380> side

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:37.020 

as<00:01:24.290> tank

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.490 

to<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.120> front<00:01:38.410> go<00:01:39.410> check<00:01:39.950> out<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:41.500> show

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
to the front go check out that show

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.990 
to the front go check out that show
everybody<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:42.800> rest<00:01:43.130> again<00:01:43.430> one<00:01:43.610> more<00:01:43.730> times

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
everybody that rest again one more times

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.390 
everybody that rest again one more times
I<00:01:44.240> think<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.600> probably<00:01:45.070> concerns<00:01:46.070> people

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
I think that probably concerns people

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.770 
I think that probably concerns people
the<00:01:46.640> most<00:01:46.820> but<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.420> don't<00:01:49.540> doesn't<00:01:50.540> seem<00:01:50.660> like

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
the most but I don't doesn't seem like

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.630 
the most but I don't doesn't seem like
it<00:01:50.870> has<00:01:50.900> that<00:01:51.170> much<00:01:51.320> roast<00:01:51.620> on<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.920> me<00:01:52.040> there's

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
it has that much roast on to me there's

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.780 
it has that much roast on to me there's
that<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.300> there's<00:01:53.510> that<00:01:53.600> mark<00:01:53.870> right<00:01:54.080> there

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
that so there's that mark right there

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.590 
that so there's that mark right there
there's<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:55.970> piece<00:01:56.930> right<00:01:56.960> there<00:01:57.369> and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
there's that piece right there and

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.570 
there's that piece right there and
there's<00:01:59.600> another<00:02:00.170> yeah<00:02:01.070> that's<00:02:01.310> right<00:02:01.430> in

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
there's another yeah that's right in

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.609 
there's another yeah that's right in
here

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
here

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.400 
here
that's<00:02:03.619> right<00:02:03.800> here<00:02:04.040> I<00:02:04.570> guess<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.810> could<00:02:06.200> be<00:02:06.380> a

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
that's right here I guess it could be a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.460 
that's right here I guess it could be a
little<00:02:06.560> bit<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:07.929> this<00:02:08.929> sounds<00:02:09.200> like<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.350> little

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
little bit of this sounds like a little

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.140 
little bit of this sounds like a little
bit<00:02:09.679> maybe<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.310> little<00:02:10.399> bit<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.670> rust<00:02:10.820> in<00:02:10.970> there

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
bit maybe a little bit of rust in there

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.729 
bit maybe a little bit of rust in there
a<00:02:12.640> little<00:02:13.640> big<00:02:13.820> deal<00:02:14.000> there<00:02:16.900> let's<00:02:17.900> see<00:02:18.140> what

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
a little big deal there let's see what

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:29.920 
a little big deal there let's see what
else<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:26.440> kind<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.500> get<00:02:27.620> an<00:02:27.709> idea<00:02:28.540> gas<00:02:29.540> tank

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
else this kind of get an idea gas tank

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:39.630 
else this kind of get an idea gas tank
anything<00:02:30.500> there<00:02:32.980> let<00:02:33.980> me<00:02:34.070> start<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.430> up

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.110 

there's<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.790> choke

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
there's the choke

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:56.420 
there's the choke
down<00:02:43.110> here<00:02:44.810> here<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:48.980> start<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.040> up<00:02:55.220> side<00:02:56.220> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
down here here and start it up side of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.559 
down here here and start it up side of
her

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569
