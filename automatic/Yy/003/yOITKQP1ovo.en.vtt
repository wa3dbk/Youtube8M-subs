00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
reflect what the capes material was in
the<00:01:32.520> movie<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.000> good<00:01:33.299> job<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.750> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the movie so good job on that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.140 
the movie so good job on that
the<00:01:35.070> sculpt<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> bat<00:01:35.729> suit<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.030> actually

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the sculpt on the bat suit is actually

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.580 
the sculpt on the bat suit is actually
pretty<00:01:36.509> good<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> way<00:01:37.439> they

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
pretty good I really like the way they

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.649 
pretty good I really like the way they
captured<00:01:37.979> his<00:01:38.159> boots<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.299> think<00:01:39.479> there's<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
captured his boots and I think there's a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.090 
captured his boots and I think there's a
lot<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> good<00:01:39.960> little<00:01:40.110> details<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.590> his<00:01:40.740> belt

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
lot of good little details in his belt

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
lot of good little details in his belt
and<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.790> chest<00:01:42.060> looks<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.479> good<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.840> be

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and the chest looks really good just be

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.240 
and the chest looks really good just be
on<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> lookout<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.439> where<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> bat<00:01:43.979> symbol

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
on the lookout for where the bat symbol

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
on the lookout for where the bat symbol
connects<00:01:45.119> into<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> chest<00:01:45.720> cuz<00:01:46.170> that's<00:01:46.320> how

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
connects into the chest cuz that's how

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
connects into the chest cuz that's how
it's<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.680> attached<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.280> there's<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it's like attached and there's like a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.069 
it's like attached and there's like a
gap<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> figures<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
gap on some of the figures so be on the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
gap on some of the figures so be on the
lookout<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.350> too<00:01:49.560> big<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> gap<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.729> this

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
lookout for too big of a gap but this

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
lookout for too big of a gap but this
head<00:01:51.320> I<00:01:52.320> don't<00:01:52.829> even<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.159> where<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> begin

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
head I don't even know where to begin

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.219 
head I don't even know where to begin
with<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.939> head<00:01:54.119> sculpt<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.720> first<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.200> all

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
with this head sculpt it first of all

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.800 
with this head sculpt it first of all
his<00:01:55.380> eyes<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.890> resting<00:01:56.280> too<00:01:56.460> low<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:57.060> his<00:01:57.509> face

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
his eyes are resting too low on his face

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.800 
his eyes are resting too low on his face
I<00:01:58.799> guess<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.820> kind<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.119> got<00:02:00.240> Keynes<00:02:00.509> mouth

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
I guess they kind of got Keynes mouth

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.510 
I guess they kind of got Keynes mouth
but<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.619> honest<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:02.040> not<00:02:02.100> even<00:02:02.399> really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
but to be honest I'm not even really

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.459 
but to be honest I'm not even really
sure<00:02:02.640> what<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> hello<00:02:03.149> I'm<00:02:03.240> looking<00:02:03.479> at<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:04.320> uh

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
sure what I hello I'm looking at it's uh

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.089 
sure what I hello I'm looking at it's uh
I<00:02:05.189> think<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:05.939> got<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> eyebrows<00:02:06.570> right<00:02:07.099> and

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
I think they got the eyebrows right and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.529 
I think they got the eyebrows right and
that's<00:02:08.280> about<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.149> really<00:02:09.390> did

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that's about it is that they really did

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.220 
that's about it is that they really did
capture<00:02:09.750> his<00:02:10.020> eyebrows<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.039> just

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
capture his eyebrows but this is just

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.380 
capture his eyebrows but this is just
very<00:02:12.800> not<00:02:13.099> impressive<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.610> me<00:02:13.760> I've<00:02:14.090> been<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.360> a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
very not impressive to me I've been to a

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.210 
very not impressive to me I've been to a
couple<00:02:14.690> toys<00:02:14.900> Russ's<00:02:15.380> which<00:02:15.620> varied<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.010> price

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
couple toys Russ's which varied in price

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.210 
couple toys Russ's which varied in price
between<00:02:16.370> 1499<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.420> 1099<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.860> target<00:02:19.190> that

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
between 1499 and 1099 and a target that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.940 
between 1499 and 1099 and a target that
had<00:02:19.400> them<00:02:19.489> for<00:02:19.640> $9.99<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:21.260> wouldn't<00:02:21.860> say

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
had them for $9.99 and I wouldn't say

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.350 
had them for $9.99 and I wouldn't say
it's<00:02:22.069> worth<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.400> at<00:02:22.489> all<00:02:22.610> but<00:02:22.849> that's<00:02:22.910> just<00:02:23.120> me

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
it's worth it at all but that's just me

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.360 
it's worth it at all but that's just me
he<00:02:23.900> also<00:02:24.050> comes<00:02:24.290> with<00:02:24.380> his<00:02:24.530> grapple<00:02:24.920> gun<00:02:25.040> which

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
he also comes with his grapple gun which

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.520 
he also comes with his grapple gun which
when<00:02:25.700> it's<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> packaging<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.930> kind<00:02:27.410> of

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
when it's in the packaging is kind of

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.140 
when it's in the packaging is kind of
wedged<00:02:28.040> between<00:02:28.310> these<00:02:28.550> two<00:02:28.700> holes<00:02:28.910> which

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
wedged between these two holes which

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.670 
wedged between these two holes which
causes<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.690> be<00:02:29.780> kind<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.050> bent<00:02:30.350> when<00:02:30.590> you

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
causes it to be kind of bent when you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
causes it to be kind of bent when you
pull<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:30.950> out<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.190> packaging<00:02:31.489> which<00:02:31.640> is

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
pull it out of the packaging which is

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
pull it out of the packaging which is
kind<00:02:31.819> of<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.940> bummer<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.330> made<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.690> very

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
kind of a bummer it's made of a very

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.309 
kind of a bummer it's made of a very
soft<00:02:33.100> rubber<00:02:34.100> but<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.360> does<00:02:35.569> fit<00:02:35.870> into<00:02:36.110> his

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
soft rubber but it does fit into his

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.250 
soft rubber but it does fit into his
hand<00:02:36.650> rather<00:02:37.069> well<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.840> forgot<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.170> mention

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
hand rather well and I forgot to mention

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.800 
hand rather well and I forgot to mention
that<00:02:39.590> one<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.400> hinges<00:02:40.580> he<00:02:40.790> has<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.269> his

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
that one of the hinges he has is his

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.590 
that one of the hinges he has is his
legs<00:02:42.140> can<00:02:42.349> swing<00:02:42.680> out<00:02:42.890> from<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.400> side<00:02:43.610> but

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
legs can swing out from the side but

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.880 
legs can swing out from the side but
taking<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> look<00:02:45.019> at<00:02:45.110> this<00:02:45.200> figure<00:02:45.440> has<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> hole

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
taking a look at this figure has a hole

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.250 
taking a look at this figure has a hole
in<00:02:46.069> just<00:02:46.190> thing<00:02:46.280> at<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.489> head<00:02:47.019> man<00:02:48.019> look<00:02:48.200> at

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
in just thing at the head man look at

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.330 
in just thing at the head man look at
the<00:02:48.350> head<00:02:48.470> sculpt<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.860> don't<00:02:49.010> even<00:02:49.100> know<00:02:49.220> what

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
the head sculpt I don't even know what

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.370 
the head sculpt I don't even know what
the<00:02:49.430> hell<00:02:49.580> I'm<00:02:49.700> looking<00:02:49.970> at<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.350> a

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
the hell I'm looking at this is a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.440 
the hell I'm looking at this is a
variant<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.610> it's<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.910> little<00:02:53.030> bit<00:02:53.180> harder<00:02:53.420> to

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
variant so it's a little bit harder to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.330 
variant so it's a little bit harder to
find<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.900> other<00:02:54.019> Batman<00:02:54.290> figures<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.010> as

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
find on the other Batman figures and as

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.610 
find on the other Batman figures and as
a<00:02:55.370> variant<00:02:55.819> I'm<00:02:56.630> not<00:02:56.840> very<00:02:57.110> happy<00:02:57.319> with<00:02:57.560> it

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
a variant I'm not very happy with it
