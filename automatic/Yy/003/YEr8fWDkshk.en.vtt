yeah it's a basically obviously we've
got<00:00:45.520> multiple<00:00:45.700> sets<00:00:46.030> of<00:00:46.120> dampers<00:00:46.420> per<00:00:46.630> car

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
got multiple sets of dampers per car

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.130 
got multiple sets of dampers per car
lots<00:00:48.910> of<00:00:49.120> different<00:00:49.390> specs<00:00:49.660> for<00:00:49.870> different

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
lots of different specs for different

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.819 
lots of different specs for different
circuits<00:00:50.590> that<00:00:50.800> that<00:00:51.489> we're<00:00:51.610> racing<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.090> so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
circuits that that we're racing it so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.590 
circuits that that we're racing it so
generally<00:00:53.829> what<00:00:53.950> happens<00:00:54.010> is<00:00:54.489> post-event<00:00:55.030> you

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
guys are pretty hard on the equipment so

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.340 
guys are pretty hard on the equipment so
we<00:00:57.670> have<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.390> pull<00:00:58.570> them<00:00:58.750> out<00:00:58.870> we<00:00:59.110> have<00:00:59.230> to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
we have to pull them out we have to

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.530 
we have to pull them out we have to
check<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.590> make<00:00:59.710> sure<00:00:59.860> they<00:01:00.340> haven't<00:01:00.940> drifted

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
check to make sure they haven't drifted

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.189 
check to make sure they haven't drifted
be<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.800> they're<00:01:03.010> all<00:01:03.160> still<00:01:03.750> reliable<00:01:04.750> and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
be that they're all still reliable and

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.039 
be that they're all still reliable and
straight<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.939> then<00:01:07.090> stay<00:01:07.420> on<00:01:07.539> top<00:01:07.719> of<00:01:07.750> the

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
racing australia's the drivers are

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.390 
racing australia's the drivers are
pretty<00:01:17.409> rough<00:01:17.619> on<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.920> equipment<00:01:18.100> every

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
pretty rough on the equipment every

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.820 
pretty rough on the equipment every
departments<00:01:18.909> actually<00:01:19.180> said<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.740> know

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
departments actually said that you know

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.320 
departments actually said that you know
so<00:01:21.040> saying<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.520> about<00:01:21.729> how<00:01:22.000> many<00:01:22.180> hours

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
so saying that about how many hours

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.240 
so saying that about how many hours
would<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.750> take<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:22.960> basically<00:01:23.770> service<00:01:24.189> a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
would it take to basically service a

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.800 
would it take to basically service a
damper<00:01:24.580> from<00:01:24.760> from<00:01:25.000> nothing<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:27.510> when<00:01:28.510> we<00:01:28.659> come

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
damper from from nothing so when we come

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.520 
damper from from nothing so when we come
to<00:01:29.080> doing<00:01:29.500> doing<00:01:30.369> a<00:01:30.430> full<00:01:30.610> strip<00:01:30.880> down<00:01:31.060> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
to doing doing a full strip down and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.649 
to doing doing a full strip down and
rebuild<00:01:32.530> it's<00:01:33.189> basically<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.909> whole<00:01:34.119> day<00:01:34.360> /

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
rebuild it's basically a whole day /

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.870 
rebuild it's basically a whole day /
damper<00:01:35.170> this<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.040> a<00:01:36.070> fair<00:01:36.340> bit<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.549> them

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
damper this is a fair bit to them

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.179 
damper this is a fair bit to them
obviously<00:01:37.750> with<00:01:37.900> testing<00:01:38.320> on<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.500> dyno<00:01:38.740> as

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
obviously with testing on the dyno as

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.300 
obviously with testing on the dyno as
well<00:01:39.759> as<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.869> know<00:01:40.900> measuring<00:01:41.590> make<00:01:42.130> sure

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
well as you know measuring make sure

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.070 
well as you know measuring make sure
everything's<00:01:42.580> within<00:01:42.729> tolerance<00:01:43.299> you<00:01:44.020> know

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
everything's within tolerance you know

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.539 
everything's within tolerance you know
do<00:01:44.290> we<00:01:44.380> continue<00:01:44.590> using<00:01:44.830> this<00:01:45.040> part<00:01:45.310> we've

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
do we continue using this part we've

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.950 
do we continue using this part we've
been<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.820> we<00:01:45.970> put<00:01:46.060> another<00:01:46.270> party<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:46.810> so

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
been it we put another party and so

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.620 
been it we put another party and so
forth<00:01:47.229> like<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.409> so<00:01:48.150> it's<00:01:49.150> generally<00:01:49.509> about

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
forth like that so it's generally about

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.440 
forth like that so it's generally about
full<00:01:49.990> day<00:01:50.200> for<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.650> damper<00:01:51.040> overhaul<00:01:51.820> it's

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
full day for a damper overhaul it's

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.060 
full day for a damper overhaul it's
absolutely<00:01:52.540> crazy<00:01:53.020> sometimes<00:01:53.560> we<00:01:53.829> only<00:01:53.950> got

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
absolutely crazy sometimes we only got

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.160 
absolutely crazy sometimes we only got
two<00:01:54.250> weeks<00:01:54.430> between<00:01:54.700> two<00:01:55.420> right<00:01:55.630> between

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
two weeks between two right between

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.560 
two weeks between two right between
races<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.490> do<00:01:57.579> notice<00:01:57.909> actually<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.390> bags

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
races so I do notice actually the bags

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.510 
races so I do notice actually the bags
under<00:01:58.900> your<00:01:58.960> eyes<00:01:59.049> do<00:01:59.770> appear<00:02:00.130> when<00:02:00.340> now

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
under your eyes do appear when now

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.520 
under your eyes do appear when now
there's<00:02:00.790> only<00:02:00.850> two<00:02:01.119> weeks<00:02:01.270> so<00:02:01.540> thank<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:02.350> very

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
there's only two weeks so thank you very

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.840 
there's only two weeks so thank you very
much<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.860> insight<00:02:03.189> on<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.759> I<00:02:03.820> know

you're very busy so thanks for giving us
a<00:02:05.439> timeout<00:02:05.649> now<00:02:06.340> we're<00:02:06.490> going<00:02:06.579> to<00:02:06.670> go<00:02:06.759> over<00:02:06.790> the

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
a timeout now we're going to go over the

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:07.920 
a timeout now we're going to go over the
other<00:02:07.090> side<00:02:07.149> of<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.390> room<00:02:07.479> we're<00:02:07.689> going<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.869> go

other side of the room we're going to go

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.259 
other side of the room we're going to go
chat<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.289> Jonesy<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:09.340> basically<00:02:09.909> see

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
chat to Jonesy and and basically see

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.300 
chat to Jonesy and and basically see
what<00:02:10.390> he<00:02:10.509> does<00:02:10.659> in<00:02:10.810> sub-assembly

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.320 

here<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:17.430> are<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> other<00:02:18.000> side<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.270> the

here we are on the other side of the
room<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.810> room<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:19.110> actually<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:19.530> big<00:02:19.770> that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
room the room is actually so big that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.470 
room the room is actually so big that
about<00:02:20.130> enough<00:02:20.340> time<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.700> get<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.850> haircut<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
about enough time to get a haircut and

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.120 
about enough time to get a haircut and
you<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> show<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.320> we're<00:02:22.800> back<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.070> with

out the time to have a chat to us so
today<00:02:27.780> we're<00:02:27.960> in<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> sub-assembly<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.860> uses

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
today we're in the sub-assembly and uses

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.440 
today we're in the sub-assembly and uses
your<00:02:29.640> department<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.150> head<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.360> this

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
your department the head of this

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.840 
your department the head of this
department<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.800> who<00:02:32.100> better<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.400> talk<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
department so who better to talk to the

department so who better to talk to the
new<00:02:32.970> about<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.510> um<00:02:33.690> gives<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.350> bit<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.500> an

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
new about it but um gives a bit of an

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.770 
new about it but um gives a bit of an
idea<00:02:34.770> what<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.520> guys<00:02:35.670> doing<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.240> sub-assembly

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
idea what you guys doing in sub-assembly

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.530 
idea what you guys doing in sub-assembly
we<00:02:37.650> basically<00:02:38.070> service<00:02:38.820> everything<00:02:39.270> from<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
we basically service everything from the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.430 
we basically service everything from the
driveline<00:02:39.780> back<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.560> uprights<00:02:41.520> rear<00:02:42.030> hubs

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
driveline back so uprights rear hubs

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.670 
driveline back so uprights rear hubs
tail<00:02:43.440> shaft<00:02:43.800> gearboxes<00:02:44.700> diffs<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.170> get<00:02:46.470> at

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
tail shaft gearboxes diffs so get at

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.470 
tail shaft gearboxes diffs so get at
clutches<00:02:47.190> yes<00:02:47.520> everything<00:02:48.000> from<00:02:48.330> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
clutches yes everything from the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.960 
clutches yes everything from the
flywheel<00:02:49.230> back<00:02:49.410> basically<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:50.100> nice<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:50.760> when<00:02:50.910> I

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
flywheel back basically a nice so when I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.580 
flywheel back basically a nice so when I
can't<00:02:51.180> get<00:02:51.300> up<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.420> line<00:02:51.660> it's<00:02:51.990> generally<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
can't get up the line it's generally the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.110 
can't get up the line it's generally the
clutch<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> issue<00:02:53.340> not<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:53.910> much<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
clutch is the issue not so much the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.430 
clutch is the issue not so much the
drive<00:02:54.330> it's<00:02:54.510> never<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> driver's<00:02:55.170> fault<00:02:55.290> in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
drive it's never the driver's fault in

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.800 
drive it's never the driver's fault in
the<00:02:55.530> driver's<00:02:55.860> handbook<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.700> yeah<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.690> how

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the driver's handbook so yeah so how

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.210 
the driver's handbook so yeah so how
many<00:02:57.870> how<00:02:58.080> many<00:02:58.140> hours<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.650> pre-taped<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
many how many hours is a pre-taped I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.190 
many how many hours is a pre-taped I
guess<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.670> do<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> clutch<00:03:00.360> for<00:03:00.540> instance<00:03:00.810> um

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
guess to do a clutch for instance um

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.930 
guess to do a clutch for instance um
clutches<00:03:01.830> are<00:03:01.920> quite<00:03:02.070> easy<00:03:02.310> there<00:03:02.610> they're

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
clutches are quite easy there they're

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.730 
clutches are quite easy there they're
sort<00:03:03.270> of<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.390> an<00:03:03.630> hour<00:03:03.780> turnaround<00:03:04.410> they're

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
sort of like an hour turnaround they're

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.650 
sort of like an hour turnaround they're
not<00:03:04.830> too<00:03:04.980> bad<00:03:05.210> basically<00:03:06.210> how<00:03:06.300> long<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.570> you

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
not too bad basically how long have you

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.600 
not too bad basically how long have you
been<00:03:06.690> involved<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.890> racing<00:03:08.130> and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
been involved with the racing and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.630 
been involved with the racing and
sub-assembly<00:03:09.180> being<00:03:10.050> here<00:03:10.320> since<00:03:10.650> fpr

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
sub-assembly being here since fpr

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.330 
sub-assembly being here since fpr
started<00:03:12.240> back<00:03:12.630> in<00:03:12.660> dandenong<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.950> think

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
started back in dandenong so I think

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.580 
started back in dandenong so I think
that's<00:03:14.520> 2003<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.720> from<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:17.239> being<00:03:18.239> in<00:03:18.590> 15

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
that's 2003 so from then and being in 15

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.560 
that's 2003 so from then and being in 15
years<00:03:19.770> in<00:03:20.010> motorsport<00:03:20.489> yeah<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.180> what<00:03:21.330> keeps

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
years in motorsport yeah so what keeps

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.490 
years in motorsport yeah so what keeps
bringing<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.900> back<00:03:21.989> yea<00:03:22.709> year<00:03:23.040> after<00:03:23.310> year<00:03:23.420> um

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
bringing you back yea year after year um

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.199 
bringing you back yea year after year um
that's<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.890> passion<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.580> guess<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.090> make
