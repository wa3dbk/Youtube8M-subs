00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:25.500

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.510
 here but at the request of her here we are going here 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.300
 what are you only stables very big 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.780
 that is because as you see but 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 so much of the stable and 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.079
 reward there is a new size and here 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:54.960

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:59.100
 and I eat Odessa rozman so here of course 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:05.670
 so very sweet there are doors here 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.159
 sit on the doors of all of them they did so 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.869
 doors on the lock 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.320
 also there is a door there. 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.939
 they close and you will not become a lock 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.780
 cool 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:29.689
 feeder but the tone of work is shorter okay here 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.689
 Such a lock opens well then 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.420
 to keep fit and halter and this 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.280
 simply 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:44.030
 this is such a very nice visit 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.430
 did the work this tree that's how it is 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.640
 as if there is a fireplace made everything altogether 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.399
 plastics it's all about saving here's a goal 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.399

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.579
 such dice stables do not sit on q &amp; a here 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.450
 each end summed up this thing 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.910

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.130

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.400

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.379
 There is with accessories for you here 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.280
 these if without that, that is more accurate, that's what I 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:14.919
 I say these, these, these are even a stable 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.699
 which has no accessories carrot me 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:24.970

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.090
 do it yourself who can't do it right away 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.639
 that I even had a nightmare I owe 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.280

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:44.130
 that this is all just fall apart like 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:48.479
 happened to me here then that is still in 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:52.690
 of course because the address is grayish things with 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:56.940
 they also cling to the corrals here 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:02.260

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.949
 verke 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.490

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:17.050
