Chronos<00:00:19.340> energy<00:00:19.759> they<00:00:20.210> have<00:00:20.390> got<00:00:20.599> a<00:00:20.810> truly<00:00:21.380> new

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
Chronos energy they have got a truly new

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.310 
Chronos energy they have got a truly new
and<00:00:22.099> novel<00:00:22.310> concept<00:00:23.029> you<00:00:23.450> have<00:00:23.480> to<00:00:23.869> check<00:00:24.140> out

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
and novel concept you have to check out

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.040 
and novel concept you have to check out
so<00:00:25.009> John<00:00:25.250> tell<00:00:25.430> me<00:00:25.579> how<00:00:25.820> does<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.090> work<00:00:26.270> it's<00:00:26.869> a

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
so John tell me how does it work it's a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.769 
so John tell me how does it work it's a
