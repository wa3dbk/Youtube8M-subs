00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 please calabrese is the croquette 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.550
 rice before loved but not only 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.590
 rice because apart from the rice that already 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.170
 we have boiled it is the same as 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.089
 we use for chicken sautéing and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.710
 previously boiled rice that I told you 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.170
 that you can store it in the refrigerator 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.449
 even for a week we made a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.580
 base so it's not just rice and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.580
 here in these arts we sauté a lot 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.949
 amount of leek onion and bacon 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.800
 then imagine the leek and the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.430
 bacon is a delight a thing of the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.550
 fungus 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.360
 then to that sauté of res pect 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.430
 leek bacon and onion we add the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.140
 rice previously boiled a rice that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 had cooked with a broth or a little 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.250
 of boiling water with salt nothing but 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.250
 this then now what we have to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.860
 to do is mix rice with that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.320
 garrison then delivers here I think 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.350
 that with that is enough on the other hand 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.840
 apart from mixing it, you are logically a 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.670
 plenty of hot oil to go 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.309
 heating to generate a good 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.450
 writing all this rice mixed with 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.789
 the bacon 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.579
 if you have time and desire and I 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.219
 pancetta fan sear podés 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.619
 beforehand in another frying pan appointment grab the 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.390
 small short shovel and with its own 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.090
 Greasy de das heat and you give time 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.679
 soft soft not to burn but it is 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.789
 crocanti I know that he wants as if he were 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.819
 pork rind 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.460
 then the excess fat eliminates it 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:32.460
 there to have the recipe to take notes and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.100
 you have that base this small 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.049
 bacon bits there 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060
 it is then all mixed well 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.740
 mixed and we have to make a paste 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.110
 to fry that is a fred paste for 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.090
 Fry a similar mixture when you put on 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.670
 to make pancakes this takes eggs 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.149
 Whole takes flour and carries milk 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.220
 then we are putting in the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.860
 preparation of rice with bacon 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.069
 leeks and onion in our pasta for 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.840
 fry this is called so the pasta for 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:06.319
 frying is in all the classic books 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.319
 as open bach pasta true 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.489
 the ballad the pasta for very fast action 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.280
 then we mix well come they go 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.349
 adorned should be the rice with that 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.880
 pasta to fry the very good I'll 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.680
 I associate with childhood where I 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.080
 I associate with every day I am a great 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.530
 Buñuelos diner among other things 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530
 as you can see 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.660
 there is clear this is a kind of 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.300
 conclave we define gastronomic and 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.090
 gerard I do not love bacon 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.819
 leek and of course the donut that acs 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.220
 then this cake that I do today 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.590
 with this good, this will take you to the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.780
 fry then after having 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.569
 martyred the lord of sound with the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.330
 tap I'm going to the fry I need 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.640
 a spoon and I need good oil 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.470
 hot like clear lime oil 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.000
 before you have to prove how the oil is 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.000
 then I'm going to throw a grain of rice 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.260
 you see that it makes a good bubble but 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.330
 less is going to bank well to our 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.330
 I think that tapas with salt 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.490
 you do not have to die from a colander this 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.500
 kind of colander that is called spider for 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.930
 then lift the bun once 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.480
 is well fried let's put another one to 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.490
 This is really delicious and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.150
 I do not ask how many they are but 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.970
 that they go out like that because I do not 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.800
 like very hot juanito is true 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.810
 just like the very hot pie 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.240
 It does not go because if it's not like it saturates you 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.670
 and I prefer that they are warm and there 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.500
 inside and inside and inside are not like 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.290
 French fries 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.000
 for not being able to stop and you can do 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.560
 rice fritters like in this case well 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.150
 seasoned with the bacon with the 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.540
 leek with the onion and others too 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.540
 you can do it 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.630
 and if you happen to insist that paella 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.430
 of pork that there is and you have left and it is not 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.460
 to repeat the same movie at 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.020
 next day that rice paella or that 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.360
 sautéed chicken with rice what 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.489
 chicken transforms that's also a 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.180
 Good characteristic of donuts is 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.340
 a little bit that food of the rejunte 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.380
 and then explain how they are giving 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.570
 maggiolo of aubergines will be able to know 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.539
 what do you think, look how super? 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.360
 inflated super suplen there is one thing 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.600
 I forgot to tell him that he must beko 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.970
 this seasoning the pasta for frying 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.780
 this pasta for frying whole eggs 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.400
 of flour and milk you have to put 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.259
 you have to put salt of the video by 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.330
 pepper because if you do not like it 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.180
 nothing as you do the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.160
 buñuelos has to fish and get this one 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.169
 supernatant or what is going 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.840
 detaching and going to look for it there 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.520
 he will make it clear so he does not leave 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.620
 burning in bali as cleaning the 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.199
 oil and so I'm doing another 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.050
 pretty more together is a salad 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:07.180
 anything from tomatito of course 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.770
 of green greens that are allowed and 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.590
 then it convinces you about 4 or 5 points 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.000
 with a salad and you're done but 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:19.640
 you know you're done 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.790
 a king who controls the oil that is not 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.160
 temperature pass so you do not have 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.830
 thermometer turns on the off that there is not 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.660
 a too excessive bubble and that 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.790
 go generating 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.560
 then the little buñuelitos that immediately 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.310
 takes in contact with the temperature of the 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.990
 oil are taking shape 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.110
 a wonder look how they are 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.720
 great then you let them cool and 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.590
 you pass it through a paper drainer 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.700
 absorbent and you're putting it in our 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.860
 preparation if you want with a little bit of 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.750
 tomato so you have a little bit of 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.470
 colour 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:59.570
 about 456 or a thousand more so we're not going to the 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.000
 cut and then we come back but you do not 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.040
 forget that we have ximena with his plan 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.410
 weekly food do not forget it 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.150
 because it is already fair to give you everything 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.270
 everything you have to give yourself in a 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.840
 minute let's go 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.650
 [Music] 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.199
 of all 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.199
 this star that feels the day
