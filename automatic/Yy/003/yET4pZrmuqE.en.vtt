00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
it's a lot easier and I really like how

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.550 
it's a lot easier and I really like how
the<00:01:56.460> bullet<00:01:56.789> drops<00:01:57.119> over<00:01:57.539> like<00:01:57.750> over<00:01:58.170> distance

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the bullet drops over like over distance

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.170 
the bullet drops over like over distance
and<00:01:59.750> some<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.810> those<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.439> leather<00:02:02.180> something

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and some of those that leather something

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.820 
and some of those that leather something
else<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.720> cool<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.289> can<00:02:04.560> give<00:02:04.710> yourself

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
else that is cool you can give yourself

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.229 
else that is cool you can give yourself
a<00:02:05.220> mo<00:02:05.690> so<00:02:06.770> it's<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:07.979> quite<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.459> cheap<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:08.970> like

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
a mo so it's not quite as cheap as like

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.990 
a mo so it's not quite as cheap as like
one<00:02:10.140> man<00:02:10.350> army<00:02:10.590> noobtube<00:02:11.190> across<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> map<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
one man army noobtube across the map and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.780 
one man army noobtube across the map and
your<00:02:15.000> buddies<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.810> actually<00:02:16.260> get<00:02:16.590> ammo<00:02:17.160> from

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
your buddies can actually get ammo from

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.870 
your buddies can actually get ammo from
you<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.769> like<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:20.130> gives<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.400> lots<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.700> points

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
you and like it gives you lots of points

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.460 
you and like it gives you lots of points
so<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.569> think<00:02:21.720> that's<00:02:21.959> pretty<00:02:22.170> cool<00:02:24.319> I'm<00:02:25.319> not

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
so I think that's pretty cool I'm not

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.880 
so I think that's pretty cool I'm not
exactly<00:02:25.769> sure<00:02:25.950> how<00:02:26.489> many<00:02:26.549> my<00:02:26.880> how<00:02:27.390> many

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.370 
what's going on and everything so like
this<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.430> squad<00:02:41.910> spawn<00:02:42.359> so<00:02:43.140> like

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
this is like you can squad spawn so like

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.770 
this is like you can squad spawn so like
you<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> squad<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.130> four<00:02:44.549> people<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.020 

pretty<00:02:48.780> much<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.709> spawn<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.700> them

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
pretty much you just spawn on them

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.330 
pretty much you just spawn on them
wherever<00:02:51.390> they<00:02:51.570> are<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.260> can<00:02:52.440> spawn<00:02:52.739> right

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
wherever they are you can spawn right

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.819 
wherever they are you can spawn right
behind<00:02:53.579> them<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.170> like<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.380> really<00:02:55.620> good

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
behind them and like it's really good

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.349 
behind them and like it's really good
like<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.840> some<00:02:57.840> ways<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.579> it's<00:02:59.579> also<00:02:59.790> really

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
like in some ways but it's also really

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.630 
like in some ways but it's also really
bad<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.959> other<00:03:01.109> ways<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.920> bad<00:03:02.070> ways<00:03:02.370> is

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
bad in other ways like the bad ways is

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.599 
bad in other ways like the bad ways is
that<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:04.019> might<00:03:04.200> not<00:03:04.350> see<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:05.370> they're

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
that you might not see that they're

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.039 
that you might not see that they're
about<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.940> get<00:03:06.060> killed<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.570> then<00:03:06.900> you'll

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
about to get killed and then you'll

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.830 
about to get killed and then you'll
spawn<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.680> then<00:03:07.769> you'll<00:03:07.920> get<00:03:08.190> killed<00:03:08.370> as<00:03:08.579> well

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
spawn and then you'll get killed as well

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.240 
spawn and then you'll get killed as well
so<00:03:09.840> that's<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.470> really<00:03:10.500> big<00:03:11.250> drawback<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:13.250> two

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
so that's a really big drawback to two

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.090 
so that's a really big drawback to two
squad<00:03:14.609> spawning

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
squad spawning

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.350 
squad spawning
um<00:03:16.600> and<00:03:17.600> yeah<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:19.340> there<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:19.850> actually

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
um and yeah and there is actually

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.710 
um and yeah and there is actually
regeneration<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.710> health<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.490> this<00:03:22.880> game<00:03:23.090> it

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
regeneration of health in this game it

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.980 
regeneration of health in this game it
wasn't<00:03:24.020> like<00:03:24.080> that<00:03:24.140> in<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.470> first<00:03:24.710> game<00:03:25.990> you

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
wasn't like that in the first game you

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.080 
wasn't like that in the first game you
had<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.320> get<00:03:27.770> like<00:03:27.950> health<00:03:28.340> packs<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.880> stuff

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
had to get like health packs and stuff

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.760 
had to get like health packs and stuff
but<00:03:29.270> they<00:03:29.420> do<00:03:29.480> still<00:03:29.900> have<00:03:29.930> health<00:03:30.320> packs<00:03:30.590> in

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
but they do still have health packs in

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.500 
but they do still have health packs in
this<00:03:30.920> game<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:33.170> comes<00:03:33.590> in<00:03:33.770> handy<00:03:33.980> for<00:03:34.510> for

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
this game and it comes in handy for for

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.370 
this game and it comes in handy for for
hardcode<00:03:36.010> hardcore<00:03:37.010> mode<00:03:37.810> which<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:38.840> very

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
hardcode hardcore mode which is very

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.980 
hardcode hardcore mode which is very
similar<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.890> call<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.250> duty<00:03:40.520> like<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.870> don't

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
similar to call of duty like you don't

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.980 
similar to call of duty like you don't
have<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:42.170> map<00:03:42.500> um<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:44.180> less<00:03:44.920> health<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.990> there

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
have a map um it's less health and there

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.750 
have a map um it's less health and there
is<00:03:48.170> no<00:03:48.470> regeneration<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.490> health<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:51.260> yeah

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
is no regeneration of health so yeah

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.100 
is no regeneration of health so yeah
there<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.820> go<00:03:52.850> that's<00:03:53.270> that's<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.960> end<00:03:54.080> of

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
there you go that's that's the end of

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.740
