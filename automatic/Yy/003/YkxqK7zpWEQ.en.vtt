00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 pandy on the background of the loud premieres 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.200
 days almost went unnoticed alone 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.880
 interesting idea which may in the future 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920
 seriously affect the market 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.900
 smart phone inventor from 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 Netherlands Dave Hawkins suggested 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.599
 ageless modular smartphone 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.210
 phoneblocks 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.010
 the idea is just the phone consists of a single 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 base boards that connect 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 different modules depending on 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.130
 user needs and amount 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.260
 which he is willing to pay all these 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.240
 modules have their sizes and can 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.340
 idea to connect to any place on 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.829
 the dress of which the user makes 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 a kind of mazoku for example you need 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.610
 smartphone for various expeditions in 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.649
 wild nature you can choose 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
 small cheap and economical option 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.120
 and on the other side of the device to connect 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.820
 giant battery back from hike 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.920
 changed the screen to a more expensive battery 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 put less free space 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 take for example additional memory 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.300
 or camera or more powerful graphics card 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.609
 for games the beauty of what is developing 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.890
 modules on the idea will take third-party 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.500
 manufacturers and if ideas will find 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.570
 incarnation will open the so-called block 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.799
 star there you can buy any 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.439
 modules as from the most famous 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.810
 manufacturers for example a sony camera or 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.310
 display sharp so from ubiquitous 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.439
 Chinese factories nouneym 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.330
 accordingly, they will be constantly 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.549
 be updated so if your screen 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.560
 out of date there will be no need to buy 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.290
 a whole smartphone is enough to replace 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.450
 the display of course is still only a concept 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.460
 having a lot of pitfalls 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.040
 at least somewhere must live 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.200
 OS means central board 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.090
 must contain its own chipset 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.520
 which will still be fast 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.060
 become obsolete and after it the operating room 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.549
 system 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.710
 so not everything is so smooth however the idea 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.869
 worth it to at least try 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.909
 Hawkins is not trying to raise money for 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.100
 organization of own production 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.860
 he is trying to find partners who 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.960
 would make his idea a reality therefore 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.149
 asks for popular support in social 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.979
 networks and at the end of October will begin 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.180
 massive advertising campaign through 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.180
 account and your subscriber
