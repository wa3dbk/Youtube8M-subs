accurate<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.320> my<00:01:31.439> opinion<00:01:31.829> maybe<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.340> just

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
accurate in my opinion maybe it's just

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.899 
accurate in my opinion maybe it's just
me<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.299> honestly<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.590> using<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.700> iron

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
me but I honestly like using the iron

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.340 
me but I honestly like using the iron
sights<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.509> weapon<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.049> than<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
sights on this weapon more than the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.990 
sights on this weapon more than the
scope<00:01:37.590> which<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.920> can't<00:01:38.189> really<00:01:38.310> say<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.579> many

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
scope which I can't really say for many

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120 
scope which I can't really say for many
weapons<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> game<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.560> weapon<00:01:40.950> is

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
weapons in the game so this weapon is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
weapons in the game so this weapon is
very<00:01:41.280> good<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.210> iron<00:01:42.420> sights<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.930> you're

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
very good for iron sights if you're

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.240 
very good for iron sights if you're
going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.350> first-person<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.009> weapon

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
going to be in first-person this weapon

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.770 
going to be in first-person this weapon
isn't<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.579> bad<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.000> problem<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
isn't all that bad the problem with the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.990 
isn't all that bad the problem with the
honor<00:01:45.930> sights<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.409> because<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> fov<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
honor sights is because of the fov and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.730 
honor sights is because of the fov and
first-person<00:01:48.329> kind<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.380> hard<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.560> actually

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
first-person kind of hard to actually

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
first-person kind of hard to actually
see<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.340> iron<00:01:50.490> sights<00:01:50.790> they're<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.720> close

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
see the iron sights they're not up close

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.740 
see the iron sights they're not up close
to<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.820> also<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> weapon<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.450> quite

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
to you and also the weapon is quite

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.539 
to you and also the weapon is quite
bulky<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.320> first-person<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
bulky and first-person so you have to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.219 
bulky and first-person so you have to
get<00:01:56.670> used<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.479> overall<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.869> really

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
get used to that but overall I really

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.350 
get used to that but overall I really
like<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> honor<00:01:58.740> sights<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.430> overall<00:01:59.909> this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
like the honor sights so overall this

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.859 
like the honor sights so overall this
weapon<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.070> okay<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.240> great

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
weapon is okay but it's not great

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.810 
weapon is okay but it's not great
especially<00:02:04.530> compared<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> combat<00:02:05.520> mg

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
especially compared to the combat mg

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.340 
especially compared to the combat mg
which<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.149> will<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.630> talking<00:02:06.810> about<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
which we will be talking about in the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740 
which we will be talking about in the
next<00:02:07.380> episode<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.160> series<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:09.030> okay<00:02:09.450> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
next episode in this series it's okay it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.600 
next episode in this series it's okay it
can<00:02:10.349> get<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> job<00:02:10.800> done<00:02:11.009> especially<00:02:11.459> with

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
can get the job done especially with

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.309 
can get the job done especially with
that<00:02:11.730> recent<00:02:12.120> buff<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.690> which<00:02:12.870> makes<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
that recent buff to it which makes it

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.880 
that recent buff to it which makes it
have<00:02:13.440> four

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
have four

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.040 
have four
damage<00:02:14.250> per<00:02:14.430> shot<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.510> weapon<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
damage per shot so on this weapon the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.220 
damage per shot so on this weapon the
spread<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:17.000> 5.50<00:02:18.000> which<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.810> accuracy

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
spread is 5.50 which is the accuracy

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.170 
spread is 5.50 which is the accuracy
spread<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:19.920> weapon<00:02:20.250> which<00:02:20.459> is<00:02:20.490> some<00:02:21.060> of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
spread on this weapon which is some of

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.330 
spread on this weapon which is some of
the<00:02:21.270> highest<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.170> game<00:02:22.380> especially<00:02:22.830> for<00:02:23.190> a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
the highest in the game especially for a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.430 
the highest in the game especially for a
fully<00:02:23.580> automatic<00:02:24.090> weapons<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
fully automatic weapons it is the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.230 
fully automatic weapons it is the
highest<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.100> game<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.640> all<00:02:26.940> fully

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
highest in the game of all fully

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.210 
highest in the game of all fully
automatic<00:02:27.720> weapons<00:02:28.140> thakura<00:02:28.680> c<00:02:28.830> spread<00:02:29.100> on

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
automatic weapons thakura c spread on

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.030 
automatic weapons thakura c spread on
this<00:02:29.310> weapon<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.970> pretty<00:02:30.570> high<00:02:30.810> which<00:02:31.709> doesn't

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
this weapon is pretty high which doesn't

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.640 
this weapon is pretty high which doesn't
make<00:02:32.100> much<00:02:32.310> sense<00:02:32.340> for<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.850> low<00:02:33.090> RPM<00:02:33.570> weapon<00:02:34.050> why

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
make much sense for a low RPM weapon why

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.220 
make much sense for a low RPM weapon why
would<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.040> spread<00:02:35.310> be<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.880> high<00:02:36.230> compared

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
would the spread be that high compared

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.050 
would the spread be that high compared
to<00:02:37.290> some<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> other<00:02:37.830> weapons<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.820> hit

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
to some of the other weapons and the hit

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.130 
to some of the other weapons and the hit
limbs<00:02:39.390> damage<00:02:39.810> modifier<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.620> times<00:02:41.630> 0.5<00:02:42.630> so

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
limbs damage modifier is times 0.5 so

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.170 
limbs damage modifier is times 0.5 so
this<00:02:43.170> weapon<00:02:43.680> isn't<00:02:44.190> all<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.400> great<00:02:44.760> you

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
this weapon isn't all that great you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.540 
this weapon isn't all that great you
know<00:02:45.270> like<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.870> said<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.200> has<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.320> pretty<00:02:46.800> low<00:02:46.980> RPM

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
know like I said it has a pretty low RPM

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.699 
know like I said it has a pretty low RPM
the<00:02:47.940> weapon<00:02:48.330> doesn't<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.840> great<00:02:49.050> accuracy

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
the weapon doesn't have great accuracy

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.699 
the weapon doesn't have great accuracy
and<00:02:50.070> has<00:02:50.459> pre<00:02:50.730> bed<00:02:50.910> spread<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:52.080> only<00:02:52.260> real

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
and has pre bed spread the only real

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.190 
and has pre bed spread the only real
redeeming<00:02:53.280> factor<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:54.000> me<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:55.050> iron

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
redeeming factor for me is the iron

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.080 
redeeming factor for me is the iron
sights<00:02:55.500> which<00:02:55.709> are<00:02:55.860> just<00:02:56.100> amazing<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.670> don't

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
sights which are just amazing I don't

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.400 
sights which are just amazing I don't
know<00:02:57.239> what<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.570> about<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.870> iron<00:02:58.019> 6<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:58.380> I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
know what it is about the iron 6 but I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.070 
know what it is about the iron 6 but I
just<00:02:58.620> love<00:02:58.920> them<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.370> weapon<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.750> that's

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
just love them on this weapon so that's

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.780 
just love them on this weapon so that's
the<00:03:01.290> only<00:03:01.380> really<00:03:01.769> thing<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.400> about<00:03:02.430> this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the only really thing I like about this

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.540 
the only really thing I like about this
weapon<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.780> most<00:03:03.989> part<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.500> looks<00:03:04.800> kinda

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
weapon for the most part it looks kinda

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.880 
weapon for the most part it looks kinda
cool<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.690> can't<00:03:06.930> place<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> grip<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.830> it
