00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
other option is to just store it against

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.640 
other option is to just store it against
the<00:02:14.420> wall<00:02:14.540> now<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.410> where<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.590> gets

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the wall now this is where it gets

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.440 
the wall now this is where it gets
interesting<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.520> can<00:02:16.640> place<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.030> i'll<00:02:17.209> add

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
interesting you can place the i'll add

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.140 
interesting you can place the i'll add
flat<00:02:18.319> against<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.770> wall<00:02:18.890> it's<00:02:19.340> weighted

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
flat against the wall it's weighted

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.210 
flat against the wall it's weighted
because<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> stepladder<00:02:20.989> at<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.470> back<00:02:21.680> so

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
because of the stepladder at the back so

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.010 
because of the stepladder at the back so
it's<00:02:22.340> very<00:02:22.520> sturdy<00:02:23.000> against<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.690> wall<00:02:23.840> you

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
it's very sturdy against the wall you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.300 
it's very sturdy against the wall you
don't<00:02:24.140> have<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.440> lean<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.830> like<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.280> a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
don't have to lean it like you do a

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.100 
don't have to lean it like you do a
traditional<00:02:25.550> ironing<00:02:26.209> board<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:26.900> it's<00:02:27.020> taking

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
traditional ironing board so it's taking

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.290 
traditional ironing board so it's taking
out<00:02:27.380> less<00:02:27.620> space<00:02:27.950> than<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.220> ironing<00:02:28.640> board<00:02:28.670> if

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
out less space than the ironing board if

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.640 
out less space than the ironing board if
you<00:02:29.450> look<00:02:29.600> here<00:02:29.780> it's<00:02:29.959> taking<00:02:30.230> up<00:02:30.319> this<00:02:30.440> much

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
you look here it's taking up this much

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.290 
you look here it's taking up this much
space<00:02:30.860> away<00:02:31.069> from<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.430> wall<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:31.819> it's<00:02:31.940> an<00:02:32.030> it's

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
space away from the wall so it's an it's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.990 
space away from the wall so it's an it's
an<00:02:32.510> excellent<00:02:32.900> space<00:02:33.319> saver<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.940> course

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
an excellent space saver and of course

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.210 
an excellent space saver and of course
it's<00:02:35.300> very<00:02:35.510> sturdy<00:02:35.810> not<00:02:36.590> only<00:02:36.769> is<00:02:36.950> there<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
it's very sturdy not only is there the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.920 
it's very sturdy not only is there the
weight<00:02:37.400> at<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.640> back<00:02:37.819> that's<00:02:38.150> securing<00:02:38.810> it

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
got the feet on the ground as well which

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.740 
got the feet on the ground as well which
adds<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:43.010> stability<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.480> ironing

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750
