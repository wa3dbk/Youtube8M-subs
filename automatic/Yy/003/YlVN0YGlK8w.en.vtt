00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
gonna want these to be approximately a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.440 
gonna want these to be approximately a
foot<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.189> a<00:01:28.220> half<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.610> two<00:01:28.790> feet<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.180> length

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
foot and a half to two feet in length

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.480 
foot and a half to two feet in length
and<00:01:29.930> something<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.100> can<00:01:31.220> get<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.369> good

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
to be you don't have some strength to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.560 
to be you don't have some strength to
them<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.220> there's<00:01:37.730> gonna<00:01:37.850> be<00:01:38.030> two<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.300> those

them and there's gonna be two of those

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.440 
them and there's gonna be two of those
that<00:01:38.720> we're<00:01:38.840> gonna<00:01:38.930> be<00:01:39.080> using<00:01:39.260> and<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:40.760> final

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
that we're gonna be using and the final

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.540 
that we're gonna be using and the final
piece<00:01:41.659> of<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:41.960> puzzle<00:01:41.990> here<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:42.770> just<00:01:43.370> a

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
piece of the puzzle here is just a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.580 
piece of the puzzle here is just a
simple<00:01:44.060> length<00:01:44.300> of<00:01:44.450> paracord<00:01:44.900> if<00:01:45.260> you<00:01:45.440> can

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
simple length of paracord if you can

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.170 
simple length of paracord if you can
actually<00:01:45.740> see<00:01:45.980> this<00:01:46.100> on<00:01:46.310> camera<00:01:46.550> if<00:01:46.940> chose<00:01:47.150> a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
actually see this on camera if chose a

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.750 
actually see this on camera if chose a
dark<00:01:47.510> color<00:01:47.830> but<00:01:48.830> this<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.159> actually<00:01:49.580> just

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
dark color but this is actually just

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.730 
dark color but this is actually just
about<00:01:50.000> ten<00:01:50.479> feet<00:01:50.690> of<00:01:50.810> paracord<00:01:51.050> here<00:01:51.470> and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
about ten feet of paracord here and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.440 
about ten feet of paracord here and
we've<00:01:52.040> actually<00:01:52.220> got<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.670> doubled<00:01:53.090> over<00:01:53.330> on

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
we've actually got it doubled over on

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.450 
we've actually got it doubled over on
itself<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.770> first<00:01:54.979> step<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.250> we're

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
itself so the first step that we're

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.490 
itself so the first step that we're
gonna<00:01:55.550> do<00:01:55.790> here<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.450> take<00:01:56.630> our<00:01:56.810> knife<00:01:57.140> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
gonna do here is to take our knife and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.200 
gonna do here is to take our knife and
simply<00:01:58.460> cut<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.150> paracord<00:01:59.690> in<00:01:59.780> half<00:01:59.990> and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
simply cut that paracord in half and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.030 
simply cut that paracord in half and
what<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.240> like<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.630> do<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:03.080> just<00:02:03.409> simply<00:02:03.620> kind<00:02:03.950> of

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
what I like to do is just simply kind of

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.649 
what I like to do is just simply kind of
melt<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.370> ends<00:02:04.640> up<00:02:04.760> a<00:02:04.940> little<00:02:05.120> bit<00:02:05.299> just<00:02:05.570> to

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
melt the ends up a little bit just to

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.450 
melt the ends up a little bit just to
keep<00:02:05.870> that<00:02:06.080> from<00:02:06.320> fraying<00:02:06.590> up<00:02:06.830> on<00:02:07.010> us

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
keep that from fraying up on us

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.860 
keep that from fraying up on us
give<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.450> nice<00:02:10.299> just<00:02:11.299> makes<00:02:11.480> things<00:02:11.659> a<00:02:11.780> little

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
give a nice just makes things a little

you that I do have this thing actually
wound<00:05:52.340> up<00:05:52.610> and<00:05:53.410> you<00:05:54.410> know<00:05:54.530> you<00:05:54.590> do<00:05:54.800> have<00:05:54.830> quite

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
wound up and you know you do have quite

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.130 
wound up and you know you do have quite
a<00:05:55.280> bit<00:05:55.340> of<00:05:55.550> carrying<00:05:55.910> capacity<00:05:56.450> in<00:05:56.570> this<00:05:56.690> much

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
a bit of carrying capacity in this much

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.700 
a bit of carrying capacity in this much
more<00:05:57.380> than<00:05:57.590> you<00:05:57.740> can<00:05:57.980> try<00:05:58.280> to<00:05:58.540> manage<00:05:59.590> you<00:06:00.590> know

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
more than you can try to manage you know

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.650 
more than you can try to manage you know
by<00:06:00.890> carrying<00:06:01.220> under<00:06:01.430> your<00:06:01.760> arm<00:06:01.850> and<00:06:02.210> just<00:06:02.540> by

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.580 
simply extending the amount of paracord
that<00:06:04.670> you<00:06:04.820> use<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.690> really<00:06:06.080> increases<00:06:06.470> the

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
that you use it really increases the

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.640 
that you use it really increases the
capacity<00:06:07.340> as<00:06:07.490> well<00:06:07.760> the<00:06:08.270> only<00:06:08.900> real<00:06:09.200> limit<00:06:09.500> to

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
capacity as well the only real limit to

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.200 
capacity as well the only real limit to
this<00:06:09.770> is<00:06:10.040> of<00:06:10.070> course<00:06:10.520> your<00:06:10.700> good<00:06:10.880> old<00:06:11.000> arm
