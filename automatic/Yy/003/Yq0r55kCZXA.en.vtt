00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
automatically change its shape so when

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.660 
automatically change its shape so when
you<00:01:54.409> put<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.680> stay<00:01:54.920> on<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.100> corner<00:01:55.399> it'll

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
you put it stay on the corner it'll

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.990 
you put it stay on the corner it'll
become<00:01:55.820> like<00:01:56.259> 90<00:01:57.259> degree<00:01:58.040> perpendicular<00:01:58.880> or

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
become like 90 degree perpendicular or

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.730 
become like 90 degree perpendicular or
something<00:01:59.329> I<00:01:59.420> don't<00:01:59.479> know<00:01:59.659> yeah<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.290> kind<00:02:00.710> of

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
something I don't know yeah it's kind of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.370 
something I don't know yeah it's kind of
hard<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.920> explain<00:02:01.009> but<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.329> then<00:02:02.420> also<00:02:02.570> we

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
hard to explain but I and then also we

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.929 
hard to explain but I and then also we
have<00:02:03.680> in<00:02:03.979> from<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.340> one<00:02:04.490> point<00:02:04.700> three<00:02:04.759> point

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
have in from the one point three point

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.060 
have in from the one point three point
one<00:02:05.119> feature<00:02:05.450> cocoapods<00:02:06.320> will<00:02:06.680> grow<00:02:07.040> on

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
one feature cocoapods will grow on

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.400 
one feature cocoapods will grow on
jungle<00:02:07.729> trees<00:02:07.969> so<00:02:08.209> that's<00:02:08.720> pretty<00:02:08.929> cool<00:02:09.019> that

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
jungle trees so that's pretty cool that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.410 
jungle trees so that's pretty cool that
means<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.709> can<00:02:09.890> make<00:02:10.070> what's<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.090> called<00:02:11.299> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
means you can make what's it called the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.750 
means you can make what's it called the
cookies<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:11.959> think<00:02:12.410> with<00:02:12.709> cocoa<00:02:13.070> beans<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.489> don't

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
cookies I think with cocoa beans I don't

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.009 
cookies I think with cocoa beans I don't
actually<00:02:14.000> know<00:02:14.150> what<00:02:14.360> other<00:02:14.480> things<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.870> can

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
actually know what other things you can

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.900 
actually know what other things you can
make<00:02:15.049> with<00:02:15.170> cocoa<00:02:15.560> bean<00:02:15.709> but<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.640> fact<00:02:16.850> that

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
make with cocoa bean but the fact that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.460 
make with cocoa bean but the fact that
they<00:02:17.060> grow<00:02:17.239> on<00:02:17.390> trees<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.840> pretty<00:02:18.079> cool<00:02:18.290> to

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
they grow on trees is pretty cool to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.839 
they grow on trees is pretty cool to
just<00:02:18.560> add<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:18.980> know<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.280> whole<00:02:19.520> theme<00:02:19.819> of

architecture changes that they needed to
do<00:03:18.600> for<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.900> update<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.350> they're<00:03:19.920> saying

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
do for this update and they're saying

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.770 
do for this update and they're saying
thank<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.580> for<00:03:20.790> your<00:03:20.880> continued<00:03:21.300> patience

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
thank you for your continued patience

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.229 
thank you for your continued patience
well<00:03:22.020> what<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:22.920> means<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.580> I'll<00:03:23.910> show<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
well what that means and I'll show the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.910 
well what that means and I'll show the
next<00:03:24.420> week<00:03:24.690> because<00:03:25.080> somebody<00:03:25.380> accent<00:03:25.739> like

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
next week because somebody accent like

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.250 
next week because somebody accent like
what<00:03:26.040> does<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.250> even<00:03:26.370> mean<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.940> it's<00:03:27.840> pretty

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
what does it even mean and it's pretty

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.770 
what does it even mean and it's pretty
much<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.950> there's<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.730> lot<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.910> changes<00:03:30.540> in

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
much that there's a lot of changes in

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.600 
much that there's a lot of changes in
the<00:03:30.959> way<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.110> code<00:03:31.500> works<00:03:31.769> underneath<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
the way the code works underneath the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.789 
the way the code works underneath the
game<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:34.049> know<00:03:34.140> I'm<00:03:34.290> assuming<00:03:34.739> that's

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
game so you know I'm assuming that's

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.199 
game so you know I'm assuming that's
probably<00:03:35.130> because<00:03:35.310> there<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.640> didn't<00:03:35.880> texture

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
probably because there I didn't texture

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.850 
probably because there I didn't texture
packs<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.630> there's<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.810> lot<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:36.989> coding<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.620> do

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
packs and there's a lot of coding you do

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.360 
packs and there's a lot of coding you do
you<00:03:38.459> know<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:39.330> make<00:03:39.900> everybody<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:41.070> know<00:03:41.100> put

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
you know to make everybody you know put

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.850 
you know to make everybody you know put
texture<00:03:41.700> packs<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.209> all<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.390> stuff

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
texture packs in and all that stuff

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.199 
texture packs in and all that stuff
obviously<00:03:43.860> jungles<00:03:44.370> there's<00:03:44.670> there's<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:45.000> lot

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
obviously jungles there's there's a lot

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.300 
obviously jungles there's there's a lot
of<00:03:45.239> stuff<00:03:45.510> they<00:03:45.630> got<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.840> put<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.140> ah<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.280> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
of stuff they got to put in ah this is a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.330 
of stuff they got to put in ah this is a
pretty<00:03:47.549> big<00:03:47.700> update<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:49.769> know<00:03:49.860> I<00:03:49.890> can<00:03:50.190> sort

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
pretty big update so you know I can sort

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
pretty big update so you know I can sort
of<00:03:50.400> understand<00:03:50.790> where<00:03:50.940> they're<00:03:51.060> coming<00:03:51.090> from

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
of understand where they're coming from

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.229 
of understand where they're coming from
by<00:03:51.780> saying<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:53.250> know<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.489> there's<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:54.209> know

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
by saying you know that there's you know

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.850 
by saying you know that there's you know
a<00:03:54.329> lot<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.510> code<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.140> stuff<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.680> they

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
a lot of code and stuff that they

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.199 
a lot of code and stuff that they
actually<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.430> put<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:56.940> with<00:03:57.060> that

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
actually have to put in so with that

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.080 
actually have to put in so with that
being<00:03:57.420> said<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:58.079> release<00:03:58.829> date<00:03:58.860> at<00:03:59.430> least<00:04:00.030> from

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
being said a release date at least from

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.670 
being said a release date at least from
naturally<00:04:00.480> because<00:04:00.630> yet<00:04:00.840> remember<00:04:01.019> they<00:04:01.500> also

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
naturally because yet remember they also

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.620 
naturally because yet remember they also
have<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.130> put<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.430> into<00:04:02.760> testing<00:04:03.329> which<00:04:03.510> is

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
have to put it into testing which is

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.449 
have to put it into testing which is
going<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.870> take<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.019> week<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.470> whatever<00:04:05.280> you

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
going to take a week so whatever you

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.500 
going to take a week so whatever you
think<00:04:05.790> it's<00:04:05.910> going<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.120> come<00:04:06.239> out<00:04:06.299> you

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
think it's going to come out you

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.699 
think it's going to come out you
probably<00:04:06.660> want<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:06.989> add<00:04:07.140> another<00:04:07.170> week<00:04:07.560> just

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
probably want to add another week just

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.930 
probably want to add another week just
because<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:08.070> testing<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.549> you<00:04:08.730> don't<00:04:08.880> know

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
because of testing and you don't know

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.250 
because of testing and you don't know
how<00:04:09.090> long<00:04:09.299> I<00:04:09.360> mean<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.630> usually<00:04:09.870> takes<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.110> week

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
how long I mean it usually takes a week

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.009 
how long I mean it usually takes a week
but<00:04:10.440> who<00:04:11.010> knows<00:04:11.220> with<00:04:11.430> Microsoft<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.660> in<00:04:12.780> my

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
but who knows with Microsoft so in my

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.219 
but who knows with Microsoft so in my
opinion<00:04:13.579> when<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.730> update<00:04:15.420> is<00:04:15.450> gonna<00:04:15.930> come

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
opinion when this update is gonna come

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.199 
opinion when this update is gonna come
out<00:04:16.380> I'm<00:04:17.040> gonna<00:04:17.280> say<00:04:17.549> it's<00:04:17.760> gonna<00:04:17.880> come<00:04:18.000> on<00:04:18.120> on

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
out I'm gonna say it's gonna come on on

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.210 
out I'm gonna say it's gonna come on on
July<00:04:18.450> thirtieth<00:04:18.870> because<00:04:19.140> usually<00:04:19.350> they<00:04:19.979> come

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
July thirtieth because usually they come

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.130 
July thirtieth because usually they come
out<00:04:20.459> on<00:04:20.640> Tuesdays<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.329> July<00:04:21.570> thirtieth<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.109> a

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
out on Tuesdays and July thirtieth is a

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.280 
out on Tuesdays and July thirtieth is a
tuesday<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.890> i<00:04:23.610> think<00:04:23.910> that<00:04:24.360> giving<00:04:24.780> 4j

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
tuesday and i think that giving 4j

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.190 
tuesday and i think that giving 4j
around<00:04:25.890> two<00:04:26.310> more

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
around two more

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200 
around two more
is<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.620> sort<00:04:27.920> of<00:04:28.040> code<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.610> then<00:04:28.730> another<00:04:28.880> week

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
is to sort of code and then another week

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.010 
is to sort of code and then another week
for<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.110> actual<00:04:30.980> Microsoft<00:04:31.700> testing<00:04:32.210> you

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
for the actual Microsoft testing you

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.390 
for the actual Microsoft testing you
know<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.260> comes<00:04:33.410> around<00:04:33.740> July<00:04:34.010> thirtieth

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
know it comes around July thirtieth

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.730 
know it comes around July thirtieth
maybe<00:04:34.760> uh<00:04:35.240> whether<00:04:35.930> it's<00:04:36.380> probably<00:04:36.650> either

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
maybe uh whether it's probably either

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.470 
maybe uh whether it's probably either
gonna<00:04:36.920> be<00:04:37.040> July<00:04:37.250> thirtieth<00:04:37.610> or<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:38.060> know<00:04:38.180> and

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
gonna be July thirtieth or you know and

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.350 
gonna be July thirtieth or you know and
at<00:04:38.930> most<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.770> think<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.460> first<00:04:40.730> week<00:04:40.940> in<00:04:41.030> August

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
at most I think the first week in August

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.490 
at most I think the first week in August
I<00:04:41.450> don't<00:04:41.630> think<00:04:41.780> they're<00:04:41.870> gonna<00:04:41.990> push<00:04:42.230> it<00:04:42.260> any

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
I don't think they're gonna push it any

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.520 
I don't think they're gonna push it any
longer<00:04:43.100> just<00:04:43.490> because<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:43.970> lot<00:04:44.690> of<00:04:44.720> people<00:04:45.020> are

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
longer just because a lot of people are

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.860 
longer just because a lot of people are
wondering<00:04:45.770> are<00:04:46.340> you<00:04:46.700> know<00:04:46.970> wanting<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.630> play

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
wondering are you know wanting to play

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.750 
wondering are you know wanting to play
this<00:04:48.050> update<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.560> this<00:04:49.070> is<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.430> know<00:04:49.520> this<00:04:49.550> is

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
this update and this is you know this is

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.940 
this update and this is you know this is
a<00:04:49.790> pretty<00:04:50.030> big<00:04:50.210> update<00:04:50.540> so<00:04:50.780> that's<00:04:51.380> my<00:04:51.590> opinion

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
a pretty big update so that's my opinion
