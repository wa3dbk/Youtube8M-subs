00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hey people here is your margin again 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.509
 I have 60 rings with me 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.280
 together and we'll see if this time 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.019
 a good ring is I wanted in the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.150
 Last rain also asked for it 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.400
 a year old with klitschko and relative 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.680
 high mainstage action house to consider 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.180
 we can do it but me 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.740
 I actually do that for women 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.189
 here are worth so much or 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.590
 you can also see so if you if you track 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.980
 goes together and then not 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.610
 really has to pay a lot for clear 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.770
 better wrestler so the first number is not 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:44.719
 worth nothing is worth nothing 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:47.450
 not a pity shame a pity but we 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.710
 we can watch 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.820
 pity that the thing I really do here 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.199
 average the match has physics risks 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.780
 better than any other like them 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.090
 So of course all is even better though 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.489
 okay, no shit shit 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.040
 shit you find better than stupid and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.040
 shit, shit, shit 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.820
 even full shit are only three steps 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:28.580
 On no one stepped between ring 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:30.090
 is too little too shit 24 gold 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:36.450
 also nothing 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:45.200
 no no shit shit was really only 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:46.940
 shit 12% life is heavy and prepaid 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.280
 credit card really a bit low 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:56.730
 but I still watch it closely 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.030
 factory five sri fucking tractor is there 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:11.520
 not we have found a broken one 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:13.470
 people believed defective while kicking 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.930
 thus the need but we have a trip 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:25.580
 vectoring there will be my vote 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:25.580
 say much higher from July 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.320
 the text is even better than mine 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.320
 was not quite 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.230
 Yes we have 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.720
 I believe the factory at times 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:57.730
 says believes says human that looks 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:59.110
 So let's see now 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.000
 We quickly track down the other things here 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.159
 it would interest us here 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.280
 not the last time a bit down 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:10.170
 on dax first 300k with in 250 degrees 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.730
 worthless 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:22.720
 ok data socket was still on the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:24.489
 pedestal with base needs here comes the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.829
 does not want to be worth 20 million 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.010
 even everything I do not know what the 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.290
 worth is the people on it offer 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.750
 reinstellen and done so simply pays 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.859
 what is there physically physics esi is 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:44.310
 not so bad the average with it 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:44.310
 son in wax fuck on it 15 million 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:53.760
 15 million 15 million watt instead 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:04:02.019
 sacrifice but soon comes the one ring 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:05.019
 the one comes on it says rektor 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.379
 Come on, it's cool to see that, yes 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.769
 people a bit of praise but here is 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:14.530
 one of its little bit better the city 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.030
 but even vitality on it we 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.380
 can now here with with strength 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.750
 looking 70 million a little bit more 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.919
 my criticism 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.510
 yes that looks good so 70 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:32.370
 Millions is already something he has 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.370
 otherwise 66 66 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.870
 being stronger is definitely going to be worth more 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.450
 Strict 70 million here has an 87 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.820
 ours you even get to 80 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.820
 go up 70 million 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.050
 cool thing 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:05.440
 it does not come with it now but we 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.440
 have a broken oven will be pleased 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:15.860
 70 million 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:18.320
 it was worth it, yes 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.540
 if the ring is sold then I will 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.800
 in any other report, I say 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.060
 like to show it in between times yes 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.220
 The ring 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.570
 If I have the still further price counter 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.850
 have set or not 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.490
 and yes I thank you for it 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.960
 watch that you are always so close 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.389
 stuck with it since I especially 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.990
 people from the first report on it 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.729
 been 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.770
 This time something good was found 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.300
 now overtopped it is better there 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.150
 sadly, unfortunately, a bit 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.950
 critical fact it lacked be yes 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.370
 still clearly further on 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.050
 been worth much more 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.640
 and yes, but let me tell you about the 470 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.320
 we have millions to get rid of 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.210
 a little bit more again 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.250
 made and yes many a nonsense I 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.750
 me quite often yes i want me 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.300
 Say goodbye until next time 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.710
 your mat then good luck good luck 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.370
 By the way, in your rain and last 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.370
