 Delicious pizza can not believe because it goes 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.510
 to be the best one that has tasted look 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 in Italian cuisine they are always based 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.910
 in the few simple ingredients 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.760
 ingredients but of very high quality 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.890
 then I looked to save the dough 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.250
 that I have on screen for you 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.399
 Start you are already beginning to antojar let 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.920
 to save us the coarse mass and we are going to 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.120
 use this arab bread that is super 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.820
 delgadito is made of wholemeal flour 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.500
 which are very few carbs in fact 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.049
 diabetics should not consume 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.540
 a lot of carbohydrate then pita bread 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.180
 It is ideal if you can not eat without 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.230
 tortilla or without bread uses pita bread and 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.320
 the integral is going to go fantastic 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:23.610
 then we are going to use tomato puree 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.190
 just a little bit we're going to put oregano 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.370
 let's do the most Italian is mashed 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:35.690
 a little salt and freshly ground pepper 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.460
 Exactly it seems then let's mix 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.930
 you can put parsley too if you have 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.040
 out there dry we are going to distribute two 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.760
 spoonfuls of tomato puree 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.760
 A) Yes 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.920
 you can put garlic on it, if it goes 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.590
 very good taste and look at this is the cheese 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.040
 authentic mozzarella mozzarella cheese 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.890
 This is how you hear it because 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.210
 because this one that he cited is extremely light 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.940
 it is low- fat cheese almost 0 grams of 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.610
 fat if you see it get what is going to 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.200
 find in little ball in a good little ball 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.300
 is the mozzarella cheese 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.300
 if you do not want to use mozzarella 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.370
 you can use panela cheese 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.290
 panela looks a lot like mozzarella 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.209
 Lady, do not tell her metal anymore because 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.420
 goes to the heart attack and will say is not true 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.930
 but good if it seems because they are light 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.260
 They are creamy, low-fat cheeses 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.660
 so let's just put a little bit of 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.000
 Parmesan cheese because people 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.340
 good that they suffer from overweight or 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.830
 some heart disease not 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.269
 they can eat a lot of saturated fat and 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.580
 who give us children are not very 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.860
 recommended then little by little 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.440
 parmesan to give it a lot of flavor and 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.100
 we are going to 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.450
 and cherry tomato I'm what happened they tell me 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.780
 I'm simulating a margarita pizza the 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.860
 authentic Neapolitan margarita pizza 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:11.480
 it's just tomato mozzarella cheese and 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.390
 basil then let's put tomato 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.710
 all over 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.840
 delicious if you do not have tomato 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.900

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.940

 exact let's go to the oven and look 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.530
 Put it that way directly on your grid 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.680
 so that the heat reaches the bottom of 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.190

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.290
