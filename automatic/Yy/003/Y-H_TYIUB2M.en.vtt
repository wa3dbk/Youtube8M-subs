00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.130
 to have 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 they have a new iphone cordial 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.580
 congratulation 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.310
 they have lost their iphone and now 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.810

 reset i show them as they do 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.949
 just like your data and content 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:41.019
 For example, address accounts or apps 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.519
 recover from the iCloud 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.530
 or on her new iphone 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.569
 provided you can play, of course 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.640

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:51.190
 set up and created the iphone 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.019

 we will show them in our 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.149
 help video on the topic of data and content 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.769
 save in icloud 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.049
 the advantage of restoring 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.280
 the icloud is that she's just her 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.740
 iPhone and an internet connection 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.320
 need and completely independent of 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.180
 your pc are at home and now show 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.070
 I tell them that if they are a new one 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.000
 iphone just turn it on 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.280
 up here 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.260
 if you have an already activated iphone 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.180
 from the iCloud want to restore 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.310
 please delete first the complete 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.830
 data on your device and put it that way 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.390
 back to the original state 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.390
 under settings general 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.280
 reset and content and 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.280
 delete settings 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.720
 in both cases starts next 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.150
 the setup assistant choose yours 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.490
 language and ireland off activate 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.880
 where appropriate, the location services and 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.690
 choose your wlan network 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.460
 Detailed information about the individual 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.100
 you see steps in our help 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.690
 video iphone activation without pc or 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 mac 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.899
 We are now going directly at a 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.810
 point configurations 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.979
 please choose from iCloud backup 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.350
 restore 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.280
 Here you give your apple id and that 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.390
 associated password on on 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:24.530
 then click the conditions of use 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:26.690
 accept now will be your apple id 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.550
 This can take a few minutes 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.470
 last 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.690
 after that the last backups appear 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.060
 for each device on which you have the backup 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.260
 have activated function 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.250
 look for a backup from that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.250
 should be restored 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.769
 a new password is required here 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.680
 her iphone starts now with her 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.820
 Settings accounts apps and data 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.650
 recover 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.570
 how long that takes depends on the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.799
 amount of data in the backup and the 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.560
 speed of your internet connection 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.079
 It's best to close your device on 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.000
 electricity on until the restoration 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.980
 it is possible that she is finished 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.870
 still after the passwords for everyone 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.519
 your device activated accounts asked 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.440
 become more successful 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.750
 recovery starts her new iphone 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.269
 and then immediately ready for use 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.459
 another tip like some data 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.560
 for example, music or videos 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.380
 not included in iCloud backup 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.750
 to sync these too easy 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.859
 Join her iphone with itunes and there 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.799
 on the rider with the desired 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.900
 content 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.269
 a note for her connection to a 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.700
 backup your iphones with icloud or 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.130
 Itunes leave, however 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.900
 not both at the same time but you 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.910
 Of course, always can itunes 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.200
 choose between these two options 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.200
 that's how it goes
