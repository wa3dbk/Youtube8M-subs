00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.920
 the pimples and genuine surprised in 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.049
 his day for his careful design by the 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.599
 striking side touch panel and by the 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.039
 unquestionable sound quality here has 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.529
 its second generation tic 2.0 in that 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.449
 improves this second version as it improves 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.910
 in which it is lighter offers greater 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.380
 autonomy and has more sensors is 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.359
 say more management possibilities 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.369
 because these dogs are capable of 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.380
 handle music and other functions that 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.360
 now I will tell you through the panel 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.000
 right side that is tactile 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.550
 Well, this whole panel is really 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.829
 touch to your right side so if 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.170
 we slide our finger up 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.500
 we increase the volume of the songs 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.020
 if the movement is horizontal 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 we will move on to the next song or the 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.080
 previous and a simple touch pauses the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.580
 Hearing also feature function 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.710
 hands- free so that if you get 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.479
 a call with a simple tap the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.570
 you answer and if you keep finger two 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.420
 you reject them but as you know if 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.000
 you must accept or reject it is that 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.340
 own headphones tell you who you 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.320
 called by a sweet clear voice has 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.450
 read the contact of the agenda of your 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.670
 mobile the same way if you want to do 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.590
 a call you press a few seconds the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.660
 panel so that the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.520
 voice recognition and you just have to 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.850
 say a name of your agenda and the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.350
 dogs take care of the rest another detail 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.270
 very gadget imagine that I'm listening 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.940
 music and roberto in our cameraman 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.800
 wants to tell me something, I put them on 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.110
 neck in this way and this simple 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.210
 movement immediately makes it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.080
 pause and audition and return them to 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.790
 your position 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.680
 the music gets back on track 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.830
 but what powerfully calls the 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.960
 attention of these for rock 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.510
 2.0 is its construction and finishing one 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.760
 genuine leather leather 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.600
 Pads are super comfortable and are very 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.890
 ergonomic and comfortable and yes very light 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 They have different technologies for 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.370
 attenuate ambient noise and so that 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.290
 You hear tube naturally when 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.440
 talk on the phone up to six 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.520
 microphones take care of it the quality 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 of sound that these provide 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.890
 headphones is a pure delight I know 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.140
 from a tablet pc mp3 or smartphone 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.750
 music equipment generates some serious 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.610
 amazing and perfectly sharp 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.140
 balanced by the way you can use 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.600

 wireless through bluetooth and nfc 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.520
 or through a standard physical cable and not 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.290
 It is convenient to forget that parrot has created 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.630
 a specific mobile application for 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.510

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.380
 according to how the producer adjusted 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.930
