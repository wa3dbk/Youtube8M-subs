they<00:00:25.980> probably<00:00:26.939> clone<00:00:27.510> these<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.199> they've

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
they probably clone these and they've

we've already gone ahead and taken a
couple<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> leaves<00:00:39.090> off<00:00:39.329> here<00:00:39.719> from<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
couple of the leaves off here from the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.910 
couple of the leaves off here from the
tops<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.719> said<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> tops<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.770> these

tea<00:00:44.190> plants<00:00:44.550> are<00:00:44.670> where<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> really

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
tea plants are where all of the really

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.069 
tea plants are where all of the really
good<00:00:47.460> nutrients<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.270> antioxidants<00:00:48.450> are

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
good nutrients and antioxidants are

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
good nutrients and antioxidants are
located<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.010> we're<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.789> plucking<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> tops

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
located so we're just plucking the tops

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.549 
located so we're just plucking the tops
of<00:00:51.960> them<00:00:52.140> today<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:54.660> soil<00:00:54.960> here<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.289> very

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
of them today the soil here is very

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.310 
of them today the soil here is very
acidic<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.190> drains<00:00:56.489> very<00:00:56.850> well<00:00:57.320> there's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
acidic it drains very well there's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.959 
acidic it drains very well there's
cottonseed<00:00:58.829> dolomite<00:00:59.550> lime<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:01.640> some<00:01:02.640> oyster

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
cottonseed dolomite lime and some oyster

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.820 
cottonseed dolomite lime and some oyster
shells<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.629> well<00:01:03.840> along<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
shells in here as well along with the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.609 
shells in here as well along with the
pearl<00:01:05.070> light<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.549> added<00:01:05.790> drainage<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.500> can

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
pearl light for added drainage you can

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.140 
pearl light for added drainage you can
see<00:01:07.770> there's<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> label<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.520> each<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.850> these<00:01:08.939> so

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
see there's a label on each of these so

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.280 
see there's a label on each of these so
I<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.689> which<00:01:09.930> tea<00:01:10.500> plant<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.630> then

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
I know which tea plant they are and then

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.190 
I know which tea plant they are and then
at<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> bottom<00:01:13.680> there's<00:01:14.070> no<00:01:14.780> trays<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.049> these

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
at the bottom there's no trays in these

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289 
at the bottom there's no trays in these
containers<00:01:16.770> they<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.189> run<00:01:17.700> right<00:01:17.909> through

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
containers they just run right through

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.800 
containers they just run right through
and<00:01:19.549> that<00:01:20.549> helps<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.150> they<00:01:21.330> don't<00:01:21.420> sit<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and that helps so that they don't sit in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.770 
and that helps so that they don't sit in
water<00:01:23.869> which<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.990> part<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.560> their<00:01:26.430> needs

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
water which is part of the their needs

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.760 
water which is part of the their needs
I'm<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.080> supposed<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.470> prune<00:01:28.650> these

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
I'm really not supposed to prune these

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.050 
I'm really not supposed to prune these
until<00:01:29.040> they're<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.250> least<00:01:29.310> three<00:01:29.640> years<00:01:29.759> old

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
until they're at least three years old

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.210 
until they're at least three years old
but<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.420> once<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.439> once<00:01:32.040> it's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
but then once they are and once it's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.850 
but then once they are and once it's
springtime<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.119> prune<00:01:33.390> them<00:01:33.630> about<00:01:34.560> once

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
springtime you can prune them about once

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350 
springtime you can prune them about once
every<00:01:35.040> ten<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> fifteen<00:01:35.880> days<00:01:36.090> because

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
every ten to fifteen days because

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.050 
every ten to fifteen days because
they'll<00:01:36.479> keep<00:01:36.689> producing<00:01:37.020> new<00:01:37.409> leaf<00:01:37.650> growth

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
they'll keep producing new leaf growth

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.260 
they'll keep producing new leaf growth
so<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.939> growth<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.119> these

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so you can see all the growth on these

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.090 
so you can see all the growth on these
plants<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> done<00:01:43.049> very<00:01:43.229> well<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:45.979> we'll<00:01:46.979> go

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
plants is done very well and we'll go

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.690 
plants is done very well and we'll go
over<00:01:47.310> here<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.290> we're<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.380> gonna<00:01:49.500> take<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
over here and we're just gonna take the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.080 
over here and we're just gonna take the
very<00:01:51.000> top<00:01:51.329> little<00:01:51.689> bit<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.170> stem<00:01:53.090> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
very top little bit of this stem and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.959 
very top little bit of this stem and
we're<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> using<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.969> making

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
we're going to be using that for making

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.730 
we're going to be using that for making
team

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.310 

so<00:02:00.740> we'll<00:02:00.890> grab<00:02:01.070> these<00:02:01.340> leaves<00:02:02.229> we're<00:02:03.229> gonna

so we'll grab these leaves we're gonna

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.990 
so we'll grab these leaves we're gonna
let<00:02:03.530> them<00:02:03.649> dry<00:02:03.979> inside<00:02:05.469> in<00:02:06.469> a<00:02:06.649> kind<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.729> cool

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
let them dry inside in a kind of cool

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.470 
let them dry inside in a kind of cool
dark<00:02:08.360> place<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:10.989> that'll<00:02:11.989> be<00:02:12.230> used<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:13.480> brew

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
dark place and that'll be used to brew

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.650 
dark place and that'll be used to brew
our<00:02:14.629> next<00:02:14.989> batch<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.470> teas<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.269> very<00:02:17.269> high<00:02:17.480> in
