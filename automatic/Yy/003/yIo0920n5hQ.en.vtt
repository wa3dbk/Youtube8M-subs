00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
lenses you'll notice that some of them

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.049 
lenses you'll notice that some of them
say<00:01:00.000> F<00:01:00.410> 2.8<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.609> after<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
say F 2.8 and just that not after you

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
say F 2.8 and just that not after you
point<00:01:03.270> eight<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.930> F<00:01:04.080> five<00:01:04.409> point<00:01:04.769> six<00:01:04.949> it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
point eight to F five point six it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.950 
point eight to F five point six it's
just<00:01:05.400> F<00:01:05.580> two<00:01:05.850> point<00:01:06.119> eight<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:06.840> that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
just F two point eight and what that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 
just F two point eight and what that
means<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.890> stay<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.159> F<00:01:08.430> two

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
means is that they can stay at F two

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.420 
means is that they can stay at F two
point<00:01:08.909> eight<00:01:08.970> throughout<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.689> focal<00:01:10.080> range

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
point eight throughout the focal range

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.710 
point eight throughout the focal range
the<00:01:11.430> reason<00:01:11.790> why<00:01:11.909> they're<00:01:12.119> able<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.689> this

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the reason why they're able to do this

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.390 
the reason why they're able to do this
is<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.439> usually<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.979> more

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is because they usually have more

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.020 
is because they usually have more
complex<00:01:15.030> lens<00:01:15.720> designs<00:01:16.200> more<00:01:16.860> glass<00:01:17.369> elements

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
complex lens designs more glass elements

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
complex lens designs more glass elements
and<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.689> more<00:01:19.020> technology<00:01:19.740> put

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and just you know more technology put

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.710 
and just you know more technology put
into<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.640> able<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.360> because

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
into it to be able to do this because

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.840 
into it to be able to do this because
these<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:22.380> more<00:01:22.590> complex<00:01:23.040> lens<00:01:23.400> designs

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
these are more complex lens designs

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
these are more complex lens designs

lens<00:01:41.189> first<00:01:41.880> off<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.450> usually<00:01:43.350> lens

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
lens first off is that usually lens

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.310 
lens first off is that usually lens
manufacturers<00:01:44.399> only<00:01:44.820> invest<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.869> creating

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
manufacturers only invest in creating

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.859 
manufacturers only invest in creating
constant<00:01:47.040> aperture<00:01:47.220> lenses<00:01:47.700> with<00:01:48.149> large

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
constant aperture lenses with large

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.380 
constant aperture lenses with large
maximum<00:01:49.740> apertures<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.610> again<00:01:50.850> you'll<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.119> F

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
maximum apertures so again you'll get F

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.780 
maximum apertures so again you'll get F
2.8<00:01:51.960> lenses<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.439> you'll<00:01:52.829> get<00:01:52.979> f4<00:01:53.430> lenses

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
2.8 lenses and you'll get f4 lenses

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.050 
2.8 lenses and you'll get f4 lenses
there's<00:01:53.939> even<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.390> new<00:01:54.540> sigma<00:01:54.990> 18<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.590> 35<00:01:56.070> F<00:01:56.340> 1.8

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
there's even a new sigma 18 to 35 F 1.8

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.670 
there's even a new sigma 18 to 35 F 1.8
constant<00:01:57.509> aperture<00:01:57.719> lenses<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.290> you'll<00:01:58.439> see

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
constant aperture lenses so you'll see

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
constant aperture lenses so you'll see
that<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.520> lens<00:01:59.909> manufactures<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:00.810> they're

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that the lens manufactures when they're

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.630 
that the lens manufactures when they're
making<00:02:01.259> constant<00:02:01.799> aperture<00:02:01.950> lenses<00:02:02.460> they're

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
making constant aperture lenses they're

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.270 
making constant aperture lenses they're
only<00:02:02.820> doing<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.500> low-light<00:02:04.500> beasts<00:02:05.040> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
only doing it for low-light beasts of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.130 
only doing it for low-light beasts of
lens's<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:05.969> these<00:02:06.090> lenses<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.600> usually<00:02:06.750> take

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
lens's so these lenses can usually take

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.960 
lens's so these lenses can usually take
up<00:02:07.170> more<00:02:07.500> light<00:02:07.710> than<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.099> average<00:02:08.310> kit<00:02:08.789> lens

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
up more light than your average kit lens

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.260 
up more light than your average kit lens
could<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.810> goes<00:02:10.140> from<00:02:10.289> 3.5<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.160> 5.6<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
could that goes from 3.5 to 5.6 the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.550 
could that goes from 3.5 to 5.6 the
second<00:02:12.599> advantage<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:13.200> that

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
second advantage is that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.800 
second advantage is that
you<00:02:13.709> have<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> constant<00:02:14.580> aperture<00:02:14.910> lens<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
you have a constant aperture lens and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.260 
you have a constant aperture lens and
you're<00:02:16.290> shooting<00:02:16.980> at<00:02:17.160> your<00:02:17.340> maximum<00:02:17.819> aperture

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
you're shooting at your maximum aperture

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.750 
you're shooting at your maximum aperture
so<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:18.510> you're<00:02:18.660> shooting<00:02:18.870> at<00:02:19.200> F<00:02:19.530> 2.8<00:02:20.340> let's<00:02:20.580> say

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
so if you're shooting at F 2.8 let's say

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.900 
so if you're shooting at F 2.8 let's say
and<00:02:21.000> you're<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.020> manual<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.340> camera's<00:02:23.880> not

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and you're on manual so the camera's not

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.089 
and you're on manual so the camera's not
changing<00:02:24.480> your<00:02:24.569> settings<00:02:24.870> for<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.380> you

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
changing your settings for you as you

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.010 
changing your settings for you as you
zoom<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.580> your<00:02:27.000> settings<00:02:27.390> are<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.720> stay

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
zoom in your settings are going to stay

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.420 
zoom in your settings are going to stay
the<00:02:28.170> same<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.739> you're<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.069> have<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the same so you're going to have the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.330 
the same so you're going to have the
same<00:02:29.640> amount<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.239> light<00:02:30.450> coming<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.989> your<00:02:31.110> lens

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
same amount of light coming to your lens

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.009 
same amount of light coming to your lens
whereas<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.550> you're<00:02:32.730> shooting<00:02:32.910> manual<00:02:33.450> with<00:02:33.720> a

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
whereas if you're shooting manual with a

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.650 
whereas if you're shooting manual with a
kit<00:02:34.860> lens<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.430> set<00:02:35.670> your<00:02:35.880> aperture<00:02:36.269> to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
kit lens and you set your aperture to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.140 
kit lens and you set your aperture to
3.5<00:02:37.230> because<00:02:37.560> you're<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.769> 18<00:02:38.160> mil<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.610> you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
3.5 because you're at 18 mil and you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.970 
3.5 because you're at 18 mil and you
have<00:02:39.300> your<00:02:39.480> shutter<00:02:39.630> speed<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.200> ISO<00:02:40.349> set<00:02:40.860> to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
have your shutter speed and ISO set to

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.890 
have your shutter speed and ISO set to
something<00:02:41.220> when<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.790> zoom<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.360> 55

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
something when you zoom in to 55

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.690 
something when you zoom in to 55
millimeters<00:02:43.470> you're<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.220> lose<00:02:44.430> light

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
millimeters you're going to lose light

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.030 
millimeters you're going to lose light
because<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.120> going<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.360> drop<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.900> F<00:02:46.049> 5.6<00:02:46.830> and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
because it's going to drop to F 5.6 and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
because it's going to drop to F 5.6 and
sometimes<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.670> don't<00:02:47.760> even<00:02:48.090> notice<00:02:48.269> that

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
sometimes you don't even notice that

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.270 
sometimes you don't even notice that
until<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.959> look<00:02:49.140> at<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> picture<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.160> that's

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
until you look at the picture so that's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.220 
until you look at the picture so that's
really<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.640> downside<00:02:51.090> there<00:02:51.450> are<00:02:51.630> cheaper

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
really a downside there are cheaper

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.410 
really a downside there are cheaper
lenses<00:02:52.440> with<00:02:52.950> constant<00:02:53.580> actors<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.299> these

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
lenses with constant actors and these

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.059 
lenses with constant actors and these
are<00:02:54.569> lenses<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.110> might<00:02:55.290> want<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.620> take<00:02:56.040> a

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
are lenses that you might want to take a

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.130 
are lenses that you might want to take a
look<00:02:56.340> at<00:02:56.489> when<00:02:56.880> you're<00:02:57.030> upgrading<00:02:57.209> from<00:02:57.840> your

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
look at when you're upgrading from your

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.750 
look at when you're upgrading from your
kit<00:02:58.380> lens<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.830> something<00:02:59.250> better

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
kit lens to something better

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.680 
kit lens to something better
for<00:03:00.269> example<00:03:00.750> Sigma<00:03:01.970> Tamron<00:03:02.970> they<00:03:03.269> all<00:03:03.420> make

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
for example Sigma Tamron they all make

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.870 
for example Sigma Tamron they all make
lenses<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.440> are<00:03:04.680> sort<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.640> kit<00:03:05.849> lens

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
lenses that are sort of the kit lens

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.020 
lenses that are sort of the kit lens
range<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:06.599> 18<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.769> 55<00:03:08.160> some<00:03:08.549> of<00:03:08.640> them<00:03:08.760> are<00:03:08.910> like

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
range so 18 to 55 some of them are like

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.350 
range so 18 to 55 some of them are like
17<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:10.110> 50<00:03:10.590> or<00:03:10.860> 17<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:12.450> 55<00:03:13.340> 1770<00:03:14.360> somewhere

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
17 to 50 or 17 to 55 1770 somewhere

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.330 
17 to 50 or 17 to 55 1770 somewhere
along<00:03:15.540> those<00:03:15.840> lines<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.530> they<00:03:16.709> have<00:03:16.920> constant

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
along those lines and they have constant

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.610 
along those lines and they have constant
F<00:03:17.549> 2.8<00:03:18.390> apertures<00:03:18.930> which<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.320> very<00:03:19.560> good

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
F 2.8 apertures which is a very good

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.440 
F 2.8 apertures which is a very good
option<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.280> because<00:03:21.060> there<00:03:21.209> are<00:03:21.239> third-party

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
option and because there are third-party

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.440 
option and because there are third-party
lenses<00:03:22.109> that<00:03:22.500> are<00:03:22.620> not<00:03:22.769> too<00:03:23.549> expensive<00:03:23.880> not<00:03:24.209> as

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
lenses that are not too expensive not as

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.630 
lenses that are not too expensive not as

again<00:03:27.450> there's<00:03:27.630> also<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.019> Sigma<00:03:28.560> 18<00:03:29.459> mil<00:03:29.700> to

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
again there's also that Sigma 18 mil to

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.830 
again there's also that Sigma 18 mil to
35<00:03:31.290> mil<00:03:31.620> that's<00:03:31.859> constant<00:03:32.459> F<00:03:32.609> 1.8<00:03:33.480> aperture

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
35 mil that's constant F 1.8 aperture

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.569 
35 mil that's constant F 1.8 aperture
which<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.230> first<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.590> its<00:03:34.769> kind<00:03:34.950> which<00:03:35.430> is

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
which is the first of its kind which is

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.890 
which is the first of its kind which is
a<00:03:35.609> great<00:03:35.910> lens<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.269> you're<00:03:36.359> shooting<00:03:36.569> in<00:03:36.780> that

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
a great lens if you're shooting in that

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.930 
a great lens if you're shooting in that
range<00:03:37.230> which<00:03:37.769> gives<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.130> sort<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.400> sort<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.880> a

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
range which gives you sort of sort of a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.539 
range which gives you sort of sort of a
28<00:03:39.630> 256<00:03:40.170> mil<00:03:40.890> in<00:03:41.609> terms<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.150> full-frame<00:03:43.549> focal

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
28 256 mil in terms of full-frame focal

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.099 
28 256 mil in terms of full-frame focal
lengths<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.090> that's<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.389> guys<00:03:45.540> those<00:03:45.840> are<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
lengths so that's it guys those are the

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.960 
lengths so that's it guys those are the
differences<00:03:46.530> between<00:03:46.590> shooting<00:03:47.549> with<00:03:47.760> a

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
differences between shooting with a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.900 
differences between shooting with a
constant<00:03:48.480> aperture<00:03:48.829> lens<00:03:49.829> versus<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> variable

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
constant aperture lens versus a variable

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.849 
constant aperture lens versus a variable
aperture<00:03:51.060> lens<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.540> hope<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:52.200> video<00:03:52.410> helped

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
aperture lens I hope this video helped

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.890 
aperture lens I hope this video helped
if<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.130> did<00:03:53.310> definitely<00:03:53.519> consider<00:03:54.060> liking<00:03:54.660> the
