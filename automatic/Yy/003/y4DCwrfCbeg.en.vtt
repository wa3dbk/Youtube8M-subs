with blue and yellow wires coming out

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.680 
with blue and yellow wires coming out
here<00:00:45.749> then<00:00:46.319> I<00:00:46.350> mounted<00:00:46.679> a<00:00:46.769> speaker<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.370> 20<00:00:48.269> by<00:00:48.390> 40

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
here then I mounted a speaker a 20 by 40

here then I mounted a speaker a 20 by 40
millimeter<00:00:49.019> speaker<00:00:49.469> had<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> stand<00:00:50.249> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
millimeter speaker had to stand the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.279 
millimeter speaker had to stand the
sides<00:00:50.609> of<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> down<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.569> touch<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
sides of it down just a touch to get it

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.189 
sides of it down just a touch to get it
to<00:00:52.379> fit<00:00:52.589> right<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.929> kind

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to fit right in here and then it's kind

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.450 
to fit right in here and then it's kind
of<00:00:55.229> difficult<00:00:55.409> to<00:00:55.679> see<00:00:55.800> cuz<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.100> all<00:00:56.219> black

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of difficult to see cuz it's all black

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
of difficult to see cuz it's all black
but<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.030> piece<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.269> black<00:00:57.569> plastic<00:00:57.870> and

this is a piece of black plastic that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.160 
this is a piece of black plastic that
seal<00:01:01.499> that<00:01:01.530> speaker<00:01:02.190> off<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:03.089> this<00:01:03.659> area<00:01:04.019> right

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
seal that speaker off in this area right

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.270 
seal that speaker off in this area right
along<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:04.710> right<00:01:05.520> down<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.680> okay<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:08.010> what

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
along here right down here okay now what

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.040 
along here right down here okay now what
that<00:01:08.430> does<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.910> it<00:01:09.060> fixes<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.690> that<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
that does is it fixes it so that the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.110 
that does is it fixes it so that the
negative<00:01:10.740> pressure<00:01:11.220> coming<00:01:11.580> off<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> back

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120

side<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> speaker<00:01:12.840> has<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:13.080> come<00:01:13.290> out

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
side of the speaker has to come out

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
side of the speaker has to come out
through<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.710> grilles<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.280> either<00:01:14.910> side<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
through the grilles on either side and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.110 
through the grilles on either side and
the<00:01:16.110> positive<00:01:16.530> pressure<00:01:16.710> goes<00:01:17.010> down<00:01:17.120> through

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
the positive pressure goes down through

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.790 
the positive pressure goes down through
the<00:01:18.270> truck<00:01:18.510> and<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.930> through<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.200> truck<00:01:19.500> over

the truck and out through the truck over
here<00:01:19.980> this<00:01:20.340> distance<00:01:20.940> is<00:01:21.480> not<00:01:22.320> around<00:01:22.860> here's

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
here this distance is not around here's

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.550 
here this distance is not around here's
not<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.610> 4<00:01:23.790> inches<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.360> discussed<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.080> my

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
not the 4 inches that I discussed in my

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740 
not the 4 inches that I discussed in my
column<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.220> August<00:01:26.580> part<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.480> advantage

column in August part of the advantage

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.020 
column in August part of the advantage
or<00:01:28.080> part<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.440> what<00:01:28.740> makes<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.160> work<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
or part of what makes it work is the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.150 
or part of what makes it work is the
fact<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:30.600> all<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.870> stuff<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
fact that there's all this stuff in the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.910 
fact that there's all this stuff in the
way<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:33.240> slows<00:01:33.780> down<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.290> sound<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.800> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
way that slows down the sound so it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.370 
way that slows down the sound so it
isn't<00:01:35.160> a<00:01:35.280> free<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.240> easy<00:01:36.360> path<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.050> get<00:01:37.200> out

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
isn't a free and easy path to get out

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.680 
isn't a free and easy path to get out
one<00:01:37.740> other<00:01:37.890> thing<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.190> did<00:01:38.370> was<00:01:38.550> I<00:01:38.700> installed

were<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.520> speaker<00:01:59.760> and<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.540> last<00:02:00.750> two<00:02:00.960> pins

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
were the speaker and the last two pins

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.470 
were the speaker and the last two pins
were<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.590> front<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:01.980> rear<00:02:02.130> light<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
were the front and rear light so that

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.630 
were the front and rear light so that
way<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.290> plug<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.130> plugged<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.640> backwards

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
way if the plug is plugged in backwards

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.550 
way if the plug is plugged in backwards
against<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.819> polarity<00:02:09.269> dots<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.470> if

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
against the polarity dots if it's but if

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.750 
against the polarity dots if it's but if
it's<00:02:10.710> plugged<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.069> backwards<00:02:11.490> all<00:02:11.610> that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
it's plugged in backwards all that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.040 
it's plugged in backwards all that
happens<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.240> at<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> front<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> rear

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
happens is at the front and the rear

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.690 
happens is at the front and the rear
light<00:02:13.260> get<00:02:13.500> reversed

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
light get reversed

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.640 
light get reversed
and<00:02:14.790> everything<00:02:15.690> still<00:02:15.959> works<00:02:15.990> just<00:02:16.410> fine

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and everything still works just fine

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.710 
and everything still works just fine
before<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:17.760> plug<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.450> let<00:02:18.569> you

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
before we plug this in and let you

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.380 
before we plug this in and let you
listen<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.440> wanted<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.770> show<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.010> one

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
listen to it I wanted to show you one

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
installation and that is the spacing

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.110 
installation and that is the spacing
between<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:25.319> speaker<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.610> top<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:27.030> the

between the speaker and the top of the
gear<00:02:27.300> tower<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:28.319> need<00:02:28.500> enough<00:02:28.739> room<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.069> there

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
gear tower you need enough room in there

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.589 
gear tower you need enough room in there
for<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.400> gear<00:02:29.550> tower<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:29.970> able<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.239> pivot

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
for the gear tower to be able to pivot

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.449 
for the gear tower to be able to pivot
as<00:02:30.750> Lokomotiv<00:02:31.440> goes<00:02:31.590> up<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:31.950> down<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.190> track

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
as Lokomotiv goes up and down the track

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.540 
as Lokomotiv goes up and down the track
not<00:02:33.090> hit<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.450> speaker<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.020> know<00:02:34.739> before<00:02:35.370> I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
not hit the speaker I know before I

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.760 
not hit the speaker I know before I
started<00:02:36.270> being<00:02:36.480> wary<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.020> several<00:02:37.500> times

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
started being wary of this several times

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.850 
started being wary of this several times
I<00:02:37.920> assembled<00:02:38.600> decoders<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.560> couldn't

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
I assembled decoders and then I couldn't

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.509 
I assembled decoders and then I couldn't
get<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.519> shell<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.209> or<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.560> truck<00:02:44.250> wouldn't

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
get the shell on or the truck wouldn't

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.160 
get the shell on or the truck wouldn't
pivot<00:02:44.849> freely<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.720> was<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> problem

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
pivot freely and so it was a problem

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.370 
pivot freely and so it was a problem
going<00:02:46.500> down<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.830> track<00:02:47.150> how<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.870> set

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
going down the track how I do this set

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.680 
going down the track how I do this set
this<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.739> when<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.340> was<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.090> process<00:02:51.269> of

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
this up when I was in the process of

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.410 
this up when I was in the process of
designing<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.380> installation<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.420> positioned

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
designing this installation I positioned

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.729 
designing this installation I positioned
the<00:02:54.480> speaker<00:02:54.810> roughly<00:02:55.200> where<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.410> thought<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
the speaker roughly where I thought it

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.910 
the speaker roughly where I thought it
would<00:02:55.950> go<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.700> took<00:02:56.760> my<00:02:56.910> calipers<00:02:57.510> and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
would go and I took my calipers and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.320 
would go and I took my calipers and
brought<00:02:58.920> them<00:02:59.100> down<00:02:59.280> until<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.790> had<00:03:00.090> a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
brought them down until I had a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.250 
brought them down until I had a
dimension<00:03:00.989> here<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.900> equal<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.080> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
dimension here that is equal to the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.050 
dimension here that is equal to the
depth<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.459> bottom<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
depth of the to the bottom of the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.380 
depth of the to the bottom of the
speaker<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.590> shell<00:03:07.799> here<00:03:08.160> and

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
speaker in the in the shell here and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.170 
speaker in the in the shell here and
then<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.420> take<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.190> dimension<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.880> stand

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
then I take that dimension and I stand

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.940 
then I take that dimension and I stand
it<00:03:12.299> up<00:03:12.420> where<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> shell<00:03:12.930> rests<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> frame

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
it up where the shell rests on the frame

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.710 
it up where the shell rests on the frame
and<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.670> can<00:03:14.850> see<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.330> plenty<00:03:15.540> of

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and I can see that I have plenty of

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.880 
and I can see that I have plenty of
clearance<00:03:15.989> between<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:18.590> speaker<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
clearance between the speaker and the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.670 
clearance between the speaker and the
gear<00:03:20.040> tower<00:03:20.250> over<00:03:20.609> here<00:03:20.790> all<00:03:21.720> right<00:03:21.870> with<00:03:22.500> that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
gear tower over here all right with that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.080 
gear tower over here all right with that
out<00:03:22.829> of<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:22.980> way<00:03:23.070> let's<00:03:23.340> fire<00:03:23.549> this<00:03:23.730> guy<00:03:23.910> up

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
out of the way let's fire this guy up

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.600 
out of the way let's fire this guy up
and<00:03:24.329> let<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.200> listen<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:26.100> him

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.610 

I<00:03:32.050> love<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:33.260> startup<00:03:33.710> Wow<00:03:35.440> there<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.530> hear

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
I love that startup Wow there you hear

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.690 
I love that startup Wow there you hear
the<00:03:36.680> engine<00:03:37.040> idling<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:39.100> let<00:03:40.100> me<00:03:40.190> turn<00:03:40.400> on<00:03:40.460> the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
the engine idling and let me turn on the

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.040 
the engine idling and let me turn on the
bell<00:03:40.940> here<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:41.480> give<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:43.450> high<00:03:44.450> frequency

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
bell here and give you a high frequency

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.810 
bell here and give you a high frequency
sound<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.680> listen<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.130> as<00:03:46.250> well<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.610> you<00:03:46.700> have

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
sound to listen to as well so you have

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.660 
sound to listen to as well so you have
low<00:03:47.000> frequencies<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.540> high<00:03:47.690> frequencies<00:03:48.670> now

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
low frequencies and high frequencies now

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.790 
low frequencies and high frequencies now
remember<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.390> said<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:51.260> sound<00:03:51.530> coming

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
remember I said that the sound coming

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.680 
remember I said that the sound coming
out<00:03:51.980> through<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.640> bottom<00:03:52.970> here<00:03:53.210> is<00:03:53.390> going<00:03:53.600> to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
out through the bottom here is going to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.900 
out through the bottom here is going to
go<00:03:53.870> through<00:03:54.680> here<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:55.550> that's<00:03:55.700> going<00:03:55.850> to

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
go through here and so that's going to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.270 
go through here and so that's going to
present<00:03:56.240> some<00:03:56.270> obstruction<00:03:57.050> to<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.170> sound<00:03:57.500> so

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
present some obstruction to the sound so

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.310 
present some obstruction to the sound so
actually<00:03:59.150> what<00:03:59.330> will<00:03:59.750> hear<00:03:59.990> when<00:04:00.140> this

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
actually what will hear when this

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.080 
actually what will hear when this
completely<00:04:00.860> assembled<00:04:01.340> will<00:04:01.520> not<00:04:01.700> be<00:04:01.910> the

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
completely assembled will not be the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.270 
completely assembled will not be the
sound<00:04:02.300> you're<00:04:02.540> hearing<00:04:02.570> now<00:04:02.980> it'll<00:04:03.980> be<00:04:04.070> more

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
sound you're hearing now it'll be more

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.710 
sound you're hearing now it'll be more
like<00:04:04.460> what<00:04:04.670> it'll<00:04:04.850> be<00:04:04.940> when<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:05.180> put<00:04:05.360> my<00:04:05.390> hand

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
like what it'll be when I put my hand

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.620 
like what it'll be when I put my hand
underneath<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.770> kind<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.540> obstruct<00:04:08.540> that

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
underneath it and kind of obstruct that

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:22.870 
underneath it and kind of obstruct that
airflow<00:04:09.290> so<00:04:10.130> let's<00:04:10.760> let's<00:04:11.120> listen<00:04:21.700> notice<00:04:22.700> the

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
airflow so let's let's listen notice the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.570 
airflow so let's let's listen notice the
level<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.530> all<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.830> sounds<00:04:25.130> comes<00:04:25.370> up

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
level of all of the sounds comes up

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.390 
level of all of the sounds comes up
making<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.210> belt<00:04:26.440> too<00:04:27.440> loud<00:04:27.650> actually<00:04:28.220> I'll

making the belt too loud actually I'll

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
making the belt too loud actually I'll
have<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.670> adjust<00:04:28.940> that<00:04:29.210> later<00:04:29.510> but<00:04:30.200> also<00:04:30.470> the

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
have to adjust that later but also the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.480 
have to adjust that later but also the
base<00:04:32.420> of<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:33.050> rumble<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.620> diesel<00:04:34.160> Rumble

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
base of the rumble the diesel Rumble

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.390 
base of the rumble the diesel Rumble
comes<00:04:34.730> up<00:04:34.930> significantly<00:04:36.010> that's<00:04:37.010> how<00:04:37.340> you

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
comes up significantly that's how you

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.580 
comes up significantly that's how you
get<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.700> sound<00:04:37.880> out<00:04:38.150> of<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.390> model

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590
