 Can you imagine ever finding a chest with a hidden treasure 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.599
 I'm going to make one of plasticine 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.549

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.009

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.999
 and plasticine red yellow black white pink 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.169
 sic uses a flag of red plasticine and model with your hands a drawer 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.169
 rectangular smoothing the surfaces with your fingers 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.050
 with another piece of the same color prepare a thick sheet of the same size as 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 the drawer bending it a little to make the lid of the ko 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.420
 I also remember to make the sides of the lid so that the chest can be 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.490

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.320

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.330
 From your hand 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.260
 When you're ready, do nothing with your fingers and surround it with the chest 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.160
 with two parallel quotes at the ends 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.350
 you have to surround yourself both the drawer and the lid 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 a small bar of the same color will serve to make the lock of the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.960
 chest 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.780
 pressed a little with your fingers to give it a rounded shape at one end 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.830
 and elongated in the other 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.980
 with the black plasticine prepare a few discs and put them in the 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.300
 yellow ribbons as if they were iron nails 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.790
 to make the handles prepare four yellow discs and join them with two threads 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.260
 blacks folding a little 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
 place the handles on the sides of the chest and I learn 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.760
 with the yellow plasticine plus many small discs to make it look 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.760
 gold coins and place them inside the chest 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.610
 The more coins behind, the better the treasure 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.080

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.480

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.540

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.330
