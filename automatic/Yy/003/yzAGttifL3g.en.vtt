00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.730
 I present you a macbook pro 13 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.389
 inches it's the last so screen 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.770
 retina as you see on 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.270
 the front of the box so the pro macbook 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:28.199
 close on the right side 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:33.690
 the little shiny apple on the top 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:37.410
 just written macbook pro is so still 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.989
 the little apple on the left side and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:48.539
 on the bottom has always written mac pro in 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:52.559
 black up on the bottom nothing very 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.309
 interesting apart from a few spec of the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.309
 macbook pro 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.280
 I'm going to unpack 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.060
 so obviously the mac you have the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:38.270
 little tongue here to remove it 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:48.680
 so we will come back to it just then what 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:52.520
 we find we will start there so 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.390
 the starter kit just with the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.270
 small foot towel to wipe the screen 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.270
 mac with the little apple here 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.660
 side so there you have the charger 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.660
 sector 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.380
 so that's classic 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.560
 I speak to make a focus 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.560
 So that 's 63 complexion 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:59.270
 So here we go with the magsafe 2 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.520
 I will stop there so I say it on 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.150
 all my videos new videos 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.230
 with the microphone I use software 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.110
 special on my iphone because I 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.120
 finished only with my iphone 5s and 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.260
 honestly I have a lot of trouble 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.890
 make adjustments that his 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:35.560
 software 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:42.210
 it's pretty swollen so what 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.210
 just find there so the second part 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.989
 we could do it better 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.660
 I find it catastrophic the second 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:07.700
 simply part of the reader's 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:09.950
 sector charger drive up does you 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.340
 snap it you put it eouzan slice 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.320
 just here if ever this 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.060
 wiring is not long enough for you 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:23.300
 apple provides you this one so it's 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.420
 exactly the same principle except that it 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.840
 you do a little more thread so here 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.890
 very nice finish it's apple is 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.890
 high-end product 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:49.480
 well, we will not stop there 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.480
 side of the mac so 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:05:07.680
 hop obviously since it's new there 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.680
 there is always that 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:25.810
 we do not see anything at all so I put it 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.670
 aside because otherwise we see it 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:33.550
 strictly nothing then so there you have 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.270
 the game touchpad allows you to zoom in 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.090
 to widen etc. 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.730
 you have the backlit keyboard with 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.820
 the keys right here to lower the 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.610
 brightness increase it so put pause 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.030
 reading in music and his hotels are 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.640
 bearish lessons or underpants 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:58.650
 after you have a classic keyboard and 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.650
 the touch to the human 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:16.199
 so after you have the setting of the 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.199
 mak returned all your accounts and so on 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.449
 we do not want I can do you 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.669
 wait longer I stopped 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.120
 this is just to show you here 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:47.759
 unpacking a 13-inch macbook pro 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:52.370
 3 3 13 hockey 13.3 this is I want to 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.370
 set up soon
