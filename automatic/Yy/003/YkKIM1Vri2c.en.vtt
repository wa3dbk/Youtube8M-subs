simulation<00:00:04.210> is<00:00:04.330> designed<00:00:04.840> to<00:00:05.229> a<00:00:05.830> couple

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.130 
simulation is designed to a couple

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.190 
simulation is designed to a couple
different<00:00:06.370> things<00:00:06.399> designed<00:00:06.850> to<00:00:07.180> give<00:00:07.990> the

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.200 
different things designed to give the

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.900 
different things designed to give the
students<00:00:08.709> some<00:00:08.740> situations<00:00:09.459> that<00:00:09.580> they<00:00:09.730> might

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
students some situations that they might

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.660 
students some situations that they might
not<00:00:10.090> see<00:00:10.389> in<00:00:10.809> clinical<00:00:11.230> and<00:00:11.380> one<00:00:12.340> of<00:00:12.429> the<00:00:12.490> most

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
not see in clinical and one of the most

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.140 
not see in clinical and one of the most
important<00:00:13.210> aspects<00:00:13.780> of<00:00:14.049> simulation<00:00:14.799> is<00:00:15.190> that

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
important aspects of simulation is that

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.970 
important aspects of simulation is that
they<00:00:16.299> cannot<00:00:16.509> hurt<00:00:16.689> this<00:00:16.810> patient<00:00:17.200> and<00:00:17.740> it<00:00:17.860> is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
they cannot hurt this patient and it is

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.189 
they cannot hurt this patient and it is
a<00:00:18.009> learning<00:00:18.430> experience<00:00:18.580> so<00:00:19.539> they<00:00:19.720> can<00:00:19.930> learn

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
a learning experience so they can learn

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.050 
a learning experience so they can learn
things<00:00:20.770> that<00:00:20.949> went<00:00:21.160> well<00:00:21.340> things<00:00:21.760> that<00:00:21.820> might

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
things that went well things that might

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.330 
things that went well things that might
do<00:00:22.240> differently<00:00:22.630> and<00:00:22.990> we<00:00:23.650> like<00:00:23.859> for<00:00:24.160> them<00:00:24.310> to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
do differently and we like for them to

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.599 
do differently and we like for them to
take<00:00:25.029> away<00:00:25.180> something<00:00:25.599> new<00:00:26.560> or<00:00:27.010> kind<00:00:27.460> of

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
take away something new or kind of

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.519 
take away something new or kind of
brings<00:00:27.910> together<00:00:28.150> lecture<00:00:28.810> in<00:00:29.019> the<00:00:29.140> clinical

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
brings together lecture in the clinical

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.580 
brings together lecture in the clinical
setting<00:00:30.519> into<00:00:31.449> the<00:00:31.539> simulation<00:00:31.869> lab<00:00:32.019> and<00:00:32.379> they

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
setting into the simulation lab and they

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.380 
setting into the simulation lab and they
can<00:00:32.800> do<00:00:33.010> whatever<00:00:33.430> they<00:00:33.699> want<00:00:33.879> in<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.210> lab

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
can do whatever they want in the lab

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.350 
can do whatever they want in the lab
they<00:00:34.989> can<00:00:35.170> give<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.409> wrong<00:00:35.530> medication<00:00:36.360> that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
they can give the wrong medication that

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.660 
they can give the wrong medication that
they<00:00:37.659> couldn't<00:00:37.989> do<00:00:38.140> in<00:00:38.379> the<00:00:38.470> hospital<00:00:38.670> their

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
they couldn't do in the hospital their

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.009 
they couldn't do in the hospital their
instructor<00:00:40.150> would<00:00:40.269> stop<00:00:40.570> them

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
instructor would stop them

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:42.960 
instructor would stop them
I<00:00:41.049> don't<00:00:41.440> stop<00:00:41.680> them<00:00:41.890> I<00:00:42.070> let<00:00:42.339> them<00:00:42.460> do<00:00:42.640> it<00:00:42.670> I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
I don't stop them I let them do it I

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.490 
I don't stop them I let them do it I
like<00:00:43.360> them<00:00:43.510> because<00:00:43.600> then<00:00:43.989> I<00:00:44.019> think<00:00:44.320> they'll

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
like them because then I think they'll

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.640 
like them because then I think they'll
remember<00:00:45.299> when<00:00:46.299> they<00:00:46.510> go<00:00:46.629> out<00:00:46.809> there<00:00:47.080> not<00:00:47.619> to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
remember when they go out there not to

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.910 
remember when they go out there not to
do<00:00:47.890> that<00:00:48.040> again<00:00:48.269> so<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:49.690> it<00:00:49.839> is<00:00:50.049> a<00:00:50.350> learning

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
do that again so and it is a learning

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.280 
do that again so and it is a learning
experience<00:00:51.190> for<00:00:51.729> them<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.780> some<00:00:53.080> of<00:00:53.199> them

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
experience for them so and some of them

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.869 
experience for them so and some of them
realized<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:53.830> time<00:00:54.040> and<00:00:54.309> then<00:00:54.400> some<00:00:54.640> of<00:00:54.729> them

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
realized the time and then some of them

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.359 
realized the time and then some of them
don't<00:00:55.089> until<00:00:55.540> afterwards<00:00:56.019> until<00:00:56.949> we<00:00:57.070> discuss

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:57.369 
don't until afterwards until we discuss

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:59.579 
don't until afterwards until we discuss
it<00:00:57.580> they<00:00:58.030> learn<00:00:58.210> from<00:00:58.360> their<00:00:58.510> mistakes<00:00:58.839> when

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
it they learn from their mistakes when

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.469 
it they learn from their mistakes when
we<00:00:59.680> do<00:00:59.799> the<00:00:59.920> debriefing<00:01:00.369> what<00:01:00.580> I<00:01:00.610> find<00:01:01.000> when<00:01:01.449> I

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
we do the debriefing what I find when I

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.179 
we do the debriefing what I find when I
ask<00:01:01.750> them<00:01:02.019> things<00:01:02.290> that<00:01:02.409> they've<00:01:02.589> learned<00:01:02.860> a

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:03.189 
ask them things that they've learned a

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:04.619 
ask them things that they've learned a
lot<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.580> time<00:01:03.729> they<00:01:03.850> they<00:01:04.059> learn<00:01:04.390> from<00:01:04.420> their

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
lot of time they they learn from their

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.480 
lot of time they they learn from their
mistakes<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.290> they<00:01:05.799> say<00:01:05.950> I<00:01:05.979> will<00:01:06.189> never<00:01:06.280> make

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
mistakes and they say I will never make

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.610 
mistakes and they say I will never make
that<00:01:06.549> same<00:01:06.880> mistake<00:01:07.000> again<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:08.080> gets<00:01:08.290> easier

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
that same mistake again it gets easier

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.680 
that same mistake again it gets easier
it's<00:01:09.490> actually<00:01:09.790> a<00:01:09.850> lot<00:01:10.060> different<00:01:10.390> than<00:01:10.480> being

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
it's actually a lot different than being

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.480 
it's actually a lot different than being
in<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.870> hospital<00:01:11.020> but<00:01:11.740> actually<00:01:12.280> gets<00:01:12.430> you

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
in the hospital but actually gets you

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.250 
in the hospital but actually gets you
ready<00:01:12.580> for<00:01:12.730> summary<00:01:13.450> first<00:01:13.660> our<00:01:13.780> simulations

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
ready for summary first our simulations

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.930 
ready for summary first our simulations
as<00:01:14.320> we're<00:01:14.440> all<00:01:14.560> scared<00:01:14.800> and<00:01:15.070> we<00:01:15.670> had<00:01:15.790> no<00:01:15.910> idea

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
as we're all scared and we had no idea

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.760 
as we're all scared and we had no idea
what<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.300> say<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:16.720> then<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.260> kind<00:01:17.410> of<00:01:17.440> prepared

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
what to say and then it kind of prepared

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.140 
what to say and then it kind of prepared
us<00:01:17.890> for<00:01:17.920> when<00:01:18.160> we<00:01:18.220> do<00:01:18.340> go<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.550> hospital<00:01:18.970> and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
us for when we do go to the hospital and

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.030 
us for when we do go to the hospital and
then<00:01:19.630> now<00:01:20.050> it's<00:01:20.260> kind<00:01:20.470> of<00:01:20.500> like<00:01:20.620> it's<00:01:20.770> gotten<00:01:20.980> a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
then now it's kind of like it's gotten a

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.410 
then now it's kind of like it's gotten a
lot<00:01:21.130> easier<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:22.000> probably<00:01:22.240> harder

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
lot easier and it's probably harder

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.460 
lot easier and it's probably harder
doing<00:01:22.630> this<00:01:22.750> because<00:01:22.900> we're<00:01:23.080> not<00:01:23.170> talking<00:01:23.410> to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
doing this because we're not talking to

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.930 
doing this because we're not talking to
a<00:01:23.500> real<00:01:23.680> person<00:01:23.710> but<00:01:24.160> you<00:01:24.310> mean<00:01:24.430> gets<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:24.700> get

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
a real person but you mean gets it get

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.250 
a real person but you mean gets it get
it<00:01:25.150> takes<00:01:25.300> some<00:01:25.390> getting<00:01:25.570> used<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.900> definitely

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
it takes some getting used to definitely

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.250 
it takes some getting used to definitely
first<00:01:26.440> it's<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.130> little<00:01:27.160> scary<00:01:27.610> but<00:01:28.300> as<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.140> get

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
first it's a little scary but as you get

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.560 
first it's a little scary but as you get
used<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.650> it<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:30.010> know<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.550> becomes<00:01:31.150> easier

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
used to it you know it becomes easier

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.690 
used to it you know it becomes easier
I'm<00:01:31.960> more<00:01:32.380> nervous<00:01:32.409> at<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.040> simulation<00:01:33.490> than

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
I'm more nervous at the simulation than

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.730 
I'm more nervous at the simulation than
in<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.030> hospital<00:01:34.450> because<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.440> fact<00:01:35.650> that

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
in the hospital because of the fact that

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.830 
in the hospital because of the fact that
your<00:01:36.100> peers<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.850> your<00:01:36.970> professors<00:01:37.510> are<00:01:37.720> all

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
your peers and your professors are all

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.750 
your peers and your professors are all
there<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.170> they're<00:01:38.260> watching<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.100> it's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
there and they're watching you and it's

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.550 
there and they're watching you and it's
actually<00:01:40.060> more<00:01:40.180> nerve-wracking<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:41.380> was

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
actually more nerve-wracking it was

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.310 
actually more nerve-wracking it was
nerve-wracking<00:01:42.280> at<00:01:42.490> first<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.840> then<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:44.050> had<00:01:44.290> a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
nerve-wracking at first but then I had a

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.110 
nerve-wracking at first but then I had a
partner<00:01:44.710> so<00:01:45.040> like<00:01:45.250> we<00:01:45.370> kind<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.700> like<00:01:45.850> bounce

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
partner so like we kind of like bounce

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.330 
partner so like we kind of like bounce
back<00:01:46.479> off<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.870> each<00:01:47.020> other<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.380> like<00:01:47.860> we

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
back off of each other and like we

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.280 
back off of each other and like we
already<00:01:48.640> learned<00:01:48.820> this<00:01:49.000> stuff<00:01:49.240> in<00:01:49.390> class<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:49.990> I

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
already learned this stuff in class so I

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.950 
already learned this stuff in class so I
wasn't<00:01:51.040> completely<00:01:51.370> lost<00:01:51.790> each<00:01:52.300> year<00:01:52.330> occurs

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
wasn't completely lost each year occurs

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.440 
wasn't completely lost each year occurs
like<00:01:53.260> off<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.500> each<00:01:53.800> other<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.280> like<00:01:54.430> so<00:01:55.270> we'll

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
like off of each other and like so we'll

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.590 
like off of each other and like so we'll
get<00:01:55.659> better<00:01:55.810> experience<00:01:56.940> as<00:01:57.940> we<00:01:58.150> go<00:01:58.300> on<00:01:58.450> I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
get better experience as we go on I

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.570 
get better experience as we go on I
guess<00:01:58.920> no<00:01:59.920> yeah<00:02:00.130> it's<00:02:00.280> definitely

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
guess no yeah it's definitely

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.219 
guess no yeah it's definitely
challenging<00:02:00.700> every<00:02:01.690> wrong<00:02:01.870> it's<00:02:02.049> very

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
challenging every wrong it's very

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.350 
challenging every wrong it's very
challenging<00:02:02.500> um<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:04.000> definitely<00:02:04.090> the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
challenging um this is definitely the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.810 
challenging um this is definitely the
hardest<00:02:04.479> year<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:04.780> think<00:02:05.049> so<00:02:05.200> far<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:05.680> uh<00:02:05.820> but

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
hardest year I think so far and uh but

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.070 
hardest year I think so far and uh but
it's<00:02:07.030> with<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.360> combination<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.900> all<00:02:08.019> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
it's with the combination of all the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.660 
it's with the combination of all the
simulations<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.739> clinical<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:09.519> that

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
simulations and clinical I think that

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.830 
simulations and clinical I think that
we'll<00:02:09.789> be<00:02:09.879> well<00:02:10.030> prepared<00:02:10.179> from<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:10.599> have<00:02:10.780> to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
we'll be well prepared from we have to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.319 
we'll be well prepared from we have to
graduate
