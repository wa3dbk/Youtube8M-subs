00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
but it doesn't congeal in the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.760 
but it doesn't congeal in the
refrigerator<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.420> stays<00:01:21.630> nice<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.110> liquidy

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
refrigerator it stays nice and liquidy

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
always want to mince your garlic first

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.020 
always want to mince your garlic first
and<00:01:33.600> then<00:01:34.200> let<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.530> sit<00:01:34.770> around<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:35.909> like

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and then let it sit around not for like

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.969 
and then let it sit around not for like
a<00:01:36.060> long<00:01:36.299> time<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.840> maybe<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.259> five<00:01:37.590> ten

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
a long time but maybe like five ten

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.039 
a long time but maybe like five ten
minutes<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.030> oxidizing<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:39.930> you

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
minutes so that is oxidizing if you

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.420 
minutes so that is oxidizing if you
don't<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.590> you're<00:01:40.829> not<00:01:40.920> gonna<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.250> all

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
don't do that you're not gonna get all

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.069 
don't do that you're not gonna get all
the<00:01:41.579> health<00:01:41.759> benefits<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.689> I've<00:01:42.780> got<00:01:42.960> my
