diplomatic<00:01:44.750> yeah<00:01:45.350> but<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.860> think<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:46.880> was

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
diplomatic yeah but I think that it was

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.950 
diplomatic yeah but I think that it was
one<00:01:47.120> of<00:01:47.150> those<00:01:47.270> things<00:01:47.480> than<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:47.840> that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
one of those things than it that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.420 
one of those things than it that
probably<00:01:48.290> at<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:48.470> time<00:01:48.770> I<00:01:48.800> didn't<00:01:49.190> see<00:01:49.220> it

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
probably at that time I didn't see it

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.830 
probably at that time I didn't see it
but<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.610> was<00:01:49.700> probably<00:01:49.940> for<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.180> best

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
but it was probably for the best

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.050 
but it was probably for the best
no<00:01:51.050> because<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.680> did<00:01:52.160> but<00:01:52.310> I've<00:01:52.550> become<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:52.880> bit

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
no because I did but I've become a bit

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.670 
no because I did but I've become a bit
