have to give him my share I think we

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.550 
have to give him my share I think we
used<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.390> be<00:02:18.510> able<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.780> treat<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> first<00:02:19.319> week

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
used to be able to treat the first week

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.160 
used to be able to treat the first week
as<00:02:19.799> qualifying<00:02:20.549> attempts<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.120> runs<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.750> then

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
as qualifying attempts and runs and then

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.110 
as qualifying attempts and runs and then
the<00:02:22.260> second<00:02:22.650> week<00:02:22.769> is<00:02:22.980> race<00:02:23.220> runs<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.000> now

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
the second week is race runs and now

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.520 
the second week is race runs and now
you've<00:02:24.269> got<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.450> try<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.720> cram<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.049> all<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.349> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
you've got to try and cram it all in and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.650 
you've got to try and cram it all in and
it's<00:02:25.860> harder<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.220> use<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.910> race<00:02:27.090> run<00:02:27.360> tires

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
it's harder to use the race run tires

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.910 
it's harder to use the race run tires
that<00:02:28.019> have<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.380> have<00:02:28.440> had<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> run<00:02:28.890> of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
that have that have had a run of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.589 
that have that have had a run of
qualifying<00:02:29.459> one<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.790> them<00:02:29.910> already<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.239> you

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
qualifying one on them already so you

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.089
