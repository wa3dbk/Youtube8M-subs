00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Profitable beef and milk production program
State of Jalisco

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.700
The main factor that impacts the cattle production profitability in Mexico

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.600
is the price volatility in livestock feeding concentrates

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.009
Even tought Jalisco is
The first producer of milk

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.200
it occupies the first place with 18% of
national production and the second place

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.859
in production of beef, the small
and medium farmers face serious

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.900
problemas, mostly
high production cost in the production

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.849
of milk and beef because the overuse of concentrates

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.399
mismanagment of prairies in
beef cattle, lack of

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.160
technical assitance in the ranches
with small and mÃ©dium farmers, thereafter

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.100
there is low production
both in milk and meat

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.850
the only choice they have is

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.140
stop using concetrates

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.890
but not stopping the use for stop the use,
we have to search for crops that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.600
in nutritional matter meet the concentrate nutrients

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.200
with alternative crops, in this case
sunflower, the ideal is to search for better

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.500
cuality and quantity in pastures and with that, reduce

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.450
as much as posible the use of concentrate

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.900
there are zones very different from each other,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.950
in the case of milk is 
very different than beef cattle

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.000
in the case of  beef it about getting the most out 
of praires, grasslands or what

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.790
the farmer has

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300
so we take little account of the farmer

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.200
we start with a diagnosis, this diagnosis give 
us the key elements

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.550
to know what to do in the different phases
of beef production

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.500
FIRA decided to implement this program
in the state of Jalisco

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.080
trying to help the farmers

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.800
with a  program of technical assistance and training trough technical advisors

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.150
the farmers can improve their
livestock management practices in

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.310
milk and beef production and be
more efficient in their production system

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.960
before FIRA's advice
I was giving around 33 pounds of concentrate per day per cow

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.030
in the trough

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.300
after the advice I am saving around 12 pounds

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.060
per cow per day

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.800
So, the only way we could improve

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.140
is in the feeding managment

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.800
and there is where FIRA come and help
us with technology

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.700
so we can more effective the foder pounds
that we give to the cows

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.500
for example in milk we are trying to improve the profitability of  production

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.519
we have achieved an increase of 
production up to

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.200
28% and cheapen the production cost
up to 40% in

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.620
beef cattle we achieved taking the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.200
production cost from 33 pesos
per kilo to 22, 23 pesos

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.300
in the case of beef we have reduced
the production cost

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.239
between 20 and 25 per cent

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.189
now, with this new system

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.979
in which FIRA has help us

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:41.239
we had encounter super
extraordinary results, we weaned

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.059
at 8 months

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:46.800
and in 8 months we sold around
an average of 300 kilos

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.200
but we are selling now around 411 kilos

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200
the success of this model comes from

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.609
fatting the calf in diferent phases

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.629
each phase adjust  according the
particular needs of each farm or enterprise

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:04.409
because I began with a production around 
125 stomach from which I get

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.000
only 45% births, nowadays
I have around 80% births

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.270
and we are going for the 85%

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.000
and if there are no technicians, you could not 
know if the cow is pregnant

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.159
and the cow reaches the year and it isn't pregnant

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.169
how much money are we losing

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.400
that is why is very important that FIRA's technitians are
working with

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.079
us

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.709
The technicians come and then

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.600
they tell us what to do next

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.619
that is why I believe that there are no limits

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.200
from 5 or 6 cows, to 50 or 100 it can be done

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.919
this program has helps us
 to improve the quality parameters

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.190
that the industry require and with that
farmers can get the benefits

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.119
that industry gives for quality products

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.400
With the FIRA's program

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.310
somatic cells have decreased
reductase minutes have increased

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.180
and above all the fat and protein parameters
have been better

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.809
we are placing around  343&nbsp;423 gallons every month

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:03.700
we are working in a project with SORIANA
so we can offer there

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.900
our products

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.629
this is what we are searching for

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.729
and I believe that we are in the right way
because I believe that

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:15.709
in Mexico we can make the beef pound cheaper than in any other 
part of the world

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.400
the calves and heifers

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.459
that I have bought that where bread within FIRA's program

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.969
fatten faster

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:25.090
I get a better colored meat

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.100
FIRA deserves my respects, I tell everyone
to get near FIRA

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.500
For me FIRA's support means a lot

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.500
because without them, I would be stuck

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.659
I would have dissapear

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.000
I personally recommend you

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.300
getting close to FIRA both for
seaking credit lines and

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.100
asking for technologic advise
