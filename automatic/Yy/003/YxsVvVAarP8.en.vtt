used to do one hundred my room trip
every<00:01:08.430> month<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.909> come<00:01:09.150> by<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> big<00:01:09.900> block<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.439> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.420 

and<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.910> has<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.480> marzipan<00:01:26.140> saw<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.130> scent

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.890 

again<00:02:09.890> most<00:02:10.460> of<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.120> going<00:02:11.210> off<00:02:11.660> to

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
again most of this is going off to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.750 
again most of this is going off to
someone<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.930> half<00:02:18.140> auntie<00:02:18.980> wrapped<00:02:19.250> up<00:02:19.520> if

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
someone and a half auntie wrapped up if

I<00:02:47.340> don't<00:02:48.340> know<00:02:48.460> why<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.760> do<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.810> guess<00:02:50.320> it

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
I don't know why I do this I guess it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.140 
I don't know why I do this I guess it
