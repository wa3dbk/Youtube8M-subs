 Hello this video is to show you how 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.150
 change the menu and background 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:12.429
 desktop to our android computer 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.789
 in a comment I was told of the video 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.710
 past where I did the analysis of this 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.500
 computer with android as it had done 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.470
 to change the menu in this way 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.840
 Well the first thing they have to do is 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.620
 download this application that is called 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.620
 a lounge 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.890
 and then this one called james 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.750
 after stopping these two 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.160
 downloaded applications we have to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.160
 go to the second 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.760
 and here we will see the variety of 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.410
 themes that we can download some are 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.410
 payments and others are free 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.750
 at least I already have here some 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.300
 installed then after the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.580
 install open only this application 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.390
 and they go to the part where it says 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.390
 installed 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.920
 what they have to do is then stop 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.920
 the installed ones to apply 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.160
 at least this 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.100
 see how I change the style of the menu 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.300
 here I also change a little the only thing is 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.220
 that I have the same wallpaper 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.670
 then you do not notice much difference 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.670
 but let's try another topic 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.650
 at least with this 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.950
 see how the icons change them out 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.950
 as an edge quoted 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.830
 here the wallpaper if I change 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.120
 a browser rooms and this is the drawer of 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.120
 applications that is the menu 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.310
 and here we have all our 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.940
 applications like watching on youtube 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.920
 azulito also several things I think 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.150
 very nice at least on twitter 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.280
 It is very cool 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.340
 and well this has been all for the video 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.340
 today I hope you have served 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.340
 Thank you
