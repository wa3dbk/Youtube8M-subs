00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:11.010
 it's ridiculous artistry me 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.780
 Must give him a crazy fak lut xbox one game 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.700
 a reactor point 1 hour 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.029
 what a swedish website is that says that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.410
 the xbox one in the nordic countries 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.410
 are sweden denmark and norway 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.650
 yes it will not be released early next year 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 but only actually q3 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.119
 it would therefore be next September 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 year and we well then logical conclusion 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.960
 would be that it is also true for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.530
 the Netherlands and that is such a logical one 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.149
 conclusion that yes that that rock hard 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 Truth has also penetrated 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.800
 at many publishers to microsoft itself 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.780
 have phoned around a bit 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.000
 asked around and listed what 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 well some problems problems 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.140
 but actually in it 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.789
 well for me personally as a gamer 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.949
 I of course something of god of the wave 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.750
 I get angry because I'm not serious 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.579
 it is taken to look at what you me the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 I can't get hot here in the Netherlands xbox 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.710
 one copper box and supports that pussy 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.229
 Kinect but not Dutch what is possible 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.920
 I already care that so use it 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.020
 on the other hand 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.310
 Mark Sat said all the time 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.930
 yes the reason we postpone it one 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.130
 Certain countries is because we want that 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.369
 kinect 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.380
 supported the local language 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.909
 Well, I have something to do fine fine fine 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.150
 that also your max it is a huge 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.310
 company make sure that optimum experience 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.200
 like you to me that so too 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.360
 is supplied 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.220
 but not to switch off the entire console 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.380
 bring at the time that that is not 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.610
 succeeds in a country like the Netherlands and that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.689
 also applies to those for countries like 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.759
 Denmark and Sweden 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.280
 everyone generally speaks there 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.110
 Pleasure English to Kinect in English 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.479
 to use 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.600
 and apart from that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.799
 yes from me he may connect who need 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.890
 not there 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.600
 but good if you know that then one 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.219
 wonder why microsoft itself up 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.590
 shoots the card 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.969
 because yes at the same time here the me 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.720
 sprayed flame is not for sale 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.020
 I hear from friends 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.840
 known 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.219
 friends retailers that in germany and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.310
 in france the 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.530
 the finex and the media market and saturn that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.330
 there are really pallets with xbox one's 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.640
 there is enough stock 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.709
 this is not very fast at all 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.750
 that constant iq just buy there so me 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.160
 exactly why it ja 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.010
 chips so they don't have too many 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.480
 to the Netherlands and then I have a round 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.160
 made by retailers in the Netherlands 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.690
 have requested warm import you 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.730
 I just didn't manage to operate 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.910
 for they would we have thought often 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.370
 problem is on the xbox one itself on that 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.530
 hardware then no profit is made 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.319
 who is the purchase price for the hard way 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.680
 so high that it 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.670
 yes it really doesn't matter or 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.260
 late would just be no profit on it 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.660
 made 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.590
 especially if you do that through 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.209
 brokers that again 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.680
 put ten on top of that or something 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.329
 then you should really think about it then stay 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.209
 so no gain on it or you suffer a loss 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.500
 on the sale of a console and that the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.150
 Media market are the set to be excited 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.829
 in the Netherlands in position if they are direct 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.989
 buy the market with at market view 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.790
 another ten dollar or 20 euro profit on one 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.280
 console what you would call prefer to 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.450
 the other side they don't want 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.250
 they are also not waiting for it 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.139
 nag you know blue if there is none 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.889
 support is from microsoft is it 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.500
 difficult to 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.450
 do guarantee and deliver service 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.220
 and I know a lot about what needs that back 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.250
 German is not such a problem 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.079
 but well seeded oops no sentences true 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.510
 the real problems with that is with 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.010
 the major publishers in the Netherlands that race 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.889
 the exhibitions 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.799
 the you peace or they all those parties that 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.599
 release software for the xbox one and 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.739
 which now just targets then 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.670
 see it evaporate for years because they have 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.349
 something like that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.690
 imagine that early next year 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.239
 fifa world cup comes true, whatever 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.579
 the conti for the PC and the playstation 3 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.430
 and the playstation 4 and xbox one xbox 360 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.169
 and so it all prevents but yes 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.549
 selling xbox one version gasunie 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.290
 to the seed is normally sat 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.810
 forty fifty thousand copies there 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.280
 of selling now does not mean that 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.380
 that 's just less going to put that 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.530
 so they get less marketing budget 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.470
 from america that they are so less yes 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.690
 can do that netherlands but also that 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.540
 they have fewer arguments for that game 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.989
 stores 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.340
 now the game does not occur of course 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.970
 to put the xbox one in stores here 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.789
 So 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.380
 retailers are therefore disappointed 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.509
 consumers learned that from okay like you 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.919
 who wants to have fifa world cup then must 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.360
 you order it in England or in 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.080
 Germany or anywhere else where they put it 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.490
 have it 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.530
 so the consumer who is being taught again 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.699
 from you you have to do import like you 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.910
 the newest shit we have then you should 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.500
 do import well that was 10 years ago 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.660
 also for the playstation example 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.580
 all Sony games really came for a year 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.050
 out sooner in america than here 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.729
 so everyone started to copy and to 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.919
 importing them just wasn't 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.449
 good for the mystery siri against something like that 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.460
 on the one hand 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.039
 Consumers are being chased away from ours 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.250
 Dutch stores in second place 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.320
 publishers yes those who need it with less 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.070
 do that go less we sell less 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.750
 marketing budget yes you know they star it 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.330
 is not all good people should start 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.889
 being fired means jobs that run out 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.919
 the tour side are just 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.229
 all extremely painful all of them 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.449
 and only because microsoft 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.500
 fucking kinect in dutch will and 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.090
 well it doesn't agree if you have one 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.349
 microsoft guilt you know because i mean 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.400
 of course they can kinect in it 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:20.909
 Dutch and it all didn't work 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.860
 a difficult one 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:26.340
 it simply indicates that he is industry 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.800
 not healthy is that yes that we are 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.449
 apparently live in a world in which 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.620
 Sony and Microsoft the only two players 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.260
 are what it's really about 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.460
 the Netherlands and one of the two that big 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.330
 towel in the ring something new from me 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.710
 do not remember 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.120
 and sonia that can't even be enough 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.220
 playstation to the netherlands 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.560
 each to meet the demand 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.810
 so yes it's just about one and already 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.070
 that is yes, I actually watch something 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.110
 just very sad of a club like 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.550
 Anything you know I get it 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.810
 microsoft so they hate how 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.620
 the Netherlands is a bit important 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.449
 to become 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.860
 I know a lot in five years time there will be 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.419
 a few hundred thousand xbox one's 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.979
 that is so important that you are sold 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.720
 gives me that dutch office it 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.320
 just seems to lose what should that 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.909
 well and I understand they say that 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.630
 but on all sides I also have something like that 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:11.820
 You should also get something give your fans what 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.310
 You also need to realize that each 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.380
 become 800,000 xbox 360 in the Netherlands 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.790
 sold you eight hundred thousand 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.190
 fans here you really know people who 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.110
 for the picked find the cool one and go 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.370
 Now all of you are going to say that from him 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.380
 you know what you are not that important 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.660
 that you just don't juice it or you know it 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.070
 you are someone yes you want it 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.950
 if you have dead rising 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.780
 plays that you fuck and you know that shit 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.220
 that's just that frustration that one 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.140
 that dutch gadgets already 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.030
 difficult just has it sometime 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.620
 from and where young but 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.920
 just because microsoft kinect and it 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.050
 my ourselves i haha ​​ok for just 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.740
 very very very sad of but good 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.740
 I just wanted to lose
