difference<00:05:01.270> between<00:05:01.660> wanting<00:05:02.199> to<00:05:02.349> win<00:05:02.560> a

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
difference between wanting to win a

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.159 
difference between wanting to win a
match<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.729> defeat<00:05:04.120> your<00:05:04.300> opponent<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.990> I

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169

always tried to win every match so in
such<00:05:08.860> a<00:05:08.889> way<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.280> person<00:05:09.340> never<00:05:09.729> wants
