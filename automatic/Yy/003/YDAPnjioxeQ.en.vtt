00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.180
 hi to all guys here in china done 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.570
 who speaks to you today, I show you the order 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.790
 build a small gym before 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.190
 all at once that of this piece of two 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.440
 of these pieces 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.420
 it takes two we say in these 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.420
 drawing the barrel of the weapon 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:50.260
 this law pieces will serve to 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:57.540
 join them I always purchase one 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.540
 kind of cross must be put 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.850
 here he put it inside 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.380
 here you could purchase 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:34.840
 there is such a thing look if then 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:36.729
 they must have a rod look then 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.830
 we can trigger 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:49.710
 then here you see the bed this serves 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.710
 to close it then given 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:12.220
 with this make the mechanism of pil 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:14.580
 read well almost two will be needed 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.580
 these 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.970
 obviously a rubber band 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:03:02.609
 having said that the water is then finally you 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.939
 you will also have the opportunity to decide 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:08.620
 there is a spring to enlarge or to fade 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:13.440
 then decide then the power but now 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:17.670
 puts a fairly normal power 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:22.209
 tula will pull the power will be high 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:30.269
 the greater the excused power for i 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:30.269
 terms wrong threat 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:37.139
 you have to put Lazio in here then 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.139
 do some laps 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.180
 here they finally put in here 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.049
 the most important part will be the arrow 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.680
 look at the build above all 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:10.180
 this piece here otherwise not 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:16.560
 never will a demonstration of how 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:28.780
 it works we see photos trento unfortunately 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:31.560
 for recall there is this we hear 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.560
 we take 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:51.650
 look at transport problems and 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.740
 had done and this is the crossbow that 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.550
 it is not decorated there is a bit ugly 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.169
 but I ask you this is the one at most 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.630
 six months has done it a lot done 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.020
 the best is certain he did that he did 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.820
 pure evil and passivity for a crossbow 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.520
 more complex I will try to explain how 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.590
 build it adaptive listening hello 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.010
 boys from enemies 98 I recommend a 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.630
 like you liked it of course 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.630
 you will share faces live bye boys
