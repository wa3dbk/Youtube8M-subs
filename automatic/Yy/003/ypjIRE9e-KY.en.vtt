room for a secondary weapon so I was
just<00:01:27.869> kind<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.110> thinking<00:01:28.259> let's<00:01:29.100> go<00:01:29.220> ahead<00:01:29.280> get

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
just kind of thinking let's go ahead get

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
just kind of thinking let's go ahead get
a<00:01:29.520> pistol<00:01:29.729> Gold<00:01:30.119> maybe<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.290> looks

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
a pistol Gold maybe if I if it looks

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
good I'll get them all so I think that's

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.580

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
break from the regular weapons that I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.340 
break from the regular weapons that I
always<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> new<00:01:36.540> stuff<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:36.930> I've<00:01:37.140> never

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
always use a new stuff that I've never

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.740 
always use a new stuff that I've never
used<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.759> pistols<00:01:39.210> snipers

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

used and that would be pistols snipers
and<00:01:39.900> shotguns<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.759> does<00:01:41.970> bring<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.329> lot<00:01:42.450> of

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and shotguns and it does bring a lot of

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.060 
and shotguns and it does bring a lot of
rage<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:43.049> me<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.439> sure<00:01:43.619> does

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
rage for me it sure does

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.700 
rage for me it sure does
but<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> lot<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.360> fun<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.140> it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
but I have a lot of fun with it and it's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.929 
but I have a lot of fun with it and it's
pretty<00:01:46.890> cool<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> say<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> golden

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I don't have the patience but I guess I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.450

the reason for that is well this gun

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.130 
the reason for that is well this gun
this<00:02:08.729> pistol<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.179> particular<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.660> haven't

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the executioner is going to be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.380 
the executioner is going to be
pretty<00:02:14.069> hard<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.490> think<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.819> maybe<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.180> last

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
pretty hard I think that maybe the last

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
right now which is that's easy and I'm

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640

probably gonna get called a bitch a lot

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.229 
probably gonna get called a bitch a lot
for<00:02:22.800> using<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.160> because<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.910> know<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.150> like

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
using it but you'll use it all day and

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.010 
using it but you'll use it all day and
you<00:02:35.910> know<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.120> pistols<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.720> game<00:02:36.870> are

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
you know the pistols in this game are

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.650 
you know the pistols in this game are
fucking<00:02:37.290> awesome<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.700> modern<00:02:39.239> warfare<00:02:39.510> 3

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660

fucking awesome and in modern warfare 3
I<00:02:40.230> think<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.920> was<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.250> submachine<00:02:41.670> pistols

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
I think it was the submachine pistols

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.140 
I think it was the submachine pistols
that<00:02:42.209> dominated<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.640> black<00:02:44.880> ops

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
that dominated that and the in black ops

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.850 
that dominated that and the in black ops

through<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.950> want<00:04:14.100> maybe<00:04:14.340> tack<00:04:14.670> mask<00:04:14.970> and

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
through and you want maybe tack mask and

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.529 
through and you want maybe tack mask and
light<00:04:17.010> or<00:04:17.310> no<00:04:17.459> attack<00:04:17.789> Mastan<00:04:18.180> extreme

extreme<00:04:19.079> conditioning<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.280> could<00:04:20.430> kind

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
extreme conditioning so you could kind

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.039 
extreme conditioning so you could kind
of<00:04:20.609> run<00:04:20.789> faster<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.239> flank<00:04:21.419> around<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.840> lots

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
