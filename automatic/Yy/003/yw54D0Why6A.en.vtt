the<00:01:39.210> power<00:01:39.390> supply<00:01:39.600> could<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.840> no<00:01:40.049> bigger<00:01:40.290> than

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the power supply could be no bigger than

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.590 
the power supply could be no bigger than
125<00:01:41.100> millimeters<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.299> gonna<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
125 millimeters so you're gonna have to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.770 
125 millimeters so you're gonna have to
get<00:01:42.689> an<00:01:42.780> s<00:01:42.899> FX<00:01:43.740> power<00:01:44.250> supply<00:01:44.640> alright<00:01:45.600> let's

let's crack this open and get under the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.160 
let's crack this open and get under the
hood<00:01:47.820> now<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.149> may<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.329> may<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.720> wondering<00:01:49.140> how

you do well you you can take off the
side<00:01:52.020> panels<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> mean<00:01:52.530> these<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.950> screws

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
side panels I mean these have the screws

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.800 
side panels I mean these have the screws
everywhere<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:54.060> that's<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.360> how<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.570> really

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

we have the inside and it will support
up<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.300> 200<00:02:09.629> millimeter<00:02:09.959> GPU<00:02:10.800> also<00:02:11.430> there's

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
up to a 200 millimeter GPU also there's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.070 
up to a 200 millimeter GPU also there's
not<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.879> lot<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.209> room

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
not a lot of room

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.070

so<00:02:16.260> that's<00:02:16.440> that's<00:02:16.620> decent<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.340> put<00:02:17.460> a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
so that's that's decent I you can put a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.580 
so that's that's decent I you can put a
small<00:02:18.270> tower<00:02:18.720> cooler<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.200> here<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.500> you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
small tower cooler on here and you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.390 
small tower cooler on here and you
you'll<00:02:19.830> be<00:02:19.950> alright

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
you'll be alright
