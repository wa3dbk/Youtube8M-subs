mean if the existence of something

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.969 
mean if the existence of something
doesn't<00:01:18.180> add<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.290> prediction<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
doesn't add to the prediction and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.460 
doesn't add to the prediction and
explanation<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.759> phenomena<00:01:21.390> how<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
explanation of phenomena how is it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.920 
explanation of phenomena how is it
supposed<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.920> cover<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.430> costs<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.000> believing

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
supposed to cover the costs of believing

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.350 
supposed to cover the costs of believing
it<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.130> son<00:01:26.369> Flying<00:01:26.759> Spaghetti<00:01:27.060> Monster

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
it so this son Flying Spaghetti Monster

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.109 
it so this son Flying Spaghetti Monster
thing<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.380> leprechaun<00:01:28.890> thing<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.759> really

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
thing and leprechaun thing is really

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.340 
thing and leprechaun thing is really
missing<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> point

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
missing the point

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
missing the point
altogether<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.220> bit<00:01:32.369> disingenuous<00:01:32.729> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
altogether it's a bit disingenuous I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.280 
altogether it's a bit disingenuous I
mean<00:01:34.670> these<00:01:35.670> things<00:01:35.729> are<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.780> part<00:01:37.200> of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
mean these things are would be part of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.080 
mean these things are would be part of
nature<00:01:37.680> these<00:01:38.009> things<00:01:38.340> would<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.729> things<00:01:39.000> that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
nature these things would be things that

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.560 
nature these things would be things that
you<00:01:39.270> could<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:40.020> touch<00:01:40.640> nope<00:01:41.670> because

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
you could see or touch nope because

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.499 
you could see or touch nope because
nature<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> addressed<00:01:44.610> by<00:01:44.759> scientists

nature as it is addressed by scientists
is<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> realm<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.220> things<00:01:47.460> there

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
is not just the realm of things there
