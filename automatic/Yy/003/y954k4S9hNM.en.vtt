00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
right now but there is room for

gamepad or what keyboard mouse works
both<00:04:24.330> ways<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:24.690> we're<00:04:25.200> going

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
both ways so we're going

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.730 
both ways so we're going
of<00:04:25.600> what<00:04:25.750> game<00:04:25.900> you're<00:04:26.020> playing<00:04:26.230> what<00:04:26.410> control

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
scheme it's using all control scheme

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.780 
scheme it's using all control scheme
you've<00:04:28.090> chosen<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.480> use<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:30.100> can<00:04:30.280> they

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
you've chosen to use that that can they

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.000 
you've chosen to use that that can they
can<00:04:30.970> they<00:04:31.000> can<00:04:31.210> do<00:04:31.420> that<00:04:31.540> but<00:04:31.810> my<00:04:32.020> favorite<00:04:32.650> new

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
can they can do that but my favorite new

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.580 
can they can do that but my favorite new
feature<00:04:33.250> about<00:04:33.790> this<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.360> this<00:04:34.660> new<00:04:34.990> sort<00:04:35.500> of

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
feature about this is this new sort of

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.100 
feature about this is this new sort of
pocket<00:04:36.430> of<00:04:36.580> functionality<00:04:37.510> they're<00:04:37.660> slamming

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
pocket of functionality they're slamming

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.290 
pocket of functionality they're slamming
into<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.290> GeForce<00:04:38.710> experience<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:40.120> can

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
into the GeForce experience is you can

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.250 
into the GeForce experience is you can
now<00:04:40.450> do<00:04:40.530> local<00:04:41.530> co-op<00:04:42.060> remotely<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.270> think<00:04:44.140> that

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
now do local co-op remotely I think that

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.410 
now do local co-op remotely I think that
makes<00:04:44.440> sense<00:04:44.680> local<00:04:45.310> co-op<00:04:45.610> remotely

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
makes sense local co-op remotely

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.640 
makes sense local co-op remotely
basically<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:46.930> can<00:04:47.020> use<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.290> streaming

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
basically you can use the streaming

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.260 
basically you can use the streaming
thing<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.040> like<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.400> said<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.850> can<00:04:48.910> hand<00:04:49.180> off

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
thing and like I said you can hand off

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.060 
thing and like I said you can hand off
the<00:04:49.330> controls<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:50.020> second<00:04:50.410> person<00:04:50.560> by<00:04:51.010> the

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
the controls to a second person by the

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.460 
the controls to a second person by the
stream<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:52.060> they<00:04:52.180> can<00:04:52.360> play<00:04:52.510> your<00:04:52.690> game<00:04:52.960> your

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
stream so they can play your game your

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.720 
stream so they can play your game your
game<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:53.740> running<00:04:53.830> locally<00:04:54.280> they're<00:04:54.460> playing

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
game is running locally they're playing

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.090 
game is running locally they're playing
it<00:04:54.850> remotely<00:04:55.120> I<00:04:55.450> think<00:04:56.200> that<00:04:56.290> makes<00:04:56.470> sense<00:04:56.680> you

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
it remotely I think that makes sense you

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.520 
it remotely I think that makes sense you
can<00:04:57.250> hand<00:04:57.430> off<00:04:57.550> second<00:04:58.480> player<00:04:58.780> controls<00:04:59.320> to

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
can hand off second player controls to

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.590 
can hand off second player controls to
them<00:04:59.680> so<00:04:59.860> your<00:05:00.100> player<00:05:00.310> one<00:05:00.520> their<00:05:01.030> player<00:05:01.330> to

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
them so your player one their player to

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.200 
them so your player one their player to
one<00:05:02.170> copy<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.620> game<00:05:02.740> running<00:05:03.010> in<00:05:03.220> local

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
one copy of the game running in local

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.200 
one copy of the game running in local
co-op<00:05:04.480> mode<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:06.370> if<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.550> game<00:05:06.700> doesn't<00:05:06.730> have

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
co-op mode so if the game doesn't have

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.020 
co-op mode so if the game doesn't have
you<00:05:07.900> know<00:05:07.930> an<00:05:08.230> internet<00:05:08.620> co-op<00:05:08.920> mode<00:05:09.520> in<00:05:09.820> it

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
you know an internet co-op mode in it

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.280 
you know an internet co-op mode in it
you<00:05:10.360> can<00:05:10.390> still<00:05:10.660> do<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:10.930> across<00:05:11.110> the

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
you can still do that across the

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.320 
you can still do that across the
internet<00:05:11.560> using<00:05:12.550> using<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.970> GeForce
