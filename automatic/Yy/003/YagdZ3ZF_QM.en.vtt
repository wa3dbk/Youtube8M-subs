00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.420
 And then everyone here beats it and today 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.630
 I'm bringing you another video 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.670
 evolved and in video tutorial 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.920
 Today I'll show you how 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.369
 we do to tame a dolphin 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 It's the dolphin I saw him is fine. 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.090
 simpler because we do not need 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.029
 knock him out 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.789
 We just need the food so the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.540
 You just have to put raw meat or 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.020
 to issue here in the last batch of the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.649
 our inventory get close to it and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 start giving food then there's one here 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.300
 he was very close here to the stones 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.070
 Let me see if he's still here. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.690
 Why does he keep moving? 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.870
 there is only one here and then what happens is 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.329
 guys, if I come near him, he'll give 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.180
 the option of pressing the and to give 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.969
 food but if I take the meat here from 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.670
 inventory is from the last lot 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.700
 he already said oh put the food to 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.420
 tame in the last lot in the east ii 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.189
 there is 10 there to be able to feed 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.090
 So that's why I did it. 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.220
 I put it in the zero and there we will start 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.210
 here is just to get close to him and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.479
 It's how you saw it started there and he 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.009
 speaks right there in the gray part of it here 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.740
 speaks to you wait until he has 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.200
 hunger for new beauty then this one is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.500
 level 12 I do not know if it will take too long 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.439
 but I already left the items there and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.810
 separated so we can make the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.939
 cell of him beauty then guys like me 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.390
 I'm here in the videos and I'm going to make a 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.640
 cut now and when you're almost at 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.590
 end when you're almost done 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.469
 here I come back beauty so come on 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.500
 Good crowd, it's almost over here. 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.009
 I think this one but this one I think 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.120
 people are already going home and we're going to see 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.489
 and that's right then this is the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.459
 dolphin is how you can see the name 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.640
 It's kind of bizarre, I do not know. 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:30.129
 how to talk then let's give a name here 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:36.079
 for him here dolphin of the drum 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:39.970
 so ok here I think he's already here 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:42.980
 and I do not know if he needs meat 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.420
 but I do not know, I do not know if 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.329
 I need to drop inventory 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.769
 I think so, but let me just come. 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.139
 here the most important is already 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.400
 Go ahead, we'll go there for another 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:59.629
 Now I want to make the cell 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.049
 for him to be able to ride baby was 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.269
 very fast then I trust him 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.799
 It really is that he is very calm is that the 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.810
 what happens when I started doing 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.829
 the tutorials the dolphin was not yet 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.780
 in the game 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:16.579
 so it's one of the easiest even just 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.530
 that since he was not in the game then 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.139
 That's why I did not do it in the beginning. 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.449
 So to his cell guys we're going 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:27.709
 need these materials here 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:34.609
 We're going to need 55 rights 50 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:36.290
 fibers 20 woods 10 metals and 8 flex 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.599
 So what happens to those guys? 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.650
 materials I think metal is the most 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:45.379
 Why do not you pick the metal? 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.470
 You can exchange a common stone only then 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.180
 it will change into an example of a in 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.459
 maximum 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.180
 if you want more metal you have to 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:00.590
 go there pick up the mountain and the rest are 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.389
 base material or the wood fiber 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.159
 The rest is very quiet then for this 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.250
 metal cell gives a little bit 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:13.099
 more work then the cell is this 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:17.000
 from here we'll make her wait to finish 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:20.090
 here so we can put it on then 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.520
 she's ready then, where are you? 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.630
 I'm too heavy or because of these things. 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.800
 here in the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:33.680
 in the trunk we will not use now 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:35.480
 So here he is, so let's put the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.460
 cell in it here I'm curious 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:44.210
 also to see what it's like to ride in it 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.360
 here and we'll see how he gets the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:51.650
 cell 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:56.210
 Let's see he walks fast, people. 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:00.820
 He walks quickly, I think he walks. 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:04.990
 even faster than what the megalodon 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.990
 Open, shut up, this is it. 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.790
 the problem is that once the crowd 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.570
 practically all the animals attack him 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:21.620
 For example, I had started to 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.830
 domesticate a here and a carbon and me 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:29.930
 attacked then understood type up to carbon 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:32.120
 and miss that is a very peaceful animal 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.220
 Let's say he attacked the end, I'm going 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:42.950
 show that from the front how it stays 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:48.670
 Strange to face but let's give one a 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.670
 parade with him here but here deep 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.590
 but he only has one 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:06.080
 opa was arrested here megalodon ali 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:10.160
 I do not know if he's after us but 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:22.430
 I think he's behind us is 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:24.340
 because I was stranded I died, people here. 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.080
 his attention here 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.080
 The site is going to kill my beast. 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:45.229
 Now yes hum my megalodon 11 were 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:47.080
 Defend me here guys, I'll ride him. 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:53.060
 here again 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:57.110
 The opaque is that I have with the captured one here I go 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.550
 I was playing but this is it guys 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.310
 basically that's what i wanted 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.009
 show you what it was like 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.520
 domestic or end and take a walk with 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:10.699
 he here for you to see how he is but he 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.539
 really not fast enough down here 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:15.319
 water 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:17.990
 is very interesting I think the speed 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:20.419
 what you need right? 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:24.440
 so it's pretty quick to tame then 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:27.710
 I think it's worth pretty much left 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:32.029
 for these two here to follow me 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:35.779
 Just to go back to base then I'll go. 

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:42.169
 tighten with the beauty 

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:43.130
 I think now they follow me more 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:50.870
 here 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:52.580
 This is the time here, but then this is it. 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:56.479
 People, I hope you have 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:58.430
 liked this video, just let it go 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:00.500
 they stop following me 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.960
 But how was talking guys, there? 

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.349
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.599
 video I hope you are enjoying it 

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:13.569
 this tutorial also beauty then is 

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:13.569
 That's good, thanks, and until the next
