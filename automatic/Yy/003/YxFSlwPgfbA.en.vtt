00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.869
 the truth is that good they added the 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.520
 servants then so we could see a 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.259
 image of the servants we do not find ourselves 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.330
 so I bring you the official image that 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.880
 they have put and well they really are 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.930
 presented themselves make us more beautiful 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.610
 they are not prettier to a few words 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.680
 also good when we kill them 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.579
 they will let us loose what will be 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.829
 its meat and apart leather when the meat 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.440
 cooking it in a campfire will give us the 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.379
 Meat cooked almost meat 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.359
 that we will see now also good 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.480
 with leather we can create what we 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:52.589
 It would be a good shirt and pants 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.589
 let's see with the next update 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.100
 good is one of the first 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 transformations that the zombies will have 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 in full moon sounds the eyes of four 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.160
 eyes will start are interactive as 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.660
 we'll see below the whole left are 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 icons when the zombies appear 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.510
 Interactive at night 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.310
 that will warn us that they will be zombies 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.440
 interactive good sounds that do not 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 inhabit the zombies did not the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.280
 zombies that is louisillo the sound of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.140
 shout smart phone video connection 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 point it out because to me the zombies do not 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 they shout me a new sovereign maximum that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.300
 there are millions the actions are good 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.370
 red eyes and the fastest ones are more 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.260
 strong and at the same time is a little 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.630
 bending meetings are a little more 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.550
 fast but not like that they are very easy to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.680
 kill as you will see he killed them with fists and not 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.630
 they do not do anything to me 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.550
 up destination to stop accounting me 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.220
 they went down and I do not know if they took like 25 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.740
 but not like that they are really bad 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.200
 I would like to me I would love that the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.480

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.870

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.240
 faster percent that have strength 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.520

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.630
