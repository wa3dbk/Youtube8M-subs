haven't even heard it yet but I know
that<00:00:29.260> I<00:00:29.290> love<00:00:29.560> that<00:00:29.590> switch<00:00:30.070> we<00:00:30.880> use<00:00:31.060> an<00:00:31.210> SG<00:00:31.810> and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
that I love that switch we use an SG and

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.030 
that I love that switch we use an SG and
a<00:00:32.770> dr.<00:00:33.280> Z<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:34.840> can<00:00:34.989> contact<00:00:35.410> crazy<00:00:35.770> tube

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
circuits if you dig this thing let's

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.910 
circuits if you dig this thing let's
check<00:00:38.350> it<00:00:38.500> out

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
check it out

sounds<00:00:41.590> like<00:00:41.770> this

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.070 

I'm

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:36.410

Neeb<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:48.080> like<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.270> man<00:03:50.270> when<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:50.600> push<00:03:50.870> the

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
Neeb I like it man when I push the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.010 
Neeb I like it man when I push the
volume<00:03:51.230> up<00:03:52.030> stuff<00:03:53.030> started<00:03:53.360> rattling<00:03:53.570> on<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
volume up stuff started rattling on the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.560 
volume up stuff started rattling on the
walls<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.560> here<00:03:54.590> which<00:03:55.310> I'm<00:03:56.209> sure<00:03:56.450> you
