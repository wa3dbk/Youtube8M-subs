00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.470 

so<00:00:09.750> what<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.080> we're<00:00:10.349> doing<00:00:10.679> so<00:00:11.389> we're<00:00:12.389> doing

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
so what is it we're doing so we're doing

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:23.509 
so what is it we're doing so we're doing
a<00:00:12.750> CMYK<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:21.170> basically<00:00:22.170> tell<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.859> stick<00:00:23.369> with

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
a CMYK so basically tell I stick with

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.450 
a CMYK so basically tell I stick with
the<00:00:23.609> pre-order<00:00:24.090> CMYK<00:00:24.949> some<00:00:25.949> people<00:00:26.250> just

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the pre-order CMYK some people just

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.580 
the pre-order CMYK some people just
switching<00:00:26.910> around<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:28.670> why<00:00:29.670> mck<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:31.410> could

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
switching around you why mck you could

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.740 
switching around you why mck you could
basically<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.640> color<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.059> too<00:00:33.239> dominant

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
basically if one color is too dominant

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.910 
basically if one color is too dominant
you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.140> change<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.800> water<00:00:35.059> om<00:00:36.710> now<00:00:37.710> your

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
you can change the water om now your

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.680 
you can change the water om now your
design<00:00:38.809> that<00:00:39.809> you've<00:00:39.989> got<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:41.540> what<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
design that you've got these what do you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.389 
design that you've got these what do you
have<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.329> computer

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
have you do that to do this on computer

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.290 
have you do that to do this on computer
created<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:49.079> file<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.770> Photoshop<00:00:50.219> ok<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
created the the file in Photoshop ok and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.369 
created the the file in Photoshop ok and
then<00:00:51.480> Photoshop<00:00:52.379> has<00:00:52.410> tools<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.329> can

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
then Photoshop has tools that you can

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.229 
then Photoshop has tools that you can
split<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> channels<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.640> create<00:00:57.030> your

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
split the channels so if you create your

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.160 
split the channels so if you create your
Photoshop<00:00:57.750> document<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.680> either<00:00:59.129> RGB<00:00:59.850> mode

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
Photoshop document in either RGB mode

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.950 
Photoshop document in either RGB mode
which<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.920> CMYK<00:01:02.340> mode<00:01:02.699> okay<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.780> then

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
which I do is in CMYK mode okay and then

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.039 
which I do is in CMYK mode okay and then
in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> channels<00:01:05.119> split<00:01:06.119> those<00:01:06.330> chambers<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
in the channels split those chambers you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.780 
in the channels split those chambers you
can<00:01:07.229> split<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> colors<00:01:08.130> between<00:01:08.400> them

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
can split the colors between them

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.420 
can split the colors between them
exactly<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> does<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.710> latina<00:01:11.189> color

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
exactly so it does all this latina color

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
exactly so it does all this latina color
for<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.510> nice<00:01:12.750> there's

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
for you which is really nice there's

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710 
for you which is really nice there's
other<00:01:13.950> programs<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.970> probably<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
other programs that you probably have to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.219 
other programs that you probably have to
make<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.409> create<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> Photoshop

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
make know you create but so Photoshop

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.469 
make know you create but so Photoshop
create<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> document<00:01:20.549> i<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.210> then

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
create the document i want and then

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.740 
create the document i want and then
split<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> channels<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.549> create<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
split the channels and then create the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.160 
split the channels and then create the
half-tones<00:01:25.790> out<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.060> those<00:01:27.240> channels<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.140> that

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
half-tones out of those channels so that

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.000 
half-tones out of those channels so that
it<00:01:28.409> prints<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.840> talked<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.380> this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
it prints out so we talked with this

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.560 
it prints out so we talked with this
so<00:01:33.600> yeah<00:01:34.620> so<00:01:35.620> you<00:01:35.680> take<00:01:36.040> a<00:01:36.370> printout<00:01:37.240> from

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
so yeah so you take a printout from

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.800 
so yeah so you take a printout from
Photoshop<00:01:38.200> your<00:01:39.040> image<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.790> wherever<00:01:40.360> you

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
Photoshop your image and wherever you

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.940 
Photoshop your image and wherever you
print<00:01:41.290> black<00:01:41.620> is<00:01:42.190> where<00:01:43.150> your<00:01:43.540> ink<00:01:44.410> will<00:01:44.740> pass

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
print black is where your ink will pass

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.760 
print black is where your ink will pass
through<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.370> screen<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.170> coated

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
through the screen so this is coated

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.450 
through the screen so this is coated
with<00:01:48.030> photo<00:01:49.030> emulsion<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.860> photo<00:01:51.100> emulsion

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
with photo emulsion the photo emulsion

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.090 
with photo emulsion the photo emulsion
is<00:01:51.730> light-sensitive<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.870> have<00:01:53.470> an<00:01:53.620> exposure

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
is light-sensitive I have an exposure

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.630 
is light-sensitive I have an exposure
unit<00:01:54.550> where<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:56.050> photo<00:01:56.770> positive<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.610> I

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
unit where the photo positive that I

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.150 
unit where the photo positive that I
print<00:01:58.000> out<00:01:58.150> from<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.630> computer<00:01:59.050> belongs<00:01:59.710> the

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
print out from the computer belongs the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.370 
print out from the computer belongs the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
the transparent ink basically fields on

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.520 
the transparent ink basically fields on
top<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.770> each<00:02:20.860> other<00:02:21.040> in<00:02:21.850> mixes<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.110> print

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
top of each other in mixes so you print

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.490 
top of each other in mixes so you print
went<00:02:23.770> on<00:02:23.860> wed<00:02:24.130> just<00:02:24.730> like<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> printer<00:02:25.420> would<00:02:26.290> on
