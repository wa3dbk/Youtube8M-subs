00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.659
 the corinthians went to argentina to face lyon 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.530
 goal of the sea 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.019
 it seems like eliéser 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.749
 the result is in the corinthians the fans we did not worry 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.730
 - needed to turn the game to get the place to the quarterfinals 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.769
 How long would it take to do this? 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.769
 I did it a lot 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.739
 almost helped me and tied the game 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.800
 who's right? 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 if it won but it was very difficult the pack would score 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.089
 I live here in the new living neighborhood of the game condition 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.210
 when salmon nodded but when before he scored the ball 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970
 there I have seen impediment 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.750
 and to the Corinthian crowd gets more angry 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.330
 looks like a mere like that said mining who does not know how to play ball right 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.110
 of cinnamon slipping by the foot 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.850
 but this was not the worst 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.050
 when one was still talking about the impediment one minute and 15 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.610
 slept a hundred 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.380
 inside it could not even complain 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.270
 claiming that such a hypothesis 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.440
 Could be worse 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.500
 the lion coach replaced Carlos Alberto yet in the first half and the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.970
 two hit the mouth 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.020
 surprisingly 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.020
 léo and carlos alberto both people concluded 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.010
 Carlos Alberto I went 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.630
 it was very important 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.490
 at the time of the robbery 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 for the second year followed the pilot after 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.300
 years come kicking 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.170
 press until the ball came in. 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 the staff did this style and did 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.870
 but almost lost again the ball passed under the legs of the navy 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.979
 in the second half he himself gave hope to Corinthian fans 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.659
 decreased to 3 to 2 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.090
 if the Corinthians tie if they conquered the vacancy there was no time for this 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.410
 but then the rudder was leaving playing ball with the skin 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
 Look, you're going to do it and skinny. 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.520
 the lanús 4 corinthians
