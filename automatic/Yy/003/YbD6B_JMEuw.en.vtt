00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.649
 hello people today would like to be with you 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.920
 talk about the cartoon 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.629
 the prince of egypt this cartoon is gorgeous 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.519
 both visually and in your feed 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.410
 stories and consider the best animated 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.140
 dreamworks studio movie 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.210
 many underestimated this cartoon in 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.540
 unlike modern studio work this 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.810
 cartoon more adult and so let's 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.670
 will arrange everything on the shelves cartoon 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.400
 tell us a story that is to us and 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.829
 so everyone knows she is about Moses and 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.140
 sell how he freed slaves from egypt 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.530
 but dreamworks decided to show this 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.329
 story a little different yes yes basically gip 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.309
 That is, there are silly moments such as 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.629
 whose moses at the beginning showed how 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.030
 standard fidget 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.030
 but the character thank God changes with 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.489
 Pharaoh's helpers are also made 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.109
 too cartoony all the same thick and 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.929
 thin which is enough in each 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.030
 cartoon and even the most films 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.499
 cartoon strengths this is how 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.149
 they showed the relationship of two brothers 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.489
 Moses Ramses 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.650
 But initially it was not very close 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.380
 it is very hard to fight against each other 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.189
 friend for slaves because they are deep in their souls 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.810
 just want everything to be like before 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.909
 the music series in the film is great 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.979
 music is most affected when 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.110
 Moses find the necessary depth and not 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.939
 speaks through not with god she still has 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.640
 then goosebumps on the case every time 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.640
 when i see this scene god's way by the way 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.340
 was ideally chosen he was strong strict 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.259
 and at the same time warm kind so he and 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.600
 it must be felt that he 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.090
 reasonable fair may then 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.670
 punish but may embrace 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.760
 warm her calm like a father 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.520
 as shown when the blue flame 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.510
 Moses envelops the blue flame was 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.130
 chosen perfectly 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.650
 so it feels like she can't you 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.430
 it can only do the opposite 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.020
 to warm 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.910
 give comfort and warmth 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.400
 visually what is great 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.800
 the picture when moses separates the seas by 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.690
 points come back to such an extent 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.340
 that speech is taken away facial animation 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.920
 deserves special praise much 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.440
 can be understood even without words such as 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.210
 the scene where ramses understands the fact that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.820
 my essay is back not to 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.790
 again be with him on the right hand but only 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.000
 in order to free your people 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.330
 sorrow and bitterness anger and thirst for revenge all 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.920
 shown just on his face 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.320
 also played a significant role as 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.090
 the characters speak it perfectly 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.350
 adapted to the time when 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.360
 all these actions took place 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.880
 the prince of Egypt will remain forever in my 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.640
 list of the most gorgeous animated 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.250
 films i'm into place to share this 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.630
 opinion along with me and in my heart i 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.940
 I still hope that the company 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.630
 dreamworks will return to its roots and 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.100
 do something as great and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.100
 adults and breathtaking
