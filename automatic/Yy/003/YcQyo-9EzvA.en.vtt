00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
in closing I want to talk about the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.010 
in closing I want to talk about the
sound<00:03:32.520> quality<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.030> comfort<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.720> these

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
sound quality and comfort of these

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.230 
sound quality and comfort of these
headphones<00:03:34.350> again<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.070> as<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.970> mentioned

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
headphones again and as I mentioned

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.060 
headphones again and as I mentioned
before<00:03:36.300> they<00:03:36.570> have<00:03:36.690> 40<00:03:37.020> millimeter<00:03:37.440> neodymium

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
before they have 40 millimeter neodymium

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.130 
before they have 40 millimeter neodymium
magnets<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.910> sound<00:03:39.300> pressure<00:03:39.540> level<00:03:39.960> is<00:03:40.110> a

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
magnets the sound pressure level is a

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.710 
magnets the sound pressure level is a
hundred<00:03:40.710> decibels<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:42.120> frequency

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
hundred decibels and the frequency

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.690 
hundred decibels and the frequency
response<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.320> ten<00:03:43.620> Hertz<00:03:43.950> all<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.370> way<00:03:44.460> up<00:03:44.580> to

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
response is ten Hertz all the way up to

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
response is ten Hertz all the way up to
thirty<00:03:45.000> thousand<00:03:45.600> Hertz<00:03:45.780> which<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> great

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
thirty thousand Hertz which is a great

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.750 
thirty thousand Hertz which is a great
frequency<00:03:47.250> response

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
frequency response

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.880 
frequency response
now<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.360> impedance<00:03:48.960> is<00:03:49.110> thirty-eight<00:03:49.620> ohms

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
now the impedance is thirty-eight ohms

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.060 
now the impedance is thirty-eight ohms
and<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.520> weight<00:03:50.880> without<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.870> cord<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.350> 280

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
and the weight without the cord is 280

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.700 
and the weight without the cord is 280
grams<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:53.820> being<00:03:54.690> said<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.020> 280<00:03:55.530> grams

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
grams and that being said the 280 grams

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.380 
grams and that being said the 280 grams
of<00:03:55.950> these<00:03:56.070> headphones<00:03:56.280> makes<00:03:56.730> these<00:03:56.940> really

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
of these headphones makes these really

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.030 
of these headphones makes these really
comfortable<00:03:57.870> for<00:03:57.930> long<00:03:58.320> sessions<00:03:58.620> where

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
comfortable for long sessions where

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.320 
comfortable for long sessions where

both now lastly guys I want to say that
I<00:04:06.240> went<00:04:06.600> from<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.930> razor<00:04:07.230> carcase<00:04:08.010> headset<00:04:08.670> to

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
I went from a razor carcase headset to

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.660 
I went from a razor carcase headset to
these<00:04:09.570> headphones<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.830> difference<00:04:11.400> was

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
these headphones and the difference was

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.750 
these headphones and the difference was
night<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.090> day<00:04:12.330> these<00:04:12.810> really<00:04:13.530> are<00:04:13.830> great

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
night and day these really are great

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.060 
night and day these really are great
headphones<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:15.510> I'm<00:04:15.870> not<00:04:16.080> an<00:04:16.260> audio<00:04:16.590> kind<00:04:16.950> of

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
headphones and I'm not an audio kind of

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.650 
headphones and I'm not an audio kind of
guy<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.460> don't<00:04:17.520> really<00:04:17.970> know<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.510> difference

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
guy I don't really know the difference

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.050 
guy I don't really know the difference
between<00:04:18.989> good<00:04:19.410> headphones<00:04:19.710> and<00:04:20.160> bad<00:04:20.340> ones<00:04:20.580> but

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
between good headphones and bad ones but

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.940 
between good headphones and bad ones but
I<00:04:21.120> can<00:04:21.330> certainly<00:04:21.630> notice<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.350> difference<00:04:22.680> here

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
I can certainly notice a difference here

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.550 
I can certainly notice a difference here
and<00:04:23.100> these<00:04:24.030> are<00:04:24.360> phenomenally<00:04:25.140> better<00:04:25.320> than

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
and these are phenomenally better than

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.150 
and these are phenomenally better than
my<00:04:25.680> razor

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
my razor

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.270 
my razor
in<00:04:26.580> terms<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.910> sound<00:04:27.090> quality<00:04:27.210> they<00:04:27.990> have

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
in terms of sound quality they have

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.490 
in terms of sound quality they have
clear<00:04:29.280> eyes<00:04:29.610> clear<00:04:29.640> mids<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:30.750> very

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
clear eyes clear mids and very

responsive<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.340> sensitive<00:04:32.880> Bates<00:04:33.120> was

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
responsive and sensitive Bates was

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.780 
responsive and sensitive Bates was
sucking<00:04:33.630> here<00:04:34.050> so<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.770> could<00:04:35.190> really<00:04:35.400> hear<00:04:35.700> the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
sucking here so I could really hear the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.310 
sucking here so I could really hear the
bass<00:04:35.970> when<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.240> was<00:04:36.360> playing<00:04:36.540> games<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.200> it

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320
