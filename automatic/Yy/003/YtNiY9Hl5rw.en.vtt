I<00:06:22.919> think<00:06:23.279> it<00:06:23.369> seems<00:06:23.580> a<00:06:23.669> little<00:06:23.699> counter

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
I think it seems a little counter

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.139 
I think it seems a little counter
intuitive<00:06:25.259> because<00:06:25.499> it's<00:06:25.889> summer<00:06:26.159> but<00:06:26.610> for

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:27.149 
intuitive because it's summer but for

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:28.519 
intuitive because it's summer but for
some<00:06:27.269> reason<00:06:27.509> it<00:06:27.569> just<00:06:27.629> feels<00:06:27.929> really<00:06:28.169> cool

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:28.529 
some reason it just feels really cool

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:29.749 
some reason it just feels really cool
and<00:06:28.739> right<00:06:28.919> right<00:06:29.129> now<00:06:29.279> it<00:06:29.429> should<00:06:29.610> have<00:06:29.729> a

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
and right right now it should have a

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.809 
and right right now it should have a
bright<00:06:30.029> lip<00:06:30.269> so<00:06:30.929> definitely<00:06:31.769> I<00:06:32.099> would<00:06:32.369> I<00:06:32.669> would

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819
