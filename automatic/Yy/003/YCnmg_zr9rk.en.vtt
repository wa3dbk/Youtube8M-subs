00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
to go ahead and do our refresh LTE is is

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.709 
to go ahead and do our refresh LTE is is
quicker<00:00:37.320> than<00:00:37.469> Wi-Fi<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.489> doing<00:00:38.790> over<00:00:39.030> 3G<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
quicker than Wi-Fi or doing over 3G it

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.040 
quicker than Wi-Fi or doing over 3G it
does<00:00:40.010> take<00:00:41.010> anywhere<00:00:41.370> from<00:00:41.430> five<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.600> 20

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
does take anywhere from five to 20

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.819 
does take anywhere from five to 20
seconds<00:00:44.870> as<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:46.559> actually

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
seconds as you can see that was actually

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.310 
seconds as you can see that was actually
pretty<00:00:46.950> quick<00:00:47.570> did<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.690> see<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.989> remote

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
pretty quick did you see this remote

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.600 
pretty quick did you see this remote
starter<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.010> whether<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> engines

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
starter you can see whether the engines

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.020 
starter you can see whether the engines
running<00:00:50.850> see<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> weather<00:00:51.989> ignitions<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:53.030> or

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
off where the doors are open or closed

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700 
off where the doors are open or closed
whether<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:57.149> security<00:00:57.690> system<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.199> armed<00:00:58.620> or

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
whether this security system is armed or

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.110 
whether this security system is armed or
disarmed<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.399> don't<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> security

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
disarmed but I don't have a security

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.580 
disarmed but I don't have a security
system<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.719> that's<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.079> whether<00:01:01.440> it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
system so that's just whether it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.579

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
locked or unlocked trunk is whether it's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.490 
locked or unlocked trunk is whether it's
