Minecraft expert in no time today we are

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.540 
Minecraft expert in no time today we are
going<00:00:20.720> to<00:00:20.869> be<00:00:21.080> looking<00:00:21.470> at<00:00:21.770> how<00:00:22.130> to<00:00:22.189> make

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
going to be looking at how to make

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.080 
going to be looking at how to make
blocks<00:00:23.029> out<00:00:23.539> of<00:00:24.230> nothing<00:00:24.829> there's<00:00:25.550> a<00:00:25.610> few<00:00:25.849> ways

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
blocks out of nothing there's a few ways

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.630 
blocks out of nothing there's a few ways
to<00:00:26.119> do<00:00:26.480> this<00:00:26.630> in<00:00:26.840> Minecraft<00:00:27.380> like<00:00:27.680> growing<00:00:28.399> a

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
to do this in Minecraft like growing a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.330 
to do this in Minecraft like growing a
tree<00:00:29.050> you<00:00:30.050> will<00:00:30.200> get<00:00:30.439> blocks<00:00:30.770> that<00:00:31.160> will

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
tree you will get blocks that will

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.049 
tree you will get blocks that will
appear<00:00:31.820> because<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.660> tree<00:00:33.020> grows<00:00:33.610> or<00:00:34.610> maybe

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
appear because the tree grows or maybe

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.930 
appear because the tree grows or maybe
snow<00:00:35.630> falling<00:00:36.379> on<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.649> ground<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:37.820> you

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
snow falling on the ground and so you

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.030 
snow falling on the ground and so you
can<00:00:38.120> harvest<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.750> snow<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:39.350> make<00:00:39.590> that<00:00:39.739> into

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
can harvest the snow and make that into

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.729 
can harvest the snow and make that into
a<00:00:40.070> block<00:00:40.399> but<00:00:41.059> this<00:00:41.300> way<00:00:41.629> I<00:00:41.989> have<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.440> do<00:00:42.589> is

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
a block but this way I have to do is

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.489 
a block but this way I have to do is
build<00:00:43.070> one<00:00:43.670> simple<00:00:44.210> setup<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:44.809> you<00:00:45.260> could

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
build one simple setup and you could

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.939 
build one simple setup and you could
basically<00:00:46.039> have<00:00:46.899> infinity<00:00:47.899> blocks<00:00:48.260> forever

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
basically have infinity blocks forever

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.340 
basically have infinity blocks forever
so<00:00:49.429> here<00:00:49.579> we<00:00:49.730> are<00:00:49.760> in<00:00:50.089> a<00:00:50.449> little<00:00:50.719> world<00:00:50.929> and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
so here we are in a little world and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.439 
so here we are in a little world and
maybe<00:00:51.980> you've<00:00:52.370> heard<00:00:52.609> of<00:00:52.699> it<00:00:52.789> maybe<00:00:53.269> you

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
maybe you've heard of it maybe you

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.869 
maybe you've heard of it maybe you
haven't<00:00:53.809> but<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:54.769> is<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:55.159> cobblestone

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
haven't but it is a cobblestone

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.130 
haven't but it is a cobblestone
generator<00:00:56.920> this<00:00:57.920> is<00:00:57.980> how<00:00:58.219> you<00:00:58.309> can<00:00:58.609> generate

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
generator this is how you can generate

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.899 
generator this is how you can generate
basically<00:01:00.140> endless<00:01:00.559> amounts<00:01:01.129> of<00:01:01.249> cobblestone

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
basically endless amounts of cobblestone

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.000 
basically endless amounts of cobblestone
you<00:01:02.479> can<00:01:02.629> see<00:01:02.780> as<00:01:02.899> many<00:01:03.109> times<00:01:03.409> as<00:01:03.620> I<00:01:03.739> break

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
you can see as many times as I break

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.800 
you can see as many times as I break
this<00:01:04.220> piece<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.670> cobblestone<00:01:04.850> right<00:01:05.420> here<00:01:05.659> it

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
this piece of cobblestone right here it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.350 
this piece of cobblestone right here it
keeps<00:01:06.229> coming<00:01:06.800> back<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:07.909> can<00:01:08.120> imagine

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
keeps coming back and you can imagine

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.530 
keeps coming back and you can imagine
that<00:01:08.810> if<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.620> actually<00:01:09.860> if<00:01:10.190> you<00:01:10.790> actually<00:01:11.300> had

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
that if you actually if you actually had

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.209 
that if you actually if you actually had
a<00:01:11.870> pick<00:01:13.090> let's<00:01:14.090> quickly<00:01:14.420> just<00:01:14.750> get<00:01:15.049> a<00:01:15.259> pick<00:01:15.920> and

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
a pick let's quickly just get a pick and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.289 
a pick let's quickly just get a pick and
switch<00:01:16.579> into<00:01:17.350> game-mode<00:01:18.350> 0<00:01:18.619> here<00:01:19.399> that<00:01:20.149> you

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
switch into game-mode 0 here that you

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.380 
switch into game-mode 0 here that you
could<00:01:20.630> harvest<00:01:21.079> this<00:01:21.560> up<00:01:21.829> and<00:01:22.159> there<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.210> go

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
could harvest this up and there you go

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.469 
could harvest this up and there you go
now<00:01:23.689> you<00:01:23.750> have<00:01:23.869> basically<00:01:24.649> unlimited

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
now you have basically unlimited

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.870 
now you have basically unlimited
cobblestone<00:01:26.479> for<00:01:26.890> your<00:01:27.890> enjoyment<00:01:28.399> now<00:01:28.729> we're

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
cobblestone for your enjoyment now we're

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.969 
cobblestone for your enjoyment now we're
losing<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.390> few<00:01:29.570> pieces<00:01:29.990> because<00:01:30.409> this<00:01:30.530> isn't<00:01:30.740> a

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
losing a few pieces because this isn't a

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.950 
losing a few pieces because this isn't a
very<00:01:31.189> efficient<00:01:31.880> look<00:01:32.450> at<00:01:32.509> that<00:01:32.600> one<00:01:32.750> piece

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
very efficient look at that one piece

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.289 
very efficient look at that one piece
just<00:01:33.229> flying<00:01:33.710> out<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:33.950> there<00:01:34.130> this<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.210> an

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
just flying out of there this is an

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.029 
just flying out of there this is an
incredibly<00:01:35.899> efficient<00:01:36.439> cobblestone

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
incredibly efficient cobblestone

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.039 
incredibly efficient cobblestone
generator<00:01:37.299> but<00:01:38.299> that's<00:01:38.509> not<00:01:38.689> really<00:01:38.899> what

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
generator but that's not really what

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.330 
generator but that's not really what
we're<00:01:39.200> trying<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.740> show<00:01:39.890> off<00:01:39.920> we're<00:01:40.189> just

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
we're trying to show off we're just

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.469 
we're trying to show off we're just
showing<00:01:40.939> you<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.570> basics<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.039> here<00:01:43.909> is<00:01:44.119> how

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
showing you the basics so here is how

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.609 
showing you the basics so here is how
this<00:01:44.930> works

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
this works

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.580 
this works
whenever<00:01:46.250> lava<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.240> if<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.840> put<00:01:48.109> down<00:01:48.289> lava

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
whenever lava and if you put down lava

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.130 
whenever lava and if you put down lava
you'll<00:01:48.890> know<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.460> flows<00:01:49.969> around<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.960> will

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
you'll know that it flows around it will

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.520 
you'll know that it flows around it will
sort<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.890> spread<00:01:52.579> out<00:01:52.609> from<00:01:53.149> its<00:01:53.530> location

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
sort of spread out from its location

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.609 
sort of spread out from its location
whenever<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.579> put<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:56.000> on<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.899> ground<00:01:57.200> and

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
whenever you put that on the ground and

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.270 
whenever you put that on the ground and
one<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.399> its<00:01:58.549> its<00:01:59.149> off<00:01:59.810> flows<00:02:00.619> one<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.219> the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
one of its its off flows one of the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.209 
one of its its off flows one of the
flows<00:02:01.520> off<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:02.359> the<00:02:02.630> source<00:02:03.020> block<00:02:03.590> of<00:02:03.890> lava

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
flows off of the source block of lava

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.989 
flows off of the source block of lava
touches<00:02:05.179> water<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:06.109> will<00:02:06.560> become<00:02:07.159> cobblestone

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
touches water it will become cobblestone

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.940 
touches water it will become cobblestone
so<00:02:08.240> if<00:02:08.300> we<00:02:08.420> do<00:02:08.600> this<00:02:08.780> out<00:02:08.960> here<00:02:09.020> in<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.530> open

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
so if we do this out here in the open

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.190 
so if we do this out here in the open
you<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.670> see<00:02:10.850> what<00:02:10.970> I'm<00:02:11.060> talking<00:02:11.090> about<00:02:11.480> this

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
you can see what I'm talking about this

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.020 
you can see what I'm talking about this
is<00:02:12.260> going<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.830> flow<00:02:13.040> out<00:02:13.070> if<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.670> put<00:02:13.880> water

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
is going to flow out if I put water

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.780 
is going to flow out if I put water
right<00:02:14.300> here<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:15.020> will<00:02:15.290> flow<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.280> those<00:02:16.460> and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
right here it will flow in to those and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.350 
right here it will flow in to those and
create<00:02:17.360> cobblestone<00:02:17.930> sometimes<00:02:19.030> neither<00:02:20.030> of

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
create cobblestone sometimes neither of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.869 
create cobblestone sometimes neither of
the<00:02:20.870> flows<00:02:21.110> are<00:02:21.319> strong<00:02:21.620> enough<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.220> there

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
the flows are strong enough so there

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:23.860 
the flows are strong enough so there
isn't<00:02:23.030> quite<00:02:23.330> enough

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
isn't quite enough

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.500 
isn't quite enough
for<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.260> game<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.650> decide<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.970> either<00:02:26.269> of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
for the game to decide that either of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.920 
for the game to decide that either of
those<00:02:26.690> should<00:02:27.319> be<00:02:28.599> one<00:02:29.599> or<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.900> other

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
those should be one or the other

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.020 
those should be one or the other
basically<00:02:30.500> they're<00:02:30.800> stopping<00:02:31.310> at<00:02:31.489> their

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
basically they're stopping at their

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.270 
basically they're stopping at their
meeting<00:02:32.330> each<00:02:32.569> other<00:02:32.840> there<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:33.950> that's<00:02:34.099> why

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
meeting each other there so that's why

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.150 
meeting each other there so that's why
it<00:02:34.370> looks<00:02:34.670> like<00:02:35.260> those<00:02:36.260> were<00:02:36.500> touching<00:02:36.739> but<00:02:37.069> it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
it looks like those were touching but it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.790 
it looks like those were touching but it
wasn't<00:02:37.430> creating<00:02:37.730> cobblestone<00:02:38.569> so<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:39.530> can

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
wasn't creating cobblestone so you can

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800 
wasn't creating cobblestone so you can
easily<00:02:40.010> make<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:40.730> happen

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
easily make this happen

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.479 
easily make this happen
on<00:02:41.989> purpose<00:02:42.680> now<00:02:42.830> what<00:02:43.069> you're<00:02:43.220> probably

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
on purpose now what you're probably

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.470 
on purpose now what you're probably
going<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.790> want<00:02:43.879> to<00:02:43.970> do<00:02:44.060> I'm<00:02:44.150> just<00:02:44.209> going<00:02:44.420> to

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
going to want to do I'm just going to

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.990 
going to want to do I'm just going to
build<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.930> in<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.349> grass<00:02:45.620> back<00:02:45.980> here<00:02:46.280> what

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
build in the in the grass back here what

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.270 
build in the in the grass back here what
you<00:02:47.090> probably<00:02:47.569> do<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:48.110> something<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.890> this

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
you probably do is something like this

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.089 
you probably do is something like this
where<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.790> will<00:02:50.060> take<00:02:50.690> your<00:02:50.870> lava<00:02:51.319> you'll<00:02:51.860> put

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
where you will take your lava you'll put

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.710 
where you will take your lava you'll put
it<00:02:52.190> right<00:02:52.340> here<00:02:52.760> then<00:02:53.269> you'll<00:02:53.390> take<00:02:53.569> your

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
it right here then you'll take your

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.839 
it right here then you'll take your
water<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.349> put<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.590> over<00:02:54.650> here<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.250> then

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
water and put it over here and then

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.930 
water and put it over here and then
you're<00:02:56.209> like<00:02:56.420> perfect<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.230> then<00:02:57.470> BAM<00:02:58.099> you<00:02:58.730> get

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
you're like perfect and then BAM you get

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.240 
you're like perfect and then BAM you get
obsidian<00:02:59.660> what's<00:03:00.380> happening<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.099> this

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
obsidian what's happening in this

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.390 
obsidian what's happening in this
scenario<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:01.910> water<00:03:02.540> will<00:03:03.440> travel<00:03:03.799> much

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
scenario is that water will travel much

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.990 
scenario is that water will travel much
faster<00:03:04.810> much<00:03:05.810> much<00:03:06.140> much<00:03:06.470> faster<00:03:06.739> than<00:03:07.250> lava

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
faster much much much faster than lava

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.970 
faster much much much faster than lava
as<00:03:08.329> you<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.810> see<00:03:09.049> well<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.500> probably

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
as you can see well you probably

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.589 
as you can see well you probably
remember<00:03:10.129> when<00:03:10.519> I<00:03:10.549> put<00:03:10.790> down<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.120> lava<00:03:11.329> before

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
remember when I put down the lava before

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.319 
remember when I put down the lava before
so<00:03:12.410> we<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.739> do<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:12.980> make<00:03:13.250> sure<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.760> the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
so we have to do is make sure that the

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.830 
so we have to do is make sure that the
water<00:03:14.780> will<00:03:15.500> stop<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.730> float<00:03:17.000> down<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.540> the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
water will stop and float down and the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.259 
water will stop and float down and the
end<00:03:18.049> not<00:03:18.739> reach<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.489> lava<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.000> can<00:03:20.150> do

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
end not reach the lava so you can do

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.080 
end not reach the lava so you can do
this<00:03:20.480> by<00:03:21.079> basically<00:03:21.829> creating<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.370> hole<00:03:22.579> for

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
this by basically creating a hole for

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.930 
this by basically creating a hole for
the<00:03:23.150> for<00:03:23.629> the<00:03:23.690> water<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.230> go<00:03:24.379> down<00:03:24.410> into<00:03:25.129> now<00:03:25.790> if

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
the for the water to go down into now if

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.420 
the for the water to go down into now if
you<00:03:26.060> put<00:03:26.239> your<00:03:26.360> lava<00:03:26.540> right<00:03:26.900> here<00:03:27.410> well<00:03:28.160> it's

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
you put your lava right here well it's

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.860 
you put your lava right here well it's
also<00:03:28.579> going<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.790> turn<00:03:28.970> into<00:03:29.150> obsidian<00:03:29.630> again

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
also going to turn into obsidian again

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.199 
also going to turn into obsidian again
because<00:03:30.650> this<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.609> source<00:03:31.910> block

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
because this is the source block

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.030 
because this is the source block
remember<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:32.690> need<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.959> flow<00:03:33.319> so<00:03:33.769> if<00:03:33.920> you

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
remember you need the flow so if you

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.720 
remember you need the flow so if you
create<00:03:34.370> one<00:03:34.730> more<00:03:35.239> space<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.040> flow<00:03:37.430> of

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
create one more space then the flow of

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.479 
create one more space then the flow of
the<00:03:38.090> lava<00:03:38.389> will<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:39.440> touching<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:39.920> water<00:03:40.220> and

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
the lava will be touching this water and

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.960 
the lava will be touching this water and
that<00:03:41.060> will<00:03:41.389> create<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:42.319> cobblestone<00:03:43.099> so<00:03:43.639> from

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
that will create the cobblestone so from

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.620 
that will create the cobblestone so from
two<00:03:44.180> liquids<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:44.959> get<00:03:45.380> one<00:03:46.010> piece<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:46.819> stone

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
two liquids you get one piece of stone

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.229 
two liquids you get one piece of stone
pretty<00:03:48.410> neat<00:03:48.680> there's<00:03:49.310> also<00:03:49.489> another<00:03:49.730> thing

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
pretty neat there's also another thing

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.819 
pretty neat there's also another thing
that<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.630> can<00:03:50.840> do<00:03:51.019> which<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.319> really<00:03:51.470> really

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
that you can do which is really really

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.509 
that you can do which is really really
cool<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.209> if<00:03:53.510> lava<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.650> flowing<00:03:54.889> down

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
cool and that is if lava is flowing down

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.140 
cool and that is if lava is flowing down
and<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.510> lands<00:03:56.810> on<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:57.410> top<00:03:57.950> of<00:03:58.430> water<00:03:58.730> we<00:03:59.120> can

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
and it lands on the top of water we can

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.789 
and it lands on the top of water we can
sort<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.870> see<00:04:00.079> this<00:04:00.260> it's<00:04:00.440> going<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.620> get<00:04:00.739> a

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
sort of see this it's going to get a

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.110 
sort of see this it's going to get a
little<00:04:01.069> messy<00:04:01.459> while<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.329> do<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:03.010> but<00:04:04.120> you'll

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
little messy while I do this but you'll

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.250 
little messy while I do this but you'll
be<00:04:05.180> able<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.540> see<00:04:05.690> what<00:04:05.810> I'm<00:04:05.870> talking<00:04:06.200> about

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
be able to see what I'm talking about

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.620 
be able to see what I'm talking about
the<00:04:07.040> lava<00:04:07.220> flows<00:04:07.579> down<00:04:07.880> just<00:04:08.180> like<00:04:08.269> this<00:04:08.389> it's

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
the lava flows down just like this it's

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.280 
the lava flows down just like this it's
going<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.810> touch<00:04:08.959> that<00:04:09.139> water<00:04:10.180> there<00:04:11.180> we<00:04:11.329> go<00:04:11.510> we

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
going to touch that water there we go we

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.870 
going to touch that water there we go we
should<00:04:12.319> be<00:04:12.560> able<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.799> pull<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.040> up<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:15.880> once

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
should be able to pull that up and once

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.379 
should be able to pull that up and once
this<00:04:17.150> goes<00:04:17.959> away<00:04:18.760> you'll<00:04:19.760> be<00:04:19.789> able<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.180> tell

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
this goes away you'll be able to tell

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.500 
this goes away you'll be able to tell
that<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:21.229> became<00:04:21.590> smooth<00:04:22.220> stone<00:04:22.700> so<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.210> this

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
that that became smooth stone so to this

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.490 
that that became smooth stone so to this
as<00:04:23.840> well<00:04:24.490> basically<00:04:25.539> instead<00:04:26.539> of<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.169> lava

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
as well basically instead of the lava

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.700 
as well basically instead of the lava
being<00:04:28.130> turned<00:04:28.520> into<00:04:28.880> a<00:04:29.450> block<00:04:29.900> which<00:04:30.349> is<00:04:30.560> like

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
being turned into a block which is like

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.430 
being turned into a block which is like
this<00:04:30.860> like<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.550> was<00:04:31.580> before<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.690> water<00:04:32.990> is

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
this like it was before the water is

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.830 
this like it was before the water is
turning<00:04:33.830> into<00:04:34.099> a<00:04:34.250> block<00:04:34.580> so<00:04:34.880> whenever<00:04:35.060> the

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
turning into a block so whenever the

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.839 
turning into a block so whenever the
water<00:04:36.140> is<00:04:37.039> sort<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.520> being

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
water is sort of being

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.119 
water is sort of being
forced<00:04:38.179> into<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.020> block<00:04:39.559> it<00:04:39.770> will<00:04:39.919> create

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
forced into a block it will create

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.049 
forced into a block it will create
smooth<00:04:40.969> stone<00:04:41.360> instead<00:04:42.349> of<00:04:42.830> cobblestone<00:04:43.789> so

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:44.059 
smooth stone instead of cobblestone so

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:47.559 
smooth stone instead of cobblestone so
we<00:04:44.179> can<00:04:44.360> use<00:04:44.569> this<00:04:45.339> over<00:04:46.339> here<00:04:46.610> this<00:04:46.909> method

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
we can use this over here this method

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.239 
we can use this over here this method
looks<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.199> little<00:04:48.319> bit<00:04:48.559> different<00:04:49.009> and<00:04:49.189> that

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:49.249 
looks a little bit different and that

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:53.379 
looks a little bit different and that
will<00:04:49.999> force<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.629> lava<00:04:50.809> to<00:04:51.050> flow<00:04:51.080> down<00:04:52.119> and<00:04:53.119> the

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
will force the lava to flow down and the

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.489 
will force the lava to flow down and the
water<00:04:53.809> will<00:04:54.110> fill<00:04:54.379> in<00:04:54.649> that<00:04:54.979> area<00:04:55.369> first

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:56.499 
water will fill in that area first

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.139 
water will fill in that area first
because<00:04:57.499> it<00:04:57.709> is<00:04:57.800> faster<00:04:58.249> than<00:04:58.399> the<00:04:58.520> lava<00:04:58.759> and

00:04:59.139 --> 00:04:59.149 
because it is faster than the lava and

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:03.399 
because it is faster than the lava and
you<00:05:00.080> will<00:05:00.319> get<00:05:00.669> this<00:05:01.669> smooth<00:05:02.419> stone<00:05:02.809> every

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
you will get this smooth stone every

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:05.769 
you will get this smooth stone every
single<00:05:03.830> time<00:05:04.099> so<00:05:04.819> you<00:05:04.939> could<00:05:05.330> if<00:05:05.539> you<00:05:05.629> had<00:05:05.659> a

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:05.779 
single time so you could if you had a

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.169 
single time so you could if you had a
soft<00:05:06.020> touch<00:05:06.199> pick<00:05:06.529> get<00:05:06.949> smooth<00:05:07.429> stone<00:05:07.699> as<00:05:07.969> well

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:08.179 
soft touch pick get smooth stone as well

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:09.820 
soft touch pick get smooth stone as well
oh<00:05:08.209> my<00:05:08.509> gosh<00:05:08.719> we're<00:05:09.050> going<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.259> create<00:05:09.619> all

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
oh my gosh we're going to create all

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.629 
oh my gosh we're going to create all
sorts<00:05:09.889> of<00:05:10.399> problems<00:05:10.639> here<00:05:11.149> oh<00:05:11.889> gosh<00:05:12.889> there<00:05:13.519> we

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
sorts of problems here oh gosh there we

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.989 
sorts of problems here oh gosh there we
go<00:05:13.789> I'm<00:05:14.509> on<00:05:14.749> a<00:05:14.779> laptop<00:05:15.050> so<00:05:15.559> my<00:05:16.309> kicky<00:05:16.639> my

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:16.999 
go I'm on a laptop so my kicky my

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.559 
go I'm on a laptop so my kicky my
clicking<00:05:17.509> was<00:05:17.899> not<00:05:18.110> fast<00:05:18.649> enough<00:05:19.419> that<00:05:20.419> will

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
clicking was not fast enough that will

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.139 
clicking was not fast enough that will
go<00:05:20.689> away<00:05:20.839> eventually<00:05:21.339> so<00:05:22.339> here<00:05:22.550> are<00:05:22.699> two<00:05:22.939> very

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:23.149 
go away eventually so here are two very

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:26.199 
go away eventually so here are two very
very<00:05:23.599> simple<00:05:24.639> generators<00:05:25.639> so<00:05:25.879> you<00:05:25.939> can

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:26.209 
very simple generators so you can

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:30.969 
very simple generators so you can
generate<00:05:26.659> blocks<00:05:27.319> in<00:05:27.740> Minecraft<00:05:28.509> from<00:05:29.979> liquid

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
generate blocks in Minecraft from liquid

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.759 
generate blocks in Minecraft from liquid
