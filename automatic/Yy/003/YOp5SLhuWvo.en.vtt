00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.890 

and<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.370> battery<00:01:42.760> is<00:01:42.820> easy<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.240> change<00:01:43.510> it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
and the battery is easy to change it's

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.770 
and the battery is easy to change it's
located<00:01:44.380> under<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.740> gas<00:01:44.920> tank<00:01:45.510> when<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.540> took

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
located under the gas tank when I took

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.770 
located under the gas tank when I took
it<00:01:46.900> all<00:01:46.990> apart<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.500> add<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.800> lining<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.340> I

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it all apart to add the lining to it I

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.359 
it all apart to add the lining to it I
went<00:01:49.780> ahead<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.020> took<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.740> battery<00:01:51.159> away<00:01:51.310> so

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
went ahead and took the battery away so

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.770 
went ahead and took the battery away so
it<00:01:51.520> could<00:01:51.610> be<00:01:51.640> easy<00:01:51.850> to<00:01:52.030> change<00:01:52.240> but<00:01:52.510> yet<00:01:52.630> would

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
it could be easy to change but yet would

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.210 
it could be easy to change but yet would
have<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:52.930> nice<00:01:53.170> sized<00:01:53.440> battery<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.010> would<00:01:54.100> last

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
have a nice sized battery and would last

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.760 
have a nice sized battery and would last
for<00:01:54.490> quite<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> while<00:01:55.320> while<00:01:56.320> we're<00:01:56.440> looking<00:01:56.680> at

faring<00:02:12.280> right<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.200> kind<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.440> out<00:02:14.590> of

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
faring right here so it's kind of out of

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.040 
faring right here so it's kind of out of
the<00:02:14.709> way<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.040> out<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.250> sight<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.870> not

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
the way and out of sight this is not

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.590 
the way and out of sight this is not
real<00:02:17.290> doesn't<00:02:17.800> stick<00:02:17.950> out<00:02:18.040> really<00:02:18.250> bad<00:02:18.459> as<00:02:19.390> far

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
real doesn't stick out really bad as far

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.050 
real doesn't stick out really bad as far
as<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.780> battery<00:02:20.080> change<00:02:20.380> goes<00:02:20.820> we<00:02:21.820> fit<00:02:21.970> it

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
as the battery change goes we fit it

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.270 
as the battery change goes we fit it
under<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.300> gas<00:02:22.450> tank<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.380> gas<00:02:23.530> tank<00:02:23.800> locks<00:02:24.040> in

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
under the gas tank the gas tank locks in

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.310 
under the gas tank the gas tank locks in
up<00:02:24.400> under<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> front<00:02:24.940> here<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.360> then<00:02:26.110> locks

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
up under the front here and then locks

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.870 
up under the front here and then locks
it<00:02:26.500> under<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.800> seat<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.310> got<00:02:27.459> these<00:02:27.550> pull<00:02:27.790> it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
it under the seat so I got these pull it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.370 
it under the seat so I got these pull it
forward<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.780> little<00:02:28.870> bit<00:02:29.019> and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
forward like this just a little bit and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.320 
forward like this just a little bit and
then<00:02:29.980> turn<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> handlebars<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:31.150> will

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
then turn the handlebars and this will

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.690 
then turn the handlebars and this will
pop<00:02:31.570> off<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.410> handlebars<00:02:32.890> back<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> left

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
pop off and handlebars back to the left

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.380 
pop off and handlebars back to the left
and<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:35.560> will<00:02:35.680> come<00:02:35.890> off<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.280> direction<00:02:36.760> then

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
and it will come off this direction then

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.850 
and it will come off this direction then
your<00:02:37.570> battery<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:37.930> located<00:02:38.350> underneath<00:02:38.620> right

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
your battery is located underneath right

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.270 
your battery is located underneath right
here<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:41.110> fairly<00:02:41.560> good<00:02:41.680> way<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.890> keep<00:02:42.130> that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
here so a fairly good way to keep that

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.920 
here so a fairly good way to keep that
battery<00:02:42.670> store<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.209> away<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.690> said<00:02:43.840> it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
battery store it away like I said it

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.660 
battery store it away like I said it
allows<00:02:44.110> for<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.410> larger<00:02:44.709> battery<00:02:45.070> in<00:02:45.190> here<00:02:45.400> and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
allows for a larger battery in here and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.550 
allows for a larger battery in here and
just<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.570> course<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.900> put<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:47.110> back<00:02:47.230> on<00:02:47.380> just

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
just of course to put it back on just

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.800 
just of course to put it back on just
