the<00:01:23.960> one<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:24.140> was<00:01:24.260> looking<00:01:24.290> for<00:01:24.710> at<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.040> store

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
the one I was looking for at the store

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.030 
the one I was looking for at the store
anyways<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:26.840> basically<00:01:27.170> you're<00:01:27.530> gonna<00:01:27.650> do

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
anyways so basically you're gonna do

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.320 
anyways so basically you're gonna do
slits<00:01:28.610> right<00:01:28.820> inside<00:01:29.480> of<00:01:29.750> both<00:01:30.470> lines<00:01:31.330> I'm

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
slits right inside of both lines I'm

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.510 
slits right inside of both lines I'm
just<00:01:32.810> doing<00:01:33.080> that<00:01:33.230> right<00:01:33.470> there<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:33.950> allow

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
just doing that right there and allow

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.650 
just doing that right there and allow
about<00:01:34.760> half<00:01:35.030> an<00:01:35.210> inch<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.960> between<00:01:36.440> each<00:01:36.920> line

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
about half an inch in between each line

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.870 
about half an inch in between each line
so<00:01:38.660> that's<00:01:38.750> about<00:01:39.200> half<00:01:39.560> an<00:01:39.710> inch<00:01:39.920> doesn't

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
so that's about half an inch doesn't

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.700 
so that's about half an inch doesn't
have<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.060> be<00:01:41.150> perfect<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.750> know<00:01:41.840> after<00:01:42.470> all<00:01:42.590> it

for the rate blade so I added a little

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.230 
for the rate blade so I added a little
cloth<00:02:38.110> over<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.250> yeah<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.700> being<00:02:39.850> careful

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
cloth over so yeah it's being careful

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.510 
cloth over so yeah it's being careful
safe<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.780> I'm<00:02:41.620> continuing<00:02:41.890> through<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.250> same

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
to do this as well you can just cut off

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.030 
to do this as well you can just cut off
a<00:03:31.090> little<00:03:31.450> bit<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.960> you<00:03:32.380> know<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.620> outside

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
a little bit of you know the outside

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.560 
a little bit of you know the outside
edges<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.580> know<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.790> top<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.150> pockets

edges you know the top of the pockets

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.370
