00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
get even lower so every camera has the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.110 
get even lower so every camera has the
ability<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:53.960> do<00:00:54.440> this<00:00:54.800> every<00:00:55.400> cell<00:00:55.640> phone<00:00:55.670> you

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120
