so siege tanks are absolutely important

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.170 
so siege tanks are absolutely important
that's<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> things<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.280> shine<00:01:56.850> did

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that's one of the things that shine did

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.109 
that's one of the things that shine did
not<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.570> versus<00:01:58.049> boxer<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.890> sorry<00:01:59.790> versus

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
not have versus boxer in sorry versus

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.209 
not have versus boxer in sorry versus
silver<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.630> game<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.079> without<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.100> sea

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
silver in that game and without the sea

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.469 
silver in that game and without the sea
shines<00:02:02.460> he<00:02:02.549> wasn't<00:02:02.759> able<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.030> counter<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
shines he wasn't able to counter the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
shines he wasn't able to counter the
hydras<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.619> think<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.100> fact<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.369> boxer

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
hydras so I think the fact that boxer

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.100 
hydras so I think the fact that boxer
has<00:02:05.790> gotten<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.149> siege<00:02:06.329> tank<00:02:06.509> up<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.780> gonna<00:02:06.960> help

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
has gotten a siege tank up is gonna help

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.240 
has gotten a siege tank up is gonna help
him<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.500> versus<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> hydrolase

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
him a little bit versus the hydrolase

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.979 
him a little bit versus the hydrolase
