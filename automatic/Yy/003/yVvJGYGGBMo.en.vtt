 that in one with a video we are in 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.160
 throwing a corner on the contrary is 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.230
 advancing a corner and it is ending 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.199
 the match and go up to the goalkeeper noel 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.170
 he climbs the way up and rejects him 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.810

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.620

 in a goal that scored a goal that 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.540
 the match is already ending 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:59.420

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.170
