00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.129
 We will continue to introduce the advanced equipment 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.440
 All models are equipped as standard 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.199
 City Emergency Brake 4 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:23.050
 Even if it is a compact car, even if it is an entry model, it is all about safety 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:25.539
 Accompanied by Volkswagen's policy of not compromise 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.530
 Was done 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.670
 For new type golf 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.710
 We further enhanced this st emergency brake with white point 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:40.489
 The latest pre-crash brake system 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.489
 All models will be standard equipped with front assist plus 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:53.399
 While this function is driving at 30 km / h or more, the vehicle can not be purchased and it is against 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 Gives a warning to the driver when he recognizes the danger of a collision 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:06.979
 And at the same time the brake goes into standby mode and prepares in principle 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:10.990
 If the driver still does not respond, the vehicle will automatically brake and cause a collision 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.990
 Minimize the damage of 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:23.850
 Also like this 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:29.660
 A house with a tree that prevents 20 clashes in case of clashes in addition to the ability to maximize clashes 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.660
 Police brakes were also adopted for all new golf models 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.040
 This function is by the German Automobile Federation 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:44.730
 Safety novation has been awarded a yellow soil 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:48.350
 Forced braking immediately when getting involved in an accident greatly increases completion energy 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.350
 To reduce 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.030
 This can prevent secondary damage such as going out to the oncoming lane 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:08.270
 One-fourth of personal injury is due to multiple collisions 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:16.120
 There is also such Volkswagen internal survey data 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:16.120
 So this function is extremely effective in order not to spread the damage in case of emergency 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:28.350
 Only advanced grades are available for new golf 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.090
 Adaptive cruise control with water 10 function in all speed range 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.090
 I will set acc 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.430
 This ecc is 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:45.890
 Together and over distance drive at high speed make them comfortable and stress-free 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:50.170
 Fatigue from frequent braking operations that often occur during slow speed traffic jams 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.170
 I will reduce these things 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.420
 And it is function to prevent lane May 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.420
 Train assistant 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.910
 It was installed on the windscreen camera running ejaculation constantly 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:21.330
 By monitoring 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:28.820
 If the car moves against the driver чев range, such as a stroke in the lane 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.820
 It is a function to correct the trajectory of the vehicle by automatically correcting the steering in addition to the valley . 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:40.010
 This time more 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:46.819
 A new feature called the existing at the same time as a professional, and a loaf pan is also standard equipment in previous life 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:48.750
 This is based on the collision of the seat belt in case the sensor billed danger from the behavior of the vehicle 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.569
 At the same time as applying tension 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.020
 All windows 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.530
 And by automatically closing the sliding roof 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.040
 Side or curtain 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.040
 And it optimizes the effects of curtain airbags
