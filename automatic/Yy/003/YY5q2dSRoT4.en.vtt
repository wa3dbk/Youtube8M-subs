ahead and back out let's go to our solar
system<00:01:24.810> there's<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.049> lot<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.439> our<00:01:25.560> solar<00:01:25.770> system

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
system there's a lot to our solar system

gonna be able to show you guys

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.719 
gonna be able to show you guys
everything<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.009> video<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.490> there's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
everything in this video because there's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:02:13.620 
everything in this video because there's
so<00:01:47.880> much<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.420> go

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.890 

Venus<00:02:14.470> rotates<00:02:14.770> so<00:02:15.400> slowly<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.600> takes

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
Venus rotates so slowly that it takes

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.110 
Venus rotates so slowly that it takes
longer<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.530> spin<00:02:17.680> on<00:02:17.890> its<00:02:18.040> axis<00:02:18.190> than<00:02:18.790> he<00:02:18.880> does

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
longer to spin on its axis than he does

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.230 
longer to spin on its axis than he does
to<00:02:19.390> go<00:02:19.630> around<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.080> Sun<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.550> Venus<00:02:21.970> a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
to go around the Sun so that on Venus a

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.920 
to go around the Sun so that on Venus a
day<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:23.080> longer<00:02:23.410> than<00:02:23.620> here

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.350 

further<00:02:28.560> out<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.220> planet's<00:02:29.250> orbit<00:02:29.849> more<00:02:30.299> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
further out the planet's orbit more and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360 
further out the planet's orbit more and
more<00:02:30.750> slowly

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
more slowly

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.630 
more slowly
Jupiter<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.750> largest<00:02:33.780> planet<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.830> 12<00:02:35.310> earth

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
Jupiter the largest planet to 12 earth

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.790 
Jupiter the largest planet to 12 earth
years<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.480> complete<00:02:37.050> each<00:02:37.260> orbit

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.100 

and<00:02:40.220> at<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.520> very<00:02:40.790> furthest<00:02:41.450> reaches<00:02:41.900> at<00:02:42.020> the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
and at the very furthest reaches at the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.380 
and at the very furthest reaches at the
solar<00:02:42.350> system<00:02:42.830> four<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.700> half<00:02:43.730> billion

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
solar system four and a half billion

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.170 
solar system four and a half billion
kilometres<00:02:44.810> from<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.560> Sun<00:02:45.770> Neptune<00:02:46.460> travels

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
kilometres from the Sun Neptune travels

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.630 
kilometres from the Sun Neptune travels
so<00:02:47.570> slowly<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.590> hasn't<00:02:48.860> completed<00:02:49.550> a

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
so slowly that it hasn't completed a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.940 
so slowly that it hasn't completed a
single<00:02:49.910> orbit<00:02:50.240> since<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.990> was<00:02:51.080> discovered<00:02:51.350> in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
single orbit since it was discovered in

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:02.880 
single orbit since it was discovered in
1846<00:02:54.250> that's<00:02:55.250> crazy

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.900 

so<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.040> want<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.190> exit<00:03:04.460> a<00:03:04.520> video<00:03:04.700> just<00:03:04.850> go

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
so if you want to exit a video just go

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.010 
so if you want to exit a video just go
ahead<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.150> swipe<00:03:05.300> up<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.690> there's<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.870> whole

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
ahead and swipe up and there's a whole

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.660 
ahead and swipe up and there's a whole
bunch<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.260> literature<00:03:06.800> and<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.100> ton<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.370> stuff

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
bunch of literature and a ton of stuff

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.180 
bunch of literature and a ton of stuff
to<00:03:07.820> read<00:03:07.970> within<00:03:08.240> this<00:03:08.420> app<00:03:08.600> as<00:03:08.810> well<00:03:09.190> there's

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
to read within this app as well there's

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.550 
to read within this app as well there's
a<00:03:10.280> lot<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.550> different<00:03:10.790> photos<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:12.290> as<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.470> can

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
a lot of different photos so as you can

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.990 
a lot of different photos so as you can
see<00:03:12.740> this<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.070> basically<00:03:13.430> kind<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
see this is basically kind of like the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.720 
see this is basically kind of like the
first<00:03:14.240> chapter<00:03:14.890> ton<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:15.920> stuff<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.520> there's

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
first chapter ton of stuff to it there's

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.190 
first chapter ton of stuff to it there's
so<00:03:16.970> much<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:17.630> app<00:03:17.810> it's<00:03:18.020> pretty

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
so much in this app it's pretty

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.410 
so much in this app it's pretty
ridiculous<00:03:18.590> if<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.610> want<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:19.940> close<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.300> just

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
ridiculous if you want to close it just

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.860 
ridiculous if you want to close it just
go<00:03:20.570> ahead<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.870> swipe<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.290> away<00:03:22.450> then<00:03:23.450> as<00:03:23.660> you

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
go ahead and swipe it away then as you

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.210 
go ahead and swipe it away then as you
can<00:03:23.960> see<00:03:24.020> here<00:03:24.350> are<00:03:24.470> all<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.920> different

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
can see here are all the different

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.550 
can see here are all the different
sections<00:03:25.400> for<00:03:25.850> within<00:03:26.030> just<00:03:26.390> our<00:03:27.110> solar

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
sections for within just our solar

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.770 
sections for within just our solar
system<00:03:27.980> there's<00:03:28.250> so<00:03:28.640> much<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:29.300> app<00:03:29.540> it's

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
system there's so much in this app it's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.220 
system there's so much in this app it's
pretty<00:03:30.020> ridiculous<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:32.060> here's<00:03:32.510> all<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.900> our

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
pretty ridiculous so here's all of our

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.650 
pretty ridiculous so here's all of our
solar<00:03:33.470> system<00:03:33.920> stuff<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.400> goes<00:03:34.520> on<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:34.970> on<00:03:35.030> we

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
solar system stuff it goes on and on we

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.260 
solar system stuff it goes on and on we
can<00:03:35.810> back<00:03:35.990> out<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.380> we<00:03:36.560> can<00:03:36.710> go<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:37.150> let's<00:03:38.150> go

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
can back out and we can go to let's go

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:48.610 
can back out and we can go to let's go
to<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:39.080> Milky<00:03:39.410> Way<00:03:39.440> which<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:39.890> our<00:03:40.190> galaxy

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.649 

a<00:03:48.709> ton<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.489> stuff<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:49.849> explore<00:03:50.390> in<00:03:50.510> this

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
a ton of stuff to explore in this

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.509 
a ton of stuff to explore in this
application<00:03:51.200> guys<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.349> can't<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:51.890> can't<00:03:52.370> tell

really stunning so let's go ahead let's
open<00:03:57.530> up<00:03:57.739> our<00:03:57.920> our<00:03:58.640> galactic<00:03:59.299> neighborhood

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
open up our our galactic neighborhood

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.869 
open up our our galactic neighborhood
and<00:04:00.319> here<00:04:01.129> we're<00:04:01.250> presented<00:04:01.640> with<00:04:01.670> another

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
and here we're presented with another

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.339 
and here we're presented with another
video<00:04:02.299> so<00:04:02.540> I'll<00:04:02.629> go<00:04:02.780> ahead<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:02.989> let<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.170> play

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
video so I'll go ahead and let this play

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:15.059 
video so I'll go ahead and let this play
again

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.560 

Milky<00:04:15.430> Way<00:04:16.709> as<00:04:17.709> we<00:04:17.949> step<00:04:18.190> away<00:04:18.340> our<00:04:19.209> so

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
Milky Way as we step away our so

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.740 
Milky Way as we step away our so
gradually<00:04:20.470> fades<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:21.639> become<00:04:21.880> just<00:04:22.150> one<00:04:22.210> dot

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
gradually fades to become just one dot

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.400 
gradually fades to become just one dot
in<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.650> sea<00:04:23.979> of<00:04:24.009> stars

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
in a sea of stars

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.500 
in a sea of stars
we<00:04:26.890> now<00:04:27.040> know<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.280> we<00:04:27.520> are<00:04:27.670> about<00:04:27.880> half<00:04:28.210> way

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
we now know that we are about half way
