00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hello, psycho arthur and today will be 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.830
 next podcast I do not remember there what 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.750
 account 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.259
 tell you a little general about what 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.080
 happened last time means 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.310
 passed here first and stremchik finally 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.859
 we figured out with the tuner what was 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.750
 the problem is why I could not stream here 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.060
 maybe someone got to the very first 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.849
 test stream where I was hanging 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.920
 The picture in general, the problem was that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.199
 during the time I streamed me 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.930
 fraps is launched then there it is 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.450
 actually the whole problem really 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.110
 we set everything up for the sake of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.750
 has turned people's well liked by 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.960
 most were of course comments about 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.320
 the fact that yes a lot of mat a lot of inadequate 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.469
 everything but the boys asked a number 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.449
 sometimes in the comments silently no 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.780
 arthur you're so calm when you do 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.520
 video how is it so strange well really 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.460
 I am calm and when I make a video 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.830
 because I'm not bombed but in our game 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.010
 I really bombed and 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.220
 bombs very often in principle this experience 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.640
 we are playing our game tanks and like 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.560
 that's how it makes tense let's say 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 so basically how we communicate with 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.729
 our boys from our company in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.650
 timspike 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.159
 in principle, I decided not to veil everything 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.119
 it does not pretend to be some and sapan 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.369
 sorbe kogure 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.490
 probably never really swear 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.520
 well, it's clear this society when 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.930
 communicating with people yes just on the street 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.590
 or with friends, I do not like Cursing Yes 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.410
 ok but on the internet in timspic 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.900
 to restrain oneself in order to 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.690
 gain more viewers or is there somehow 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.950
 attract audience I think for streams 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.890
 it is not so important in principle those who were 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.100
 interesting is just such a life gameplay 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.149
 my see how it all happens I 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.550
 I think they like the format and those who do not 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.239
 like mate and stuff just pay 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:21.150
 attention to the cover 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:25.170
 streams down there on the left there is a plate on 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.300
 ranta 8 vat expeed content in general hotel 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.020
 18 + remat and mats 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:36.270
 u so i think it sorted it out 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.940
 Now, about could while recently there 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.739
 came out to this update in their own still in 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.489
 Rainier cults I think to write a separate 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.100
 video and add it to modpak well in the dust 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.600
 pokamist itself like this so corrected 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.130
 there without hanging up with carousel kai 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.700
 tanks in the hangar then still appeared 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.370
 wealth literally disappeared today 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.739
 tank inscriptions everywhere ie mini cards 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:07.830
 of these, well, in short, you understand who this tank 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.489
 there was a snapshot I don't know yet I just replaced 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.810
 samsung 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.549
 that is, I'm in the description for this podcast 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.330
 leave a link to download on Yandex 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:22.010
 drive but if you go in the dust with poppies 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.519
 go to that video there too 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.310
 proper link 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.100
 I replaced it there with a video can from there 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.560
 download again that is and reinstall 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.329
 deed 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.690
 remove consider let's back 1 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.959
 someone asked me this vkontakte mod 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.900
 They wrote me and here is how to set the mod fact 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.570
 well seriously guys really need someone 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.640
 do here a guide write like 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.740
 set it on google 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.930
 seriously simple and the junction of the site 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.960
 like giving google instead of you here 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.970
 just like everybody needs 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.750
 link to give yes that's how it should be 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.390
 correctly coals as here and because 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.180
 set fashion well it's funny so 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.240
 I don't want to do this anyway 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.000
 I hope that my audience is music 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.200
 about experienced users let's say 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.520
 Internet leaving stumbled upon my 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.300
 channel which is not particularly anywhere 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:26.410
 advertised would also like to learn about 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.090
 your viewers actually how would you 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.090
 like so that I spent stream and 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.610
 because now I have noticed that I can in 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.500
 principle go into the game 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.660
 include shooting and play well as usual 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.790
 i play just always aim at 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.310
 principle I can because it does not 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.910
 almost affects the FPS there a little bit 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.710
 less literally something imperceptible quality 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.530
 like normal well, sort of like you see 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.680
 especially did not complain about the quality 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:56.140
 although I have not waited for 1080 yet 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.910
 Understandably when I stream 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.790
 I could not check it out yet 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.820
 lies on the channel it is processed there and 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.740
 unfortunately one of the grains of sand at the moment 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.260
 when I walked away from the computer . yes she 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.740
 played without my voice on top she 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.970
 recognized there somehow 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.910
 shorter claims put forward to me 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.860
 and it is not monetized this video 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.210
 so I decided to do it bye 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.270
 closed access 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:26.500
 I'll wait for him to update there 1080 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:30.040
 mind you would download the moment there where the music 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.980
 you and i will cut a little 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.530
 neatly and I'll upload this video on 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.800
 youtube back to a separate playlist 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.410
 records of streams and this one now 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.510
 I'll tell you where I shoved it here 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.240
 there is a different section 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.120
 on the main page of the channel and here 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.550
 just be a playlist to actually 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.580
 stream recordings and there you can find 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.460
 this record is a four-hour stream from 1 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.110
 before such a debut you can check out all 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:05.460
 it did a special streamer affected 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.460
 as told 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:15.990
 so that's all in fact and in life all 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.990
 thanks for watching me all good luck
