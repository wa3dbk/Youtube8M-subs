00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 Dr. Jeong Jung, I am now wondering what happened this time 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.599
 I wonder how it affects inter-Korean relations . 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.900
 How do you see there are several household appliances Yes Bug Now North Korea 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.289
 It is quite quiet internally as well as flow 4 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.289
 But now this is publicly 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:30.240
 Uh says the trees again this North inner chancel around 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:35.160
 Here you'll now struggling to incisor own internal requirements, for example, so that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:40.170
 Can I get somewhat a little stabilized intermittent wind the example external to the relationship 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.550
 When it was all hot and normalize and develop any such 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.260
 But the cooler that has not been around for a while has lasted for me. 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.079
 Let the other it also true 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:56.190
 Such that in some sense they are normally operating the system I un 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.140
 It is well known that the only system of governance is being studied. 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:05.070
 For example, some kind of inter-Korean relations to a more resolutely For that, externally 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.990
 The example for improvement is to propose what it is to the ancient world. 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.880
 So yes now the possibility can not be entirely ruled out IMHO 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.200
 I can tell you a little bit about the nutrition of these cases 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.380
 Examples of such external control over the degree of the ceramic itself is no longer with me, etc. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.570
 Haejusijyo some factors expected to end in the end of the world 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 For what I bojineun domestic issues and the Word angled drilling in the North-South issues 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.210
 I think enlightenment to China go up you have any relations with China 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.259
 Recently 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:44.549
 In addition to the name of Jang Sung Taek , 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:48.720
 In connection with China, it was easy to say that it was good to say at least 5 new 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.180
 A positive lift nose to the new situation really coming together Eun Ji Won In 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.549
 I'll make it clear in the future 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:00.630
 However , as before, Kim Jong Eun had to give China some value 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:05.880
 When you know about the effects that can be processed at it will probably issue a press of Jang Sung Taek 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:11.310
 I know that the old problem is now waiting for the Wall. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.470
 Kim Jong Un What happened through the really central China, the relationship between bukjung go 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.800
 Whether or not it should be removed in the future 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.970
 China is perhaps through this, too 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.810
 In a situation where it is imperative to implement a policy that is stricter, 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.140
 But get out Zorro is finally one day I called to talk of 30,000 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.450
 For the material of the further period of time between steps in the North-South own 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.920
 This camp is now public, Kim Jong Un, North Korea through me, but North Korea 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:42.360
 A little more time in terms of what stated only that can move me two times 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.640
 4 This incident North Korean pop seems to have a big impact for the time being 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.500
 Jang Seong-taek seems to have a little more eye on how it will evolve. 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:56.160
 At the time of contagion , senior researcher of the Korea Institute for National Unification 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.160
 And Chae Myung-shin and political journalists was often hide more details. 4
