00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.170 
the place and there's not too large
where<00:00:34.140> things<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.649> trapped<00:00:34.980> between

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
where things will get trapped between

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.000 
where things will get trapped between
particles<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> nice<00:00:37.380> in-between

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
particles so it is a nice in-between

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.670

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
this I believe to have a choice of a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.900 
this I believe to have a choice of a
curved<00:00:45.870> send<00:00:46.110> live<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.039> regular<00:00:47.340> dry<00:00:47.610> ones

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
curved send live or the regular dry ones

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.060 
curved send live or the regular dry ones
given<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.840> choice<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.500> go<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> dry

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
given a choice I would go of the dry

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.240 
given a choice I would go of the dry
ones<00:00:50.390> although<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.840> did<00:00:52.469> not<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> dry

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
ones although I did not see the dry

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.700 
ones although I did not see the dry
option<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.850> Amazon<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> end<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.320> doing

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
option on Amazon so what I end up doing

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.310 
option on Amazon so what I end up doing
is<00:00:55.829> buying<00:00:56.129> two<00:00:56.520> bags<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.329> quote<00:00:58.050> cold

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
is buying two bags of the quote cold

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.630 
is buying two bags of the quote cold
live<00:00:59.180> could<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.449> sent<00:01:00.690> from<00:01:00.899> KFC<00:01:01.170> I

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
live could you think sent from KFC I

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.799 
live could you think sent from KFC I
believe<00:01:02.640> they<00:01:02.850> say<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.149> there's<00:01:03.449> some<00:01:03.600> kind

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
believe they say that there's some kind

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.479 
believe they say that there's some kind
of<00:01:03.870> bacteria<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.350> kind<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.710> comes<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
of bacteria that kind of comes with the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.270 
of bacteria that kind of comes with the
sand<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.720> sand<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> actually<00:01:07.290> packed<00:01:07.560> wet

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
sand the sand is actually packed wet

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
sand the sand is actually packed wet
meaning<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.390> Bezalel<00:01:10.020> water<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.470> there

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
meaning that this Bezalel water in there

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.690 
meaning that this Bezalel water in there
so<00:01:10.830> there's<00:01:10.950> water<00:01:11.130> weight<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.580> know

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
so there's water weight you know

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.250 
so there's water weight you know
actually<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> much<00:01:12.450> scent<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.049> in

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
actually get that much scent but in

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.550 
actually get that much scent but in
return<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.950> beneficial<00:01:14.790> bacteria

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
return you get beneficial bacteria

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.039 
return you get beneficial bacteria
now<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:16.860> bacteria<00:01:17.600> if<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.750> remember<00:01:18.900> right

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
now these bacteria if I remember right

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.929 
now these bacteria if I remember right
they're<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.979> typical<00:01:20.189> ones<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
they're not the typical ones that you

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789 
they're not the typical ones that you
find<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.390> reef<00:01:21.570> tank<00:01:21.600> or<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.680> least

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
find in a reef tank or like at least

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.200 
find in a reef tank or like at least
like<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> ones<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> help<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.880> cycle

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
like not the ones that help you cycle

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.060 
like not the ones that help you cycle
and<00:01:24.299> stuff<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.170> they<00:01:25.799> claim<00:01:26.040> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and stuff like that but they claim that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.160 
and stuff like that but they claim that
it<00:01:26.280> would<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.430> beneficial<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> tank<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.479> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
it would be beneficial for the tank so I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.580 
it would be beneficial for the tank so I
mean<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:29.520> fine<00:01:30.049> again<00:01:31.049> give<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.320> try<00:01:31.470> so

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
mean that's fine again give it a try so

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.050 
mean that's fine again give it a try so
I'll<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.770> over<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> dry<00:01:32.100> wan<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.610> due<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.939> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I'll go over to dry wan but due to a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
I'll go over to dry wan but due to a
lack<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> options<00:01:33.570> I'd<00:01:33.990> love<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.350> live<00:01:34.530> which

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
lack of options I'd love to live which

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.249 
lack of options I'd love to live which
serve<00:01:36.119> his<00:01:36.270> purpose<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.659> little<00:01:37.020> bit<00:01:37.110> more

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
serve his purpose a little bit more

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.899 
serve his purpose a little bit more
expensive<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.310> mean<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.700> looks<00:01:39.150> nice<00:01:39.329> so

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
expensive but I mean it's looks nice so

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.310 
expensive but I mean it's looks nice so

to the refugee jail I was hoping to get
about<00:03:18.799> three<00:03:19.190> inches<00:03:19.549> I<00:03:19.790> think<00:03:20.510> I'm<00:03:20.870> almost

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
about three inches I think I'm almost

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.520 
about three inches I think I'm almost
there<00:03:21.470> not<00:03:21.709> quite<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.330> about<00:03:23.540> two<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.470> a

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
there not quite this is about two and a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.600 
there not quite this is about two and a
half<00:03:24.650> inches<00:03:24.890> off<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:26.799> would<00:03:27.799> not<00:03:27.920> like<00:03:28.100> I<00:03:28.430> would

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
half inches off I would not like I would

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.360 
half inches off I would not like I would
not<00:03:28.700> be<00:03:28.820> like<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.970> typical<00:03:29.239> guy<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.540> round<00:03:29.690> up<00:03:29.900> I

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
not be like a typical guy and round up I

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.500 
not be like a typical guy and round up I
think<00:03:31.370> I'm<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.459> little<00:03:31.670> bit<00:03:31.760> short<00:03:31.940> on<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:32.450> in

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
think I'm a little bit short on it so in

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.640 
think I'm a little bit short on it so in
the<00:03:32.570> future<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:32.870> would<00:03:32.989> add<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.230> little<00:03:33.380> bit<00:03:33.620> more
