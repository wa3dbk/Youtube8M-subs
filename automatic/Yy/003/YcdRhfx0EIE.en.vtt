the<00:00:06.359> problem<00:00:06.720> came<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.109> mango<00:00:07.470> theory<00:00:07.830> which

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
the problem came to mango theory which

the problem came to mango theory which
was<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.490> know<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.700> kind<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.000> basic<00:00:09.389> model<00:00:09.660> is

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
was you know the kind of basic model is

was you know the kind of basic model is
that<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.440> very<00:00:10.860> heavily<00:00:11.370> assumption-based<00:00:11.969> and

to<00:01:01.500> add<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:01.859> pound<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.250> needs<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.910> consider

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
to add one pound it needs to consider

to add one pound it needs to consider
the<00:01:04.019> expected<00:01:04.589> reaction<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.070> firm<00:01:05.280> being

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the expected reaction of firm being

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
making a decision before working out

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.200 
making a decision before working out
whether<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.250> right<00:01:08.460> thing<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:08.939> or<00:01:08.970> not

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
whether it's a right thing to do or not

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.300 
whether it's a right thing to do or not
so<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.619> draw<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so what we can do we can draw one of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.660 
so what we can do we can draw one of
these<00:01:11.400> grids<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.000> called<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.299> payoff<00:01:12.659> matrix

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
these grids it's called a payoff matrix

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.160 
these grids it's called a payoff matrix
which<00:01:14.670> represents<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> game<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:15.900> going

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
which represents the game that's going

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
which represents the game that's going
on<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.710> okay<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> game<00:01:17.549> very<00:01:17.790> simply<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
on here okay the game very simply is a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.950 
on here okay the game very simply is a
versus<00:01:19.080> B<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.340> beat<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.450> beat<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
maximizing profits that's the game

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
maximizing profits that's the game
that's<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.430> what<00:01:27.150> does<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that's going on so what does it

this<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> breed<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:47.070> helps<00:01:47.340> us<00:01:47.430> work<00:01:47.579> things

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
this is breed it helps us work things

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.940 
this is breed it helps us work things
out<00:01:47.939> very<00:01:48.149> nicely<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> figures<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
out very nicely so the figures on the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.179 
out very nicely so the figures on the
Left<00:01:50.159> applied<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.270> firm<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.720> all<00:01:52.439> right<00:01:52.500> so

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
Left applied to firm a all right so

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.069 
Left applied to firm a all right so
let's<00:01:53.369> say<00:01:53.520> therm<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.000> went<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.689> charge<00:01:54.899> one

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
let's say therm a went to charge one

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.620 
let's say therm a went to charge one
pound<00:01:55.369> it<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.610> either<00:01:56.729> own<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.329> million

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
pound it can either own two million

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.959 
pound it can either own two million
pounds<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:58.079> 1<00:01:58.229> million<00:01:58.439> pound<00:01:58.740> ok<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> figures

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
pounds or 1 million pound ok the figures

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.760 
pounds or 1 million pound ok the figures
on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.090> Left<00:02:00.360> apply<00:02:00.630> deferment<00:02:01.469> whereas<00:02:01.649> if

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
on the Left apply deferment whereas if

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.730 
on the Left apply deferment whereas if
MB<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.700> figures<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.180> right<00:02:03.320> apply<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
MB the figures on the right apply to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
MB the figures on the right apply to
third<00:02:04.950> B<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.520> third<00:02:05.820> B<00:02:06.030> decided<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> charge

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
third B so third B decided to charge

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.410 
third B so third B decided to charge
warming<00:02:07.439> at<00:02:07.590> 1<00:02:07.799> pound<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.610> could<00:02:08.789> either<00:02:08.879> 2

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
warming at 1 pound it could either 2

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.230 
warming at 1 pound it could either 2
million<00:02:09.690> pounds<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.200> 1

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
million pounds or 1

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.390 
million pounds or 1
okay<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:12.230> fix<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.650> right<00:02:12.800> firm<00:02:13.130> B

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
okay so the fix on the right firm B

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.330 
okay so the fix on the right firm B
things<00:02:13.730> on<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.910> Left<00:02:14.120> fairly<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.980> beauty<00:02:16.310> of

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
things on the Left fairly the beauty of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.640 
things on the Left fairly the beauty of
this<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:16.970> can<00:02:17.630> work<00:02:17.780> out<00:02:17.990> what<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.260> firm<00:02:18.470> to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
this is we can work out what the firm to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.890 
this is we can work out what the firm to
come<00:02:18.770> work<00:02:18.950> out<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.730> expected<00:02:20.090> reactions<00:02:20.750> of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
come work out the expected reactions of

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.050 
come work out the expected reactions of
their<00:02:21.020> rivals<00:02:21.280> when<00:02:22.280> they<00:02:22.460> make<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> decision

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
their rivals when they make a decision

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.600 
their rivals when they make a decision
so<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:23.630> they<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.990> decide<00:02:24.080> what<00:02:24.920> decision<00:02:25.490> is

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
so then they can decide what decision is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.000 
so then they can decide what decision is
optimal<00:02:26.150> for<00:02:26.180> themselves<00:02:26.740> beauty<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.830> game

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
optimal for themselves beauty of game

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.640 
optimal for themselves beauty of game
theory<00:02:28.600> okay<00:02:29.600> I'm<00:02:29.780> going<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.050> isolate<00:02:30.230> those

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
theory okay I'm going to isolate those

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.280 
theory okay I'm going to isolate those
those<00:02:31.190> decisions<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.820> green<00:02:32.120> okay<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.050> what

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
those decisions in green okay so what

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.560 
those decisions in green okay so what
I'm<00:02:33.410> going<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.590> say<00:02:33.770> is<00:02:33.950> let's<00:02:34.490> assume<00:02:34.880> firm<00:02:35.270> B

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
I'm going to say is let's assume firm B

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.640 
I'm going to say is let's assume firm B
makes<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:36.050> decision<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:37.280> should<00:02:37.580> they<00:02:38.060> do

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
makes a decision what should they do

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.590 
makes a decision what should they do
given<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.680> decision<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.850> Furby<00:02:41.270> is<00:02:41.390> made

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
given that decision that Furby is made

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.600 
given that decision that Furby is made
right<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.470> this<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:43.010> how<00:02:43.160> firms<00:02:43.460> would

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
right so this is just how firms would

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.550 
right so this is just how firms would
actually<00:02:43.910> make<00:02:44.060> decision<00:02:44.480> themselves<00:02:44.630> so

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
actually make decision themselves so

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.250 
actually make decision themselves so
let's<00:02:45.770> say<00:02:45.920> third<00:02:46.190> B<00:02:46.430> went<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.630> charged<00:02:48.050> at

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
let's say third B went and charged at

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.950 
let's say third B went and charged at
one<00:02:48.530> pound<00:02:48.770> what<00:02:49.370> should<00:02:49.640> they<00:02:50.090> do<00:02:50.360> well<00:02:50.840> at

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
one pound what should they do well at

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.380 
one pound what should they do well at
one<00:02:51.140> pound<00:02:51.320> firm<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.920> can<00:02:52.490> either<00:02:52.730> earn<00:02:53.060> two

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
one pound firm a can either earn two

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.050 
one pound firm a can either earn two
million<00:02:53.720> pounds<00:02:53.870> worth<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.260> profits<00:02:54.620> or<00:02:55.060> 2.2

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
million pounds worth of profits or 2.2

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.940 
million pounds worth of profits or 2.2
million<00:02:56.300> pounds<00:02:56.540> worth<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:56.930> profits<00:02:57.260> well<00:02:57.860> it

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
million pounds worth of profits well it

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.860 
million pounds worth of profits well it
makes<00:02:58.130> logical<00:02:58.700> sense<00:02:59.000> assuming<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.780> the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
makes logical sense assuming that the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.540 
makes logical sense assuming that the
profit<00:03:00.200> maximizers<00:03:00.830> for<00:03:01.310> firm<00:03:01.520> a<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:02.380> produce

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
profit maximizers for firm a to produce

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.310 
profit maximizers for firm a to produce
or<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.610> make<00:03:04.850> 2.2<00:03:05.360> million<00:03:05.540> pound<00:03:05.750> profits<00:03:06.170> and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
or to make 2.2 million pound profits and

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.080

similar decisions but a therm a charged
at<00:03:32.960> one<00:03:33.170> pound<00:03:33.440> okay<00:03:34.310> these<00:03:34.550> two<00:03:34.610> subs<00:03:35.000> were<00:03:35.150> up

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
at one pound okay these two subs were up

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
on the other phone the best thing to do

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.150 
on the other phone the best thing to do
is<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.750> press<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:15.989> nun<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.320> be<00:04:16.410> for<00:04:16.620> both<00:04:16.769> firms

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
is to press a nun to be for both firms

to price at 90 P this is an example of

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.330 
to price at 90 P this is an example of
the<00:04:20.940> prisoner's<00:04:21.449> dilemma<00:04:21.770> okay<00:04:22.770> we're<00:04:23.310> a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
the prisoner's dilemma okay we're a

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.460 
the prisoner's dilemma okay we're a
dominant<00:04:24.060> strategy<00:04:24.240> occurs<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:25.050> both<00:04:25.199> phones

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
dominant strategy occurs of both phones

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.590 
dominant strategy occurs of both phones
the<00:04:25.889> most<00:04:26.070> classic<00:04:26.550> case<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.790> game<00:04:27.120> theory<00:04:27.449> and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
the most classic case of game theory and

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.900 
the most classic case of game theory and
in<00:04:27.780> oligopoly<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.979> tends<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.400> be<00:04:29.580> quite<00:04:29.880> a

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
in oligopoly this tends to be quite a

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.689 
in oligopoly this tends to be quite a
common<00:04:30.419> scenario<00:04:31.310> all<00:04:32.310> right

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
common scenario all right

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.300 
common scenario all right
so<00:04:33.180> how<00:04:34.050> can<00:04:34.110> we<00:04:34.290> actually<00:04:34.440> use<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:35.040> for<00:04:35.250> the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
so how can we actually use this for the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.280 
so how can we actually use this for the
senton<00:04:35.639> theory<00:04:36.030> well<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.510> helps<00:04:36.840> us<00:04:36.930> explain

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
senton theory well it helps us explain

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.770 
senton theory well it helps us explain
price<00:04:37.560> rigidity<00:04:38.070> again<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:39.000> helps<00:04:39.180> us<00:04:39.360> explain

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
price rigidity again it helps us explain

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.439 
price rigidity again it helps us explain
why<00:04:40.080> firms<00:04:40.530> tend<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.949> settle<00:04:41.280> on<00:04:41.340> one<00:04:41.490> price<00:04:41.729> it

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
why firms tend to settle on one price it

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.240 
why firms tend to settle on one price it
doesn't<00:04:42.780> make<00:04:42.870> any<00:04:43.020> logical<00:04:43.110> sense<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.740> change

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
doesn't make any logical sense to change

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.310 
doesn't make any logical sense to change
really<00:04:45.030> there's<00:04:45.510> no<00:04:45.630> point<00:04:45.810> increase<00:04:46.139> in<00:04:46.229> the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
really there's no point increase in the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.500 
really there's no point increase in the
price<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.530> is<00:04:46.800> going<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:46.979> lose<00:04:47.160> out<00:04:47.340> okay<00:04:48.270> think

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
price of is going to lose out okay think

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.659 
price of is going to lose out okay think
about<00:04:48.570> if<00:04:48.870> firm<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.229> decided<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.830> instead<00:04:50.160> price

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
about if firm a decided to instead price

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.460 
about if firm a decided to instead price
of<00:04:50.850> one<00:04:51.030> pound<00:04:51.240> regardless<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.169> what<00:04:52.289> phone

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
of one pound regardless of what phone

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.800 
of one pound regardless of what phone
views<00:04:52.740> do<00:04:52.949> well<00:04:53.699> firm<00:04:54.300> Billy<00:04:54.539> would<00:04:54.690> then

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
views do well firm Billy would then

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.320 
views do well firm Billy would then
choose<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.320> price<00:04:55.560> at<00:04:55.830> 90<00:04:56.190> P<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:56.940> then<00:04:57.090> firm

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
choose the price at 90 P so then firm

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.460 
choose the price at 90 P so then firm
they<00:04:57.449> would<00:04:57.600> lose<00:04:57.750> out<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.199> they<00:04:58.289> want

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
they would lose out and they want

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.230 
they would lose out and they want
million<00:04:58.740> pounds<00:04:59.070> as<00:04:59.160> opposed<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.490> 1.5<00:05:00.030> billion

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
million pounds as opposed to 1.5 billion

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.120 
million pounds as opposed to 1.5 billion
pounds<00:05:00.600> okay<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:01.470> it<00:05:01.620> makes<00:05:01.770> sense<00:05:01.860> the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
pounds okay so it makes sense the

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.510 
pounds okay so it makes sense the
statement<00:05:02.669> if<00:05:02.820> hit<00:05:02.940> not<00:05:03.150> change<00:05:03.740> but<00:05:04.740> look<00:05:05.400> at

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
statement if hit not change but look at

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.480 
statement if hit not change but look at
things<00:05:05.699> very<00:05:05.789> carefully<00:05:06.560> both<00:05:07.560> firms<00:05:08.160> and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
things very carefully both firms and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.279 
things very carefully both firms and
their<00:05:08.729> pricing<00:05:09.120> ninety<00:05:09.449> PM<00:05:09.690> make<00:05:09.870> one<00:05:10.050> point

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
their pricing ninety PM make one point

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.350 
their pricing ninety PM make one point
five<00:05:10.470> million<00:05:10.680> profits<00:05:11.070> each<00:05:11.190> great<00:05:11.580> but<00:05:12.300> you

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
five million profits each great but you

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.960 
five million profits each great but you
can<00:05:12.539> see<00:05:12.750> here<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.650> efficient<00:05:14.190> outcome<00:05:14.430> is

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
can see here the efficient outcome is

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.960 
can see here the efficient outcome is
actually<00:05:15.630> at<00:05:16.500> one<00:05:16.770> pound<00:05:17.039> each<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.490> both<00:05:17.669> terms

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
actually at one pound each of both terms

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:18.950 
actually at one pound each of both terms
of<00:05:18.120> charge<00:05:18.330> one<00:05:18.510> pound

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
of charge one pound

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.540 
of charge one pound
they<00:05:19.229> were<00:05:19.289> both<00:05:19.530> made<00:05:19.830> two<00:05:20.070> million<00:05:20.400> pounds

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
they were both made two million pounds

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.580 
they were both made two million pounds
if<00:05:20.729> they<00:05:20.849> did<00:05:21.000> that<00:05:21.360> that's<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.169> efficient

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
if they did that that's the efficient

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.650 
if they did that that's the efficient
equilibrium<00:05:22.710> that's<00:05:23.700> what<00:05:23.940> we<00:05:24.060> call<00:05:24.270> Pareto

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
equilibrium that's what we call Pareto

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.379 
equilibrium that's what we call Pareto
efficient<00:05:25.260> yet<00:05:26.039> that's<00:05:26.520> where<00:05:26.849> the<00:05:26.970> long-run

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
efficient yet that's where the long-run

efficient yet that's where the long-run
equilibrium<00:05:27.450> is<00:05:27.990> mm-hmm<00:05:28.950> so<00:05:29.370> what<00:05:30.210> we<00:05:30.360> can

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
equilibrium is mm-hmm so what we can

equilibrium is mm-hmm so what we can
also<00:05:30.630> conclude<00:05:30.960> is<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.410> in<00:05:31.740> illegally<00:05:32.340> there

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
also conclude is that in illegally there

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.730 
also conclude is that in illegally there
is<00:05:32.639> a<00:05:32.669> massive<00:05:33.120> incentive<00:05:33.870> for<00:05:34.289> firms<00:05:34.560> to

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
is a massive incentive for firms to

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.710 
is a massive incentive for firms to
collude<00:05:35.160> together<00:05:35.580> there<00:05:36.150> are<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.300> few<00:05:36.479> third

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
collude together there are a few third

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.210 
collude together there are a few third
dominating<00:05:37.380> now<00:05:37.500> if<00:05:37.590> those<00:05:37.770> films<00:05:38.070> got

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
dominating now if those films got

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.400 
dominating now if those films got
together<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.880> colluded<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:39.930> set<00:05:40.139> a<00:05:40.169> price

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
together and colluded and set a price

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.760 
together and colluded and set a price
look<00:05:41.160> at<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.430> amazing<00:05:41.639> profits<00:05:42.240> they<00:05:42.360> call<00:05:42.630> me

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
look at the amazing profits they call me

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.170 
look at the amazing profits they call me
so<00:05:43.770> that's<00:05:44.010> something<00:05:44.310> else<00:05:44.520> we<00:05:44.639> could<00:05:44.940> see

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
so that's something else we could see

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.510 
so that's something else we could see

another<00:06:20.870> thing<00:06:21.110> we<00:06:21.230> tend<00:06:21.410> to<00:06:21.470> see<00:06:21.740> is<00:06:21.950> what<00:06:22.820> we

another thing we tend to see is what we

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.880 
another thing we tend to see is what we
call<00:06:23.060> tacit<00:06:23.540> collusion<00:06:23.750> so<00:06:24.230> informal

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
call tacit collusion so informal

the real world is through price

the real world is through price
leadership<00:06:28.310> so<00:06:29.090> if<00:06:29.210> there<00:06:29.360> are<00:06:29.480> a<00:06:29.510> few<00:06:29.750> themes

might be
it<00:06:39.140> more<00:06:39.500> then<00:06:39.680> kind<00:06:39.920> of<00:06:39.980> set<00:06:40.310> prices<00:06:40.790> so<00:06:41.690> it

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200 
it more then kind of set prices so it

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.140 
it more then kind of set prices so it
has<00:06:42.440> leadership<00:06:42.770> over<00:06:43.190> the<00:06:43.310> price<00:06:43.550> is<00:06:43.730> set<00:06:43.910> and

has leadership over the price is set and

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.430 
has leadership over the price is set and
other<00:06:44.330> firms<00:06:44.570> just<00:06:44.840> have<00:06:44.960> to<00:06:45.050> try<00:06:45.200> and<00:06:45.290> follow

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
other firms just have to try and follow

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.430 
other firms just have to try and follow
so<00:06:46.190> often<00:06:46.550> the<00:06:46.610> price<00:06:46.820> leader<00:06:47.360> or<00:06:48.110> kind<00:06:48.380> of

so often the price leader or kind of

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.620 
so often the price leader or kind of
reduced<00:06:48.770> prices<00:06:49.220> here<00:06:49.910> and<00:06:50.060> then<00:06:50.180> try<00:06:50.480> and

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
reduced prices here and then try and

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.540 
reduced prices here and then try and
gain<00:06:50.840> their<00:06:51.110> market<00:06:51.590> share<00:06:51.800> by<00:06:51.980> doing<00:06:52.280> so

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
gain their market share by doing so

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.330 
gain their market share by doing so
leading<00:06:53.420> the<00:06:54.080> actual<00:06:54.440> prices<00:06:54.920> being<00:06:55.100> said

other firms how to try and follow you

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.630 
other firms how to try and follow you
see<00:06:57.530> that<00:06:57.710> quite<00:06:57.920> a<00:06:57.980> lot<00:06:58.190> actually<00:06:58.340> at

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
see that quite a lot actually at

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.920 
see that quite a lot actually at
oligopoly<00:06:59.150> and<00:06:59.620> tacit<00:07:00.620> collusion<00:07:01.630> the<00:07:02.630> reason

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
oligopoly and tacit collusion the reason

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.450 
oligopoly and tacit collusion the reason
that<00:07:03.020> works<00:07:03.260> is<00:07:03.560> because<00:07:03.770> there<00:07:04.100> might<00:07:04.220> be<00:07:04.280> an

that works is because there might be an
