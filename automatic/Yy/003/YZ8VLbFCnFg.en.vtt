there with the head you guys have little
wheels<00:02:17.770> down<00:02:18.099> here<00:02:19.349> roll<00:02:20.349> okay<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:22.120> his<00:02:22.300> body

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
wheels down here roll okay on his body

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.940 
wheels down here roll okay on his body
you<00:02:22.690> saw<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.989> said<00:02:23.170> ground<00:02:23.440> speed<00:02:23.739> so

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
you saw it said ground speed so

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.530 
you saw it said ground speed so
apparently<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.370> guy<00:02:24.550> can<00:02:24.760> drive<00:02:24.970> around<00:02:25.150> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
apparently this guy can drive around a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.199 
apparently this guy can drive around a
little<00:02:25.690> bit<00:02:25.870> if<00:02:26.110> you'd<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.380> to

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
little bit if you'd like to

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.760 
little bit if you'd like to
transformation<00:02:28.209> very<00:02:28.810> simple<00:02:29.280> although<00:02:31.770> it's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
transformation very simple although it's

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.280 
transformation very simple although it's
kind<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:34.630> have<00:02:34.750> doing<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.050> certain

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
kind of you can I have doing a certain

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.910 
kind of you can I have doing a certain
order<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.560> my<00:02:35.680> opinion<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:37.560> kind<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.620> grab<00:02:38.769> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
order in my opinion I kind of grab the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.430 
order in my opinion I kind of grab the
head<00:02:39.100> because<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.910> head<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.540> tightly<00:02:41.080> tied

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
head because the head is so tightly tied

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.710 
head because the head is so tightly tied
to<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.709> shoulders<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.390> spin<00:02:43.630> it

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
to the shoulders that if you spin it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.330 
to the shoulders that if you spin it
later<00:02:43.900> his<00:02:44.140> arms<00:02:44.410> went<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.650> spring<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.310> I

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
later his arms went to spring to so I

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.550 
later his arms went to spring to so I
always<00:02:45.700> spin<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.030> head<00:02:46.150> around<00:02:46.330> now<00:02:46.600> before<00:02:47.530> I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
always spin the head around now before I

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.350 
always spin the head around now before I
do<00:02:47.650> anything<00:02:47.709> else<00:02:48.130> I'll<00:02:48.370> show<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.700> wanted<00:02:49.000> in

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.660 
do anything else I'll show you wanted in
the<00:02:49.600> moment<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.080> p.m.<00:02:50.920> these<00:02:51.040> guys<00:02:51.280> are<00:02:51.459> so

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
the moment in p.m. these guys are so

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.020 
the moment in p.m. these guys are so
tight<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:51.970> cannot<00:02:52.330> believe<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:53.790> he's<00:02:54.790> feel<00:02:54.940> like

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
tight I cannot believe it he's feel like

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.820 
tight I cannot believe it he's feel like
I'm<00:02:55.120> gonna<00:02:55.209> break<00:02:55.420> him<00:02:55.569> spin<00:02:56.440> his<00:02:56.530> head<00:02:56.650> around

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
I'm gonna break him spin his head around

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.160 
I'm gonna break him spin his head around
that<00:02:57.519> hole<00:02:57.670> portion<00:02:57.940> flips<00:02:58.239> around<00:02:58.330> then<00:02:59.140> I

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
that hole portion flips around then I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.559 
that hole portion flips around then I
extend<00:02:59.709> his<00:02:59.890> waist<00:03:00.519> which<00:03:00.819> unlocks<00:03:01.150> his<00:03:01.269> hands

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
extend his waist which unlocks his hands

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.750 
extend his waist which unlocks his hands
and<00:03:02.049> again<00:03:02.319> if<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.590> had<00:03:02.799> not<00:03:03.010> flip<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.580> over

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
and again if I had not flip this over

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.900 
and again if I had not flip this over
when<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.150> flipped<00:03:04.390> at<00:03:04.510> his<00:03:04.630> hands<00:03:04.870> would<00:03:05.019> move

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
when I flipped at his hands would move

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.570 
when I flipped at his hands would move
with<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.239> head<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.110> kind<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.380> do<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.709> and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
with the head so I kind of do that and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.650 
with the head so I kind of do that and
then<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.790> kind<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.030> have<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.180> turn<00:03:10.510> these

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
then you kind of have to turn these

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.770 
then you kind of have to turn these
afterwards<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:12.670> rotate<00:03:13.000> them<00:03:13.330> back<00:03:13.510> and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
afterwards just rotate them back and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.210 
afterwards just rotate them back and
they<00:03:14.340> meet<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.519> back<00:03:15.700> like<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:17.950> raw

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
they meet in the back like so so in raw

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.710 
they meet in the back like so so in raw
mode<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.700> only<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.940> belize<00:03:19.120> guys<00:03:19.269> these<00:03:19.480> wings

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
mode the only to belize guys these wings

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.289 
mode the only to belize guys these wings
hanging<00:03:20.019> off<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.230> back<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.410> them<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:22.120> and

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
hanging off the back of them here and

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.330 
hanging off the back of them here and
then<00:03:23.290> if<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.500> want<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.769> leave<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:23.980> guns<00:03:24.190> in

about so you move his hand up you can

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.610 
about so you move his hand up you can
hold<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:40.600> one<00:03:40.750> regular<00:03:41.049> he<00:03:41.140> actually<00:03:41.350> has

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
hold this one regular he actually has

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.849 
hold this one regular he actually has
true<00:03:42.190> fists<00:03:42.640> with<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.209> peg<00:03:43.420> holes<00:03:43.450> on<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.810> top
