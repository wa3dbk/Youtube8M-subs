00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
time I blow dried my hair first and then

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.509 
time I blow dried my hair first and then

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
tooth comb through each section before I

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:52.450 
tooth comb through each section before I
start<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.600> blow<00:01:44.780> dryer

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.130 

so<00:01:53.030> now<00:01:53.150> I'm<00:01:53.270> finishing<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.690> blow-dry<00:01:54.110> my

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
so now I'm finishing that blow-dry my

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.410 
so now I'm finishing that blow-dry my
hair<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:55.160> has<00:01:55.340> enough<00:01:55.580> oil<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.120> it's<00:01:56.240> not

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
hair and it has enough oil and it's not

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.840 
hair and it has enough oil and it's not
overly<00:01:56.810> saturated<00:01:57.250> but<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.340> has<00:01:58.520> plenty<00:01:58.700> of

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
overly saturated but it has plenty of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.490 
overly saturated but it has plenty of
moisture<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.510> I<00:01:59.810> went<00:01:59.990> ahead<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.290> just<00:02:00.410> put

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
moisture and I went ahead and just put

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.380 
moisture and I went ahead and just put
it<00:02:00.800> in<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.980> big<00:02:01.250> thick<00:02:01.520> braid<00:02:01.820> because<00:02:02.030> I'm<00:02:02.270> not

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
it in a big thick braid because I'm not

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.170 
it in a big thick braid because I'm not
able<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.950> start<00:02:03.950> twisting<00:02:04.610> my<00:02:04.700> hair<00:02:04.730> right<00:02:05.030> now

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
able to start twisting my hair right now

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.640 
able to start twisting my hair right now
cuz<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.450> had<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.630> go<00:02:05.720> check<00:02:05.900> on<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.110> kids<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:06.620> I

cuz I had to go check on the kids so I

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.800 
cuz I had to go check on the kids so I
didn't<00:02:07.100> want<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.370> to<00:02:07.550> get<00:02:08.060> too<00:02:08.240> poofy<00:02:08.630> or

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
didn't want it to get too poofy or

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.500 
didn't want it to get too poofy or
frizzy<00:02:09.350> but<00:02:09.950> but<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.550> is<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.729> later<00:02:11.030> time<00:02:11.240> now

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
frizzy but but this is a later time now

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.330

I'm<00:02:11.600> coming<00:02:11.900> back<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.290> I'm<00:02:12.590> gonna<00:02:12.740> untie<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
I'm coming back and I'm gonna untie the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.970 
I'm coming back and I'm gonna untie the
braid<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.910> start<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.480> twist<00:02:15.200> each<00:02:15.410> section<00:02:15.920> of

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
braid and start to twist each section of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.390 
braid and start to twist each section of
my<00:02:16.100> hair

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.940 

I'm<00:02:19.390> gonna<00:02:19.599> be<00:02:19.750> using<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.170> motion<00:02:20.560> sculpt

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
I'm gonna be using this motion sculpt

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.559 
I'm gonna be using this motion sculpt
and<00:02:21.069> twist<00:02:21.340> molding<00:02:21.819> cream<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.269> my<00:02:22.329> first

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
and twist molding cream this is my first

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.330 
and twist molding cream this is my first
time<00:02:22.750> ever<00:02:22.959> using<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.890> would<00:02:24.250> have

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
time ever using this I would have

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.030 
time ever using this I would have
preferred<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.849> use<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.120> curly<00:02:25.900> meringue<00:02:26.260> but

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
preferred to use the curly meringue but

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.069 
preferred to use the curly meringue but
I<00:02:27.370> don't<00:02:27.549> have<00:02:27.730> any<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.420> consistency<00:02:28.930> of

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
I don't have any and the consistency of

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.289 
I don't have any and the consistency of
this<00:02:29.349> is<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.920> kind<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.700> similar<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
this is it's kind of similar to the

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.569 
this is it's kind of similar to the
curly<00:02:31.510> meringue<00:02:31.810> it's<00:02:32.110> really<00:02:32.470> thick<00:02:33.310> and

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
curly meringue it's really thick and

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.640 
curly meringue it's really thick and
sticky<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.049> figured<00:02:35.379> this<00:02:35.439> would<00:02:35.590> be

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
sticky so I figured this would be

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.009 
sticky so I figured this would be
something<00:02:36.099> good<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.310> try<00:02:36.670> I've<00:02:37.629> never<00:02:37.810> used

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
something good to try I've never used

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.080 
something good to try I've never used
this<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.290> my<00:02:38.319> hair<00:02:38.560> before<00:02:38.769> but<00:02:39.609> this<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.970> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
this on my hair before but this is the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.059 
this on my hair before but this is the
closest<00:02:40.480> thing<00:02:40.659> that<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.900> had<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.829> thought

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
closest thing that I had that I thought

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.280 
closest thing that I had that I thought
would<00:02:42.220> work<00:02:42.489> on<00:02:42.879> this<00:02:43.000> style<00:02:43.359> so<00:02:44.019> I'm<00:02:44.109> just

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
would work on this style so I'm just

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.660 
would work on this style so I'm just
going<00:02:44.409> to<00:02:44.439> add<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> little<00:02:44.890> bit<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.189> the<00:02:45.280> section

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
going to add a little bit to the section

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.940 
going to add a little bit to the section
comb<00:02:45.939> it<00:02:46.060> through<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.629> I'm<00:02:47.170> putting<00:02:47.439> out<00:02:47.890> of

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
comb it through and I'm putting out of

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.000 
comb it through and I'm putting out of
all<00:02:48.400> eco<00:02:49.150> styler<00:02:49.450> gel<00:02:49.569> around<00:02:50.109> my<00:02:50.200> edges<00:02:50.680> to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
all eco styler gel around my edges to

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.039 
all eco styler gel around my edges to
just<00:02:51.609> lay<00:02:51.730> my<00:02:51.760> edges<00:02:52.150> down<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.329> little<00:02:52.599> bit<00:02:52.750> and

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
just lay my edges down a little bit and

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.800 
just lay my edges down a little bit and
I'm<00:02:53.859> twisting<00:02:54.400> each<00:02:54.609> section<00:02:55.090> first<00:02:55.329> before<00:02:55.569> I

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
I'm twisting each section first before I

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:06.570 
I'm twisting each section first before I
start<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.319> bantu<00:02:56.709> knots

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.790 

so<00:03:07.540> I'm<00:03:07.660> finished<00:03:07.960> with<00:03:08.020> this<00:03:08.260> two<00:03:08.470> strand

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
so I'm finished with this two strand

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.950 
so I'm finished with this two strand
twist<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.460> I'm<00:03:09.880> gonna<00:03:10.060> start<00:03:10.300> my<00:03:10.420> bantu<00:03:10.630> knot

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
twist and I'm gonna start my bantu knot

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.170 
twist and I'm gonna start my bantu knot
and<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.290> started<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.770> going<00:03:12.100> in<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.490> opposite

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
and I started it going in the opposite

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.690 
and I started it going in the opposite
direction<00:03:13.710> from<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:15.070> direction<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.640> I

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
direction from the direction that I

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.130 
direction from the direction that I
twisted<00:03:16.180> my<00:03:16.240> hair<00:03:16.600> and<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.750> two<00:03:16.870> strand

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
twisted my hair and the two strand

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.770 
twisted my hair and the two strand
twists<00:03:17.380> I'm<00:03:17.560> not<00:03:17.740> exactly<00:03:18.160> sure<00:03:18.550> why<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.180> did<00:03:19.720> it

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
twists I'm not exactly sure why I did it

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.000 
twists I'm not exactly sure why I did it
this<00:03:19.870> way<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.080> don't<00:03:20.230> really<00:03:20.500> have<00:03:20.740> my

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
this way I don't really have my

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.060 
this way I don't really have my
technique<00:03:21.400> down<00:03:21.610> or<00:03:21.970> anything<00:03:22.500> also<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.530> did

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
technique down or anything also I did

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.600 
technique down or anything also I did
not<00:03:24.100> use<00:03:25.030> any<00:03:25.240> rubber<00:03:25.570> bands<00:03:25.840> or<00:03:26.170> bands<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:27.010> did

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
not use any rubber bands or bands I did

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.370 
not use any rubber bands or bands I did
in<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.910> back<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.510> couple<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.840> sections<00:03:29.230> but

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
in the back a couple of sections but

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.380 
in the back a couple of sections but
then<00:03:29.500> once<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.770> got<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.010> hang<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.460> I<00:03:30.640> just

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
then once I got the hang of it I just

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.840

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
use about half that and see what kind of

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.850 
use about half that and see what kind of
results<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.419> get<00:05:10.479> so<00:05:11.080> it's<00:05:11.199> time<00:05:11.380> for<00:05:11.530> bed<00:05:11.680> now

thing<00:05:25.059> I<00:05:25.149> like<00:05:25.300> about<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:25.659> style<00:05:25.960> is<00:05:26.169> that<00:05:26.229> I

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
thing I like about this style is that I

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.600 
thing I like about this style is that I
don't<00:05:26.529> have<00:05:26.679> to<00:05:26.770> worry<00:05:27.009> about<00:05:27.159> it<00:05:27.369> being<00:05:27.490> dry

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
don't have to worry about it being dry

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.760 
don't have to worry about it being dry
and<00:05:28.240> worry<00:05:28.809> about<00:05:28.869> how<00:05:29.080> much<00:05:29.229> time<00:05:29.439> it<00:05:29.499> takes

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
and worry about how much time it takes

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.230 
and worry about how much time it takes
for<00:05:29.889> my<00:05:29.979> hair<00:05:30.129> to<00:05:30.219> dry<00:05:30.249> because<00:05:30.580> my<00:05:30.819> hair<00:05:31.029> was

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
for my hair to dry because my hair was

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.510 
for my hair to dry because my hair was
already<00:05:31.449> dry<00:05:31.869> when<00:05:32.529> I<00:05:32.559> started<00:05:33.039> the<00:05:33.159> bantu

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
already dry when I started the bantu

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.919

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
with each section trying to make sure

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.879 
with each section trying to make sure
that<00:05:39.279> I<00:05:39.339> don't<00:05:39.599> pick<00:05:40.599> it<00:05:40.629> apart<00:05:40.779> too<00:05:41.199> much<00:05:41.439> and

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
that I don't pick it apart too much and

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.489 
that I don't pick it apart too much and
don't<00:05:42.610> want<00:05:42.789> it<00:05:42.849> to<00:05:42.939> get<00:05:43.089> too<00:05:43.539> poofy<00:05:44.020> or<00:05:44.229> too
