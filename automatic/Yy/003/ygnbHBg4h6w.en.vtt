battlefield<00:02:18.480> 4<00:02:18.900> really<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:19.890> looks<00:02:20.130> like

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
battlefield 4 really just looks like

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.980 
battlefield 4 really just looks like
they<00:02:20.520> made<00:02:20.700> some<00:02:20.910> small<00:02:21.209> improvements<00:02:21.870> on

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
they made some small improvements on

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.070 
they made some small improvements on
battlefield<00:02:22.530> 3<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.069> honestly<00:02:24.000> for<00:02:24.360> me<00:02:24.420> that's

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
battlefield 3 and honestly for me that's

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.710 
battlefield 3 and honestly for me that's
fine<00:02:26.030> obviously<00:02:27.030> there's<00:02:27.240> not<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> lot<00:02:27.690> of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
fine obviously there's not a lot of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.630 
fine obviously there's not a lot of
footage<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.350> judge<00:02:28.590> from<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.280> might<00:02:29.610> be

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
footage to judge from and I might be

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.970 
footage to judge from and I might be
reading<00:02:30.060> too<00:02:30.360> much<00:02:30.540> into<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.930> trailer<00:02:31.200> but

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
reading too much into the trailer but

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.400 
reading too much into the trailer but
whether<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.730> better<00:02:33.000> version<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.570> bf3<00:02:33.900> or

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
whether it's a better version of bf3 or

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.410 
whether it's a better version of bf3 or
something<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.890> bit<00:02:35.010> different<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:36.120> what<00:02:36.390> I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
something a bit different I like what I

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.010
