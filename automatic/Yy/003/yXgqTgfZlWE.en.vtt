 related to the visibility of the data 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.119

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.919
 secondary button of the mouse 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.919

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.340
 I do not know how the work of modifying every aspect of the system 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.540
 visual 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.540
 irene based on the idea of ​​previous versions as ing 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.120
 in the desk section 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.380
 and where we can find a possibility to select the design 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.860
 From the bottom 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.530
 and access to the personalization of system icons that were shown or not 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.610
 on the desk 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.890
 these are on my pc my documents my network sites 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.500
 internet explorer 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.780
 and the recycling bin 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.780

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.410
 images 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.820
 there was another graphic representation that will be activated when the pc is not used 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.790
 in a given time 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.350
 this function not only presents us with effects to brighten the eyes but also 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.769
 fulfills the function of real protection in monitors 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.739
 2 the most serious thing about monitors that is not their color is very quickly without the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.739
 image is permanently exposed in batches 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.549
 and the passage of time some images and colors that have 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.779
 annoying way they have recorded some blankets 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:28.299
 in this way the protective drawing and changing images and colors 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.660
 which prevent the same color from being represented for a long time in a 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.179
 same site of the plants 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:35.459
 and in that way 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.459
 the life of the monitor is extended 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.759
 in appearance 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.639

 color styles and some other things

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.549
 the resolution and visual size of our desktop and 12 elements that 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.759
 make up 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.759
 the quantity and quality of the colors 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.750
