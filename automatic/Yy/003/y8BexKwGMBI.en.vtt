00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
in the light reflection there which I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
high quality case and on the inside

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.100 
high quality case and on the inside
we've<00:02:11.790> got<00:02:11.819> some<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.209> leather<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:12.959> as
