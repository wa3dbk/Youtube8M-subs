00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 gavorrano 2 bastia 1 this the verdict 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.370
 of the second day of the championship that 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.230
 sees the Maremma team passing here 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.360
 to the municipal of bastia after having led 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.280
 a first time over the lines really 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.379
 a nice team and suffered instead 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.770
 especially in the final part of the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.510
 second time the public was expected 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.699
 great opportunities for this 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.980
 debut of the bastia which has been lacking 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 on the eve of the 52nd edition of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.619
 palio di san michele 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 this is a very worrying sign 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.630
 for the management also because 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.940
 today's opponent was the gavorrano 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.950
 ambitious company that aims to return 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.010
 in league pro and who in the team had 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.780
 flavio mattia and giacomo silversea two ex 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.460
 and still loved by the people here 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.350
 white and red of bastia 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.360
 second minute immediately dangerous 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.969
 guests but the conclusion placed by 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.340
 zizzari ends out like outside too 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.190
 the viviano shooting to the stars after a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.500
 support of riccardi tries lombardi 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.359
 then out of money to evil with 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.460
 small but effective 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.530
 I drive to dictate the maneuver are the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.600
 guests to have more initiatives but the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.909
 bastiano remained passive to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 fifteenth, however, the gavorrano passes into 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.439
 advantage with the former and flavio mattia that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.630
 from a few steps puts goes into the door of 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.610
 test an assist always ahead of the head 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.500
 own companion of the zizzari department 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.259
 despite the advantage to the guests 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.080
 have continued to grind having game 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.930
 always holding the reins of the maneuver 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.939
 to the 31st still gavorrano close to 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.770
 doubling with zizzari that served from 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.020
 head tarantino sends high 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.030
 the porter is good at the thirty-fifth 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.890
 of the bastia bracalenti to stretch for 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.880
 send a strong low shot to the corner 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.140
 reuse at the thirty-ninth wild 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.420
 literally and tarantino that from bottom 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.729
 field serves the well lombarded but 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.520
 his shot is lost very high closes 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.020
 so the first time with the gavorrano 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.350
 legitimately in advantage decides up 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.750
 now the ex and flavio mattia and now with 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.670
 the filming of massimiliano costs we go 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.040
 to see the second time he sees 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.259
 immediately the gavorrano leave strong and 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.270
 skim the doubling but Lombard 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.759
 it hits badly on the opposite tip 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.520
 is riccardi with a strong diagonal of 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.790
 severely engage a con goalkeeper 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.969
 that we will hear about 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.829
 the class 96 that is saved by foot 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.989
 at the fifth minute insistent action of 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.060
 beautiful but first dark-headed not 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.030
 find the door then bornioli instead 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.819
 his conclusion was rebutted 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.430
 eighth minute inside pagni per moretti 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.349
 in the bastia that did not change anything in the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.599
 deployment changed a lot instead 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.370
 in substance to the fifteenth 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.069
 the technician away from the bench 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.959
 Lombard bastiolo with the referee who was 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.909
 gone into confusion having extracted 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.220
 first the red card for the 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.989
 player moretti already replaced then 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.150
 however the assistant de gennaro 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.459
 made him change his mind and so it is 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.829
 lombardi to move away from the field to 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.290
 seventeenth pure action needed 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.720
 the new entered bathrooms abb is saved with 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.599
 the feet again this time then one 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.909
 restart of the tarantino gavorrano solo 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.439
 in front of bracalenti he sends high 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.810
 in wet at twenty-first for 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.819
 marchetti then scozzafava for tarantino 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.799
 penalty kick for the gavorrano al 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.680
 twenty-fifth assigned by the director 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.400
 tender for a foul hand arms in 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.919
 barrier of beautiful lime that kicked 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.079
 zizzari and the double what made in 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.900
 holy forum we had already transcribed 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.129
 beautiful in the list of the ammonites 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.930
 obviously we were wrong or yes 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.079
 the referee who won't admit is wrong 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.129
 never otherwise the red would have sprung 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.530
 for beautiful 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.690
 to the 36th insisted action always of 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.479
 pure split lifeguards halve it 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.430
 disadvantage the bastia galvanizes and al 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:45.519
 forty-seventh there is a header 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.500
 close up of pagni abb bara 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.299
 thus ends with the second victory of the 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.519
 they gavorano while for the bastia another 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.280
 stop that must make everyone think 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.049
 the setting of the cavour put the mark 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.639
 first time drawers as a real team 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.470
 line in the second half you suffered 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:05.019
 a little too much the cause but the cause starts 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.379
 there is also the opponent and then clearly 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.280
 those three in front did not make the 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.010
 work 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.840
 in the first half how much in how much they were 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.870
 only very stressed by 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.280
 midfielders were able to return to 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.070
 restart 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.590
 then they started to drop them is 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:29.320
 took over a little more than this 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.280
 tension we suffered until the end 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.130
 we just need that right 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.010
 suffer though if we want to get in 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.020
 high floors we need to improve 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.760
 especially from the point of view also 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.060
 of ball management certain point 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.320
 it was played more piero lombardi 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.630
 difficult to comment on the second stop 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.979
 consecutive we understand, however, what is the 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.630
 true meals at the first time 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.350
 or that of the second part of the 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.699
 second time but according to me bases it is 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.150
 that of the first half and that of the 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.919
 second 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.360
 of course we played against one 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.650
 team that we know is one of the 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.610
 candidates try to win the 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.830
 championship and we have also seen how it is 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.949
 goals and our reaction are taken and 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.139
 then unfortunately I always repeat that we know 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.810
 how it ends but no one knows how 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.520
 they start as it ends you never know 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.810
 we made a very big one 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.770
 performance of the second half but I repeat 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.990
 with a team that has a mentality is 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.840
 a concept of soccer is a quadrature 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.449
 to try to aspire to primacy 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.800
 we know we have to try 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:35.630
 it is very hard to save ourselves but I am confident 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.520
 I'm sorry we didn't get it 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.050
 not even one point so far but if we go to 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.550
 watch the two games of St. John is 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.550
 this I think they saw her a little 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.780
 I don't know what I have to complain about 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.889
 clear that first time we were a little 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.250
 most loved c under the door 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.729
 but I repeat a team that has three 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.979
 such strikers also struggle 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.650
 stay there and don't let them kick in the goal 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.820
 we were good ni first time then 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.110
 there is a time we had with us 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.110
 an important reaction
