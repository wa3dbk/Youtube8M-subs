 freedom beats here like a key 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.219
 but who needs this separation if all 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.179
 sharpened by joint gaming 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.549

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.560
 the upgrade system is independently akin to it and 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.930

 role-playing classic offers a lot 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.830
 direction for development not only by

 social or criminal skills 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.410
 traditionally for a series of development 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.690
 limited to only five maximum 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.910

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.490
 equipment abilities 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.710
 go beyond the permissible master 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.240
 seventh level accounts for example can 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.300

 who killed a few glorious guys 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.490
 any choice is fraught with changes in 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.190
 biographies and for each character 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.440
 against the host of modern games 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.260
 Original Syn really offers 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.770
 the choice they mock the player of his sham 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.770
 versions 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.270
 the main thing which is scared away 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.010
 more than a dozen representatives 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.440
 the younger generation 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.930
 the slowness of the game and the fact that it is not 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.270
 treats the user as a bag 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.330
 tutorial fight followed by 5 hours 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.370
 conversations in the first city in the end 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.950
 it turns out that it still has 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.290
 unexplored cellars and dungeons 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.660
 no one leads by the pen pointing at 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.370
 compass under which stone 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.010
 hidden necessary detail 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.860
 keep a huge open world and all by yourself 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.780
 everything is good if the author is an errand 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.180
 will say that the treasured cave is located 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.580
 somewhere in the north more often 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.650
 understand that we are all human and forgetful 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.440
 man too can easily be mistaken in 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.350
 indications quest system is better to be 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.080
 already simply can not do any tasks on 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.520
 the manner of a small inscription lost in the forest 10 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.640
 cones go get some 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.620
 instead of this diary we found 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.900
 two countries and caves with pillars 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.900
 player be kindly straining your brains 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.640
 will have to think a lot but for everyone 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.340
 found from the knowledge is already almost 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.430
 forgotten happiness researcher wait 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.680
 the statue said the weight of knowledge and what if 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.860
 movable plate to put the book on 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.110
 sarcophagus caused unknown hieroglyphs 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.230
 where even I came across 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.360
 literature on their decoding tips to 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.230
 current task can be read on 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.420
 leaflet 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.600
 found muddy puddles in some 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.850
 the surviving basement and screw up with ease 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.010
 you can even the main quest throwing out 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.830
 inventory of some nondescript 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.820
 piece of paper storyline in the game are on 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.040
 to their places 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.810
 but things exactly as their properties 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.120
 randomly generated 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.100
 if earlier it was possible to load the game in 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.290
 searching for the desired stat on the sword 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.770
 now spell your fleet when 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.180
 desire and patience can weigh yourself 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.720
 exceptional legendary clothes 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.390
 or make them yourself thank you donor 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.790
 kickstarter'a larin succeeded one of 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.370
 best crafting systems possible in 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.260
 principle by combining things 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.440
 to the bag or with items surrounding 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.350
 Environments can sometimes be made serious 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.230
 items amulets potions weapons all that 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.240
 it’s a pleasure to stick a shoe of shoes and 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.760
 get anti-slip boots 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.880
 instill a tortured soul in arms and 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.190
 give it a bonus to strength and agility 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.580
 there would be a fantasy and it would be applied 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.160
 Where 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.070
 without creativity do not pass and 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.690
 battle local tactical combat system 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.510
 an example to follow 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.390
 elemental interaction buffs warriors magicians 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.030
 receiving control of enemies is all clear 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.380
 but how about in order to burn the boss 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.450
 pushing him into 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.300
 Av or immobilize 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.310
 forcing from all sides to be boxes 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.400
 may be easier and not to engage him in battle 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.580
 bypassing or eventually finding a remedy 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.580
 neutralization 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.870
 old role-playing school gave heat of course 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.420
 the young are mostly here 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.120
 nothing to do but for hardened people 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.510
 classic role-playing games of origin 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.600
 syn 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.300
 it's a wonderful oasis of identity in the dark 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.730
 quagmire of marketing monotony 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.980
 soulful dialogues are memorable 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.710
 characters interesting storylines 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.290
 constantly intertwining with each other 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.300
 excellent crafting system gorgeous 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.090
 tactical combat system freedom 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.760
 narratives but the main variation 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.020
 even the usual ordinary chest here 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.140
 key open 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.390
 the master key by the power of magic blowing it up or 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.940
 transferring to the fire what can we say about 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.700
 many ways to complete tasks 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:46.520
 gunpowder in the old dog Larissa showed that 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.520
 it’s still early to bury the rbg genre
