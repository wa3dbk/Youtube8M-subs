00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.380
 jelle foxes after the european assignment 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.780
 also the cup assignment completed tonight 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.950
 yes it remains true that the three fronts 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.330
 active from 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.980
 that is the intention for the competition 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.820
 be absolutely absolutely dorian the we 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.760
 shall not 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.410
 not easily expected in 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.689
 a debtor standard special atmosphere 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.640
 So then if you knew not easy 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.170
 worms we have overcome obstacles 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 so we can move on to the next one 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.470
 come back two games at so 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.640
 stays nice and busy but that's it 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.870
 most beautiful profession footballer 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.370
 tonsure actually a match with two 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.840
 faces you will be very different again 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.280
 nature dressing room then you do the first 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 half played 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.450
 no ok but i think the same again 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.789
 a good organization already exist and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.260
 that is and remains important for sure 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.610
 in this type of competition 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.469
 yet decided on nine ten minutes 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.800
 in between then it is also sat to took none 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.360
 target 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 so that we have counter goals 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.860
 very well done we came 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.760
 we did not play certain situations 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.379
 good enough 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.030
 but then the whole second half actually 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.739
 two attached between two washing the dishes 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.090
 of a very good level and then we are 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.290
 also efficiency western 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.330
 We have had opportunities 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.979
 finished and take until the second 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.150
 headscarf outside a few 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.930
 distance shot ni want to invest so whole 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.369
 oath 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.780
 yes but of course i20 can not make 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.360
 then the species is completely locked 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.700
 of course no ok that's at that time 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.060
 regrettable but in retrospect no one there 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.770
 nobody riders around yet so we all 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.119
 have the assignment 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.710
 assignment completed and that was the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.090
 most important thing we want and just 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.060
 so good in all competitions 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.740
 perform and yes there they are with 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
 it when it was a bit difficult the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.110
 first half second half we succeed a lot 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.820
 better genk 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.640
 yes first itself was more the tactical saw 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.380
 that they played well organized 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 we created too little for them 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.799
 not too much so it was on that 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.659
 moment not a really nice way but 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.610
 cup soccer goes at 90 minutes 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.140
 it's not so you see the competition that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.100
 you play those three points when you play at home 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.960
 really aware 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.430
 so you could build the matches in the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.530
 second half indeed was a better one 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.780
 match the match also a goal 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.240
 needed good luck we made diaz 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.140
 first good go good cross from steve 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 and and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.370
 finishing jelle yes and then saw 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.930
 you of course some shots from standard 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.119
 and i have to say we do a lot 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.410
 had a better phase playing football 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.120
 so how important today today 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.440
 Thomas Buffalo is for this genk 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.450
 yeah thomas i do n't know where something is coming from 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.220
 but he is very important 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.530
 that we give cooking for a long time in the newspapers 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.030
 and I hope very soon that it 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.310
 contract okay because it 's one 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.930
 boy who also lets other people better 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.630
 and for us 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.010
 in terms of experience and willpower and then 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.840
 are real fights like the ones on it 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.340
 field state is very important 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.080
 thomas buffel first goal that falls 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.730
 from a ball that you intercept 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.750
 actually experience that plays then 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.130
 I think 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.230
 jan de dat but that can also do that 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.730
 hammered also just a switch 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.280
 screen must be that occasionally and 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.540
 photos made at one time I was hoping for one 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.640
 bit to bring something inside 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.560
 and that ball came your me too 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.630
 expected you can quickly find the fast 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.670
 counterattack then a gate mate 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.650
 pinkish deep that keeps the overview 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.180
 and yes then power off good and was one 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.560
 important goal point for us 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.060
 we enough can see the images of the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.380
 penalty kick type was a pure one 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.910
 penalty 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.390
 yes of course a little disappointment 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.760
 that phase because I wanted to play that 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.860
 Assisting never had that himself 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.390
 have more so yes I hope in the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.160
 future that it will make us better 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.049
 is minded if you have a high point in one 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.150
 we basin fruit is just forgotten 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.829
 no yes that is so I think that's it 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.060
 most important thing 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.980
 it was a completely different genk in the second 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.630
 half that we saw why and the first 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.190
 45 minutes 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.870
 yes what is cup football and then you want 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.730
 naturally not open and expose 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.320
 and as in the competition against 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.579
 account can run 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.620
 think well recovered just pace 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.329
 Have looked around us by directing 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.130
 moment it was now first that not 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.720
 easy to find an opening 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.100
 In the second half we have something with us 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.100
 put back to front and their mistake 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.490
 punished and then with some yes 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.790
 delights occasionally matter 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.790
 format
