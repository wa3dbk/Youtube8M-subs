00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
don't have people camping just one type

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
don't have people camping just one type
of<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.579> these<00:00:42.090> ones<00:00:42.270> shown<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
of them these ones shown here are the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.720 
of them these ones shown here are the
static<00:00:43.829> gloves<00:00:44.100> which<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> made<00:00:44.700> ones

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
static gloves which are the made ones

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490 
static gloves which are the made ones
and<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.360> look<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.870> they'd<00:00:46.079> go<00:00:46.230> quite<00:00:46.469> well

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and they look like they'd go quite well

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.529 
and they look like they'd go quite well
with<00:00:46.829> virtus<00:00:47.160> although<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:47.879> inver<00:00:48.149> decided

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
with virtus although I'm inver decided

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.479 
with virtus although I'm inver decided
to<00:00:48.690> UM<00:00:48.780> gloves<00:00:49.020> already<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.860> suppose<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to UM gloves already so I suppose it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.310 
to UM gloves already so I suppose it
isn't<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.420> only<00:00:51.449> thing<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.199> with

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
isn't the only thing that I can go with

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.310 
isn't the only thing that I can go with
and<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.760> last<00:00:53.940> set<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and then this last set here are the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.260 
and then this last set here are the
tracking<00:00:55.739> gloves<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.370> their<00:00:56.489> Ranger<00:00:56.910> ones<00:00:57.120> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
tracking gloves and their Ranger ones of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.490 
tracking gloves and their Ranger ones of
course<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:57.780> really<00:00:57.930> sure<00:00:58.020> what's<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
course I'm not really sure what's that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.319 
course I'm not really sure what's that
they<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.859> they<00:00:59.100> don't<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.520> look<00:01:00.270> like

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
they go they don't really look like

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.009 
they go they don't really look like
pernix<00:01:01.140> color<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.620> all<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.300> maybe<00:01:03.300> future<00:01:03.809> rain

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
pernix color at all so maybe future rain

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
pernix color at all so maybe future rain
gear<00:01:04.320> hopefully<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.309> maybe<00:01:05.549> they're<00:01:05.760> just

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
gear hopefully or maybe they're just

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240 
gear hopefully or maybe they're just
gloves<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.930> their<00:01:07.080> own<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.680> anyway<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.220> terms

armor rating but they also give 7 damage
and<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> set<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.270> the

and if you have to set then you get the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300 
and if you have to set then you get the
side<00:01:36.540> effect<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.710> these<00:01:37.829> new<00:01:38.040> gloves

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
side effect and then these new gloves

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.810 
side effect and then these new gloves
give<00:01:38.520> 194<00:01:39.479> armor<00:01:39.900> rating<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.409> 255<00:01:41.310> live<00:01:41.610> bonus

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
give 194 armor rating and 255 live bonus
and<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.930> they<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.470> definitely<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.009> best

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and so they are definitely the best

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
and so they are definitely the best
