00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.520
 in Colombia we consume 10 million 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.820
 air empanadas and much of these 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.130
 of this ethnic product is manufactured to 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.630
 hand then we start there 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.520
 identify that there was a potential 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.450
 large market that is a product of 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.050
 massive consumption and that it was a product that 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.950
 needed 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.280
 have technology more than anything 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.640
 exists 4 years ago is a dream that had 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.280
 my father and that I followed him who is engaged 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.309
 the manufacture of machinery 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.449
 Latino ethnic foods industry 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:52.330
 how is the empanada as is the patacÃ³n 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:55.390
 as the area as the compulsa all 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.760
 products there for generations 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.460
 they have crafted more than empanadas today 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.979
 manufactures all the machinery so that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.199
 can do on a large scale so that 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.330
 can do efficiently and to 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.250
 that can be marketed 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.860
 the process of creating our 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.500
 company was a very nice process 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.890
 because we had a dream to do 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.560
 technology we look for different sources 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.170
 of support and there was a support source that we 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.390
 opened the doors that is called the bottom 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.160
 start from sena 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.650
 subsequently we needed to do 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.220
 science research processes and 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.860
 technology and it was with colciencias who 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.290
 support of them we managed to develop and 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.120
 tune our machines and 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.700
 then other institutions came 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.590
 as manizales more proexport with the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.260
 process to internationalize mention 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.660
 our and now drives that is us 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.570
 giving great support in the process of 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.070
 improvement and business growth 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.320
 all the machines and our 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.470
 inventions have protection from 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.420
 intellectual property and patents in this 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.130
 moment we have one that is 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.630
 supremely important that is a 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.520
 protection to 180 countries where our 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.210
 fundamental objective is 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.550
 protect our invention for us already 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.710
 We are advancing all processes and 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.650
 thus achieve to introduce with force 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:25.260
 our mack brand machines and empanadas 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.780
 made in color we sell 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.240
 USA is our target market but 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.200
 We also sell in Central America in 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.170
 Ecuador in France we have exported 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.810
 machines for australia and switzerland for 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.410
 Spain' 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.599
 and Canada we have direct competition 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.569
 national we do not have competition 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.700
 but internationally if the 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.870
 Prices of our machines are 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.440
 very much 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.880
 inferior to what can be 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.780
 Argentine and some Mexican machines 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.269
 in 2013 we achieved in a 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.489
 turnover around 200 thousand 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.680
 dollars that is a very 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.140
 significant when we identify from 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.120
 which is a new product that this basis 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.769
 of a technological process and that 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.230
 we beat a lot of 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.120
 obstacles in the technological issue of 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.420
 patents and licenses to be able 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.180
 position our products 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.180
 today that we already generate employment today that 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.459
 we grew up that I want to have a very good 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.310
 company and we want to be a very company 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.940
 recognized at the national level and 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.930
 international that provides solutions in 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.930
 the manufacture of food
