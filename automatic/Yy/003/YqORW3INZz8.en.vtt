00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.219
 It sounds like a mountain yesterday . I introduced Canon YOS 60 seconds yesterday . 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:15.440
 Today, I think let's introduce the lens of this Tamron you are using with it 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:20.119
 Well even though I'm a lens of Tamron we are using the I 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.140
 I will read what is written on this rim for a moment Assle led xr di 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.150
 2 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.740
 Moth 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.920
 af auto focus 18 mm to 200 mm 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.220
 f is 3.5 to 6.3 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:39.790
 Aiefu macro and filter diameter 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:45.489
 62mm Here is 62mm and it is written that a 14 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.760
 First of all because it covers from Kedomo 18 mm to 8 200mm I know this lens 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.170
 Quite 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.650
 It is easy to use 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:58.200
 I feel that I wonder can cover roughly even in this one 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.880
 And it is much cheaper than anything, and if it is late 15,000 yen, it will come out at all 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.910
 It is a lens of cheap 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:08.280
 So I use close proximity too 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:13.740
 Well lens hood is also attached properly will be like this feeling 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.740
 Quite a no you and extend up to a maximum of 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.840
 Lens main body is made in China 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.640
 And the lens hood 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.750
 It is a game against the Philippines I have a switch here, but here auto 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.760
 Switch the focus and manual 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.830
 And here and down to it I'd lock button is attached zoom locks 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.300
 I can do it will not move 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:44.220
 And that 's autofocus but the original is fine 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.220
 It sounds like this 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:01.120
 Never quiet and with this salt vinegar the turn shooting distance is 45 cm 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:06.370
 So when it comes to want to take the photo you closer if you can not be much closer 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.780
 It will zoom a little away and you will be able to zoom in. The background will blur even as a light 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.060
 Say would 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.390
 There are also benefits 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.480
 Yes it's like this kind of feeling 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.989
 It is the end 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:24.629
 The video I got on Eto this meeting that I got low on a lonely ride 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:27.720
 This there is this lens look Kedomo I think that is can probably 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:32.790
 It is something to be done in 62 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.090
 If you have n't seen it yet, please check it out. 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.250
 200 mm 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:43.959
 It is said that it will be 6 times as much, but I understand that the angle of view is how much 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:49.000
 It has taken a little at the bottom of a nearby park so I think some people do not 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:55.350
 It is the first 18mm this kind of feeling visit 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.030
 And it feels like 35mm Next school order 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.630
 70 3 people 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.630
 100 mm 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.099
 131 houses mm 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.099
 And finally 100mm 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.000
 How is it? I use this lens in a mess 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.770
 Another easy meeting 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.760
 I'm using it to the extent that it is broken 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:29.910
 By Ka and Hiromi also as a so would over mess the filter when striking the work 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:35.020
 I'm sorry I can not help, but somehow the atmosphere and this much now 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:39.100
 Please take a look at the fact that you can make a work of that much. 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:44.980
 I am using tablo lens 18 mm to 100 mm 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:48.120
