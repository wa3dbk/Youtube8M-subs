it's not folded and this is the case
when<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.180> actually<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.869> directional

when you actually have directional

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.500 
when you actually have directional
fabric<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.310> sometimes<00:00:20.880> referred<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.300> as

now<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.210> design<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:25.019> running<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.560> way<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.279> you

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
now the design is running one way as you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.320 
now the design is running one way as you
can<00:00:27.000> see<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.510> we've<00:00:28.230> got<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.380> flower<00:00:28.710> there

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
can see here we've got a flower there

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.080 
can see here we've got a flower there
and<00:00:30.330> we've<00:00:30.480> got<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> little<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.140> here<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.090> each

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and we've got a little one here and each

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.690 
and we've got a little one here and each
corner<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.050> all<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> designs<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.520> just

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
corner here so all the designs is just

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.299 
corner here so all the designs is just
running<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.510> way<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> need<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.890> make<00:00:38.070> sure

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
running one way do you need to make sure

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.520 
running one way do you need to make sure
that<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:38.700> fabric<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.570> not<00:00:39.960> only<00:00:40.469> fold<00:00:42.530> when

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that your fabric in not only fold when

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
that your fabric in not only fold when
the<00:00:43.680> best<00:00:43.860> ways<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.190> actually<00:00:44.789> make<00:00:44.969> sure<00:00:45.000> that

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the best ways to actually make sure that

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
the best ways to actually make sure that
you<00:00:45.510> cut<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:45.899> fabric<00:00:46.230> correctly<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
you cut out your fabric correctly on a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.569 
you cut out your fabric correctly on a
directional<00:00:48.030> fabric<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.680> put<00:00:49.950> arrows<00:00:50.190> on

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
directional fabric is to put arrows on

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
directional fabric is to put arrows on
the<00:00:50.820> selvage<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.530> don't<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the selvage here and you don't have to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
the selvage here and you don't have to
do<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:53.340> done<00:00:53.370> I've<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.449> done<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.690> for

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
do I've done I've just done it for

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.860 
do I've done I've just done it for
demonstration<00:00:55.440> purposes<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.430> chalk<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
demonstration purposes but just chalk it

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
demonstration purposes but just chalk it
so<00:00:57.870> you're<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.350> direction<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:59.280> your

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so you're going in a direction that your

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.330 
so you're going in a direction that your
design<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.190> my

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
design is and as you can see here my

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
design is and as you can see here my
flower<00:01:02.550> head<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
flower head is going that way and the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.140 
flower head is going that way and the
next<00:01:04.799> flower<00:01:04.979> head<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.700> way<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
next flower head is going that way and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.690 
next flower head is going that way and
you<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.960> each<00:01:07.260> side<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.760> selvage<00:01:10.700> now

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you on each side of your selvage now

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.940 
you on each side of your selvage now
before<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.150> put<00:01:12.330> my<00:01:12.390> sewing<00:01:12.810> patterns<00:01:13.229> onto<00:01:13.830> my

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
before I put my sewing patterns onto my

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.230 
before I put my sewing patterns onto my
fabric<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.670> need<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.530> cross<00:01:17.460> wire<00:01:17.759> grain

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
fabric I need to do a cross wire grain

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.469 
fabric I need to do a cross wire grain
layout<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.770> I'm<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> fold<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.960> half

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
layout so I'm going to fold it in half

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.859 
layout so I'm going to fold it in half
like<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> show<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.759> what<00:01:29.759> may<00:01:30.509> cause<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
like so and show you what may cause a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.270 
like so and show you what may cause a
problem<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.650> turn<00:01:32.070> back<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.960> see

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
problem now the turn back you can see

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.219 
problem now the turn back you can see
the<00:01:35.280> grain<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> actual<00:01:36.600> direction<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the grain that the actual direction of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:37.999 
the grain that the actual direction of
my<00:01:37.409> design

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
my design

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.700 
my design
is<00:01:38.189> running<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:40.290> other<00:01:40.409> arrow

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
is running that way and the other arrow

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.760 
is running that way and the other arrow
is<00:01:41.670> telling<00:01:42.030> me<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.390> my<00:01:42.750> flower<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
is telling me that my flower is going to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.789 
is telling me that my flower is going to
be<00:01:43.860> upside<00:01:44.159> down<00:01:44.299> now<00:01:45.299> what<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> need<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.409> is

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
be upside down now what I need to do is

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.580 
be upside down now what I need to do is
cut<00:01:47.250> along<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.000> fold<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.170> cross

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
cut along the fold of the cross

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.480 
cut along the fold of the cross
crosswise<00:01:50.159> grain<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.619> then<00:01:52.619> turn<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> round

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
crosswise grain and then turn it round

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.670 
crosswise grain and then turn it round
and<00:01:54.270> I'll<00:01:54.420> show<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> how<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.259> once

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and I'll show you how to do that once

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.990 
and I'll show you how to do that once
I've<00:01:55.860> got<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:57.740> okay<00:01:58.740> I'm<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.189> cutting<00:01:59.640> along

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
I've got it okay I'm not cutting along

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.109 
I've got it okay I'm not cutting along
the<00:02:00.740> crosswise<00:02:01.740> grain

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.699 

putting<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.330> long<00:02:07.640> as<00:02:08.640> possible<00:02:09.360> right<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.380> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
putting as long as possible right to the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.440 
putting as long as possible right to the
end<00:02:11.370> there<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.270> go<00:02:13.580> nice<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.640> straight<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
end there we go nice and straight and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.210 
end there we go nice and straight and
now<00:02:16.020> I'm<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.410> turn<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.770> around<00:02:16.830> for<00:02:17.160> you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
now I'm going to turn it around for you
