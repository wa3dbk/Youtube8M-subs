00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.649 
on it
it's<00:01:17.189> amazing<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> work<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.240> through<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it's amazing the work we go through to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990 
it's amazing the work we go through to
make<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.960> look<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:20.250> didn't<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.610> any<00:01:20.790> work

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
make it look like we didn't do any work

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000

at<00:01:21.180> all

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.380 

now<00:01:31.010> you<00:01:31.070> can<00:01:31.400> do<00:01:31.580> this<00:01:31.730> with<00:01:31.910> a<00:01:31.940> curling<00:01:32.300> iron

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
now you can do this with a curling iron

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.390 
now you can do this with a curling iron
I<00:01:32.660> would<00:01:32.810> choose<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.170> larger<00:01:33.710> barrel<00:01:33.920> curling

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
I would choose a larger barrel curling

00:01:34.400 --> 00:02:09.740 
I would choose a larger barrel curling
iron

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.970 

just<00:02:10.750> make<00:02:10.899> sure<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.140> whenever<00:02:11.379> you<00:02:11.500> do<00:02:11.709> curl

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
just make sure that whenever you do curl

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.320 
just make sure that whenever you do curl
it<00:02:12.129> with<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.250> flatiron<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:12.819> always<00:02:13.000> use<00:02:13.150> your

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
it with a flatiron you always use your

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.320 
it with a flatiron you always use your
finger<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.750> sort<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.080> finish<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.590> curl<00:02:14.860> off

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
finger to sort of finish that curl off

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.369 
finger to sort of finish that curl off
because<00:02:16.330> sometimes<00:02:16.720> they<00:02:16.870> can<00:02:16.900> be<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.140> little

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
because sometimes they can be a little

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.229 
because sometimes they can be a little
lazy<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.280> if<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.489> wrap<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.730> around<00:02:18.879> your

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
lazy and if you wrap it around your

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.670 
lazy and if you wrap it around your
finger<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.720> can<00:02:19.870> get<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.110> little<00:02:20.260> bit<00:02:20.470> more

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
finger you can get a little bit more

finger you can get a little bit more
action<00:02:21.069> out<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.519> it
