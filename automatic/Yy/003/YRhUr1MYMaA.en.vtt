00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 this is to show that I do fulfill my promises 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
 before showing you the video that I have three rules 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.140
 rule number one 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 do not put offensive comments since I took a shit doing it 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.619
 rule number 2 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.890
 if you like de manuel rivas and if not then change the video do not give hands 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.540

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.460
 and rule 3 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.550
 some audios I did not stay since I still do not know everything about the pc so there 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.190
 some scenes with music of the series but still enjoy it 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 for those who do not follow these rules I want to tell you that your comments 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.660
 offensive I pass them by the eggs so if I get a bad comment 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.000
 do not waste your time at last I have the power to erase them 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.910

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 the idea of â€‹â€‹what is 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.529

 I was not there 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.319
 it is difficult to decide 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.319
 today 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.889

 This is my people and in the Canary Islands 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.049
 by then they were so excited about how you did that because of what 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.449
 them 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.449

 when the imprisonment of both 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.730
 but I'm afraid it's a bit of the end of the Senate plenary session 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.040
 the complaint was dismissed
