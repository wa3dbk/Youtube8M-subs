yourself

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.510 

three<00:02:07.909> opportunities<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.050> first<00:02:09.259> off

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
three opportunities to the first off

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.949 
three opportunities to the first off
could<00:02:10.520> be<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.750> most<00:02:12.020> applications<00:02:12.830> but<00:02:13.959> in

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
could be the most applications but in

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.410 
could be the most applications but in
the<00:02:15.140> end<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.410> thought<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:16.069> very<00:02:16.280> well<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:17.000> start

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
the end I thought it very well to start

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.780 
the end I thought it very well to start
with<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.720> plan<00:02:17.990> then<00:02:18.380> this<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.220> possibly<00:02:19.550> walk

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
with a plan then this is possibly walk

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.730 
with a plan then this is possibly walk
this<00:02:20.120> was<00:02:20.330> probably<00:02:20.510> exactly<00:02:21.050> what<00:02:21.260> we<00:02:21.470> needed

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
this was probably exactly what we needed

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.440 
this was probably exactly what we needed
or<00:02:22.340> yet<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.760> mind<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:25.100> couple<00:02:25.430> way<00:02:25.580> here<00:02:25.940> my

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
or yet in mind the couple way here my

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.690 
or yet in mind the couple way here my
point<00:02:28.420> still<00:02:29.420> feel<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.810> for<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> couple

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
point still feel that for that a couple

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.370 
point still feel that for that a couple
of<00:02:31.760> chances<00:02:32.180> as<00:02:32.540> well<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:32.990> should<00:02:33.260> have

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380
