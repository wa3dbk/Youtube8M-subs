00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
when someone's dribbling and they're

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.899 
when someone's dribbling and they're
running<00:01:36.109> they<00:01:37.039> don't<00:01:37.249> know<00:01:37.369> how<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.549> throw<00:01:37.819> the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
running they don't know how to throw the

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.379

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
instead what they're doing is they're

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.899
