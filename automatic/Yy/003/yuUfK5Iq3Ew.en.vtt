I'm a neuroscientist I would like to
know<00:01:50.010> whether<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.490> actor<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:50.970> faking<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.570> or

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600

whether<00:01:52.230> he<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:53.670> help<00:01:54.120> what<00:01:54.600> he<00:01:54.750> was

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
whether he just really help what he was

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.500 
whether he just really help what he was
particularly<00:01:55.260> was<00:01:55.590> pretending<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:57.210> had<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
particularly was pretending we had to

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.840 
particularly was pretending we had to
ask<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.900> actors<00:01:58.230> to<00:01:58.410> act<00:01:58.830> within<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.580> scanner

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
ask the actors to act within the scanner

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.360 
ask the actors to act within the scanner
without<00:02:00.180> moving<00:02:00.660> without<00:02:01.170> talking<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
concentrating all this loud noise is his

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.920 
concentrating all this loud noise is his
fight<00:02:05.160> of<00:02:05.340> his<00:02:05.430> loud<00:02:05.670> noise<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.660> first

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
fight of his loud noise and the first

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.330 
fight of his loud noise and the first
act<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.500> we<00:02:07.650> asked<00:02:07.890> whether<00:02:08.040> they<00:02:08.220> were

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
act is that we asked whether they were

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.070 
act is that we asked whether they were
able<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.700> do<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:09.030> said<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.810> didn't

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
orbitofrontal cortex and the evicted are

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.430 
orbitofrontal cortex and the evicted are
two<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> most<00:02:24.270> important<00:02:24.990> commercial

two of the most important commercial
modules<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.520> brain<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.000> they<00:02:27.780> switched

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
modules in the brain and they switched

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.449 
modules in the brain and they switched
them<00:02:28.350> off<00:02:28.500> when<00:02:28.740> they<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:29.100> were<00:02:29.250> rehearsing

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the text so it seems that they really

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.720 
the text so it seems that they really
can't<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.590> conscious<00:02:34.590> access<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:35.220> emotional
