00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.420
 cloud cover and the rains that hit 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.490
 the great southern river in the last days and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.230
 also part of the southern region of the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.070
 simplified here in the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.800
 satellite 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.869
 finally dissipate in this 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.330
 Wednesday to 5 during the day what 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.730
 remains only a greater amount of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.680
 clouds between the north east 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 santa catarina and also the paranÃ¡ 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.960
 only in the other regions of the south of the country 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.200
 What we have is the firm time 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 sun early on as well the difference in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
 relation to the last days in this 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.489
 Wednesday incursion of an air mass 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.950
 polar 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 this mass of air comes from the polar region 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.059
 bringing an air a little colder than 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.789
 what was on the south of the country 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.070
 until then the winds change from 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.930
 change direction to the south quadrant and 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.510
 decrease temperature and sensation 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.670
 especially in the region of the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.370
 campaign so the temperatures 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.980
 Minutes of the beginning of Wednesday are 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.589
 especially in the south and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.700
 campaign in this region here in the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.860
 bagÃ© region 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.210
 the thermometers can reach up to eight 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.549
 degrees in the wee hours of the morning 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.580
 therefore return of the cold this winter 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.170
 although not very significant 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.729
 for the southern region of the country 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.799
 in the other areas of the south 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.540
 slightly pleasant temperatures 14 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.150
 degrees in the western region of the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100
 southern region of Uruguay and during the day 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.619
 with predominance of the sun and also the return 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.810
 of dry weather temperatures rise 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.200
 gradually merry port will be above 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.320
 30 degrees and only between the east and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.390
 note here of santa catarina and paranÃ¡ 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.430
 is like the highest amount of clouds 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.470
 these temperatures can not be 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.110
 take as much as in other areas of 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.320
 region and therefore the maximum in the region 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.570
 of curitiba is in the house of 25 degrees 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.240
 already a good part of the interior of the south 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.219
 with sp predominance is of sun and also 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.140
 elevation temperatures we will have the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.020
 return of the north quadrant winds 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.790
 here about the northwest region of the parana 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.130
 this also favors the decline of 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.129
 relative humidity a good part of the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.509
 will have units between 25 and 30 percent 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.610
 this wednesday 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.239
 therefore care hydration are 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.239
 required
