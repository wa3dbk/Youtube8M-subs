00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi little whores I'm late lately 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.049
 seen many videos of criticism so 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.510
 I was singing the balls to make a 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.610
 that's why in this video I'm going to 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 throw shit to mtv and if not what 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.199
 they want to see they already know close the video and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.869
 to take for ass mtv is a channel of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.460
 television that has changed its structure 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.160
 roundly turning it into a complete 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.529
 shit mtv is the abbreviation of music 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.810
 television perhaps the current idiots 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.840
 who manage the channel do not understand music 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.550
 music music music music means music 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.829
 piece of subnormal imbeciles 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.620
 mentally retarded because I say this 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.050
 because mtv in its beginnings was a channel 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.850
 of full-time music after 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 he was adding series of black humor 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.500
 made for teenagers and adult people 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.420
 but now it has gone from being 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.910
 very no television to shit television 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.860
 since 90% of things that happen in the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.780
 channel are fucking series with crazy 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.510
 insane and the music they pass is 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.969
 totally a shit I started to look 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.039
 mtv back in the 90s where 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.409
 they passed music of the good one like rolas de 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.129
 iron maiden metallica black sabbath 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.380
 ramón 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.630
 is and all the good rock and metal of the 80s 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.229
 there was also a section for rock 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.539
 national 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.259
 they passed good bands like soda stereo 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.509
 the lice green dwarfs tree 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.009
 attaque77 bersuit vergarabat old 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.289
 crazy among other bands 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.299
 little by little it was growing with the 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.970
 good music that happened not just rock 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.340
 but also poor the 80s an example 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.439
 to give is michael jackson also passed 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.810
 the concerts and play that were a lot 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.819
 To my liking they invited rock bands to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.549
 play their songs in acoustic version and 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.649
 so they pulled out their acoustic record examples 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.539
 like soda stereo comfort and music for 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.670
 fly the three would feel silver 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.459
 mana entibian silver nirvana empyrean 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 plug in new york and they would feel silver with 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.959
 the passing of time in addition to music 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.569
 they were adding humor cartoons 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.030
 black cartoons for teens 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.340
 my favorites are southpark beavis and 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.229
 butthead the house of drawings happy 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.780

 teen drama soap opera that 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.400

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.859
 of mtv currently as you know they do not pass 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.230
 too much music just pass series of 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.329
 shit or shit reality shows 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.250

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.970
 Do what the vagina sing and 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.099
 they treat them like sexual slaves 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.159
 the banks going one by one until 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.500

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.810
 there was actually a reality like that but 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.450
