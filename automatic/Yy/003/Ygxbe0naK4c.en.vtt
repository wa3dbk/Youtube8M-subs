00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
cheer me with that t-80 6-speed factory

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.230 
cheer me with that t-80 6-speed factory
here<00:00:19.650> today<00:00:20.160> we're<00:00:20.340> looking<00:00:20.400> at<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.789> RSR

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
here today we're looking at the RSR

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.390 
here today we're looking at the RSR
coilovers<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.960> Scion<00:00:22.230> fr-s<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.890> Subaru<00:00:22.980> BRZ

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
coilovers the Scion fr-s and Subaru BRZ

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.790 
coilovers the Scion fr-s and Subaru BRZ
now<00:00:24.119> our<00:00:24.300> SR<00:00:24.689> makes<00:00:24.930> two<00:00:25.260> different<00:00:25.380> coil

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
now our SR makes two different coil

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.370 
now our SR makes two different coil
overs<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.369> 4sm<00:00:26.789> vrz<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:28.050> we've<00:00:28.199> taken

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
overs for that 4sm vrz so we've taken

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.240 
overs for that 4sm vrz so we've taken
one<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> each<00:00:29.580> front<00:00:30.300> dampener<00:00:31.199> lace<00:00:31.890> them<00:00:32.130> out

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
one of each front dampener lace them out

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.040 
one of each front dampener lace them out
here<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.669> we're<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.630> talk<00:00:33.809> about

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
here and we're going to just talk about

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.840 
here and we're going to just talk about
the<00:00:34.170> differences<00:00:34.590> between<00:00:34.649> them<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.670> know

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the differences between them so you know

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
the differences between them so you know
it<00:00:35.940> helps<00:00:36.180> make<00:00:37.020> your<00:00:37.140> decision<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.770> which

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it helps make your decision on which

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.910 
it helps make your decision on which
coil<00:00:38.129> over<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.540> easier<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:39.930> what

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
coil over to get a little easier so what

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.500 
coil over to get a little easier so what
I've<00:00:41.010> done<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.430> flush<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> bottoms<00:00:42.300> here

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I've done is I flush up the bottoms here

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.869 
I've done is I flush up the bottoms here
and<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:43.680> thing<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.950> notice<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:44.250> away<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and one thing you notice right away is

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.080 
and one thing you notice right away is
the<00:00:45.780> black<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.200> version<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> back<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.730> going

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the black I version in the back is going

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.270 
the black I version in the back is going
to<00:00:48.180> sit<00:00:48.360> lower<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> sports<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.649> version<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
to sit lower in the sports I version and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.220 
to sit lower in the sports I version and
that's<00:00:51.239> basically<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.050> main

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that's basically one of the main

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.900 
that's basically one of the main
differences<00:00:52.469> between<00:00:53.039> these<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:53.460> coil

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
differences between these two coil

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.840 
differences between these two coil
rockets<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.420> design<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.899> black<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.350> version

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
rockets they design this black I version

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.450 
rockets they design this black I version
to<00:00:56.850> give<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> little<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.399> adjustment<00:00:59.399> as

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
to give you a little more adjustment as

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
to give you a little more adjustment as
far<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.850> how<00:01:00.030> low<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> car<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.899> sit<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.379> then

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
far as how low the car can sit and then

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.619 
far as how low the car can sit and then
the<00:01:02.129> sports<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.579> version<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.359> kind<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the sports I version that kind of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.149 
the sports I version that kind of
control<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.799> reason<00:01:05.070> they

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
control that and the reason they

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.090 
control that and the reason they
controlled<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.140> it's<00:01:07.140> better<00:01:07.409> coil<00:01:07.830> over

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
controlled that is it's better coil over

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.649 
controlled that is it's better coil over
for<00:01:08.340> daily<00:01:08.610> driving<00:01:08.760> you're<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> get

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
for daily driving you're going to get

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.770 
for daily driving you're going to get
more<00:01:09.840> stroke<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:10.979> dampening<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.540> spring

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
more stroke more dampening the spring

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.390 
more stroke more dampening the spring
rates<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.680> softer<00:01:14.100> we'll<00:01:14.250> talk

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
rates a little bit softer we'll talk

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550 
rates a little bit softer we'll talk
about<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> second<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.990> overall<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
about that in a second but overall the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
about that in a second but overall the
sports<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.520> designed<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> guy<00:01:18.330> whose

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
sports I is designed to the guy whose

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.899 
sports I is designed to the guy whose

daily driving who wants to get a little

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.570 
daily driving who wants to get a little
lower<00:01:21.150> wants<00:01:21.930> good<00:01:22.080> dampening<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.920> good

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580

black eye version in the back here a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.359 
black eye version in the back here a
little<00:01:31.320> stiffer<00:01:31.710> spring<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.340> much

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
little stiffer spring right not much

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.819 
little stiffer spring right not much
again<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.750> again<00:01:34.020> designed<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> guy

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
again but it's again designed to the guy

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.429 
again but it's again designed to the guy
who's<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> go<00:01:35.310> low<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.900> still<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
who's going to go low and still want a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.800 
who's going to go low and still want a
decent<00:01:37.710> ride<00:01:38.180> but<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> understand

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
decent ride but you got to understand

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.719 
decent ride but you got to understand
when<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:40.320> low<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.590> lose<00:01:41.250> some<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.610> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
when you do go low you lose some of that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.569 
when you do go low you lose some of that
ride<00:01:42.000> quality<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.950> spring<00:01:44.220> rates<00:01:44.399> on

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
ride quality so the spring rates on

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.760 
ride quality so the spring rates on
those<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:45.210> got<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.630> sports<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.020> version<00:01:46.409> here

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
those we got the sports I version here

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
those we got the sports I version here
it's<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.460> 6k<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.000> front<00:01:48.240> 7k<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it's going to be 6k up front 7k in the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's going to be 6k up front 7k in the
rear<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:50.310> black<00:01:50.729> eye<00:01:50.909> version<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.540> 7k<00:01:52.079> all

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
rear the black eye version is 7k all

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.679 
rear the black eye version is 7k all
around<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:53.880> stiffer<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> front

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
around so a little stiffer in the front

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.990 
around so a little stiffer in the front
it's<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.590> huge<00:01:55.950> change<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
it's not a huge change but it is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.649 
it's not a huge change but it is
noticeable<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:59.250> keep<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.030> mind<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.570> know

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
noticeable so keep that in mind you know

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.389 
noticeable so keep that in mind you know
if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> kind<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.590> daily<00:02:01.740> drive<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.130> again<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
if you kind of daily drive it again the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.520 
if you kind of daily drive it again the
sports<00:02:02.670> idea<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> best<00:02:03.119> version<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
sports idea is the best version the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560 
sports idea is the best version the
black<00:02:04.710> eye<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.219> it's<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.729> bad<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.360> daily

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
black eye is it's not bad for daily

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.180 
black eye is it's not bad for daily
driving<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.560> something<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:07.979> stiffer

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
driving but something a little stiffer

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.889 
driving but something a little stiffer
especially<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.789> go<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.270> low<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.720> it

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
especially if you go really low with it

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.840 
especially if you go really low with it
so

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
so

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.220 
so
both<00:02:12.180> are<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.570> go<00:02:12.630> pretty<00:02:12.870> low<00:02:13.020> though

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
both are going to go pretty low though

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.470 
both are going to go pretty low though
are<00:02:13.500> already<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.160> sports<00:02:15.060> side<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.330> going<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
are already the sports side is going to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.880 
are already the sports side is going to
allow<00:02:15.600> for<00:02:15.630> twenty<00:02:16.050> five-millimeter<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
allow for twenty five-millimeter to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.010 
allow for twenty five-millimeter to
thirty<00:02:17.100> millimeter<00:02:17.490> drop<00:02:17.790> over<00:02:18.480> stock<00:02:18.750> which

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
thirty millimeter drop over stock which

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.780 
thirty millimeter drop over stock which
is<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.290> two<00:02:19.500> inches<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:20.130> mean<00:02:20.610> that's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
is like two inches I mean that's

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.300 
is like two inches I mean that's
honestly<00:02:21.390> plenty<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.710> Sport<00:02:22.980> sign<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.220> going

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
honestly plenty the Sport sign is going

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.630 
honestly plenty the Sport sign is going
to<00:02:23.400> give<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> little<00:02:23.790> bit<00:02:23.940> more<00:02:24.090> 35<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.840> 40

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
to give you a little bit more 35 to 40

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.500 
to give you a little bit more 35 to 40
you<00:02:26.640> know<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:26.940> that's<00:02:27.090> going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> get<00:02:27.390> you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you know so that's going to get you

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.200 
you know so that's going to get you
pretty<00:02:27.690> low<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.020> that's<00:02:28.200> what<00:02:28.380> you're<00:02:28.530> into<00:02:29.210> so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
pretty low if that's what you're into so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.110 
pretty low if that's what you're into so
let's<00:02:30.750> talk<00:02:30.960> about<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.470> top<00:02:32.160> hat<00:02:32.370> itself<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.090> a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
let's talk about the top hat itself is a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.000 
let's talk about the top hat itself is a
little<00:02:33.390> different<00:02:33.690> design<00:02:33.810> than<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.590> way

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
little different design than the way

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.520 
little different design than the way
most<00:02:35.040> people<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:35.610> their<00:02:35.730> top<00:02:35.940> hats<00:02:36.210> are<00:02:36.420> sr<00:02:36.780> you

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
most people do their top hats are sr you

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.290 
most people do their top hats are sr you
know<00:02:37.650> they<00:02:37.800> maintain<00:02:38.190> some<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.910> rubber

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
know they maintain some of the rubber

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.180 
know they maintain some of the rubber
bushings<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.960> stuff<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.350> top<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:40.830> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
bushings and stuff in the top here to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.940 
bushings and stuff in the top here to
limit<00:02:41.880> north<00:02:42.120> noise<00:02:42.690> harshness<00:02:43.230> vibration

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
limit north noise harshness vibration

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.770

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
that's you know daily drivable one thing

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.900 
that's you know daily drivable one thing
they<00:02:49.080> do<00:02:49.140> give<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.370> know<00:02:50.550> most<00:02:50.730> people

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
have camera plates with adjustments you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.400 
have camera plates with adjustments you
know<00:02:53.250> slots<00:02:53.640> there<00:02:54.000> are<00:02:54.780> SR<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.140> taking<00:02:55.350> a

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
know slots there are SR is taking a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.740 
know slots there are SR is taking a
different<00:02:55.530> approach<00:02:55.770> they<00:02:56.370> want<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.880> make

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
different approach they want to make

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.660 
different approach they want to make
sure<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.080> know<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.440> top<00:02:58.590> hat<00:02:58.830> does<00:02:59.580> how

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
sure you know that the top hat does how

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.610 
sure you know that the top hat does how
many<00:02:59.880> issues<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.270> sometimes<00:03:00.960> those<00:03:01.200> sliders

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
many issues you sometimes those sliders

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.350 
many issues you sometimes those sliders
will<00:03:01.770> break<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.220> lose<00:03:02.580> Allen<00:03:02.880> bolts<00:03:03.150> things

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
will break you lose Allen bolts things

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.050 
will break you lose Allen bolts things
like<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.740> this<00:03:04.740> is<00:03:04.950> basically<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.370> reversible

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
like that this is basically a reversible

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.050 
like that this is basically a reversible
top<00:03:06.570> hats<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:07.020> rotated<00:03:07.680> 180<00:03:08.160> degrees<00:03:08.250> what

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
top hats you rotated 180 degrees what

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.720 
top hats you rotated 180 degrees what
that<00:03:09.210> does<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.690> gets<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.960> 1.5<00:03:10.830> negative

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
that does is it gets you 1.5 negative

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.210 
that does is it gets you 1.5 negative
camber<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.810> if<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.960> combine<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.380> with<00:03:13.650> you

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
camber so if you combine that with you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.710 
camber so if you combine that with you
know<00:03:14.310> an<00:03:14.430> SPC<00:03:14.850> camera<00:03:15.180> bold<00:03:15.390> or<00:03:15.570> white

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
know an SPC camera bold or white

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.660 
know an SPC camera bold or white
lighting<00:03:15.930> camera<00:03:16.140> Bowl<00:03:16.440> you'll<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.459> able<00:03:17.610> to

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
lighting camera Bowl you'll be able to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.520 
lighting camera Bowl you'll be able to
get<00:03:17.790> two<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.510> two<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> half<00:03:18.959> degrees<00:03:19.170> and

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
get two to two and a half degrees and

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.960 
get two to two and a half degrees and
negative<00:03:19.800> camber<00:03:19.980> up<00:03:20.160> front<00:03:20.400> maybe<00:03:20.640> more

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
negative camber up front maybe more

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.490 
negative camber up front maybe more
depending<00:03:21.390> on<00:03:21.450> how<00:03:21.510> low<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.780> go<00:03:22.050> because<00:03:22.350> as

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
depending on how low you go because as

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.850 
depending on how low you go because as
you<00:03:22.620> go<00:03:22.739> low<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:22.980> get<00:03:23.730> natural<00:03:23.910> camber<00:03:24.709> on<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
you go low you get natural camber on the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.290 
you go low you get natural camber on the
Front's<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.550> rears<00:03:26.820> they've<00:03:27.030> got<00:03:27.180> the

Front's in the rears they've got the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.170 
Front's in the rears they've got the
adjustment<00:03:27.750> for<00:03:27.900> your<00:03:28.459> dampening<00:03:29.459> right
