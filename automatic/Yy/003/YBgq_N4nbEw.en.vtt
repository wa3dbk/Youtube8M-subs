72 curves it looks nice on that track
thought<00:03:47.910> I'd<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.300> point<00:03:48.900> out<00:03:49.080> some<00:03:49.350> of<00:03:49.380> the

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
thought I'd just point out some of the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.570 
thought I'd just point out some of the
differences<00:03:49.890> here<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:51.800> here's<00:03:52.800> a<00:03:52.860> also

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
differences here and here's a also

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.220 
differences here and here's a also
another<00:03:53.880> difference<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.050> the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
another difference is that on the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.530 
another difference is that on the
firebox<00:03:55.800> on<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:57.890> American<00:03:58.890> Flyer<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.820> piping

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
firebox on the American Flyer the piping

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.350 
firebox on the American Flyer the piping
starts<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.680> be<00:04:01.830> molded<00:04:02.340> in<00:04:02.670> but<00:04:02.970> then<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.209> kind

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
starts to be molded in but then it kind

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.060 
starts to be molded in but then it kind
of<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.630> kind<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.020> brought<00:04:04.230> out<00:04:04.260> as<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.830> comes

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
of is kind of brought out as it comes

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.890 
of is kind of brought out as it comes
underneath<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:06.560> walkway<00:04:07.560> there<00:04:08.000> on<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.720> line

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
underneath the walkway there on the line

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.729 
underneath the walkway there on the line
master<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:10.680> molded<00:04:11.100> in<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.930> all<00:04:13.140> molded<00:04:13.590> in

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
master it's molded in it's all molded in

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.039 
master it's molded in it's all molded in
and<00:04:14.040> on<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.310> jlc<00:04:14.880> version<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.600> have<00:04:15.780> some

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
and on the jlc version you have some

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.800 
and on the jlc version you have some
additional<00:04:16.350> piping<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:18.150> separately

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
additional piping that separately

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.430 
additional piping that separately
applied<00:04:19.230> as<00:04:19.530> well<00:04:19.709> as<00:04:19.830> separately<00:04:20.609> applied

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
applied as well as separately applied

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.400 
applied as well as separately applied
piping<00:04:22.440> traversing<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.780> firebox

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
piping traversing the firebox

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
piping traversing the firebox
so<00:04:26.280> some<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.210> differences<00:04:27.720> very<00:04:28.430> good

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
so some of the differences very good

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.060 
so some of the differences very good
models<00:04:29.880> very<00:04:30.360> good<00:04:30.590> representations<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.800> the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
models very good representations of the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.160 
models very good representations of the
Challenger<00:04:32.550> locomotive<00:04:33.180> one<00:04:33.660> of<00:04:33.750> my<00:04:33.840> favorite

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
Challenger locomotive one of my favorite

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.520 
Challenger locomotive one of my favorite
locomotives<00:04:34.770> if<00:04:35.580> not<00:04:35.790> my<00:04:36.030> favorite<00:04:36.530> that

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
locomotives if not my favorite that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.890 
locomotives if not my favorite that
probably<00:04:37.890> is<00:04:38.010> my<00:04:38.190> favorite<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.480> I<00:04:39.510> thought<00:04:39.750> I'd

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
probably is my favorite so I thought I'd

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.640 
probably is my favorite so I thought I'd
just<00:04:40.080> kind<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:40.970> show<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.300> relative<00:04:42.810> sizes

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
just kind of show you the relative sizes
