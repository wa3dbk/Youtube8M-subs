00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
the sheet metal so you can hot glue it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.209 
the sheet metal so you can hot glue it
in<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.989> second<00:00:59.410> now<00:00:59.559> take<00:00:59.800> your<00:00:59.890> heavy-duty

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219

scissors and start to cut your fabric

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.799 
scissors and start to cut your fabric
the<00:01:03.280> line<00:01:03.489> doesn't<00:01:03.730> have<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.090> be<00:01:04.180> perfect

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
the line doesn't have to be perfect

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:05.940 
the line doesn't have to be perfect
because<00:01:05.320> it's<00:01:05.440> just<00:01:05.470> going<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.740> wrap<00:01:05.920> around

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
because it's just going to wrap around

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.040 
because it's just going to wrap around
the<00:01:06.250> back<00:01:06.400> of<00:01:06.460> your<00:01:06.670> sheet<00:01:06.910> metal<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.780> then

we're<00:01:08.170> going<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.410> hot<00:01:08.710> glue<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.490> stays

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
we're going to hot glue it so it stays

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.950 
we're going to hot glue it so it stays
in<00:01:09.730> place

sheet metal and it fits perfectly in the
frame<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:43.770> when<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.460> wrap<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.820> fabric

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
frame but then when you wrap your fabric

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.850

around it it's going to be too big so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.770 
around it it's going to be too big so
