there's three parts of it on the bottom
part<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> pyramid<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:50.760> move<00:00:51.449> slowly<00:00:54.559> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
part of the pyramid is to move slowly it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.849 
part of the pyramid is to move slowly it
was<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.600> bottom<00:00:57.600> part<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.260> I<00:01:00.739> don't<00:01:01.739> remember

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
was it bottom part is I don't remember

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
was it bottom part is I don't remember
what<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.309> called<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.870> bottom<00:01:04.110> part<00:01:04.260> is

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
what it's called but the bottom part is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.750 
what it's called but the bottom part is
like<00:01:04.680> moving<00:01:05.309> slowly<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.510> walking<00:01:07.170> hiking

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
like moving slowly like walking hiking

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.100 
like moving slowly like walking hiking
you're<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:08.909> our<00:01:09.060> ancestors<00:01:09.420> used<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.960> do

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you're like our ancestors used to do

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.420 
you're like our ancestors used to do
foraging<00:01:11.689> traveling<00:01:12.689> long<00:01:12.900> distances<00:01:13.430> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
foraging traveling long distances so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.109 
foraging traveling long distances so
that<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.570> maybe<00:01:16.280> two<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
that for maybe two I think the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.490 
that for maybe two I think the
recommendation<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:18.990> two<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> five<00:01:19.439> hours

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
recommendation is like two to five hours

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.649 
recommendation is like two to five hours
a<00:01:19.770> week<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.159> something<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:21.450> do

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
a week or something like that to do

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.340 
a week or something like that to do
moving<00:01:22.530> slowly<00:01:23.180> like<00:01:24.180> hiking<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.720> walking<00:01:24.750> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
moving slowly like hiking or walking so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
moving slowly like hiking or walking so

I'm doing an eight and a half mile hike
in<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> forest<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.420> part<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
in the forest so that's that part of the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.359 
in the forest so that's that part of the
little<00:01:40.259> pyramid<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.280> second<00:01:41.729> part<00:01:41.970> is

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
little pyramid the second part is

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.740 
little pyramid the second part is
lifting<00:01:44.369> heavy<00:01:44.579> things<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.509> another

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
lifting heavy things which is another

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.539 
lifting heavy things which is another
thing<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.259> our<00:01:46.500> ancestors<00:01:46.829> did<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
thing that our ancestors did to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.179 
thing that our ancestors did to
naturally<00:01:48.000> stay<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.299> shape<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.979> part<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
naturally stay in shape and so part of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.289 
naturally stay in shape and so part of
marks<00:01:50.610> plan<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.659> do<00:01:52.759> for<00:01:53.759> essential

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
marks plan is to do for essential

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.700 
marks plan is to do for essential
movements<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.990> those<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:57.259> pull<00:01:58.259> ups

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.540 

and<00:02:01.790> um<00:02:02.900> push-ups<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:05.479> squats<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.550> plank

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and um push-ups and squats and plank

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.990 
and um push-ups and squats and plank
pose<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.720> side<00:02:10.140> side<00:02:10.350> other<00:02:11.190> side<00:02:11.280> tank<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
pose and side side other side tank and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.920 
pose and side side other side tank and
so<00:02:13.670> that's<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.940> middle<00:02:15.180> part<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.540> pyramid

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
so that's the middle part of the pyramid

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.600 
so that's the middle part of the pyramid
and<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.530> doing<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.950> three

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and I'm going to be doing that three

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.510 
and I'm going to be doing that three
times<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.970> week<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:20.010> top<00:02:20.220> part<00:02:20.459> of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
times a week and then the top part of

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.510 
times a week and then the top part of
the<00:02:20.580> pyramid<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.770> sprinting<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.340> reason

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
the pyramid is sprinting so the reason

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.420 
the pyramid is sprinting so the reason
why<00:02:24.239> sprinting<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.200> great<00:02:25.770> for<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.190> is

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
