00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
personally me I don't think that's a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.439 
personally me I don't think that's a
good<00:00:24.150> idea<00:00:24.570> because<00:00:25.490> not<00:00:26.490> every<00:00:26.880> gamer<00:00:27.119> has

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
good idea because not every gamer has

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.660 
good idea because not every gamer has
money<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.769> when<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.490> buy<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
money for this like when you buy the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.429 
money for this like when you buy the
game<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.179> pay<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> game<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> then<00:00:31.289> you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
game you pay for a game and then you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
game you pay for a game and then you
have<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.830> think<00:00:32.009> about<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.820> every<00:00:33.210> month

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
have to think about it like every month

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.389 
have to think about it like every month
you<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.870> pay<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.079> fifteen<00:00:34.739> dollars<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you have to pay for fifteen dollars and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.639 
you have to pay for fifteen dollars and
if<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.360> game<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.660> pretty<00:00:36.870> good<00:00:37.170> if<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> game

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
if the game is pretty good if the game

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.250 
if the game is pretty good if the game
is<00:00:37.829> awesome<00:00:38.160> de<00:00:38.610> nom<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.329> no<00:00:39.540> problems<00:00:40.050> in

is awesome de nom I have no problems in
paying<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.100> um<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.910> game<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.090> decent<00:00:42.629> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
paying this but um if a game is decent I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200 
paying this but um if a game is decent I
don't<00:00:43.770> think<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.010> every<00:00:44.550> gamer<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
don't think that every gamer is going to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
don't think that every gamer is going to
do<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:45.960> will<00:00:46.050> see<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.559> game

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
do that because they will see that game

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.069 
do that because they will see that game
isn't<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.610> awesome<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.719> doesn't

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
isn't that awesome and it doesn't

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
isn't that awesome and it doesn't
deserve<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.680> much<00:00:50.670> money<00:00:50.940> every<00:00:51.390> month<00:00:51.449> I

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
deserve that much money every month I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.689 
deserve that much money every month I
mean<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> money<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.250> when

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
mean it's not a lot of money but when

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.479 
mean it's not a lot of money but when
you<00:00:53.789> sum<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.360> through<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> year<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.620> it's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you sum up it through the year it's it's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.990 
you sum up it through the year it's it's
a<00:00:56.610> decent<00:00:57.030> amount<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.360> money<00:00:57.570> actually<00:00:57.809> so

should<00:01:53.700> other<00:01:54.299> Scrolls<00:01:54.689> online<00:01:55.020> be

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
should other Scrolls online be

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.469 
should other Scrolls online be
subscription-based<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:57.149> World<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
subscription-based like World of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.810 
subscription-based like World of
Warcraft<00:01:57.960> or<00:01:58.170> should<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.799> more<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.070> Guild

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
Warcraft or should be more like Guild

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.060 
Warcraft or should be more like Guild
Wars<00:02:00.000> where<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.930> pay<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> game<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
Wars where you just pay for a game and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.310 
Wars where you just pay for a game and
that's<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.390> don't<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> anything

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
that's it you don't have to you anything

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
that's it you don't have to you anything
because<00:02:04.469> I've<00:02:05.280> seen<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.850> gameplay<00:02:06.299> videos

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
because I've seen some gameplay videos

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.460 
because I've seen some gameplay videos
and<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.970> think<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.149> game<00:02:09.450> has<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> future<00:02:10.080> but

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and I think this game has a future but

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.339 
and I think this game has a future but
it's<00:02:10.800> not<00:02:11.400> really<00:02:11.730> an<00:02:11.970> awesome<00:02:12.000> experience<00:02:12.660> I

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
it's not really an awesome experience I

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.850 
it's not really an awesome experience I
mean

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
mean

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.040 
mean
it's<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.550> game<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.120> pretty<00:02:15.300> good<00:02:15.540> I'm<00:02:15.750> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
it's it's the game is pretty good I'm a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.380 
it's it's the game is pretty good I'm a
huge<00:02:16.440> fan<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.010> other<00:02:17.160> Scrolls<00:02:17.460> I'm<00:02:17.820> series

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
huge fan of the other Scrolls I'm series

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.330 
huge fan of the other Scrolls I'm series
and<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.690> huge<00:02:18.930> fan<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.560> single-player

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
and the huge fan of the single-player

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.670 
and the huge fan of the single-player
series<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.060> i<00:02:21.210> think<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.870> Elder

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
series and i think that the Elder

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.100 
series and i think that the Elder
Scrolls<00:02:22.710> online<00:02:23.160> has<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> future<00:02:24.090> but<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.870> it's

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
Scrolls online has a future but if it's

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.680 
Scrolls online has a future but if it's
going<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.470> be<00:02:25.590> an<00:02:25.800> awesome<00:02:26.010> future<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.910> don't

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
going to be an awesome future I don't

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.900 
going to be an awesome future I don't
think<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.380> because<00:02:28.740> um<00:02:29.040> world<00:02:29.820> of

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
think so it is because um world of

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.880 
think so it is because um world of
warcraft<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.450> gone<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.870> fat<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.620> world

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
warcraft is gone that fat and the world

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.210 
warcraft is gone that fat and the world
of<00:02:32.010> warcraft<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.550> losing<00:02:33.060> our<00:02:33.270> members<00:02:33.810> every

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
of warcraft is losing our members every

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.830 
of warcraft is losing our members every
month<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.910> mean<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.510> normal<00:02:36.780> thing

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
month and I mean that's the normal thing

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.930 
month and I mean that's the normal thing
because<00:02:37.320> world<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.040> warcraft<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.610> pretty

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
because world of warcraft is a pretty

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.090 
because world of warcraft is a pretty
old<00:02:39.210> game<00:02:39.980> but<00:02:40.980> you've<00:02:41.700> seen<00:02:41.940> some<00:02:42.209> other<00:02:42.450> arm

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
old game but you've seen some other arm

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
titles and that that God gone this way

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.280 
titles and that that God gone this way
and<00:02:46.709> they<00:02:47.250> failed<00:02:47.730> because<00:02:47.910> um<00:02:48.420> as<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:49.080> said
