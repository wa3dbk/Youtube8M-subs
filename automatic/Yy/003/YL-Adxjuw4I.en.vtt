this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.190> most<00:00:11.400> efficiently<00:00:11.790> done<00:00:11.969> by<00:00:12.150> a

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
this is most efficiently done by a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.570 
this is most efficiently done by a
volume<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.840> compare<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.559> before<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.219> after<00:00:14.370> a

we're gonna take some paper clips and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.230 
we're gonna take some paper clips and
fold<00:01:47.780> them<00:01:48.050> into<00:01:48.610> what's<00:01:49.610> ready<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.940> become<00:01:50.210> a

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
fold them into what's ready to become a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.990 
fold them into what's ready to become a
hook<00:01:50.830> you<00:01:51.830> can<00:01:51.980> see<00:01:52.130> when<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.460> is<00:01:52.550> flattened

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.880 
of our undigested sample in the reaction
chamber<00:02:21.640> but<00:02:22.640> allow<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.910> juice<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.540> flow<00:02:23.750> out

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
chamber but allow the juice to flow out

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.470 
chamber but allow the juice to flow out
okay<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:25.130> recommend<00:02:25.790> using<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.060> rubber<00:02:26.180> band

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
okay I recommend using a rubber band

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
okay I recommend using a rubber band
because<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:26.960> is<00:02:27.050> gonna<00:02:27.140> need<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.350> be

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
because this is gonna need to be

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.380 
because this is gonna need to be
replaced<00:02:27.860> frequently<00:02:28.250> throughout<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
replaced frequently throughout the

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.980 
at once you can move the scale to
another<00:04:25.380> location<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.270> using<00:04:27.270> two<00:04:27.720> more

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
another location and using two more

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.080 
another location and using two more
lengths<00:04:28.560> of<00:04:28.680> twine<00:04:28.949> these<00:04:29.280> are<00:04:29.430> both<00:04:29.550> 45

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
lengths of twine these are both 45

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.330 
lengths of twine these are both 45
centimeters<00:04:30.630> long<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:33.030> can<00:04:33.210> hang<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:34.340> funnel

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
centimeters long you can hang a funnel

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.750 
centimeters long you can hang a funnel
and<00:04:35.460> tube<00:04:35.820> system<00:04:37.039> underneath<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.280> reaction

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
and tube system underneath the reaction

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.839 
and tube system underneath the reaction
vessel<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.300> place<00:04:39.690> your<00:04:40.139> harvesting<00:04:40.849> beaker

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
vessel and place your harvesting beaker

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:51.180 
vessel and place your harvesting beaker
and<00:04:41.970> elsewhere<00:04:42.389> and<00:04:43.669> collect<00:04:44.669> in<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:44.849> manner

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.280 

and<00:04:51.280> that's<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.090> hopefully<00:04:52.870> everything<00:04:53.260> goes

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
and that's it hopefully everything goes

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.660 
and that's it hopefully everything goes
great<00:04:53.620> for<00:04:53.860> you<00:04:53.950> if<00:04:54.040> you<00:04:54.100> have<00:04:54.190> any<00:04:54.310> questions
