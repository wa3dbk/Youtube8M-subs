00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
guys you know if you're thinking of a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.369 
guys you know if you're thinking of a
bug-out<00:00:50.399> vehicle<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.180> ideal<00:00:52.140> because

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
bug-out vehicle this is ideal because

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
bug-out vehicle this is ideal because
it's<00:00:53.030> pre-1980<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.210> there's<00:00:54.360> no<00:00:54.480> computer<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it's pre-1980 so there's no computer in

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.939 
it's pre-1980 so there's no computer in
it<00:00:56.690> four-wheel<00:00:57.690> drive<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> stick

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
it four-wheel drive and it's a stick

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.689 
it four-wheel drive and it's a stick
shift<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.949> thing's<00:01:02.100> pretty<00:01:02.250> cool<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
shift so this thing's pretty cool and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.359 
shift so this thing's pretty cool and
you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.660> built<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.019> off-roading<00:01:04.470> it's

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you know it's built for off-roading it's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.120 
you know it's built for off-roading it's
got<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.140> big<00:01:07.140> old<00:01:07.260> lift<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130

alrighty so yeah you see look at this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.990 
alrighty so yeah you see look at this
engine<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.130> doesn't<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.520> much<00:01:23.670> better<00:01:23.880> than

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
engine it doesn't get much better than

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.340 
engine it doesn't get much better than
that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.929

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
look at this engine this is the simplest

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.800 
look at this engine this is the simplest
design<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> world<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:42.060> how<00:01:42.210> that's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
design in the world that's how that's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.740 
design in the world that's how that's
how<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.049> built<00:01:43.320> things<00:01:43.530> back<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> day<00:01:44.750> made

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
how we built things back in the day made

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.080 
how we built things back in the day made
things<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> last<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.770> truck<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:48.020> 1967<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
things to last this truck is a 1967 and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.219 
things to last this truck is a 1967 and
it's<00:01:51.090> lasted<00:01:51.630> through<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.079> these<00:01:52.229> years<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.770> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
still trusted yeah you know it's been

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.870 
still trusted yeah you know it's been
rebuilt

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
rebuilt

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.959 
rebuilt
you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.090> most<00:01:57.299> old<00:01:57.600> cars<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:58.079> been<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.969> you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you know most old cars have been but you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
know if I had a bug-out vehicle be

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.319 
know if I had a bug-out vehicle be
something<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:06.060> thought

guys<00:02:09.450> how<00:02:09.569> cool<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.869> truck<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.349> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.650
