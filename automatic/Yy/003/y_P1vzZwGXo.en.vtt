for<00:00:07.090> many<00:00:07.269> years<00:00:07.479> I<00:00:07.960> have<00:00:08.230> taken<00:00:08.440> interesting

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
for many years I have taken interesting

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.910 
for many years I have taken interesting
studying<00:00:09.880> fluorescent<00:00:10.510> proteins<00:00:10.930> so<00:00:11.650> because

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
studying fluorescent proteins so because

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.480 
studying fluorescent proteins so because
they<00:00:12.130> allow<00:00:12.400> the<00:00:13.030> direct<00:00:13.150> visualization<00:00:13.840> of

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
they allow the direct visualization of

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.429 
they allow the direct visualization of
Piroska<00:00:15.490> processes<00:00:16.209> in<00:00:16.480> live<00:00:16.840> cells<00:00:17.199> and

produced<00:00:19.929> many<00:00:20.289> flotsam<00:00:20.859> tools<00:00:21.220> so<00:00:22.119> that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
produced many flotsam tools so that

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.870 
produced many flotsam tools so that

tools<00:00:33.640> but<00:00:34.390> until<00:00:34.989> our<00:00:35.140> new<00:00:35.379> discovery

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
tools but until our new discovery

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.849 
tools but until our new discovery
it<00:00:36.489> was<00:00:36.789> difficult<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:38.019> to<00:00:38.079> bridge<00:00:38.469> the<00:00:38.680> gap

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
it was difficult so to bridge the gap

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.259 
it was difficult so to bridge the gap
from<00:00:39.399> lab<00:00:39.730> bench<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.570> human<00:00:41.350> applications

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
from lab bench so to human applications

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.270 
from lab bench so to human applications
our<00:00:43.269> discovery<00:00:43.929> of<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.320> new<00:00:44.469> green<00:00:44.739> fluorescent

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
our discovery of a new green fluorescent

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.479 
our discovery of a new green fluorescent
protein<00:00:45.309> came<00:00:45.969> from<00:00:46.269> an<00:00:46.629> expected<00:00:47.489> sebacean

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
protein came from an expected sebacean

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.430 
protein came from an expected sebacean
and<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:50.410> as<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.309> know<00:00:51.429> una<00:00:51.879> una<00:00:52.059> una<00:00:52.390> de<00:00:52.839> ros<00:00:53.170> a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
and so as you know una una una de ros a

and so as you know una una una de ros a
part<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.010> Japanese<00:00:54.249> cuisine<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.769> previous

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
part of Japanese cuisine and a previous

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.040 
part of Japanese cuisine and a previous
observation<00:00:57.519> showed<00:00:57.940> that<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.660> de<00:00:58.809> Vil

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
observation showed that the de Vil

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.099 
observation showed that the de Vil
fluorescent<00:00:59.589> Maria<00:01:00.460> property<00:01:00.940> in<00:01:01.059> nature<00:01:01.359> so

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
fluorescent Maria property in nature so

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.979 
fluorescent Maria property in nature so
we<00:01:02.260> cloned<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.679> gene<00:01:02.859> and<00:01:03.190> so<00:01:04.150> we<00:01:04.629> named<00:01:04.870> the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
we cloned the gene and so we named the

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.730 
we cloned the gene and so we named the
protein<00:01:05.440> unity<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:07.630> unagi<00:01:08.260> green

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
protein unity for unagi green

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.400 
protein unity for unagi green
fluorescence<00:01:09.370> but<00:01:10.240> we<00:01:10.750> couldn't<00:01:11.140> see<00:01:11.380> it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
fluorescence but we couldn't see it

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.030 
fluorescence but we couldn't see it
natural<00:01:12.100> fluorescence<00:01:12.670> until<00:01:13.480> we<00:01:13.690> put<00:01:14.040> so

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
natural fluorescence until we put so

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.900 
natural fluorescence until we put so

so energy so needed be activated by a

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.270 
so energy so needed be activated by a
compound<00:01:22.060> so<00:01:22.750> we<00:01:22.900> searched<00:01:23.320> for<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.830> mystery

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
compound so we searched for that mystery

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.940 
compound so we searched for that mystery
compound<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:25.090> discovered<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.590> was<00:01:26.800> the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
compound and discovered so it was the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.010 
compound and discovered so it was the

structure of energy and the found that

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.790 
structure of energy and the found that
the<00:01:53.950> protein<00:01:54.340> had<00:01:54.580> unique<00:01:55.240> pocket<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.230> bound

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
the protein had unique pocket and bound

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.270 
the protein had unique pocket and bound
bilirubin<00:01:57.490> very<00:01:58.390> tightly<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:59.170> we<00:02:00.040> also

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
bilirubin very tightly and we also

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.240 
bilirubin very tightly and we also
showed<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.180> protein<00:02:01.540> is<00:02:01.830> present<00:02:02.830> in

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
showed so the protein is present in

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.230 
showed so the protein is present in
muscle<00:02:04.180> cells<00:02:04.690> in<00:02:04.990> us<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:06.670> suspect

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
muscle cells in us and so we suspect

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.169 
muscle cells in us and so we suspect
that<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.690> interaction<00:02:08.379> so<00:02:08.769> may<00:02:08.950> help<00:02:09.220> use<00:02:09.550> so

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
that the interaction so may help use so

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.540 
that the interaction so may help use so
to<00:02:10.210> control<00:02:10.690> their<00:02:10.929> muscle<00:02:11.530> recovery<00:02:11.800> from

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
to control their muscle recovery from

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.400 
to control their muscle recovery from

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
long distance migrations

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.470 
long distance migrations
and<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:15.130> found<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.970> unity<00:02:16.330> like

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
and we found that the unity like

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.570 
and we found that the unity like

we<00:02:27.730> hope<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.450> energy<00:02:28.930> proteins<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.620> can<00:02:29.890> help

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
we hope so energy proteins can can help

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.840 
we hope so energy proteins can can help
us<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.730> preserve<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.810> they're<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.800> eager<00:02:33.460> Osaka

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
us to preserve so they're so eager Osaka

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.840 
us to preserve so they're so eager Osaka
survival<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.290> most<00:02:35.500> importantly<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.670> we

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
survival so the most importantly so we

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.960 
survival so the most importantly so we
used<00:02:37.090> energy<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.320> create<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:38.920> new<00:02:39.010> asset<00:02:39.640> for

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
used energy so to create a new asset for

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.140 
used energy so to create a new asset for
bilirubin<00:02:40.480> from<00:02:41.050> him<00:02:41.500> Brad<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:43.000> we

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
bilirubin from him Brad and that we

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.430 
bilirubin from him Brad and that we
believe<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:44.260> their<00:02:44.410> system<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.790> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
believe that their system is going to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.110 
believe that their system is going to
liberalize<00:02:47.440> so<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.220> clinical<00:02:48.640> measurement

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
liberalize so the clinical measurement

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.020 
liberalize so the clinical measurement
of<00:02:49.270> bilirubin<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:50.050> hospitals<00:02:50.920> worldwide<00:02:51.430> and

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
of bilirubin in hospitals worldwide and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.820 
of bilirubin in hospitals worldwide and
they<00:02:52.660> lead<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.320> a<00:02:53.350> better<00:02:53.740> understanding

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
they lead it to a better understanding

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.360 
they lead it to a better understanding
of<00:02:54.780> blood<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.020> liver<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.350> in<00:02:56.560> trouble<00:02:56.950> ISM<00:02:57.190> in

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
of blood and liver and in trouble ISM in

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.390 
of blood and liver and in trouble ISM in
humans<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.210> in<00:02:58.990> treatment<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.710> diseases

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
humans and in treatment of the diseases

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.830 
humans and in treatment of the diseases
like<00:03:01.200> connectors<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.560> their<00:03:03.100> jaundice<00:03:03.840> so

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
like connectors and their jaundice so

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.170 
like connectors and their jaundice so
before<00:03:05.170> our<00:03:05.200> discovery<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:05.920> energy<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.850> I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
before our discovery of energy so I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.910 
before our discovery of energy so I
couldn't<00:03:07.540> imagine<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> basic

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
couldn't imagine so that the basic

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130 
couldn't imagine so that the basic
science<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:10.060> could<00:03:10.300> have<00:03:10.420> such<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> direct

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
science so could have such a direct

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.070 
science so could have such a direct
impact<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:11.920> human<00:03:12.310> health<00:03:12.390> but<00:03:13.390> just<00:03:13.780> from<00:03:14.050> a

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
impact on human health but just from a

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.390 
impact on human health but just from a
simple<00:03:14.440> ear

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
simple ear

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.470 
simple ear
we<00:03:15.700> found<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.210> new<00:03:16.360> path<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.050> clinic
