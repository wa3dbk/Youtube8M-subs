so<00:00:00.240> on<00:00:00.329> the<00:00:00.420> south<00:00:00.570> side<00:00:00.750> of<00:00:00.870> Chicago<00:00:01.260> we<00:00:01.410> found

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
so on the south side of Chicago we found

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.409 
so on the south side of Chicago we found
a<00:00:01.800> former<00:00:02.129> meatpacking<00:00:02.700> warehouse<00:00:03.090> that<00:00:03.360> has

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
a former meatpacking warehouse that has

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.059 
a former meatpacking warehouse that has
been<00:00:03.780> repurposed<00:00:03.990> what's<00:00:04.740> it<00:00:04.830> called<00:00:04.950> again

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
been repurposed what's it called again

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.320 
been repurposed what's it called again
you're<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.819> plant

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
you're in the plant

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.970 
you're in the plant
oh<00:00:06.359> yes<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.990> plant<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.440> they've<00:00:07.560> set<00:00:07.740> out<00:00:07.770> to

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
oh yes the plant and they've set out to

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.680 
oh yes the plant and they've set out to
prove<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.280> few<00:00:08.429> concepts<00:00:08.940> first<00:00:09.269> off<00:00:09.480> that

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
prove a few concepts first off that

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.540 
prove a few concepts first off that
we're<00:00:09.809> surrounded<00:00:10.080> by<00:00:10.290> waste<00:00:10.590> John<00:00:11.219> there's

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
we're surrounded by waste John there's

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.400 
we're surrounded by waste John there's
no<00:00:11.670> such<00:00:11.880> thing<00:00:12.090> as<00:00:12.120> waste<00:00:12.450> right<00:00:12.870> good<00:00:13.080> there

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
no such thing as waste right good there

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.460 
no such thing as waste right good there
actually<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.219> no<00:00:14.250> such<00:00:14.670> thing<00:00:14.969> as<00:00:15.000> waste

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
actually is no such thing as waste

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.019 
actually is no such thing as waste
everywhere<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.650> look<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> wasteful

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
everywhere we look this is a wasteful

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.179 
everywhere we look this is a wasteful
Society<00:00:18.210> people<00:00:19.170> put<00:00:19.320> things<00:00:19.439> down<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.710> hole<00:00:19.949> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
Society people put things down a hole it

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.920 
Society people put things down a hole it
disappears<00:00:20.699> they<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.000> no<00:00:21.150> idea<00:00:21.449> where<00:00:21.810> it

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
disappears they have no idea where it

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.540 
disappears they have no idea where it
goes<00:00:22.080> they<00:00:22.350> don't<00:00:22.529> care<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.130> fact<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
goes they don't care the fact of the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.920 
goes they don't care the fact of the
matter<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.060> material<00:00:24.810> that's

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
matter is that that material that's

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.390 
matter is that that material that's
going<00:00:25.199> down<00:00:25.350> those<00:00:25.500> holes<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.949> actually<00:00:26.220> quite

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
going down those holes is actually quite

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.670 
going down those holes is actually quite
valuable<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.210> if<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.930> figure<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> way

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
valuable and if you can figure out a way

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.550 
valuable and if you can figure out a way
to<00:00:28.710> harness<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:30.300> something<00:00:31.080> else<00:00:31.289> for

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
to harness it for something else for

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.260 
to harness it for something else for
making<00:00:31.830> energy<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.369> instance<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.969> as

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
making energy for instance or as

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.049 
making energy for instance or as
material<00:00:33.870> inputs<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.500> other<00:00:34.680> processes<00:00:35.059> then

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
material inputs to other processes then

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.060 
material inputs to other processes then
you're<00:00:36.570> way<00:00:36.719> ahead<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> plant<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.890> about

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you're way ahead the plant is about

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.740 
you're way ahead the plant is about
closing<00:00:44.309> loops<00:00:44.579> taking<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> output<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.570> one

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
closing loops taking the output of one

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
closing loops taking the output of one
process<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.379> making<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> input<00:00:47.100> of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
process and making it the input of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.670 
process and making it the input of
another<00:00:47.910> process<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.899> any<00:00:49.170> system<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
another process so any system of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
another process so any system of
production<00:00:49.860> has<00:00:50.160> inputs<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.690> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
production has inputs and then what you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
production has inputs and then what you
get<00:00:51.930> from<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.440> outputs<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> form<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
get from that are outputs in the form of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100 
get from that are outputs in the form of
whatever<00:00:53.940> you're<00:00:54.210> creating<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:54.930> any

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
whatever you're creating and then any

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.529 
whatever you're creating and then any
waste<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.430> mean<00:00:56.610> by<00:00:56.670> turning<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
waste so what we mean by turning that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.420 
waste so what we mean by turning that
into<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.840> loop<00:00:58.199> instead<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> linear<00:00:59.219> system

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
into a loop instead of a linear system

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.410 
into a loop instead of a linear system
is<00:00:59.969> somehow<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.899> waste<00:01:01.379> becomes<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.520> benefit

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
is somehow that waste becomes a benefit

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
is somehow that waste becomes a benefit
or<00:01:03.570> an<00:01:03.690> input<00:01:04.049> into<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.070> same<00:01:05.280> system<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
or an input into the same system of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.160 
or an input into the same system of
production<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.390> another<00:01:06.659> system<00:01:06.900> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
production or another system of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
production or another system of
production<00:01:07.409> well<00:01:07.880> Abby<00:01:08.880> could<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.090> show<00:01:09.330> us

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
production well Abby could you show us

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.210 
production well Abby could you show us
around<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.840> plant<00:01:10.049> yeah<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.860> our

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
around the plant yeah so this is our

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.350 
around the plant yeah so this is our
lobby<00:01:12.060> space<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.470> currently<00:01:14.119> running<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
lobby space we are currently running a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.850 
lobby space we are currently running a
Kickstarter<00:01:15.600> campaign<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.530> sort<00:01:16.799> of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
Kickstarter campaign to sort of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.859 
Kickstarter campaign to sort of
transform<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.729> area<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> area

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
transform this area and then the area

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.660 
transform this area and then the area
right<00:01:19.049> next<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.130> permanent

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
right next to this we have permanent

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.219 
right next to this we have permanent
tenants<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.210> operate<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> building<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
tenants that operate in the building and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.990 
tenants that operate in the building and
those<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.439> all<00:01:22.560> food<00:01:22.860> producing<00:01:23.430> businesses

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
those are all food producing businesses

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
those are all food producing businesses
so<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:25.409> sell<00:01:25.590> their

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
so right now when they sell their

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
so right now when they sell their
products<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> has<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> happen<00:01:26.640> off-site<00:01:27.150> for

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
products that has to happen off-site for

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.380 
products that has to happen off-site for
the<00:01:27.420> most<00:01:27.600> part<00:01:27.950> once<00:01:28.950> our<00:01:29.280> lobby<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.820> retail

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the most part once our lobby and retail

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.649 
the most part once our lobby and retail
space<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.810> ready<00:01:31.460> they'll<00:01:32.460> be<00:01:32.579> able<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> sell

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
space is ready they'll be able to sell

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.770 
space is ready they'll be able to sell
those<00:01:33.780> products<00:01:34.229> on-site<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.549> oh<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.390> smells

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
those products on-site here oh it smells

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.120 
those products on-site here oh it smells
yeah<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:38.850> smells<00:01:39.270> bad<00:01:39.570> yeah<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.799> are<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> lot

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
yeah it smells bad yeah there are a lot

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.120 
yeah it smells bad yeah there are a lot
of<00:01:41.159> different<00:01:41.610> smells<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.390> yeah<00:01:43.130> well

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
of different smells in here yeah well

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.120 
of different smells in here yeah well
we'll<00:01:44.250> probably<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.939> with<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.649> use<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.920> lot

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
we'll probably do with it is use a lot

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.910 
we'll probably do with it is use a lot
of<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> space<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.750> mushroom<00:01:48.750> growing<00:01:48.990> okay

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
of the space for mushroom growing okay

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.590 
of the space for mushroom growing okay
so<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.670> our<00:01:50.759> mushroom<00:01:51.180> fruiting

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
so we have one of our mushroom fruiting

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.230 
so we have one of our mushroom fruiting
rooms<00:01:51.780> down

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
rooms down

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.870 
rooms down
here<00:01:52.479> okay<00:01:55.649> oh<00:01:56.649> so<00:01:57.310> you're<00:01:57.430> growing<00:01:57.520> mushrooms

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
here okay oh so you're growing mushrooms

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.420 
here okay oh so you're growing mushrooms
in<00:01:58.240> here<00:01:58.270> yeah<00:01:58.810> we<00:01:59.619> grow<00:01:59.920> mushrooms<00:02:00.070> because

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
in here yeah we grow mushrooms because

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.490 
in here yeah we grow mushrooms because
they're<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:01.090> food<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.659> we<00:02:01.810> can<00:02:01.990> grow<00:02:02.140> inside

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
they're a food that we can grow inside

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.010 
they're a food that we can grow inside
yeah<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:03.520> most<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.149> our<00:02:04.270> food<00:02:04.450> production<00:02:04.869> is

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
yeah so most of our food production is

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.510 
yeah so most of our food production is
really<00:02:05.200> focused<00:02:05.649> on<00:02:05.770> what<00:02:05.979> we<00:02:06.070> can<00:02:06.100> grow<00:02:06.340> in

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
really focused on what we can grow in

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.339 
really focused on what we can grow in
the<00:02:06.640> building<00:02:07.000> Ryan<00:02:07.630> just<00:02:07.780> get<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:07.960> few<00:02:08.110> brief

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
the building Ryan just get a few brief

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.630 
the building Ryan just get a few brief
shots<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:08.920> get<00:02:09.099> out<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.489> room

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
shots and then get out of the room

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.970 
shots and then get out of the room
probably<00:02:10.119> all<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.750> these<00:02:10.929> are<00:02:11.200> our<00:02:11.590> big

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
probably all that these are our big

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.009 
probably all that these are our big
plastic<00:02:12.790> bags<00:02:13.000> filled<00:02:13.390> with<00:02:13.480> pasteurized

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
plastic bags filled with pasteurized

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.130 
plastic bags filled with pasteurized
straw<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.920> then<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:15.760> mix<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.630> our<00:02:16.720> mushroom

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
straw and then we mix in our mushroom

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.309 
straw and then we mix in our mushroom
spun<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.269> poke<00:02:19.269> holes<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.690> plastic<00:02:20.110> and

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
spun and poke holes in the plastic and

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.020 
spun and poke holes in the plastic and
then<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.920> mushrooms<00:02:21.250> will<00:02:21.489> grow<00:02:21.700> out<00:02:21.910> of

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
then the mushrooms will grow out of

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.089 
then the mushrooms will grow out of
those<00:02:22.150> holes<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.630> bag<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.500> another<00:02:23.860> cool

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
those holes in the bag so another cool

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.699 
those holes in the bag so another cool
thing<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.670> room<00:02:25.350> part<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.500> reason

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
thing is that room part of the reason

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.550 
thing is that room part of the reason
that<00:02:26.739> it's<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.130> moist<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.239> humid<00:02:28.959> in<00:02:29.170> there<00:02:29.350> is

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
that it's so moist and humid in there is

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.780 
that it's so moist and humid in there is
because<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:29.950> heat<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.310> water<00:02:30.459> in<00:02:30.610> our

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
because we heat the water in our

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.120 
because we heat the water in our
aquaponic<00:02:31.420> system<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.830> warm

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
aquaponic system and then that warm

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.910 
aquaponic system and then that warm
humid<00:02:33.610> air<00:02:33.790> gets<00:02:34.780> directly<00:02:35.170> vented<00:02:35.590> from<00:02:35.799> in

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
humid air gets directly vented from in

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:45.370 
humid air gets directly vented from in
here<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.819> mushroom<00:02:37.150> room<00:02:37.390> okay

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.080 

whoa

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
whoa

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.510 
whoa
that's<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.840> bunch<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.170> plants<00:02:54.370> aquaponics<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.489> a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
that's a bunch of plants aquaponics is a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.979 
that's a bunch of plants aquaponics is a
combination<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.209> hydroponics<00:02:56.900> and

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
combination of hydroponics and

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.320 
combination of hydroponics and
aquaculture<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:58.610> what<00:02:58.790> we're<00:02:58.940> doing<00:02:58.970> is

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
aquaculture and so what we're doing is

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.380 
aquaculture and so what we're doing is
we're<00:02:59.510> using<00:02:59.770> the<00:03:00.770> waste<00:03:00.950> from<00:03:01.250> fish<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:02.239> feed

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
we're using the waste from fish to feed

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.180 
we're using the waste from fish to feed
our<00:03:02.569> plants<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.140> feed<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.560> fish<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:04.069> fish

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
our plants so you feed the fish to fish

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.040 
our plants so you feed the fish to fish
feed<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.519> plants<00:03:04.849> so<00:03:05.209> over<00:03:05.480> there<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.870> have

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
feed the plants so over there you have

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.850 
feed the plants so over there you have
bins<00:03:06.620> full<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.400> tilapia<00:03:08.090> yes<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.500> over<00:03:09.709> here

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
bins full of tilapia yes and over here

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.690 
bins full of tilapia yes and over here
you<00:03:09.950> have<00:03:09.980> plants<00:03:10.340> how<00:03:10.430> do<00:03:10.489> they<00:03:10.640> work

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
you have plants how do they work

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.320 
you have plants how do they work
together<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.930> our<00:03:12.349> fish<00:03:12.680> are<00:03:13.099> in<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.819> far<00:03:14.090> row

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
together so our fish are in the far row

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.949 
together so our fish are in the far row
of<00:03:14.480> Tanks<00:03:14.900> yeah<00:03:15.349> and<00:03:15.590> then<00:03:15.739> they<00:03:15.950> poop<00:03:16.370> they

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
of Tanks yeah and then they poop they

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.130 
of Tanks yeah and then they poop they
create<00:03:17.959> waste<00:03:18.489> kiss<00:03:19.489> yeah<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.720> could<00:03:20.870> live<00:03:21.019> in

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
create waste kiss yeah you could live in

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.170 
create waste kiss yeah you could live in
there<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.500> don't<00:03:22.040> really<00:03:22.430> want<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.640> do<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:22.880> and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
there I don't really want to do that and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.729 
there I don't really want to do that and
then<00:03:23.299> their<00:03:23.510> weights<00:03:23.750> goes<00:03:24.019> into<00:03:24.410> one<00:03:24.709> of

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
then their weights goes into one of

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.410 
then their weights goes into one of
these<00:03:24.890> tanks<00:03:25.190> on<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.400> end<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:25.880> that's<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.120> solid

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
these tanks on the end so that's a solid

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.690 
these tanks on the end so that's a solid
settling<00:03:26.810> tank<00:03:27.019> yeah<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.709> all<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.430> happens

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
settling tank yeah and all that happens

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.820 
settling tank yeah and all that happens
in<00:03:28.850> there<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.299> solid<00:03:29.750> fish<00:03:30.019> waste<00:03:30.260> settles

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
in there is the solid fish waste settles

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.559 
in there is the solid fish waste settles
to<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.010> bottom<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.489> tank<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.970> then<00:03:32.480> we

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
to the bottom of the tank and then we

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.089 
to the bottom of the tank and then we
can<00:03:32.720> suck<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.170> out<00:03:33.349> and<00:03:33.560> use<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.799> as

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
can suck that out and use it as

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.550 
can suck that out and use it as
fertilizer<00:03:34.400> for<00:03:34.819> our<00:03:35.060> outdoor<00:03:35.209> farm<00:03:35.599> so<00:03:36.440> then

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
fertilizer for our outdoor farm so then

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.559 
fertilizer for our outdoor farm so then
what's<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:36.890> left<00:03:37.099> is<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.880> mixture<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.239> ammonia

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
what's the left is a mixture of ammonia

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.020 
what's the left is a mixture of ammonia
and<00:03:38.810> water<00:03:39.340> biofilter<00:03:40.340> tank<00:03:40.549> has<00:03:40.760> two

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
and water biofilter tank has two

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.210 
and water biofilter tank has two
different<00:03:41.330> kinds<00:03:41.569> of<00:03:41.630> bacteria<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.470> break

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
different kinds of bacteria that break

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.100 
different kinds of bacteria that break
the<00:03:43.370> ammonia<00:03:43.670> down<00:03:43.910> into<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.630> nitrogen<00:03:45.080> that

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
the ammonia down into the nitrogen that

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.500 
the ammonia down into the nitrogen that
we<00:03:45.290> need<00:03:45.440> for<00:03:45.650> our<00:03:45.739> plants<00:03:45.980> so<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:46.970> plants<00:03:47.360> are

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
we need for our plants so the plants are

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.449 
we need for our plants so the plants are
sitting<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:47.930> these<00:03:48.049> foam<00:03:48.349> rafts<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.040> their

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
sitting in these foam rafts and their

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.099 
sitting in these foam rafts and their
roots<00:03:49.640> just<00:03:49.849> hang<00:03:50.090> down<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.510> water<00:03:50.720> and

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
roots just hang down in the water and

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.580 
roots just hang down in the water and
then<00:03:51.859> what<00:03:52.280> they<00:03:52.459> do<00:03:52.519> is<00:03:52.700> they<00:03:53.660> absorb<00:03:54.290> the

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
then what they do is they absorb the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.490 
then what they do is they absorb the
nitrogen<00:03:55.070> out<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.430> water<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:56.230> in<00:03:57.230> doing

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
nitrogen out of the water and in doing

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.840 
nitrogen out of the water and in doing
that<00:03:57.620> they're<00:03:57.890> cleaning<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.310> water<00:03:58.519> for<00:03:58.790> the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
that they're cleaning the water for the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.460 
that they're cleaning the water for the
fish<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.420> then<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.810> water<00:03:59.900> goes<00:04:00.170> right<00:04:00.200> back

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
fish so then the water goes right back

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.720 
fish so then the water goes right back
to<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.739> fish<00:04:00.890> tanks<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.430> whole<00:04:01.519> thing

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
to the fish tanks and the whole thing

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.039 
to the fish tanks and the whole thing
starts<00:04:02.030> over<00:04:02.120> Wow

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
starts over Wow

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.780 
starts over Wow
so<00:04:03.350> we<00:04:03.470> get<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.739> nutrients<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.190> we<00:04:04.400> need<00:04:04.549> for

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
so we get the nutrients that we need for

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.150 
so we get the nutrients that we need for
our<00:04:04.850> plants<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.620> we're<00:04:06.620> also<00:04:06.769> sort<00:04:07.100> of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
our plants and we're also sort of

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.020 
our plants and we're also sort of
cleaning<00:04:07.519> our<00:04:07.640> fish<00:04:07.850> tanks<00:04:08.150> at<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.329> same<00:04:08.540> time

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
cleaning our fish tanks at the same time

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.680 
cleaning our fish tanks at the same time
that's<00:04:09.210> awesome<00:04:10.050> good<00:04:10.260> work<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.910> one<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
that's awesome good work so one of the

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.150 
that's awesome good work so one of the
permanent<00:04:12.900> tenants<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.590> we're<00:04:13.740> gonna<00:04:13.830> have

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
permanent tenants that we're gonna have

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.490 
permanent tenants that we're gonna have
is<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.570> brewery<00:04:16.100> cool<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.459> like<00:04:17.850> beer<00:04:18.090> yes<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:19.440> you

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
is a brewery cool I like beer yes so you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.800 
is a brewery cool I like beer yes so you
chose<00:04:19.769> beer<00:04:20.220> because<00:04:20.519> because<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.120> generates

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
chose beer because because it generates

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.420 
chose beer because because it generates
a<00:04:21.870> lot<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:22.019> waste

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
a lot of waste

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.610 
a lot of waste
so<00:04:23.430> our<00:04:23.880> renewable<00:04:24.300> energy<00:04:24.660> systems<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.200> the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
so our renewable energy systems of the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.130 
so our renewable energy systems of the
primary<00:04:26.070> machine<00:04:26.510> part<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:27.960> an

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
primary machine part of that is an

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.500 
primary machine part of that is an
anaerobic<00:04:28.380> digester<00:04:28.610> it's<00:04:29.610> basically<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.090> a

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
anaerobic digester it's basically just a

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.630 
anaerobic digester it's basically just a
big<00:04:30.660> composter<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.950> does<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.310> same<00:04:32.460> thing

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
big composter it does the same thing

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.190 
big composter it does the same thing
that<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:32.790> compost<00:04:33.150> pile<00:04:33.360> outside<00:04:33.510> would<00:04:33.930> do<00:04:34.050> it

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
that a compost pile outside would do it

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.960 
that a compost pile outside would do it
just<00:04:34.350> does<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.680> an<00:04:34.800> anaerobic<00:04:35.190> environment

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
just does it in an anaerobic environment

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.390 
just does it in an anaerobic environment
so<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.390> digester<00:04:36.900> will<00:04:37.080> consume<00:04:37.500> 30<00:04:37.920> tons<00:04:38.250> a

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
so the digester will consume 30 tons a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.980 
so the digester will consume 30 tons a
day<00:04:38.550> every<00:04:38.910> day<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.090> food<00:04:39.540> waste<00:04:39.750> from

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
day every day of food waste from

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.200 
day every day of food waste from
neighboring<00:04:40.380> food<00:04:40.560> industries<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.880> fat

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
neighboring food industries like the fat

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.380

buildings<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.250> field<00:04:47.490> museum<00:04:47.640> is<00:04:48.090> actually

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
buildings the field museum is actually

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.520 
buildings the field museum is actually
going<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.630> be<00:04:48.690> sending<00:04:48.930> all<00:04:49.110> of<00:04:49.260> their<00:04:49.380> food

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
going to be sending all of their food

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.990 
going to be sending all of their food
waste<00:04:49.800> here<00:04:50.010> so<00:04:50.160> there<00:04:50.280> are<00:04:50.370> bacteria<00:04:50.520> in

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
waste here so there are bacteria in

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.400 
waste here so there are bacteria in
there<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.419> break<00:04:51.660> down<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.930> food<00:04:52.169> waste

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
there that break down the food waste

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.950 
there that break down the food waste
into<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.919> solid<00:04:53.430> a<00:04:53.550> liquid<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.060> gas<00:04:54.090> the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
into a solid a liquid and a gas the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.200 
into a solid a liquid and a gas the
solid<00:04:55.380> digested<00:04:55.980> or<00:04:56.100> pressed<00:04:56.520> cake<00:04:56.730> will<00:04:57.060> get

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
solid digested or pressed cake will get

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.880 
solid digested or pressed cake will get
sold<00:04:57.450> off<00:04:57.630> as<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.870> soil<00:04:58.140> amendment<00:04:58.350> we<00:04:58.740> have<00:04:58.860> a

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
sold off as a soil amendment we have a

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.860 
sold off as a soil amendment we have a
buyer<00:04:59.130> lined<00:04:59.430> up<00:04:59.610> for<00:04:59.760> every<00:05:00.000> bit<00:05:00.150> of<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.390> we

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
buyer lined up for every bit of that we

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.270 
buyer lined up for every bit of that we
build<00:05:01.050> up<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.290> liquid<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.830> we'll<00:05:01.980> sell<00:05:02.250> it

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
build up the liquid and we'll sell it

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.450 
build up the liquid and we'll sell it
off<00:05:02.720> also<00:05:03.720> as<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:03.870> fertilizer<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:05.070> gas<00:05:05.220> it's

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
off also as a fertilizer the gas it's

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.360 
off also as a fertilizer the gas it's
called<00:05:05.669> biogas<00:05:06.380> so<00:05:07.380> that's<00:05:07.530> what<00:05:07.650> we<00:05:07.770> get<00:05:07.919> from

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
called biogas so that's what we get from

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.159 
called biogas so that's what we get from
that<00:05:08.400> food<00:05:08.730> waste<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.270> it<00:05:09.419> goes<00:05:09.600> into<00:05:09.930> our

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
that food waste and it goes into our

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.650 
that food waste and it goes into our
turbine<00:05:10.860> generator<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:12.000> that's<00:05:12.210> gonna<00:05:12.419> be<00:05:12.570> an

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
turbine generator and that's gonna be an

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.050 
turbine generator and that's gonna be an
engine<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.020> burns<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.680> biogas<00:05:14.190> it's

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
engine that burns the biogas it's

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.530 
engine that burns the biogas it's
tremendously<00:05:15.600> efficient<00:05:16.200> about<00:05:17.540> 40%

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
tremendously efficient about 40%

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.590 
tremendously efficient about 40%
electrical<00:05:19.020> efficiency<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:19.830> 51%<00:05:20.790> thermal

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
electrical efficiency and 51% thermal

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.030 
electrical efficiency and 51% thermal
efficiency<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:22.320> we're<00:05:22.440> actually<00:05:22.590> going<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:22.919> be

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
efficiency so we're actually going to be

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.190

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
energy in that biogas which is pretty

energy in that biogas which is pretty
unheard<00:05:27.630> of<00:05:27.750> that's<00:05:27.960> amazing<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:29.280> consuming

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.690 
unheard of that's amazing and consuming
that<00:05:30.270> energy<00:05:30.660> so<00:05:31.200> on-site<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:32.010> run<00:05:32.190> all<00:05:32.400> of<00:05:32.430> the

that<00:05:45.620> so<00:05:46.620> I've<00:05:46.770> been<00:05:46.800> looking<00:05:47.160> for<00:05:47.610> ways<00:05:47.760> to

something productive something where you

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.940 
something productive something where you
