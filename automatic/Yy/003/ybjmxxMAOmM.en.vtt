with the overall build quality of these

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.179 
with the overall build quality of these
headphones<00:01:54.780> they're<00:01:55.290> very<00:01:55.500> cheap<00:01:55.799> feeling

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
headphones they're very cheap feeling

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.010 
headphones they're very cheap feeling
they're<00:01:56.369> very<00:01:56.520> flexible<00:01:57.119> however<00:01:57.659> they're

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
they're very flexible however they're

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.080 
they're very flexible however they're
very<00:01:58.200> durable<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> same<00:01:59.100> time<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
very durable at the same time but that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.999 
very durable at the same time but that
glossy<00:02:00.299> plastic<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> fingerprint<00:02:01.799> magnet

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
glossy plastic is a fingerprint magnet

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.530 
glossy plastic is a fingerprint magnet
so<00:02:02.460> whenever<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> touch<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.210> you're<00:02:03.329> going<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
so whenever you touch it you're going to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.999 
so whenever you touch it you're going to
see<00:02:03.659> fingerprints<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> earbuds

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
see fingerprints so the earbuds

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.560 
see fingerprints so the earbuds
themselves<00:02:05.159> actually<00:02:05.880> attached<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
themselves actually attached to the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.839 
themselves actually attached to the
headphone<00:02:06.930> band<00:02:07.229> by<00:02:07.500> magnets<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.340> if<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> get

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
headphone band by magnets so if you get

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.160 
headphone band by magnets so if you get
it<00:02:08.940> close<00:02:09.119> enough<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.509> kind<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.899> clips

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
it close enough it kind of just clips

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.990 
it close enough it kind of just clips
itself<00:02:10.560> into<00:02:10.950> place<00:02:11.190> which<00:02:11.489> works<00:02:11.730> pretty

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
itself into place which works pretty

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.670 
itself into place which works pretty
good<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.629> most<00:02:12.660> part<00:02:13.110> however

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
good for the most part however

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.110 
good for the most part however
the<00:02:13.769> magnet<00:02:14.099> doesn't<00:02:14.430> work<00:02:14.549> it<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.909> be

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the magnet doesn't work it can be

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.910 
the magnet doesn't work it can be
frustrating<00:02:15.390> those<00:02:16.049> little<00:02:16.170> attachments<00:02:16.769> on

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
frustrating those little attachments on

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
frustrating those little attachments on
each<00:02:17.189> side<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.640> headphone<00:02:18.000> band<00:02:18.269> allowing

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
each side of the headphone band allowing

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.660 
each side of the headphone band allowing
for<00:02:19.019> adjustment<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.859> cable<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.489> if

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
for adjustment of the cable so if

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.190 
for adjustment of the cable so if
there's<00:02:20.849> not<00:02:21.000> enough<00:02:21.269> slack<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.719> can<00:02:21.870> adjust

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
there's not enough slack you can adjust

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.750 
there's not enough slack you can adjust
it<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.409> make<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.590> looser<00:02:22.890> or<00:02:23.099> if<00:02:23.430> there's<00:02:23.640> too

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it and make it looser or if there's too

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.160 
it and make it looser or if there's too

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
much slack you can adjust it and make it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.050 
much slack you can adjust it and make it
tighter<00:02:25.469> depending<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.129> your<00:02:26.310> liking<00:02:26.760> even

on the market it serves its purpose a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.759
