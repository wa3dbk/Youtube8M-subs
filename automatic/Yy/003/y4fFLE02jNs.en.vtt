don't don't sound so - with that it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.330 
don't don't sound so - with that it's
not<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> work<00:01:00.180> let's<00:01:00.870> take<00:01:01.230> our<00:01:01.500> sugar

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
not going to work let's take our sugar

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.280 
not going to work let's take our sugar
and<00:01:02.519> water<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.329> put<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> saucepan

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and water and put it in a saucepan

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.600 
and water and put it in a saucepan
because<00:01:04.920> we're<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.160> to<00:01:05.220> cook<00:01:05.430> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
because we're going to cook this

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
because we're going to cook this
together<00:01:06.000> long<00:01:06.330> enough<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:07.050> for<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.410> sugar

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
together long enough just for the sugar

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.160 
together long enough just for the sugar
to<00:01:07.860> dissolve<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:09.030> basically<00:01:09.570> makes<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
to dissolve and that basically makes a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.320 
to dissolve and that basically makes a
simple<00:01:10.590> syrup<00:01:10.800> because<00:01:11.460> that's<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> be

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
simple syrup because that's going to be

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.230 
simple syrup because that's going to be
the<00:01:12.420> sweetener<00:01:12.810> now<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.400> don't<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the sweetener now we don't want this to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.870 
the sweetener now we don't want this to
go<00:01:15.360> too<00:01:15.420> far<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.870> turn<00:01:16.350> into<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.880> caramel

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
go too far and turn into a caramel

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.610 
go too far and turn into a caramel
because<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.240> becomes<00:01:18.570> rock-hard<00:01:19.110> so

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
because it just becomes rock-hard so

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.500 
because it just becomes rock-hard so
keep<00:01:19.770> an<00:01:19.890> eye<00:01:20.010> on<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.400> make<00:01:20.760> sure<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.210> sugars

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
keep an eye on it make sure the sugars

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.210 
keep an eye on it make sure the sugars
dissolved<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.230> turn<00:01:22.410> it<00:01:22.440> off<00:01:22.650> what

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
dissolved and then you turn it off what

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.220 
dissolved and then you turn it off what
I've<00:01:23.340> got<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:24.120> here<00:01:24.480> is<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> guessed<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
I've got going on here is I guessed it

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.050 
I've got going on here is I guessed it
two<00:01:25.470> lemons<00:01:25.920> only<00:01:26.160> because<00:01:26.550> I'm<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.940> to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.310 
juice all of them but I needed the zest
from<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:29.670> lemons<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.630> wanted<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.080> get<00:01:31.230> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
from two lemons so I wanted to get the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.890 
from two lemons so I wanted to get the
job<00:01:31.530> done<00:01:31.560> ahead<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.160> time<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.750> are

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
job done ahead of time but these are

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480

small lemons so I'm actually going to
zest<00:01:35.640> three<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.240> them<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.660> I'm<00:01:36.750> looking
