00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.340
 hello everyone let's explain in this 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.799
 day what we have the model of the 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.080
 fluid mosaic of a re-provision of 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.450
 the plasma sister we go with a 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.689
 little bit of history the mosaic model 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.610
 fluid is a model presented in 1972 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.620
 by sj singer and garmin course 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.540
 all the components of the membrane 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.820
 phospholipids and proteins are 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.100
 arranged and organized in the manner of 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.200
 a mosaic that is a mosaic a mosaic 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.560
 is that which is made up of different 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 elements both the solid and the 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.180
 whole proteins and groups 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.610
 proteins are molecules have cited the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.710
 sympathetic term refers to that 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.320
 this fluid mosaic model has the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.790
 ability to have two behaviors 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.710
 one hydrophobic and one hydro- clinical are 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.329
 molecules with double behavior in 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.550
 relation to hydro lytic water 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.680
 hydrophobic it was found that the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.750
 whole proteins or caries of the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.060
 membranes just like he used them lipids 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.020
 present in hydrophobic regions and 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.539
 hydrophilic regions 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.490
 Whole proteins are those that 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.219
 they cross the membrane and appear in both 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.159
 sides of the phospholipid layer the 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.210
 most of these proteins are 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.590
 glycoproteins proteins that have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.240
 united one several several ways 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.250
 monosaccharides the carbohydrate part 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.610
 of the molecule is always of each 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.490
 decade outside the cell 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.660
 the physical part of the bank that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.580
 stands out about the husband these 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.920
 politicians while the region 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.890
 hydrophobic remains on the inner side 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.020
 sea phospholipid 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.390
 these unfriendly molecules form 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.270
 Liquid crystalline aggregates in the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.100
 ares groups which are directed 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.900
 bed and the non-polar ones are located 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.300
 within the habitat the proteins 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.130
 integral are those that stand out from 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.220
 sea ​​said sun and pi 2 this means 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.740
 that cross the sea of ​​phospholipids and 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.330
 they give him a movement of translation and 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.320
 rotating is why the membrane 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.320
 it is not static 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.140
 some whole proteins have 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.630
 attached to the internal side a small 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.240
 globular proteins called proteins 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.070
 peripherals these act as pillars or 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.950
 columns in the organization of the mosaic 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.200
 fluid the peripheral proteins do not 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.690
 they are in all the transporters but 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.790
 in adhered to something not proteins 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.770
 peripherals these do not extend to what 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.230
 width of the uvi layer but these 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.390
 are attached to the internal surface 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.370
 or external of it and they separate 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.470
 easily from the same 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.510
 some cargo adapt their shape to the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.220
 passage of substances in the form of channels 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.080
 Protein a protein channel is a 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.570
 set of proteins by which 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.360
 they transfer the substances to enter the 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.640
 leave the cell 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.400
 the fluid mosaic the plasma membrane 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.290
 is not a static structure their 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.170
 components can move what you 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.580
 provides a certain fluidity the fluency is 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.590
 one of the most characteristic 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.080
 important membrane depends on 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.150
 factors such as temperature when 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.120
 increases the temperature inside the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.100
 cell fluency langan increases the 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.110
 nature of lipids presence 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.060
 of unsaturated lipids and chain 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.880
 short favor the increase of vines 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.980
 the presence of cholesterol and hardens 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.350
 the membranes reducing their fluidity and 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.480
 permeability providing stability 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.670
 with the data offered by the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.130
 electron microscopy and analyzes 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.200
 biochemical this model has been developed 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.140
 of the membrane characteristics of 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.690
 fluid mosaic model 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.480
 the membrane is like a fluid mosaic in 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.790
 wherein the bilayer is the base or support 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.760
 the proteins are incorporated or 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.069
 associated with it interacting ones with 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.020
 others and with the lipids both 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.330
 proteins like lipids can 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.760
 move the membranes laterally 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.700
 are asymmetric structures in terms of 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.870
 the distribution of its components 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.640
 basically of the carbohydrates that 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.610
 they are only found on the outer side 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.130
 we have represented a glycoprotein with 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.380
 two wounds is because we 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.080
 we crush a syringe that 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.330
 would symbolize the passage of substances we see 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.459
 that inside the membrane 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.440
 plasma also between the substance 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.690
 later enter the cell and of 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.950
 the same way for the exit the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.160
 substance 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.590
 would push in this case the glycoprotein 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.710
 to leave the membrane and thus the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.090
 cell and this is all about the model 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.020
 of we have echoed fluid 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.020
 thank you very much for seeing us 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.310
 how
