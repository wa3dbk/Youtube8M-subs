00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.330 
die call i can know what she's talking
about<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.200> basically<00:02:40.620> there's<00:02:40.830> five<00:02:41.010> factions

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
about so basically there's five factions

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.800 
about so basically there's five factions
in<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.850> world<00:02:42.090> which<00:02:42.240> I'm<00:02:42.390> pretty<00:02:42.510> sure<00:02:42.660> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
in this world which I'm pretty sure is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.690 
in this world which I'm pretty sure is
like<00:02:43.110> old<00:02:43.320> chicago<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.160> each<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.610> them

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
like old chicago and each of them

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.400 
like old chicago and each of them
represent<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> fault<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.510> which<00:02:45.720> humanity<00:02:46.200> has

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
represent a fault to which humanity has

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.230 
represent a fault to which humanity has
so<00:02:46.830> they<00:02:46.950> have<00:02:47.130> one<00:02:47.370> that's<00:02:47.550> like<00:02:47.670> super<00:02:47.910> happy

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
so they have one that's like super happy

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.910 
so they have one that's like super happy
so<00:02:48.660> it's<00:02:48.780> kind<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:48.990> compensating<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:49.709> all<00:02:49.800> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
so it's kind of compensating for all the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.320 
so it's kind of compensating for all the
unhappy<00:02:50.400> people<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.880> were<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.150> bringing

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
unhappy people that were just bringing

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.550 
unhappy people that were just bringing
down<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.690> world<00:02:51.990> that<00:02:52.170> there's<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.410> group

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
down the world that there's a group

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.800 
down the world that there's a group
called<00:02:52.770> candor<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.520> they<00:02:53.970> are<00:02:54.300> all<00:02:54.570> about

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
called candor and they are all about

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.940 
called candor and they are all about
telling<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.140> truth<00:02:55.350> like<00:02:55.530> they<00:02:55.680> will<00:02:55.830> say

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
telling the truth like they will say

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.290 
telling the truth like they will say
whatever<00:02:56.280> they<00:02:56.459> want<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.940> your<00:02:57.060> face<00:02:57.270> and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
they have no problem doing it and that

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.710 
they have no problem doing it and that
kind<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.400> like<00:02:59.520> represents<00:03:00.000> how<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.150> lie<00:03:00.480> all

thing because it makes you question what
society<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:03.690> can<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:04.049> because<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.830> never

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
society like can be because I never

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.860 
society like can be because I never
would<00:04:05.700> have<00:04:05.730> imagined<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.360> society<00:04:06.750> where

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
would have imagined a society where

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.330 
would have imagined a society where
there<00:04:06.989> was<00:04:07.140> factions<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.860> like<00:04:07.980> different

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
there was factions and like different

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.950 
there was factions and like different
people<00:04:08.430> were<00:04:08.670> separated<00:04:09.180> into<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.600> sort

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
people were separated into that sort

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.960 
people were separated into that sort
just<00:04:10.290> because<00:04:10.500> we<00:04:10.530> don't<00:04:10.980> have<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:11.730> just

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
just because we don't have that we just

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.700 
just because we don't have that we just
have<00:04:12.180> like<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.660> free-for-all<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.200> everybody

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
have like a free-for-all and everybody

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.260 
have like a free-for-all and everybody
can<00:04:13.890> be<00:04:14.010> compassionate<00:04:14.340> they<00:04:14.700> can<00:04:14.850> be<00:04:14.970> happy

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
things so it's weird to see that they're
