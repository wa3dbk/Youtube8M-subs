one of the third installment of the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.570 
one of the third installment of the
headliner<00:00:12.889> collection<00:00:14.620> so<00:00:15.620> this<00:00:15.950> part<00:00:16.250> we're

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
headliner collection so this part we're

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.980 
headliner collection so this part we're
going<00:00:16.700> to<00:00:16.759> talk<00:00:16.910> about<00:00:16.939> the<00:00:17.390> actual<00:00:17.599> alignment

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
going to talk about the actual alignment

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.100 
going to talk about the actual alignment
the<00:00:18.470> heavens

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
the heavens

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:29.370 
the heavens
so<00:00:26.400> okay<00:00:27.400> so<00:00:27.610> the<00:00:27.779> point<00:00:28.779> I<00:00:28.930> was<00:00:29.110> we're<00:00:29.259> gonna

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
so okay so the point I was we're gonna

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.519 
so okay so the point I was we're gonna
just<00:00:29.710> actual<00:00:30.070> pencil<00:00:30.279> so<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.849> drivers<00:00:31.570> behind

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
just actual pencil so the drivers behind

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.090 
just actual pencil so the drivers behind
here<00:00:33.059> justice<00:00:34.059> true<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:34.960> in<00:00:35.200> 20<00:00:35.530> talk<00:00:35.770> wide

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
here justice true and in 20 talk wide

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.400 
here justice true and in 20 talk wide
race<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:37.090> actual<00:00:37.390> beef<00:00:37.600> the

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
race the actual beef the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.960 
race the actual beef the
counterclockwise

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:59.610 

exactly<00:00:44.970> you<00:00:45.300> know

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.479 

all<00:01:00.620> right<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:00.890> we're<00:01:01.010> at<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.160> point<00:01:01.340> now

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
all right so we're at the point now

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.939 
all right so we're at the point now
where<00:01:01.610> we're<00:01:01.879> going<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.149> fine<00:01:02.360> tune<00:01:02.390> the

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
where we're going to fine tune the

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.640 
where we're going to fine tune the
headlight<00:01:03.949> alignments<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.720> we<00:01:06.049> found<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.409> wall

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
headlight alignments so we found a wall

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.350 
headlight alignments so we found a wall
here<00:01:06.979> where<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.340> car<00:01:07.550> is<00:01:07.670> perpendicular

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
here where the car is perpendicular

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.770 
here where the car is perpendicular
against<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.170> wall<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.650> level<00:01:10.100> okay<00:01:10.820> now<00:01:11.540> it's

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
against the wall and level okay now it's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.260 
against the wall and level okay now it's
it's<00:01:12.619> very<00:01:12.650> helpful<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.250> separate<00:01:13.759> the

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
it's very helpful to separate the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.990 
it's very helpful to separate the
headlights<00:01:15.170> by<00:01:15.590> discovering<00:01:16.310> one<00:01:16.520> side<00:01:16.820> in

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
headlights by discovering one side in

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.460 
headlights by discovering one side in
this<00:01:17.090> case<00:01:17.300> I'm<00:01:17.509> covering<00:01:17.869> up<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.050> passenger

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
this case I'm covering up the passenger

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.160 
this case I'm covering up the passenger
side<00:01:18.649> we<00:01:19.399> will<00:01:19.550> see<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.820> projection<00:01:20.180> sort<00:01:21.110> of

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
side we will see the projection sort of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.530 
side we will see the projection sort of
light<00:01:21.290> up<00:01:21.470> but<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.130> just<00:01:22.700> one<00:01:22.880> projection<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
light up but of just one projection the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.749 
light up but of just one projection the
driver's<00:01:23.869> side<00:01:23.990> in<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.229> case<00:01:24.470> okay<00:01:25.190> then

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
driver's side in this case okay then

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.190 
driver's side in this case okay then
we're<00:01:25.850> going<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.030> go<00:01:26.300> back<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.690> forth<00:01:26.990> and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
we're going to go back and forth and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.200 
we're going to go back and forth and
then<00:01:27.950> what<00:01:28.070> we<00:01:28.190> see<00:01:28.220> here<00:01:28.610> now<00:01:28.790> is<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.119> the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
then what we see here now is that the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.880 
then what we see here now is that the
path<00:01:29.390> missed<00:01:29.630> our<00:01:29.780> projection<00:01:30.229> sits<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.680> little

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
path missed our projection sits a little

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.590 
path missed our projection sits a little
bit<00:01:31.009> higher<00:01:31.100> than<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.820> driver's<00:01:32.149> side<00:01:32.330> and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
bit higher than the driver's side and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.230 
bit higher than the driver's side and
the<00:01:33.500> way<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.679> want<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.220> line<00:01:34.429> this<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.910> that

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
the way you want to line this is that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.230 
the way you want to line this is that
the<00:01:35.390> cutoff<00:01:35.929> looks<00:01:36.800> like<00:01:36.920> an<00:01:37.009> inverted<00:01:37.280> Z<00:01:37.610> the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
the cutoff looks like an inverted Z the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.510 
the cutoff looks like an inverted Z the
bottom<00:01:38.570> left<00:01:38.780> line<00:01:39.020> right<00:01:39.470> before<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.100> actual

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
bottom left line right before the actual

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.510 
bottom left line right before the actual
up<00:01:40.850> step<00:01:41.210> for<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.509> cut<00:01:41.869> up<00:01:41.960> step<00:01:42.259> has<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.399> be

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
up step for this cut up step has to be

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.060 
up step for this cut up step has to be
open<00:01:44.000> overlap<00:01:44.570> with<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.140> other<00:01:45.440> projector

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
open overlap with the other projector

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.840 
open overlap with the other projector
okay<00:01:46.610> that's<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.149> correct<00:01:47.649> alignment<00:01:48.850> so

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
okay that's the correct alignment so

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.240 
okay that's the correct alignment so
going<00:01:50.210> back<00:01:50.390> here<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.750> can<00:01:50.869> see<00:01:50.929> that<00:01:51.409> the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
going back here you can see that the

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.070 
going back here you can see that the
passenger<00:01:52.940> side<00:01:53.060> projector<00:01:53.570> sits<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:53.990> little

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
passenger side projector sits a little

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.410 
passenger side projector sits a little
bit<00:01:54.229> higher<00:01:54.520> what<00:01:55.520> I'm<00:01:55.580> going<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.729> do<00:01:55.850> next

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
bit higher what I'm going to do next

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.859 
bit higher what I'm going to do next
it's<00:01:57.110> just<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.710> race<00:01:58.310> up<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.850> driver<00:01:59.659> side

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
it's just to race up the driver side

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.429 
it's just to race up the driver side
projector<00:02:00.670> until<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.149> bottom<00:02:02.990> left<00:02:03.200> knee

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
projector until the bottom left knee

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:23.690 
projector until the bottom left knee
lines<00:02:03.649> are<00:02:03.829> overlapping

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.210 

go<00:02:24.240> back<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.630> forth<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:24.900> make<00:02:25.650> sure<00:02:25.890> that

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
go back and forth here make sure that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.430 
go back and forth here make sure that
this<00:02:27.020> left<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> D<00:02:28.739> line<00:02:28.920> or<00:02:29.220> overlaps

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
this left to the D line or overlaps

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.570 
this left to the D line or overlaps
looks<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:31.650> gonna<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.010> break<00:02:32.340> up

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
looks like I'm gonna have to break up

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.390 
looks like I'm gonna have to break up
the<00:02:32.700> driver<00:02:32.880> side<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.390> little<00:02:33.420> bit<00:02:33.630> more

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
the driver side just a little bit more

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.680 
the driver side just a little bit more
using<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> brick<00:02:35.640> wall<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:36.270> pretty<00:02:36.480> helpful

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
using a brick wall it's pretty helpful

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.250 
using a brick wall it's pretty helpful
as<00:02:36.959> well

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.880 

perfect

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.890 

now<00:02:49.430> what<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.700> want<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.910> do<00:02:50.060> here<00:02:50.270> is<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.540> you

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
now what you want to do here is that you

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.250 
now what you want to do here is that you
want<00:02:51.110> these<00:02:51.230> two<00:02:52.180> left<00:02:53.180> z<00:02:53.420> lines<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.780> always<00:02:54.110> be

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
want these two left z lines to always be

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.170 
want these two left z lines to always be
overlapped<00:02:54.710> this<00:02:54.920> way<00:02:55.130> no<00:02:55.340> matter<00:02:55.550> how<00:02:55.880> far

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
overlapped this way no matter how far

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.820 
overlapped this way no matter how far
away<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.450> are<00:02:56.600> from<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.930> wall<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.530> if<00:02:57.590> you

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
away you are from the wall so if you
