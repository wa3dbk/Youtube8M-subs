00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
dollars and 49 cents for it but I don't

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.329 
dollars and 49 cents for it but I don't
remember<00:00:43.210> if<00:00:43.539> that<00:00:43.569> was<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:44.589> original<00:00:45.069> price

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
remember if that was the original price

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.520 
remember if that was the original price
or<00:00:45.639> the<00:00:45.819> sale<00:00:46.059> price<00:00:46.359> but<00:00:46.749> if<00:00:46.870> that<00:00:47.050> was<00:00:47.289> the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
or the sale price but if that was the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.259 
or the sale price but if that was the
sale<00:00:47.739> price<00:00:48.010> I<00:00:48.219> don't<00:00:48.280> think<00:00:48.789> that<00:00:49.059> the

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
sale price I don't think that the

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.629 
sale price I don't think that the
original<00:00:49.690> price<00:00:49.899> is<00:00:49.929> much<00:00:50.440> more<00:00:50.979> than<00:00:51.159> that<00:00:51.219> so

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:51.639 
original price is much more than that so

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:54.449 
original price is much more than that so
just<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.539> fact<00:00:52.749> that<00:00:52.960> this<00:00:53.260> face<00:00:53.710> wash<00:00:53.979> really

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
works well for my skin and it's not that

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.799

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
because every night before I go to bed I

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.710

off because sleeping in your makeup is

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.600 
off because sleeping in your makeup is
really<00:01:16.420> bad<00:01:16.780> for<00:01:17.020> your<00:01:17.110> skin<00:01:17.320> but<00:01:18.130> sometimes

so another awesome part about this face

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.260 
so another awesome part about this face
wash<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.590> that<00:01:59.770> has<00:02:00.070> microbeads<00:02:00.760> in<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:01.090> and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
wash is that has microbeads in it and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.390 
wash is that has microbeads in it and
the<00:02:01.810> microbeads<00:02:02.320> in<00:02:02.470> this<00:02:02.620> face<00:02:02.830> wash<00:02:03.100> are<00:02:03.370> a

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.100 
the microbeads in this face wash are a
lot<00:02:03.610> different<00:02:04.060> than<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.390> microbeads<00:02:04.900> that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
lot different than the microbeads that

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.840 
lot different than the microbeads that
I've<00:02:05.440> found<00:02:05.680> in<00:02:05.860> other<00:02:06.010> face<00:02:06.340> washes

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
I've found in other face washes

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.910 
I've found in other face washes
sometimes<00:02:07.600> an<00:02:07.780> other<00:02:07.930> face<00:02:08.200> washes<00:02:08.739> the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
sometimes an other face washes the

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.690 
sometimes an other face washes the
microbeads<00:02:09.369> can<00:02:09.610> be<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.729> little<00:02:09.909> bit<00:02:10.090> rough

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
microbeads can be a little bit rough

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.190 
microbeads can be a little bit rough
and<00:02:10.759> when<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:10.970> wash<00:02:11.180> your<00:02:11.360> face<00:02:11.420> then<00:02:11.870> kind<00:02:12.140> of

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
and when you wash your face then kind of

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.020 
and when you wash your face then kind of
scratch<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.830> little<00:02:13.010> bit<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.849> just

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
scratch it a little bit and that just

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.150 
scratch it a little bit and that just
makes<00:02:14.209> me<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.420> little<00:02:14.540> bit<00:02:14.750> nervous<00:02:14.959> but<00:02:15.860> I'm

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
makes me a little bit nervous but I'm

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.979 
makes me a little bit nervous but I'm
the<00:02:16.640> microbeads<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.269> this<00:02:17.450> face<00:02:17.690> wash

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
actually break up they're called

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.759 
actually break up they're called
bursting<00:02:20.150> beads<00:02:20.390> when<00:02:21.019> you<00:02:21.170> wash<00:02:21.349> your<00:02:21.590> face

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
with it and they release antioxidants

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.540 
with it and they release antioxidants

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
interesting cooling sensation and the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.910 
interesting cooling sensation and the
cooling<00:02:34.940> sensation<00:02:35.120> doesn't<00:02:35.840> only<00:02:36.019> last<00:02:36.440> when

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
cooling sensation doesn't only last when

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.430 
cooling sensation doesn't only last when
you're<00:02:37.099> washing<00:02:37.489> your<00:02:37.760> face<00:02:38.060> but<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.930> lasts

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
you're washing your face but it lasts

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.960 
you're washing your face but it lasts
like<00:02:39.530> after<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.069> dry<00:02:40.310> your<00:02:40.519> face<00:02:40.670> and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
like after you dry your face and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.520 
like after you dry your face and
sometimes<00:02:41.360> I'll<00:02:41.540> be<00:02:41.660> lying<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:42.080> bed<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.410> I'll

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
sometimes I'll be lying in bed and I'll

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.280

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
feeling I had another face wash that did

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.490 
feeling I had another face wash that did
that<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.690> past<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.140> don't<00:02:54.319> remember

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
that in the past I don't remember

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.920 
that in the past I don't remember
exactly<00:02:55.069> which<00:02:55.310> one<00:02:55.579> it<00:02:55.610> was<00:02:55.849> but<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.810> was

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
exactly which one it was but it was

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.360 
exactly which one it was but it was
something<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.440> really<00:02:57.530> loved<00:02:58.069> about<00:02:58.190> it

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
something that I really loved about it

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.130 
something that I really loved about it
in<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.760> last<00:02:59.000> things<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.540> wanted<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.870> talk

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
in the last things that I wanted to talk

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.780 
in the last things that I wanted to talk
about<00:03:00.170> with<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.709> face<00:03:01.010> wash<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.519> that<00:03:01.670> it

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
about with this face wash is that it

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.030 
about with this face wash is that it
doesn't<00:03:02.090> specifically<00:03:02.599> target<00:03:03.170> acne<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.860> so

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
doesn't specifically target acne and so

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.440 
doesn't specifically target acne and so
when<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.400> picked<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:04.849> up<00:03:04.940> in<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.120> store<00:03:05.420> I

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
when I picked it up in the store I

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.600 
when I picked it up in the store I
didn't<00:03:05.930> know<00:03:06.079> really<00:03:06.620> what<00:03:06.860> kind<00:03:07.099> of<00:03:07.160> benefits

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
didn't know really what kind of benefits

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.280 
didn't know really what kind of benefits
it<00:03:07.760> would<00:03:07.849> have<00:03:07.910> for<00:03:08.060> my<00:03:08.390> skin<00:03:08.690> but

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
it would have for my skin but

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.440 
it would have for my skin but
surprisingly<00:03:09.860> ended<00:03:10.190> up<00:03:10.310> really<00:03:10.670> liking<00:03:10.849> it<00:03:11.239> I

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
surprisingly ended up really liking it I

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.930 
surprisingly ended up really liking it I
mean<00:03:11.599> it's<00:03:11.810> not<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.319> miracle<00:03:13.160> worker<00:03:13.370> with<00:03:13.819> the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
mean it's not a miracle worker with the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.059 
mean it's not a miracle worker with the
acne<00:03:14.329> but<00:03:14.630> when<00:03:14.870> I'm<00:03:15.019> breaking<00:03:15.380> out<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.560> lot<00:03:15.859> I

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
acne but when I'm breaking out a lot I

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.920 
acne but when I'm breaking out a lot I
definitely<00:03:16.609> noticed<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.150> when<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.299> use<00:03:17.630> this

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
definitely noticed that when I use this

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.379 
definitely noticed that when I use this
it<00:03:18.319> helps<00:03:18.739> my<00:03:18.920> breakouts<00:03:19.370> go<00:03:19.730> away<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> lot

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
it helps my breakouts go away a lot

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.360 
it helps my breakouts go away a lot
quicker<00:03:20.720> than<00:03:21.049> if<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.350> hadn't<00:03:21.709> used<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:22.040> at<00:03:22.220> all

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
quicker than if I hadn't used it at all

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.090 
quicker than if I hadn't used it at all
so<00:03:22.970> if<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.359> guys<00:03:23.510> have<00:03:23.810> breakouts<00:03:24.319> then<00:03:24.829> I

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
so if you guys have breakouts then I

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.430 
so if you guys have breakouts then I
would<00:03:25.340> definitely<00:03:25.459> recommend<00:03:25.970> this<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.840> even

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
would definitely recommend this and even

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.110 
would definitely recommend this and even
if<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.709> doesn't<00:03:27.980> help<00:03:28.069> with<00:03:28.250> your<00:03:28.400> breakouts<00:03:28.850> I

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
if it doesn't help with your breakouts I

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.030 
if it doesn't help with your breakouts I
definitely<00:03:29.810> think<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.109> it<00:03:30.319> has<00:03:30.470> plenty<00:03:30.920> of

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
definitely think that it has plenty of

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.210 
definitely think that it has plenty of
other<00:03:31.220> benefits<00:03:31.790> for<00:03:32.030> your<00:03:32.120> skin<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:32.750> yes<00:03:33.709> so
