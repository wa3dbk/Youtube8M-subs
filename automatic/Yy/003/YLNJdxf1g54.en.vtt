green<00:00:27.269> technology<00:00:27.930> which<00:00:28.560> means<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.980> they

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
green technology which means that they

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.240 
green technology which means that they
can<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> smaller<00:00:29.939> bezel<00:00:30.449> than<00:00:30.750> before<00:00:31.250> so

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
can have a smaller bezel than before so

one<00:02:20.459> is<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> mock-up<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.540> can't<00:02:22.050> be<00:02:22.140> turned

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
one is a mock-up so it can't be turned

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.680 
one is a mock-up so it can't be turned
on<00:02:22.560> at<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> moment<00:02:23.870> both<00:02:24.870> batteries<00:02:25.290> will<00:02:25.770> be

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
on at the moment both batteries will be

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.870 
on at the moment both batteries will be
rated<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:27.959> fifteen<00:02:28.440> hundred<00:02:28.709> cycles<00:02:28.950> which

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
rated for fifteen hundred cycles which

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.540 
rated for fifteen hundred cycles which
means<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:32.310> there'll<00:02:32.519> be

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
means that you can and and there'll be

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.640 
means that you can and and there'll be
good<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.330> up<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.720> eighty<00:02:33.840> percent<00:02:34.050> after<00:02:34.349> that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
good for up to eighty percent after that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.100 
good for up to eighty percent after that
so<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.730> means<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.360> won't<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.840> replace

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
so that means you won't have to replace

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.960 
so that means you won't have to replace
them<00:02:37.380> which<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.650> good<00:02:37.830> because<00:02:38.010> they're<00:02:38.400> built

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
