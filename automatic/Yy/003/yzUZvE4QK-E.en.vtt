wafers butter and pine nuts that might

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.240 
wafers butter and pine nuts that might
it's<00:01:55.270> become<00:01:55.600> so<00:01:55.900> expensive<00:01:56.170> lately<00:01:56.800> that<00:01:57.190> I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
it's become so expensive lately that I

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.770 
it's become so expensive lately that I
had<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.460> come<00:01:57.610> up<00:01:57.640> with<00:01:57.730> an<00:01:57.940> alternate<00:01:58.360> recipe

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
had to come up with an alternate recipe

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.690 
had to come up with an alternate recipe
I<00:01:59.020> think<00:01:59.500> it's<00:01:59.620> just<00:01:59.890> as<00:02:00.100> good<00:02:00.190> but<00:02:00.550> if<00:02:00.640> you

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
I think it's just as good but if you

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.280 
I think it's just as good but if you
prefer<00:02:00.880> more<00:02:01.300> more<00:02:01.510> like<00:02:01.750> graham<00:02:02.020> cracker

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
prefer more more like graham cracker

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.110 
prefer more more like graham cracker
crust<00:02:02.710> I'll<00:02:03.160> leave<00:02:03.430> that<00:02:03.460> recipe<00:02:03.910> down<00:02:04.060> below

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
crust I'll leave that recipe down below

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.469 
crust I'll leave that recipe down below
as<00:02:04.450> well<00:02:05.220> okay<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.250> now<00:02:06.580> our<00:02:06.730> crust<00:02:06.970> is<00:02:07.210> done

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
as well okay so now our crust is done

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.730 
as well okay so now our crust is done
okay<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.660> think<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.350> long<00:02:11.560> enough

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
okay I think this is that long enough

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.870 
okay I think this is that long enough
we're<00:02:11.980> going<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.160> give<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.310> another<00:02:12.580> mix

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
we're going to give it another mix

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:28.729 
we're going to give it another mix
before<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:13.210> pour<00:02:13.420> into<00:02:13.540> our<00:02:13.660> crust

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.690 

I'm<00:02:29.739> just<00:02:29.859> gonna<00:02:29.950> pop<00:02:30.189> this<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.519> oven

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
I'm just gonna pop this in the oven

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:46.550 
I'm just gonna pop this in the oven
again<00:02:30.879> for<00:02:31.180> about<00:02:31.239> 20<00:02:31.569> or<00:02:31.629> 25<00:02:31.689> minutes

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.960 

it's<00:02:47.560> okay<00:02:47.799> if<00:02:47.860> there's<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.069> little<00:02:48.310> cracks<00:02:48.700> on

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
it's okay if there's a little cracks on

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.130 
it's okay if there's a little cracks on
top<00:02:49.180> because<00:02:49.390> we're<00:02:49.510> gonna<00:02:49.599> cover<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:50.019> with

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
top because we're gonna cover it with

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.809 
top because we're gonna cover it with
sugar<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.340> won't<00:02:51.489> really<00:02:51.640> make<00:02:51.760> a

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
sugar so it won't really make a

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.039 
sugar so it won't really make a
difference<00:02:52.000> nobody<00:02:52.599> will<00:02:52.720> see<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:57.900> then<00:02:58.900> to

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
difference nobody will see it then to

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.539 
difference nobody will see it then to
get<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.349> creme<00:02:59.620> brulee<00:02:59.739> touch<00:03:00.159> we're<00:03:00.430> gonna

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.759 
get the creme brulee touch we're gonna
sprinkle<00:03:00.939> some<00:03:01.180> sugar<00:03:01.239> on<00:03:01.510> top<00:03:01.650> I'm<00:03:02.650> gonna

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
sprinkle some sugar on top I'm gonna

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.170 
sprinkle some sugar on top I'm gonna
take<00:03:03.010> my<00:03:03.159> blowtorch<00:03:03.609> and<00:03:03.760> give<00:03:03.879> it<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.030> nice

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
scorch on top now I know that most

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.949 
scorch on top now I know that most
people<00:03:06.790> probably<00:03:06.939> do<00:03:07.180> not<00:03:07.299> have<00:03:07.359> a<00:03:07.480> blowtorch

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959
