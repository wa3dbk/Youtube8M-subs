00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.730
 good afternoon then see let's 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:14.110
 show them a cable tutorial or 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 usb adapter a port would be first 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:25.700
 we have on the disk or drivers 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.700
 this program is called knowing about itself 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 no no 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.520
 this this tutorial is for 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.630
 the computers that sometimes bring us 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.540
 the port would be this cable quoted 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.500
 is for that and it is already seen that 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.970
 bring a look 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.310
 and lion -3 here we see different 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.430
 operating systems that we can manage 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.960
 or work with windows and windows 7 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.960
 windows xp windows 98 of linux and mac 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.950
 select we are working with xp 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.450
 and we hope that it loads 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.450
 already 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.010
 speaks very well with anyone 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.440
 and to know what our name is called 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.549
 what is our port called for 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.420
 change so that there may be 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.150
 communication and download 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.670
 already here our garlic appears 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.170
 port that is connected we arrived 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.360
 we are working with usb 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.590
 and they speak their properties but you know which 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.680
 is 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.130
 and another port is called 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:28.150
 with 3 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.150
 in the chat program we modified it 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.680
 here so we only had one 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.330
 because it was from machine to machine 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.150
 directly in here as we already change 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.730
 of puerto los nerds trainer and in 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.750
 the machine that receives 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.750
 and in 1 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.290
 and we are sad 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.769
 communication 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.950
 it's much better
