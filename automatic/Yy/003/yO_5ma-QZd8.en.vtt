00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.870
 hi this is a pilot release of my new 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.880
 show where we spit on tradition 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.490

 let's go we need soy sauce 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.400
 rice vinegar can be dispensed with 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.100
 rice can take special can 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.230
 I didn't notice the usual difference. 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.620
 any game that you most 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.740
 love tuna seaweed sheets 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.320
 cream cheese cucumbers and the most important 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.370
 bamboo mat say it's called 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.770

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.840
 well, I still stole a couple of sticks from 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.490
 store in order to fully immerse in not 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.280
 convenience of Japanese cuisine 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.290
 further cook rice and since I do not know 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.989

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.380

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.770

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.909
 minutes well and now the most difficult at the same 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.300
 time is an impossible task for me 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.850
 turn the rolls start with the sheet we lay it down 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.320
 on the mat we cover our rice and hands 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.500
 can be lubricated with water 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.360
 By adding rice vinegar I'm not talking about that. 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.909
 knew and I had a hard time 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.350
 now it's all time to twist 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.750

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.990
 sharyu but as you know my skill is far 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.150

 a mixture of water and vinegar what we did 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.390
 previously everything is ready even tastes like 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.670
