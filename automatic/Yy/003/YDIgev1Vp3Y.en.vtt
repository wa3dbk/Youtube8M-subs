 where they offered a great concert that served to commemorate the 20 years in 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.409
 that its foundation 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:28.599
 the bassist javier infant conveyed the illusion of the group to return to act in 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:29.539
 her land 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.969
 and had words of remembrance and tribute to the founders of the queen group in the 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.310
 year 1989 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.020
 burst into the music scene of the town with an unusual style in 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.340
 these lands manchegas well 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.310
 on the cd 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.520
 in fear 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.429
 to take advantage of 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.000
 First record was recorded in Ireland 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.880
 Teachers no longer have a guard in our town because they improve what has been done 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.470
 live to the heat of the people and find 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.210
 the opa thrown against him like this if he has been guarantor for a long time or always for not 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.120
 receive it 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.000
 the concert that lasted two hours had the accompaniment 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.300
 some songs of the band of bagpipes of toledo laugh icas 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.520
 that has been faithful companion 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.360
 of travel in the summer tour that the group has made for different 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.510
 scenarios of castilla-la mancha 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.070
 its director and at the same time component of aquelarre fernando mosquera explained that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.610
 the function of the cookies in the concerts of the group manzanareño 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.600
 consists of printing more show and eye-catching performances 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.150
 independently from the network 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.760
 but then it was 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.810
 in the group, we have the idea 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.870
 and incorporate them in order to give a little more entertainment to the 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.830
 concerts 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.640
 and well, they participate in four themes 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.420
 ea throughout the concert 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.250
 i think that encourages a bit 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.640
 the crowd not of the people the public and such what the band of bagpipes has done 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.300
 more than participating in the concerts has been participating in a show in 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.290
 concrete that was called conga and almost crazy we have presented for the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.670
 network of theaters then in that show was included the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.090
 collaboration of the band with aznar 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.130
 the group of bagpipers wanted to make themselves known in apple groves in making a 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.410
 pasacalle that began half an hour before the concert from the plaza de la 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.750
 constitution and ended in front of the installed scenario 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.579
 in the river walks and that attracted interest among the passerby sickle 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.269
 the repertoire he plays 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.609

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.439

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.900
