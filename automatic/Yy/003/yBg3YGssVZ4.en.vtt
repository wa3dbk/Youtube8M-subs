00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello and welcome to kitchen and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.380
 quick 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.990
 today we will do their 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.549
 recipe for this apple pie 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.100
 the recipe we will need two apples 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.340
 golden a little bit of sugar or 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.560
 apple compote rods and a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.769
 roll of puff pastry bought in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.880
 the trade we will start with husband 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.880
 in our apples 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.030
 so I 'm going to touch apples 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.780
 I cut them in half and I took them 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.989
 the idea now I'm going to carve the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.989
 slices 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.820
 so I cut the bridges in play 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.520
 am I going to do the ends 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.860
 I'm going to remove the ends 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.070
 could eat it because it will be 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:05.070
 not pretty on my pie 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 then I will flatten them 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:16.450
 and I'm going to make circles on my 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.200
 puff pastry actually it will be good for 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.200
 make your pie 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.620
 so that's a fine pie I make 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.270
 with apples but you can do it at 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.470
 the mango to drink at the threat one can 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.470
 to make pies and girl against her 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.909
 so here and what to do 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:56.170
 so it pique our pie to avoid 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:58.390
 that it swells too much in the oven so 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.590
 I'll put some compote 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.920
 apples in the middle of my pie ever very 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.020
 fear 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.520
 and no need for the state him because 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.720
 when we will put the apple on it 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.720
 it will spread itself 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:30.220
 So here I am, sprinkle with 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.500
 cane sugar to have a nice 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 coloring and I'm going to bring that to light 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:49.600
 between 15 and 20 minutes to monitor our 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:57.630
 thin pies without cooked west is ya 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.630
 the ovens we get beautiful slice of bread 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.260
 so I put my toast on a 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.990
 grate for whatever she's cooling 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.080
 because we can do it is either 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.750
 soups or dre icing sugar 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.610
 it's so pretty or so napper 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.610
 with a little bit of apricot mapping 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:29.680

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.870
 quite simple so try to duplicate 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.940
