00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.150
 hello welcome aboard my name is 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.680
 good and today he talks to them about the telephone more 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.680
 expected of the year the iphone 5 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 Y 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.619
 i 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.610
 as you can see the iphone 5 is a bit 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.320
 higher than its predecessors 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.450
 this because apple decided to expand the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.610
 screen to 4 inches but without changing 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.470
 the width is worth noting that from the 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.530
 first iphone to 4 is the screen 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.410
 it was always 3.5 inches another 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.210
 44% more screen feature 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.510
 of contrast and in addition to the sensors 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.220
 are integrated within these 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.579
 this makes the new iphone 5 a 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.489
 18% thinner and 20% lighter than your 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.739
 predecessor the iphone 5 is also in its 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.810
 inside the new apple a6 chip what 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.130
 that will make your games applications and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.619
 web pages are opened almost 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.510
 instantly if you are one of those who 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.400
 love to take pictures with the phone 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.500
 I tell you about the iPhone 5 brings a camera 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.659
 8 megapixels and a sapphire crystal 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 almost impossible to ryanair one of the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.710
 functions that I like the most is that of 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.100
 panorama that allows you to take a photo 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.229
 of 240 degrees and 28 megapixels ideal 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.229
 for landscapes or groups like 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.270
 Y 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.280
 to access this function simply 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.220
 you press on camera 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.770
 in three options and select photo 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.229
 panorama 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.490
 another big change of the iphone 5 is that the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.259
 classic connector d 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.259
 was replaced by a new one and more 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.939
 little one called li ning besides is 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.229
 reversible so you will never have 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.590
 the problem of finding the side 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.590
 Right 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.620
 inside the box besides finding the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.170
 brochure the charger and the cable 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.569
 you'll find the new hearing aid and pop 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.200
 which is more resistant and with better 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.200
 audio quality 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.310
 and if it's sound the iphone5 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.379
 has three microphones to cancel 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.049
 outside noise so that the voice gets 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.579
 listen clearer and stronger finally 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.189
 Users who buy their iPhone 5 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.140

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:34.319
