 credits pretty much by because of this 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.409
 fork there and I have some friends who have 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:12.040
 lost wrongs to say almost 10 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.510
 millions of credits so that's it 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.780
 rabies is a very very very very 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.550
 bad thing for fifa 15 was 15 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.080
 however, it may be a good 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.390
 thing for fifa cèze south 16 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.100
 so we'll see there for once we do 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.100
 all the players almost the prices have 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.440
 dropped by a few hundred thousand 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.700
 of credits same thing with with manu 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.050
 besides see I had bought 600 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.690
 miles almost credit and I can the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.340
 resell 440 miles maximum and minimum 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.320
 of 190 million that we all lost 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.880
 a lot of credit where I am 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.830
 very very unhappy is that it falls 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.020
 like that it's overnight 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.250
 you ask that and you are told nothing where 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.260
 it would have been interesting if we were 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.300
 already base date of the basic advertised 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.530
 to also consult the community 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.690
 it's still us who play in game 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.040
 this is what we who injecting 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.030
 the real money on fifa points by 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.570
 example or for people who buy 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.580
 credits 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.950
 so that's also why they 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.690
 have added that to condemn 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.659
 completely purchases of credits on 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.820
 internet but that's what is sure 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.179
 it is that I have the impression that everything is 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.340
 does for us nothing goes in the direction 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.770
 players finally because if this 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.850
 is only 7 these credits 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.800
 is there is a reason to leave a 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.180
 first time the fifa points it did not 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.110
 operated him that shit he got 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.220
 said I'll buy direct 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.990
 credit it costs less people come 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.420
 the more I can take the lead 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.770
 here on the other side there are all 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.740
 people 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.960
 who do not make third party purchases that this 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.610
 whether it is fifa or whether it is credits 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.210
 on the internet that simply make 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.560
 resale purchase 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.930
 there you shoot them in the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.760
 foot too and that's it in all I 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.530
 believe I think today we are 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.090
 is all on the same wavelength in 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.350
 say you sold us some 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.060
 super goalkeeper at the end of the game 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.380
 guards stinks shit you told us 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.640
 one day we will improve our servers to 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.200
 waiters it's been three years that stinks the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.320
 shit and you do not answer a fork 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.820
 transfer of players which are in 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.100
 has absolutely nothing to wank and it's 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.150
 not at all what we want and basically 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.380
 I feel like it's all 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.490
 is made to piss me off 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.800
 personally I am very disappointed because 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.630
 that I lost a lot of credit and and 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.790
 on one side I tell myself we'll see on foot 16 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.810
 if it's going to give something good there 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.160
 where I'm happy it's for 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.840
 people more or less who had not 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.180
 a lot of credit that will be able to get 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.060
 to afford to buy ben here if you 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.160
 look at me ribery my cowardice 450 455 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.470
 400 5000 fucking credit I have trouble 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.640
 today he admits that 380 thousand max 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.530
 so with a little luck you 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.150
 chopper to something like 300,000 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.140
 so here I'm happy because everything 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.080
 the world is going to be able a little can 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.180
 buy the players that he n etc and the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.630
 players have dropped dramatically on the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.810
 totti is the same you take see 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.350

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.010
 for example I do I do it live 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.050
 I have not edit recipe will go over enough 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.310

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.420
 wifi was no whistle everyone 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.730
 waiting to see what will happen 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.959
 which is sure friends anyway I 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.450
 think it very sincerely it can not 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.770
 to be sure but I think so 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.209
 it will not be any change we set 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.860

 royally our opinion enjoy direct 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.430
 so here we go we will suffer what is it 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.660
 what to do if you want to do a 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.370
 little bit of resale purchase credit 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.100
 do it on regular type players 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.640

 siph very strong regular players and everything 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.060
 Remember that the seasons but we will 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.560
 try to see a little bit about it 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.210
 will happen all that 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.590
 there for once we are all in the same 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.139
 shit we got all swollen it's 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.940
 done it's done it's useless 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.470
 crying or anything your team 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.240
 to not change your players you not 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.360
 taken away it's just that they lost a 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.020
 huge value and that if you had planned 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.070
 to resell them but that's it if you 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.250
 are done balls and like all the 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.520
 world 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.740
 I had made my team there for 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.910
 the series the beast on the chain that 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.330
 you will discover where you have 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.580
 discovered 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.190
 I think the first episode to 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.260
 to appear after this video and I hope 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.570
 that the concept will please you I had 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.430

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.080
 credit today tattered big max 4 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.729
 440 miles so that's all it fucks 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.930
 balls because it's time spent 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.210
 to play is time spent buying 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.380
 resale and today we lost 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.270
 a lot of time a lot of energy 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.630
 for once again a game that we 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.550
 flows 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.470
 and here that knows not when it's not 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.539
 crap servers bc a fork 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.639
 we're fighting royally 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.530
 balls just after the fork is 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.660
 well sealed at the atrium the apl a triangle 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.160
 high and one that does not change 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.940
 yet the same shit is the 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.700
 guards who stinks 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.800

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.630
 fifa players makes at least the effort 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.180
 to watch videos of people who 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.800
