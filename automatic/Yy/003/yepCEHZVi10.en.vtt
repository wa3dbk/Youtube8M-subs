00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
Start and you can choose to save but you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.260 
Start and you can choose to save but you
really<00:01:37.259> don't<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.670> case<00:01:38.939> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
really don't have to but in this case I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.600 
really don't have to but in this case I
just<00:01:39.540> saved<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:42.259> once<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> say<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.430> want

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just saved it once to say what you want

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.020 
just saved it once to say what you want
to<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.939> go<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.290> save<00:01:46.290> again<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.829> export<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to do is go to save again and export the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.800 
to do is go to save again and export the
team<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.579> save<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.060> team<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.600> as

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
team and you can save it as team one as

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
team and you can save it as team one as
default<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.950> case<00:01:53.189> I'm<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
default but in this case I'm going to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.899 
default but in this case I'm going to
name<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.060> Afro<00:01:54.990> Kobe<00:01:55.409> Cal<00:01:55.799> as<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.430> create<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
name it Afro Kobe Cal as in create a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.890 
name it Afro Kobe Cal as in create a
legend

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.090 

so<00:02:03.900> once<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.290> saved<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:04.620> want<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.830> go<00:02:04.920> back

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
so once it's saved you want to go back

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.370 
so once it's saved you want to go back
to<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.400> main<00:02:05.610> menu<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.860> want<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.460> load<00:02:11.970> up

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
to the main menu and you want to load up

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.320 
to the main menu and you want to load up
a<00:02:13.380> separate<00:02:13.890> roster<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.550> case<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:14.970> don't<00:02:15.150> want

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
a separate roster in case you don't want

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.440 
a separate roster in case you don't want
to<00:02:15.480> mess<00:02:15.930> up<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.260> default<00:02:16.560> roster<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.450> this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
to mess up the default roster in this

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.180 
to mess up the default roster in this
case<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:19.110> created<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:20.010> roster<00:02:20.430> beforehand

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
case I created a roster beforehand

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.290 
case I created a roster beforehand
Lakers<00:02:23.190> create<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> legend

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
Lakers create a legend

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.380 
Lakers create a legend
so<00:02:24.930> load<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> roster<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.940> load<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.150> team

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
so load the roster and load the team

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.500 
so load the roster and load the team
that<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.650> exported<00:02:32.300> then<00:02:33.300> what<00:02:33.420> you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
want to do is go back to or go to main

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.390
