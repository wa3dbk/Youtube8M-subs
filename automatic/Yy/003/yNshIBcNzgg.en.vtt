Peggy three
I<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:22.810> there<00:00:22.900> was<00:00:23.020> a<00:00:23.050> lot<00:00:23.200> of<00:00:23.230> limitations

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
I think there was a lot of limitations

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.380 
I think there was a lot of limitations
in<00:00:23.980> our<00:00:24.099> old<00:00:24.279> collision<00:00:24.730> system<00:00:24.880> it<00:00:25.150> was<00:00:25.210> very

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
in our old collision system it was very

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.029 
in our old collision system it was very
good<00:00:25.660> but<00:00:25.869> it<00:00:26.079> didn't<00:00:26.289> allow<00:00:26.439> us<00:00:26.560> to<00:00:26.680> do<00:00:26.800> some

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
good but it didn't allow us to do some

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.100 
good but it didn't allow us to do some
things<00:00:27.279> that<00:00:27.489> were<00:00:27.970> quite<00:00:28.270> difficult<00:00:28.509> so<00:00:29.079> a

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
things that were quite difficult so a

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.659 
things that were quite difficult so a
lot<00:00:29.289> of<00:00:29.320> times<00:00:29.560> in<00:00:29.710> fifa<00:00:30.009> 11<00:00:30.099> you<00:00:30.460> get<00:00:30.640> a

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.490 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a
situation<00:00:31.329> where<00:00:31.509> maybe<00:00:31.660> two<00:00:31.989> players<00:00:32.290> are

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
situation where maybe two players are

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.700 
situation where maybe two players are
running<00:00:32.860> into<00:00:33.399> one<00:00:33.850> another<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.710> because

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
running into one another and because

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.709 
running into one another and because
there's<00:00:36.399> a<00:00:36.460> lot<00:00:36.700> of<00:00:36.730> contacts<00:00:37.239> between<00:00:37.450> those

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
there's a lot of contacts between those

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.690 
there's a lot of contacts between those
two<00:00:37.870> players<00:00:38.110> with<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.920> old<00:00:39.040> system<00:00:39.280> we<00:00:39.550> had

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
two players with the old system we had

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.000 
two players with the old system we had
to<00:00:39.820> pick<00:00:40.030> one<00:00:40.270> contact<00:00:41.110> which<00:00:41.739> meant<00:00:41.950> that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
to pick one contact which meant that

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.830 
to pick one contact which meant that
we'd<00:00:42.190> get<00:00:42.309> a<00:00:42.370> a<00:00:42.579> collision<00:00:43.149> animation<00:00:43.600> but<00:00:43.719> did

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
we'd get a a collision animation but did

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.150 
we'd get a a collision animation but did
a<00:00:43.930> great<00:00:44.110> job<00:00:44.140> of<00:00:44.379> showing<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.890> that<00:00:45.010> there

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
a great job of showing you that there

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.560 
a great job of showing you that there
was<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.340> collision<00:00:45.610> something<00:00:46.090> happened<00:00:46.420> but

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
was a collision something happened but

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.939 
was a collision something happened but
maybe<00:00:46.749> didn't<00:00:47.079> take<00:00:47.199> into<00:00:47.350> account<00:00:47.589> every

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
maybe didn't take into account every

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.799 
maybe didn't take into account every
little<00:00:48.190> detail<00:00:48.309> with<00:00:48.999> this<00:00:49.210> year's<00:00:49.420> engine

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
little detail with this year's engine

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.209 
little detail with this year's engine
what<00:00:49.929> you<00:00:50.019> see<00:00:50.260> is<00:00:50.469> when<00:00:50.649> those<00:00:50.800> two<00:00:51.010> players

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
what you see is when those two players

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:52.979 
what you see is when those two players
come<00:00:51.489> together<00:00:51.789> we're<00:00:51.999> resolving<00:00:52.569> for<00:00:52.749> every

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
come together we're resolving for every

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.649 
come together we're resolving for every
single<00:00:53.289> collision<00:00:53.499> that<00:00:53.739> happens<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:55.089> we're

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
single collision that happens and we're

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.319 
single collision that happens and we're
really<00:00:56.230> able<00:00:56.499> to<00:00:56.739> preserve<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.280> momentum<00:00:57.789> a

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
really able to preserve the momentum a

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.910 
really able to preserve the momentum a
lot<00:00:58.809> better<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.350> interactions<00:00:59.859> between

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
lot better in the interactions between

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.790 
lot better in the interactions between
players<00:01:00.569> this<00:01:01.569> looks<00:01:01.809> fantastic<00:01:01.989> when<00:01:02.710> you

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
players this looks fantastic when you

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.710 
players this looks fantastic when you
get<00:01:02.920> into<00:01:03.069> the<00:01:03.219> replay<00:01:03.579> camera<00:01:03.999> and<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.449> see

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
get into the replay camera and you see

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.500 
get into the replay camera and you see
all<00:01:04.900> of<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.430> limbs<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.729> parts<00:01:07.000> bending

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
all of the limbs and the parts bending

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.060 
all of the limbs and the parts bending
and<00:01:07.659> contorting<00:01:08.140> as<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:08.409> would<00:01:08.560> expect<00:01:08.650> them

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
and contorting as you would expect them

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.040 
and contorting as you would expect them
to<00:01:09.250> like<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:09.790> would<00:01:09.909> see<00:01:10.120> on<00:01:10.150> real-world<00:01:10.479> TV

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
to like you would see on real-world TV

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.380 
to like you would see on real-world TV
but<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:11.560> also<00:01:11.740> translates<00:01:12.280> into<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.820> telecom

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
but it also translates into the telecom

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.570 
but it also translates into the telecom
where<00:01:14.229> you<00:01:14.320> really<00:01:14.590> feel<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.070> difference<00:01:15.430> of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
where you really feel the difference of

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.770 
where you really feel the difference of
the<00:01:15.670> game<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.240> really<00:01:16.510> feel<00:01:16.750> that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
the game and you really feel that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.680 
the game and you really feel that
preservation<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.620> momentum<00:01:18.270> another<00:01:19.270> benefit

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
preservation of momentum another benefit

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.720 
preservation of momentum another benefit
that<00:01:19.720> we<00:01:19.840> get<00:01:20.050> is<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:21.040> resolve<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.430> lot<00:01:21.550> of<00:01:21.640> our

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
that we get is we resolve a lot of our

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.240 
that we get is we resolve a lot of our
clipping<00:01:22.360> issues<00:01:22.690> in<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.870> game<00:01:23.050> this<00:01:23.230> year<00:01:23.290> in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
clipping issues in the game this year in

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.740 
clipping issues in the game this year in
last<00:01:24.760> year's<00:01:25.000> system<00:01:25.330> we<00:01:25.450> didn't<00:01:25.630> actually

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
last year's system we didn't actually

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.450 
last year's system we didn't actually
account<00:01:26.110> for<00:01:26.260> arm<00:01:26.470> collisions<00:01:26.890> at<00:01:27.010> all<00:01:27.160> and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
account for arm collisions at all and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.730 
account for arm collisions at all and
you<00:01:27.730> couldn't<00:01:27.910> really<00:01:28.330> tell<00:01:28.630> in<00:01:28.900> in<00:01:29.620> the

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
you couldn't really tell in in the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.650 
you couldn't really tell in in the
telecom<00:01:30.160> but<00:01:30.340> if<00:01:30.400> you<00:01:30.490> wanted<00:01:30.730> to<00:01:30.820> replay<00:01:31.180> you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.350 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you
would<00:01:31.870> notice<00:01:32.290> that<00:01:33.130> arms<00:01:33.790> could<00:01:33.940> sometimes

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
would notice that arms could sometimes

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.880 
would notice that arms could sometimes
click<00:01:34.660> through<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:34.930> shoulder<00:01:35.380> or<00:01:35.410> clip<00:01:35.710> through

variety<00:02:03.310> we<00:02:03.820> get<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.150> want<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.390> talk<00:02:04.510> about

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
variety we get I want to talk about

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.630 
variety we get I want to talk about
contextual<00:02:05.230> dribble<00:02:05.620> terms<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.040> what<00:02:06.520> this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
contextual dribble terms and what this

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.029 
contextual dribble terms and what this
is<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:06.880> using<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.750> left<00:02:07.930> stick<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.860> could

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
is is using the left stick you could

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.680 
is is using the left stick you could
beat<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.250> player<00:02:09.519> last<00:02:09.759> year<00:02:09.910> by<00:02:10.149> maybe<00:02:10.330> taking

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
beat a player last year by maybe taking

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.009 
beat a player last year by maybe taking
just<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.989> 45-degree<00:02:11.650> dribble<00:02:11.950> turn<00:02:12.129> but

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
just a 45-degree dribble turn but

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.180 
just a 45-degree dribble turn but
sometimes<00:02:14.019> when<00:02:14.379> you<00:02:14.470> do<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.830> maybe<00:02:15.040> you

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
sometimes when you do that maybe you

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.500 
sometimes when you do that maybe you
knock<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.519> ball<00:02:15.640> by<00:02:15.879> him<00:02:15.909> and<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.300> player

because he's been caught it creates
another<00:02:46.310> level<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.700> variety<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.239> we<00:02:47.299> just

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
another level of variety that we just

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.990 
another level of variety that we just
wouldn't<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:47.840> had<00:02:47.930> in<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.140> game<00:02:48.349> last<00:02:48.560> year

wouldn't have had in the game last year
further<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.209> that<00:02:50.410> what<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.500> can<00:02:51.650> see<00:02:51.680> sup<00:02:52.010> now

further to that what you can see sup now

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.699 
further to that what you can see sup now
is<00:02:52.489> sometimes<00:02:52.849> a<00:02:53.060> dribbler<00:02:53.329> will<00:02:53.720> knock<00:02:54.560> the

dribble turns jump out of the way and
gets<00:02:57.769> caught<00:02:57.980> but<00:02:58.370> just<00:02:58.579> slightly<00:02:58.849> so<00:02:59.360> he

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
gets caught but just slightly so he

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.270 
gets caught but just slightly so he
takes<00:02:59.569> a<00:02:59.720> small<00:02:59.870> knock<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.530> what<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.040> get<00:03:01.220> is
