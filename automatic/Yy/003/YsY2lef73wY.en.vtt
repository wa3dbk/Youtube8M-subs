on the package I bought the number one

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200 
on the package I bought the number one

hinges each hinge position has a
different<00:00:45.719> number<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.100> from

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
different number and as you can see from

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.020 
different number and as you can see from
my<00:00:47.579> door

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
my door

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.639 
my door
it<00:00:48.239> starts<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.719> number<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.200> down<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it starts with number one down at the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
it starts with number one down at the
bottom<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.250> goes<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.700> number<00:00:50.969> three

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
bottom and then goes up to number three

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.389 
bottom and then goes up to number three
taller<00:00:52.260> doors<00:00:52.530> might<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.920> hinges<00:00:53.250> with

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
taller doors might have hinges with

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.950 
taller doors might have hinges with
numbers<00:00:53.699> higher<00:00:53.940> than<00:00:54.180> number<00:00:54.300> three<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
numbers higher than number three and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.020 
numbers higher than number three and
that's<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> track<00:00:56.280> actually<00:00:56.550> sits

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that's because the track actually sits

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.670 
that's because the track actually sits
closer<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> door<00:00:58.109> frame<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.559> bottom

than at the top of the frame the hinges

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.280 
than at the top of the frame the hinges
that<00:01:02.070> are<00:01:02.250> higher<00:01:02.489> than<00:01:02.520> number<00:01:03.059> one<00:01:03.290> offset

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that are higher than number one offset

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.630 
that are higher than number one offset
the<00:01:04.409> rollers<00:01:04.680> from<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> tracks<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> door

the rollers from the tracks on the door

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.460 
the rollers from the tracks on the door
will<00:01:05.790> sit<00:01:06.030> flush<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:06.600> completely<00:01:07.049> closed

will sit flush when completely closed

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469 
will sit flush when completely closed

number hinge don't worry about it the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.550 
number hinge don't worry about it the
cylinder<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> middle<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> hinges

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
cylinder in the middle of all the hinges

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
cylinder in the middle of all the hinges
lined<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> number<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:14.850> hinge<00:01:15.180> as

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
out for is that the top and bottom

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.039 
out for is that the top and bottom
roller<00:01:20.759> brackets<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.479> totally<00:01:21.900> different

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
roller brackets are totally different

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.740 
roller brackets are totally different
from<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.560> hinges<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
from the hinges so now that you know a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.240 
from the hinges so now that you know a
little<00:01:25.049> bit<00:01:25.170> about<00:01:25.350> garage<00:01:25.680> door<00:01:25.950> hinges

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

I'll start by removing bolts from the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:02:08.430 
I'll start by removing bolts from the
bottom<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> hinge<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.110> work<00:01:31.350> my<00:01:31.530> way<00:01:31.710> up

once all the bolts are back in and the
hinge<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.320> nice<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.650> tight<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:33.010> can<00:03:33.190> start

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
hinge is nice and tight I can start

00:03:33.400 --> 00:04:26.880 
hinge is nice and tight I can start
working<00:03:33.580> on<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> other<00:03:33.970> side<00:03:34.330> now

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.320 

okay<00:04:27.890> so<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.190> second<00:04:28.520> hinge<00:04:28.670> is<00:04:28.790> done<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.150> as

you<00:04:29.450> can<00:04:29.570> see<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:29.990> isn't<00:04:30.320> too<00:04:30.620> hard<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.920> replace

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
you can see it isn't too hard to replace

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.340 
you can see it isn't too hard to replace
and<00:04:31.850> I<00:04:31.910> think<00:04:32.150> anyone<00:04:32.450> who's<00:04:32.690> even<00:04:33.050> slightly

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
and I think anyone who's even slightly

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.510 
and I think anyone who's even slightly
handy<00:04:33.830> can<00:04:33.980> do<00:04:34.160> it

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
handy can do it

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.520 
handy can do it
and<00:04:35.150> as<00:04:35.420> I<00:04:35.540> said<00:04:35.780> in<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:35.930> beginning<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.470> the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
and as I said in the beginning of the

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.260 
and as I said in the beginning of the
video<00:04:36.680> I've<00:04:36.980> never<00:04:37.250> done<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.610> before<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.030> I

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
video I've never done this before and I

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.350 
video I've never done this before and I
was<00:04:38.420> still<00:04:38.750> able<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.080> make<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.410> repair<00:04:39.770> easily

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
was still able to make the repair easily

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.940 
was still able to make the repair easily
so<00:04:41.360> now<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.600> last<00:04:41.870> thing<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.230> do<00:04:42.380> is<00:04:42.410> reengage

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
so now the last thing to do is reengage

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.800 
so now the last thing to do is reengage
the<00:04:43.220> door<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.730> motor<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.180> you're<00:04:44.390> all<00:04:44.510> set
