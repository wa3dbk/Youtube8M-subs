00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
out the skylight and we had some roofers

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.889 
out the skylight and we had some roofers
come<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.270> fixed<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.329> hole<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> roof

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
huge section of the roof and then my

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.920 
huge section of the roof and then my
turn<00:02:10.140> was<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.879> make<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> whole<00:02:12.239> square<00:02:12.629> cut

turn was to make the whole square cut

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.700 
turn was to make the whole square cut

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the try replaced those right at joists

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.210 
the try replaced those right at joists
as<00:02:20.970> best<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.360> could<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.900> then<00:02:22.770> put<00:02:23.010> drywall

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.270 
as best I could and then put drywall
over<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.850> well<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:25.440> people<00:02:25.710> who<00:02:25.800> came<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.160> did

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
over it well the people who came and did

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.920 
over it well the people who came and did
the<00:02:26.370> roof<00:02:26.550> shored<00:02:26.910> up<00:02:27.030> some<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:27.810> they

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the roof shored up some of that but they

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.070 
the roof shored up some of that but they
didn't<00:02:28.230> do<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.500> right<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:30.210> I<00:02:30.240> had<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.720> didn't

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
didn't do it right and so I had I didn't

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.010 
didn't do it right and so I had I didn't
do<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.350> when<00:02:31.680> they<00:02:31.800> put<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.130> new<00:02:32.720> studs<00:02:33.720> new

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
do it when they put in new studs new

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.960 
do it when they put in new studs new
joists<00:02:34.320> they<00:02:35.100> didn't<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.610> at<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.820> right

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
joists they didn't do it at the right

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.990 
joists they didn't do it at the right
angle<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:38.070> angle<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.490> they<00:02:38.640> had<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
angle and so the angle that they had the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.360 
angle and so the angle that they had the
board's<00:02:39.450> coming<00:02:39.840> out<00:02:39.990> at<00:02:40.200> would<00:02:41.010> have<00:02:41.040> caused

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
board's coming out at would have caused

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.440 
board's coming out at would have caused
the<00:02:41.610> drywall<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:43.130> not<00:02:44.130> sit<00:02:44.520> at<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.270> right

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
the drywall to not sit at the right

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.090 
the drywall to not sit at the right
angle<00:02:45.810> at<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.020> right<00:02:46.200> plane<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.800> had<00:02:46.980> to

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
angle at the right plane so I had to

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.650 
angle at the right plane so I had to
come<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.400> redo<00:02:47.730> some<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:50.450> didn't<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.540> it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
come and redo some of that didn't get it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.630 
come and redo some of that didn't get it
perfect<00:02:52.110> as<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.470> can<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.800> especially<00:02:53.130> right

here if you look around here you can see

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.930 
here if you look around here you can see

actually painters caulk I found that
painters<00:03:28.530> caulk<00:03:28.740> actually<00:03:29.130> does<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> really

painters caulk actually does a really

painters caulk actually does a really
good<00:03:29.730> job<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:31.170> sealing<00:03:31.710> seams<00:03:32.130> when<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.460> don't

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
good job of sealing seams when you don't

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.150 
good job of sealing seams when you don't
have<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.940> right<00:03:33.090> stuff<00:03:34.100> like<00:03:35.100> some<00:03:35.510> adhesive

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
have the right stuff like some adhesive

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.910 
have the right stuff like some adhesive
joint<00:03:38.160> compared<00:03:38.580> he's<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> joint<00:03:39.390> tape<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.930> and

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
joint compared he's a joint tape and and

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.040 
joint compared he's a joint tape and and
joint<00:03:41.400> compound<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.120> I've<00:03:42.420> got<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.630> big<00:03:42.810> beck

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
joint compound but I've got a big beck

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.570 
joint compound but I've got a big beck
of<00:03:43.200> joint<00:03:43.470> compound<00:03:43.920> now<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:45.710> anyway<00:03:46.710> what<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
of joint compound now so anyway what you

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.890 
of joint compound now so anyway what you
see<00:03:47.790> there<00:03:48.000> more<00:03:48.900> painters<00:03:49.590> caulk<00:03:50.900> eventually

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
see there more painters caulk eventually

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.940 
see there more painters caulk eventually
a<00:03:52.110> long<00:03:53.100> time<00:03:53.430> from<00:03:53.610> now<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.820> hope<00:03:54.770> we'll<00:03:55.770> get

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
a long time from now I hope we'll get

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.560 
a long time from now I hope we'll get
real<00:03:56.940> tree<00:03:57.330> instead<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:57.930> fake<00:03:58.200> cardboard

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
real tree instead of this fake cardboard

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.340 
real tree instead of this fake cardboard
stuff<00:04:00.920> real<00:04:01.920> record<00:04:02.490> around<00:04:02.790> or<00:04:03.030> whatever<00:04:03.350> and

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
stuff real record around or whatever and

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.720 
stuff real record around or whatever and
it<00:04:04.470> will<00:04:04.560> go<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:04.710> there<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.100> cover<00:04:05.280> where<00:04:05.520> that

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
it will go up there and cover where that

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.440 
it will go up there and cover where that
 line<00:04:06.270> is<00:04:07.370> same<00:04:08.370> for<00:04:08.400> there<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.060> the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
 line is same for there and the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.080 
 line is same for there and the
whole<00:04:09.570> place<00:04:09.780> will<00:04:09.930> be<00:04:10.020> painted<00:04:10.580> but<00:04:11.580> so<00:04:11.940> there

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
whole place will be painted but so there

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.610 
whole place will be painted but so there

this for like two weeks
ordinarily<00:04:36.830> this<00:04:37.039> would<00:04:37.190> be<00:04:37.280> like<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.460> two-day

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
bathroom that master bathroom I had to

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.610 
bathroom that master bathroom I had to
take<00:05:08.240> out<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.659> toilet<00:05:09.080> because<00:05:09.229> it<00:05:09.530> was

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
take out the toilet because it was

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.129 
take out the toilet because it was
sinking<00:05:10.009> into<00:05:10.159> the<00:05:10.310> floor<00:05:10.810> what<00:05:11.810> ended<00:05:12.080> up

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
sinking into the floor what ended up

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.930 
sinking into the floor what ended up
happening<00:05:12.199> was<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.860> subfloor<00:05:13.340> underneath<00:05:13.370> it

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
happening was the subfloor underneath it

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.709 
happening was the subfloor underneath it
was<00:05:14.060> rotten<00:05:14.680> mmm<00:05:15.680> because<00:05:15.889> again<00:05:16.599> when<00:05:17.599> they

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
was rotten mmm because again when they

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.270 
was rotten mmm because again when they
built<00:05:17.960> these<00:05:18.110> mobile<00:05:18.469> homes<00:05:18.500> especially

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
built these mobile homes especially

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.110 
built these mobile homes especially
before<00:05:19.479> 1993<00:05:21.069> 1994<00:05:23.620> they<00:05:24.620> used<00:05:25.120> particle

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
before 1993 1994 they used particle

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.480 
before 1993 1994 they used particle
board<00:05:26.919> subfloor<00:05:28.210> instead<00:05:29.210> of<00:05:29.300> plywood<00:05:29.479> and

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
board subfloor instead of plywood and

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.920 
board subfloor instead of plywood and
while<00:05:31.490> particle<00:05:31.969> board<00:05:32.180> is<00:05:32.330> great<00:05:32.569> because

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
while particle board is great because

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.930 
while particle board is great because
it's<00:05:33.169> stiff<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.889> doesn't<00:05:34.219> squeak<00:05:34.520> or<00:05:34.759> anything

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
it's stiff it doesn't squeak or anything

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.260 
it's stiff it doesn't squeak or anything
like<00:05:35.180> that<00:05:35.240> it's<00:05:35.630> also<00:05:35.840> basically<00:05:36.620> a<00:05:36.650> sponge

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
like that it's also basically a sponge

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.140 
like that it's also basically a sponge
so<00:05:38.270> any<00:05:38.509> moisture<00:05:38.779> just<00:05:39.349> gets<00:05:40.279> sucked<00:05:40.610> up<00:05:40.819> by

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
so any moisture just gets sucked up by

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.540 
so any moisture just gets sucked up by
this<00:05:41.719> particle<00:05:42.289> board<00:05:42.469> and<00:05:42.680> then<00:05:43.430> the

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
this particle board and then the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.700 
this particle board and then the
particle<00:05:43.940> board<00:05:44.090> loses<00:05:44.779> all<00:05:44.960> integrity<00:05:45.560> and

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
particle board loses all integrity and

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.330 
particle board loses all integrity and
just<00:05:45.860> crumbles<00:05:46.310> and<00:05:46.520> to<00:05:46.669> basically<00:05:47.060> dust<00:05:47.509> dirt

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
just crumbles and to basically dust dirt

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.680 
just crumbles and to basically dust dirt
whatever<00:05:49.340> you<00:05:49.490> want<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.699> call<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.060> it's<00:05:50.419> very

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
whatever you want to call it it's very

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.480 
whatever you want to call it it's very
nasty<00:05:51.699> so<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:54.440> had<00:05:54.620> been<00:05:54.770> going<00:05:54.979> on<00:05:55.190> for<00:05:55.250> a

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
nasty so that had been going on for a

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.360 
nasty so that had been going on for a
while<00:05:56.110> it<00:05:57.110> finally<00:05:57.440> got<00:05:57.560> bad<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:57.979> afterward

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
while it finally got bad and afterward

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.689 
while it finally got bad and afterward

the old closet flange of it solvent weld

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.040 
the old closet flange of it solvent weld
into<00:06:54.920> place<00:06:55.130> so<00:06:55.370> I<00:06:55.430> couldn't<00:06:55.670> reuse<00:06:56.030> it<00:06:56.210> I

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
into place so I couldn't reuse it I

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.130 
into place so I couldn't reuse it I
couldn't<00:06:57.860> get<00:06:57.950> it<00:06:58.070> out<00:06:58.190> of<00:06:58.400> the<00:06:59.000> closet<00:06:59.690> flange

couldn't get it out of the closet flange

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.340 
couldn't get it out of the closet flange
because<00:07:00.770> it<00:07:00.950> was<00:07:01.070> solid<00:07:01.460> welded<00:07:01.880> and<00:07:02.720> so<00:07:03.170> what

because it was solid welded and so what

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.110 
because it was solid welded and so what
I<00:07:03.380> ended<00:07:03.620> up<00:07:03.740> having<00:07:03.920> to<00:07:04.010> do<00:07:04.190> was<00:07:04.520> cut<00:07:04.790> the<00:07:04.970> main

approximate same place which I did

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.900 
approximate same place which I did
somewhat<00:07:21.410> that's<00:07:21.890> the<00:07:22.250> toilet<00:07:22.460> is<00:07:22.730> now<00:07:22.880> a

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
somewhat that's the toilet is now a

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.690 
somewhat that's the toilet is now a
little<00:07:23.180> bit<00:07:23.330> closer<00:07:23.570> to<00:07:23.840> the<00:07:23.870> wall<00:07:24.110> but<00:07:25.100> it

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:25.700 
little bit closer to the wall but it

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.630 
little bit closer to the wall but it
works<00:07:26.620> it's<00:07:27.620> not<00:07:27.680> interfering<00:07:28.280> with<00:07:28.310> anything

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.640 
works it's not interfering with anything

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.430 
works it's not interfering with anything
and<00:07:29.120> it's<00:07:30.100> completely<00:07:31.100> solid<00:07:31.370> now<00:07:31.720> so<00:07:32.720> I'd

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 
and it's completely solid now so I'd

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.050 
and it's completely solid now so I'd
like<00:07:33.680> to<00:07:33.740> have<00:07:33.980> shown<00:07:34.190> you<00:07:34.370> guys<00:07:34.520> that<00:07:34.820> but<00:07:35.030> I

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.060 
like to have shown you guys that but I
don't<00:07:35.330> think<00:07:35.540> that<00:07:35.780> my<00:07:35.960> aunt<00:07:36.350> my<00:07:36.680> roommate

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.070

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.560 
don't think that my aunt my roommate
would<00:07:37.250> have<00:07:37.520> been<00:07:37.700> too<00:07:37.940> thrilled<00:07:38.300> with<00:07:38.390> me

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.950 
putting her toilet on YouTube so she's

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.170

kind<00:07:43.130> of<00:07:43.220> sensitive<00:07:43.550> about<00:07:43.670> that<00:07:43.970> guessed<00:07:44.210> it

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 
kind of sensitive about that guessed it

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.160 
kind of sensitive about that guessed it
so<00:07:46.110> anyway<00:07:46.940> hopefully<00:07:47.940> I'll<00:07:48.210> be<00:07:48.270> get<00:07:48.930> around
