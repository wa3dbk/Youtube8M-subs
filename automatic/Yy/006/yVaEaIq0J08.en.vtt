00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.670 

it's<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.760> unique<00:04:10.060> thing<00:04:10.260> seven<00:04:11.260> miles<00:04:11.440> away

put<00:04:18.220> winners<00:04:18.580> out<00:04:18.760> there<00:04:18.970> but<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.480> think<00:04:20.380> boys

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
put winners out there but I think boys

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.140 
put winners out there but I think boys
basketball<00:04:20.980> and<00:04:21.370> girls<00:04:21.430> volleyball<00:04:21.700> is<00:04:22.030> where

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
basketball and girls volleyball is where

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.200 
basketball and girls volleyball is where
you<00:04:22.240> see<00:04:22.420> it<00:04:22.510> manifest<00:04:22.720> itself<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.560> most<00:04:24.210> it

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
you see it manifest itself the most it

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.210 
you see it manifest itself the most it
is<00:04:25.390> an<00:04:25.540> intense<00:04:25.870> rivalry<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:26.590> think<00:04:26.890> that's<00:04:27.070> one

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
is an intense rivalry I think that's one

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.100 
is an intense rivalry I think that's one
word<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.520> describe<00:04:27.670> it<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.270> think<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.780> has<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.930> lot

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
word to describe it I think it has a lot

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.960 
word to describe it I think it has a lot
to<00:04:29.140> do<00:04:29.410> with<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:30.330> people<00:04:31.330> involved<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.370> think<00:04:33.370> I

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
to do with the people involved I think I

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.140 
to do with the people involved I think I
think<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.300> really<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.200> rivalry<00:04:35.680> starts<00:04:36.190> with

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
think it really the rivalry starts with

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.300
