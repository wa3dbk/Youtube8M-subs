with the theme of looking at some
traditional<00:00:10.040> origami<00:00:10.280> and<00:00:10.730> we're<00:00:10.880> going<00:00:11.059> to

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
traditional origami and we're going to

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.940 
traditional origami and we're going to
make<00:00:11.300> another<00:00:11.540> variation<00:00:11.929> of<00:00:12.170> a<00:00:12.290> jumping<00:00:12.650> frog

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
make another variation of a jumping frog

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.730 
make another variation of a jumping frog
now<00:00:13.670> this<00:00:13.849> particular<00:00:14.420> design<00:00:14.750> is<00:00:15.110> I<00:00:15.469> believe

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
now this particular design is I believe

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.019 
now this particular design is I believe
in<00:00:16.580> from<00:00:17.119> America<00:00:17.570> and<00:00:17.720> maybe<00:00:18.430> but<00:00:19.430> it's<00:00:19.669> a

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
in from America and maybe but it's a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.490 
in from America and maybe but it's a
little<00:00:20.419> different<00:00:20.720> from<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.050> one<00:00:21.169> we've<00:00:21.320> done

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
little different from the one we've done

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.530 
little different from the one we've done
before<00:00:21.919> and<00:00:22.160> does<00:00:22.730> create<00:00:22.880> some<00:00:23.119> kind<00:00:23.239> of<00:00:23.360> cool

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
before and does create some kind of cool

before and does create some kind of cool
little<00:00:23.660> pattern<00:00:24.140> on<00:00:24.320> his<00:00:24.439> back<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:25.059> this

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:26.059 
little pattern on his back and this

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.630 
little pattern on his back and this

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
the dimensions of the Frog when we're

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.360 
the dimensions of the Frog when we're
done<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:36.560> that<00:00:36.680> you<00:00:36.770> could<00:00:36.950> tell<00:00:37.130> if<00:00:37.250> you're

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
done so that you could tell if you're

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.320 
done so that you could tell if you're
trying<00:00:37.580> to<00:00:37.610> make<00:00:37.790> it<00:00:37.820> for<00:00:38.150> something

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
trying to make it for something

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.240 
trying to make it for something
particular<00:00:38.810> he<00:00:39.530> does<00:00:39.680> have<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:39.890> good<00:00:40.040> little

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
particular he does have a good little

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.760 
particular he does have a good little
pop<00:00:40.430> about<00:00:40.730> him<00:00:40.880> so<00:00:41.630> he<00:00:41.990> works<00:00:42.320> pretty<00:00:42.530> good

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
pop about him so he works pretty good

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.580 
pop about him so he works pretty good
that's<00:00:42.890> in<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:43.460> sense<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.880> think<00:00:44.470> we'll<00:00:45.470> be

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
that's in that sense I think we'll be

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.290 
that's in that sense I think we'll be
going<00:00:45.830> ahead<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.160> starting<00:00:46.610> here<00:00:46.850> with<00:00:47.090> our

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
going ahead and starting here with our

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.600

paper and you want to start with the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.819 
paper and you want to start with the
waterbomb<00:00:50.120> base<00:00:50.150> so<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.079> do<00:00:51.470> that<00:00:51.620> I'm<00:00:51.710> going

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
waterbomb base so to do that I'm going

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.230 
waterbomb base so to do that I'm going
to<00:00:51.860> start<00:00:52.070> with<00:00:52.160> my<00:00:52.250> color<00:00:52.520> side<00:00:52.820> facing<00:00:53.210> down

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
half diagonally here to get a good big

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.540 
half diagonally here to get a good big
triangle<00:00:59.570> going<00:00:59.829> open<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:00.920> up<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.220> fold<00:01:01.370> the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
you get all of these creases going to

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.070 
you get all of these creases going to
help<00:01:18.470> us<00:01:18.650> make<00:01:18.890> our<00:01:19.100> water<00:01:19.400> bomb<00:01:19.670> base<00:01:19.990> open<00:01:20.990> up

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
help us make our water bomb base open up

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.750 
help us make our water bomb base open up
to<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.290> color<00:01:21.470> side<00:01:21.770> find<00:01:22.130> those<00:01:22.280> diagonal

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
to the color side find those diagonal

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.300 
to the color side find those diagonal
creases<00:01:23.260> hold<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:24.409> like<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.560> diamond<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.159> just

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
creases hold it like a diamond and just

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.430 
creases hold it like a diamond and just
pinch<00:01:25.610> on<00:01:25.909> opposite<00:01:26.450> sides<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:26.960> just<00:01:27.170> kind<00:01:27.409> of

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
pinch on opposite sides and just kind of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.750 
pinch on opposite sides and just kind of
put<00:01:27.620> a<00:01:27.650> little<00:01:27.680> pressure<00:01:28.040> into<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.460> middle

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
put a little pressure into the middle

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.750 
put a little pressure into the middle
until<00:01:29.000> everything<00:01:29.450> shimmies<00:01:29.930> around<00:01:30.729> into<00:01:31.729> a

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
until everything shimmies around into a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.020 
until everything shimmies around into a
nice<00:01:31.970> little<00:01:32.119> triangle<00:01:32.799> smooth<00:01:33.799> it<00:01:33.950> out<00:01:34.040> here

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.010 

now<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.090> next<00:01:38.330> thing<00:01:38.390> we're<00:01:38.540> going<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.690> do<00:01:38.810> is

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
now the next thing we're going to do is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.920 
now the next thing we're going to do is
take<00:01:39.409> this<00:01:40.340> flap<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.420> see<00:01:41.600> here<00:01:41.840> and

take this flap that you see here and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.680 
take this flap that you see here and
take<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.229> outer<00:01:42.409> top<00:01:42.950> edge<00:01:43.220> there<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.880> roll

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
take the outer top edge there and roll

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.490 
take the outer top edge there and roll
it<00:01:44.840> down<00:01:45.049> towards<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.799> center<00:01:47.290> I'm<00:01:48.290> going<00:01:48.439> to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
it down towards the center I'm going to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.440 
it down towards the center I'm going to
do<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.710> same<00:01:48.950> thing<00:01:49.189> on<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:49.460> side<00:01:49.700> too<00:01:50.000> I'm

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
do the same thing on this side too I'm

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.260 
do the same thing on this side too I'm
just<00:01:50.659> rolling<00:01:50.930> into<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.350> center<00:01:55.150> then<00:01:56.150> I'm

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
just rolling into the center then I'm

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.399 
just rolling into the center then I'm
going<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.570> make<00:01:56.689> things<00:01:56.900> just<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.380> little

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
going to make things just a little

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.670 
going to make things just a little
narrower<00:01:58.070> by<00:01:58.490> taking<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.630> center<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.350> edge<00:02:00.500> I

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
narrower by taking the center the edge I

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.080 
narrower by taking the center the edge I
just<00:02:00.860> put<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.369> center<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.729> folding<00:02:02.000> it

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
just put to the center and folding it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.230 
just put to the center and folding it
back<00:02:02.119> out<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.350> edge<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.710> made<00:02:03.920> here<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:04.460> it's

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
back out to the edge I made here so it's

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.429 
back out to the edge I made here so it's
good<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.479> go<00:02:05.570> ahead<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.780> start<00:02:06.080> up<00:02:06.140> at<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.350> top

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
good to go ahead and start up at the top

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.440 
good to go ahead and start up at the top
where<00:02:07.009> it's<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.220> little<00:02:07.430> narrower<00:02:07.790> get<00:02:08.299> that

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
where it's a little narrower get that

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.929 
where it's a little narrower get that
kind<00:02:08.659> of<00:02:08.689> started<00:02:09.200> good<00:02:09.409> and<00:02:09.709> then<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.519> fold

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
kind of started good and then just fold

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.640 
kind of started good and then just fold
everything<00:02:11.269> down<00:02:11.689> to<00:02:12.019> match<00:02:12.169> up<00:02:12.379> with<00:02:12.529> that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
everything down to match up with that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.560 
everything down to match up with that
edge

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
edge

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.850 
edge
so<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.660> get<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> nice<00:02:15.020> little<00:02:15.230> narrow<00:02:15.530> piece

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
so you get a nice little narrow piece

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:27.280 
so you get a nice little narrow piece
there<00:02:16.130> I'll<00:02:17.030> do<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.420> side<00:02:17.630> too<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:27.020> we<00:02:27.140> wind

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
there I'll do this side too so we wind

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.680 
there I'll do this side too so we wind
up<00:02:27.410> with<00:02:27.470> something<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.070> looks<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.340> this

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
up with something that looks like this

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.200 
up with something that looks like this
then<00:02:29.690> flip<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.050> over<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.470> we'll<00:02:31.220> take<00:02:31.490> these

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
then flip it over and we'll take these

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.570 
then flip it over and we'll take these
flaps<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.110> take<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.380> bottom<00:02:33.710> right<00:02:33.920> tip<00:02:34.250> and

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
flaps and take the bottom right tip and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.610 
flaps and take the bottom right tip and
fold<00:02:34.820> straight<00:02:35.270> up<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.720> top<00:02:35.960> making<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.410> big

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
fold straight up to the top making a big

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.850 
fold straight up to the top making a big
triangle<00:02:36.980> here<00:02:38.080> do<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.200> same<00:02:39.410> thing<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.740> this

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
triangle here do the same thing on this

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.480 
triangle here do the same thing on this
side<00:02:40.100> too<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:45.380> then<00:02:45.860> once<00:02:46.070> you've<00:02:46.190> gotten

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
side too and then once you've gotten

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.580 
side too and then once you've gotten
those<00:02:46.640> folded<00:02:47.150> up<00:02:47.420> I'm<00:02:47.930> going<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.140> fold<00:02:48.350> these

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
those folded up I'm going to fold these

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.700 
those folded up I'm going to fold these
tips<00:02:49.010> back<00:02:49.280> down<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:50.240> this<00:02:50.510> these<00:02:51.140> two<00:02:51.410> sides

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
tips back down to this these two sides

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.620 
tips back down to this these two sides
here<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.310> just<00:02:52.760> bring<00:02:52.970> them<00:02:53.120> down

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
here so you just bring them down

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.720 
here so you just bring them down
you'll<00:02:54.050> make<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.260> little<00:02:54.440> tiny<00:02:54.770> triangle<00:02:55.430> here

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
you'll make a little tiny triangle here

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.350 
you'll make a little tiny triangle here
and<00:02:56.590> then<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:57.860> side<00:02:57.920> as<00:02:58.280> well<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:01.360> then

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
and then on this side as well and then

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.450 
and then on this side as well and then
I'm<00:03:02.450> gonna<00:03:02.570> take<00:03:02.900> each<00:03:03.290> of<00:03:03.680> those<00:03:03.770> tips<00:03:04.100> again

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
I'm gonna take each of those tips again

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.850 
I'm gonna take each of those tips again
and<00:03:04.760> fold<00:03:05.000> them<00:03:05.120> up<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.660> I'm<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.410> gonna<00:03:06.560> try

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
and fold them up and I'm just gonna try

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.400 
and fold them up and I'm just gonna try
to<00:03:06.950> do<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:07.520> that<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.730> it's<00:03:08.060> not<00:03:08.300> exactly<00:03:08.780> even

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
to do it so that I it's not exactly even

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.870 
to do it so that I it's not exactly even
I'm<00:03:09.620> just<00:03:09.800> gonna<00:03:09.920> let<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.160> stick<00:03:10.430> out<00:03:10.580> just<00:03:10.790> a

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
I'm just gonna let it stick out just a

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.940 
I'm just gonna let it stick out just a
tiny<00:03:11.090> bit<00:03:11.300> so<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.660> can<00:03:11.870> see<00:03:12.140> where<00:03:12.350> my<00:03:12.500> feet

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
tiny bit so that I can see where my feet

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.930 
tiny bit so that I can see where my feet
are<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.220> little<00:03:13.580> when<00:03:13.820> I<00:03:13.850> do<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.760> give

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
are a little when I do this so give

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.730 
are a little when I do this so give
yourself<00:03:17.300> just<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.540> little<00:03:17.780> bit<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.140> stuff<00:03:18.470> to

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
yourself just a little bit of stuff to

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.100 
yourself just a little bit of stuff to
stick<00:03:18.980> out<00:03:19.100> there<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.430> show<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.840> then<00:03:20.960> we're

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
stick out there to show and then we're

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.650 
stick out there to show and then we're
going<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.350> do<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.920> really<00:03:22.730> simple<00:03:23.180> little

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
going to do a really simple little

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.510 
going to do a really simple little
zigzag<00:03:24.140> fold<00:03:24.350> down<00:03:24.590> here<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:25.010> kind<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.280> try<00:03:25.490> to

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
zigzag fold down here to kind of try to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.200 
zigzag fold down here to kind of try to
get<00:03:25.760> our<00:03:26.270> creases<00:03:27.020> going<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:28.610> easiest<00:03:28.970> thing

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
get our creases going the easiest thing

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.030 
get our creases going the easiest thing
first<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.690> we're<00:03:29.870> gonna<00:03:29.990> fold<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.740> create<00:03:31.010> a

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
first is we're gonna fold and create a

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.980 
first is we're gonna fold and create a
crease<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.370> runs<00:03:31.550> right<00:03:31.970> here<00:03:32.570> at<00:03:32.720> these

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
crease that runs right here at these

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.080 
crease that runs right here at these
points<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.100> I<00:03:34.130> can<00:03:34.160> just<00:03:34.490> essentially<00:03:34.910> kind<00:03:35.000> of

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
points so I can just essentially kind of

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.060 
points so I can just essentially kind of
fold<00:03:35.330> things<00:03:35.570> in<00:03:35.780> half<00:03:35.990> right<00:03:36.320> where<00:03:36.620> that

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
fold things in half right where that

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.490 
fold things in half right where that
crease<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.610> take<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.600> really<00:03:38.840> good<00:03:39.140> crease

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
crease is take a really good crease

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.170 
crease is take a really good crease
there<00:03:41.170> open<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.230> up<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.440> little<00:03:42.590> bit<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.520> if<00:03:44.060> we

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
there open it up a little bit and if we

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.850 
there open it up a little bit and if we
kind<00:03:44.300> of<00:03:44.450> flip<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.750> over<00:03:44.870> for<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.260> second<00:03:45.710> and

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
kind of flip it over for a second and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.500 
kind of flip it over for a second and
look<00:03:46.130> at<00:03:46.280> just<00:03:46.460> this<00:03:46.610> section<00:03:46.940> where<00:03:47.390> we

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
look at just this section where we

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.800 
look at just this section where we
folded<00:03:47.870> down<00:03:48.050> I<00:03:48.380> then<00:03:48.980> want<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.370> fold<00:03:50.300> down<00:03:50.540> and

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
folded down I then want to fold down and

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.350 
folded down I then want to fold down and
then<00:03:51.020> bring<00:03:51.170> this<00:03:51.500> up<00:03:51.800> to<00:03:52.280> meet<00:03:52.520> that<00:03:52.820> area

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
then bring this up to meet that area

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.720 
then bring this up to meet that area
there<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:57.320> you<00:03:57.410> get<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.530> nice<00:03:57.710> little<00:03:57.890> Criss<00:03:58.400> a

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
there so you get a nice little Criss a

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.700 
there so you get a nice little Criss a
little<00:03:59.060> crease<00:03:59.300> there<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.630> zigzag<00:04:00.050> crease<00:04:00.290> and

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
little crease there of zigzag crease and

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.800 
little crease there of zigzag crease and
that<00:04:01.280> should<00:04:01.520> give<00:04:01.670> you<00:04:01.880> your<00:04:02.090> completed

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
that should give you your completed

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.400 
that should give you your completed
little<00:04:03.170> froggy<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:04.400> as<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.760> can<00:04:04.880> see<00:04:04.940> here<00:04:05.270> he

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
little froggy and as you can see here he

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.140 
little froggy and as you can see here he
he<00:04:06.410> flips<00:04:06.740> that's<00:04:07.130> cool<00:04:07.370> he's<00:04:07.490> a<00:04:07.520> flippin<00:04:08.000> frog

most<00:04:47.030> action<00:04:47.720> origami<00:04:48.290> these<00:04:48.650> do<00:04:48.920> tend<00:04:49.220> to

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
most action origami these do tend to

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.130 
most action origami these do tend to
work<00:04:49.460> better<00:04:49.670> that<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.210> keep<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.630> paper<00:04:50.810> kind

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
work better that you keep the paper kind

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.740 
work better that you keep the paper kind
of<00:04:51.260> small<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:51.950> this<00:04:52.250> size<00:04:52.520> or<00:04:52.970> smaller<00:04:53.630> is

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
of small so this size or smaller is

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.820 
of small so this size or smaller is
probably<00:04:54.080> going<00:04:54.200> to<00:04:54.290> give<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.620> best

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
probably going to give you the best

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.080 
probably going to give you the best
results<00:04:55.310> if<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.520> use<00:04:55.640> something<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:55.880> little

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
results if you use something a little

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.940 
results if you use something a little
bigger<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.420> may<00:04:56.540> not<00:04:56.720> quite<00:04:57.050> jump<00:04:57.410> as<00:04:57.560> good<00:04:57.830> as

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
bigger it may not quite jump as good as

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.610 
bigger it may not quite jump as good as
it<00:04:58.100> should<00:04:58.130> so<00:04:58.670> but<00:04:59.570> that<00:04:59.720> is<00:04:59.990> our<00:05:00.410> little

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
it should so but that is our little

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.190 
it should so but that is our little
