watermelon<00:00:30.179> because<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.810> weird<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.669> already

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
watermelon because it's weird I already

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.100 
watermelon because it's weird I already
got<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> raisins<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.660> boil<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
got the raisins on the boil and do a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.170 
got the raisins on the boil and do a
quick<00:00:37.860> hydrometer<00:00:38.550> reading<00:00:38.700> let's<00:00:39.030> see

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
quick hydrometer reading let's see

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.549 
quick hydrometer reading let's see
what's<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> think<00:00:39.930> I'm<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> add

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
what's in here I think I'm going to add

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.190 
what's in here I think I'm going to add
about<00:00:40.739> maybe<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.579> cup<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> half<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.690> sugar

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.260 

let's<00:00:46.200> get<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.970 

alright<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> specific<00:00:55.170> gravity<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.649> this

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
alright so the specific gravity of this

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.630 
alright so the specific gravity of this
by<00:00:56.280> itself<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.050> one<00:00:58.050> point<00:00:58.410> zero<00:00:58.500> five<00:00:59.100> zero<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
by itself is one point zero five zero it

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.549 
by itself is one point zero five zero it
came<00:00:59.850> out<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.359> about<00:01:00.510> six<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.530> seven

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
came out to be about six to seven

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.799 
came out to be about six to seven
percent<00:01:01.949> alcohol<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> be

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
percent alcohol it's not going to be

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.719 
percent alcohol it's not going to be
exactly<00:01:04.290> accurate<00:01:04.589> because<00:01:05.189> there<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:05.489> other

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
exactly accurate because there are other

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.490 
exactly accurate because there are other
dissolved<00:01:06.330> solids<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.350> they

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
dissolved solids in here you know they

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100 
dissolved solids in here you know they
add<00:01:07.619> their<00:01:07.860> shit<00:01:08.570> I'm<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
add their shit I'm going to take a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
add their shit I'm going to take a
little<00:01:10.350> bit<00:01:10.500> more<00:01:10.740> out<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.159> I've<00:01:11.430> decided

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
little bit more out of this I've decided

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.840 
little bit more out of this I've decided
I'm<00:01:12.030> only<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> add<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> cup<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.140> sugar

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
I'm only going to add a cup of sugar

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.980 
I'm only going to add a cup of sugar
you're<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> put<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.420> bit<00:01:15.600> here<00:01:15.900> in

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
you're going to put a little bit here in

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.929 
you're going to put a little bit here in
this<00:01:16.140> pan<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> use<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.759> my

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this pan and I'm going to use that as my

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.640 
this pan and I'm going to use that as my
yeast<00:01:18.150> starter<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:18.780> if<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.200> use<00:01:19.380> water

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
yeast starter because if I use water

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.780 
yeast starter because if I use water
people<00:01:20.009> start<00:01:20.400> bitching<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:23.310> doesn't<00:01:23.640> really

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
people start bitching it doesn't really

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.550 
people start bitching it doesn't really
matters<00:01:24.180> throw<00:01:24.390> some<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> hot

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
matters throw some in there get it hot

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:50.390 
matters throw some in there get it hot
throw<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.159> yeast<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> deal

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.620 

alright<00:01:51.400> now<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:51.580> I've<00:01:51.759> added<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.270> cup<00:01:52.479> of

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
alright now that I've added the cup of

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.580 
alright now that I've added the cup of
sugar<00:01:52.840> I'm<00:01:53.049> going<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.290> take<00:01:53.440> another

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
sugar I'm going to take another

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:07.370 
sugar I'm going to take another
hydrometer<00:01:54.460> reading

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.290 

all<00:02:07.979> right<00:02:08.130> so<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> new<00:02:08.520> hydrometer<00:02:09.149> reading

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
all right so the new hydrometer reading

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.410 
all right so the new hydrometer reading
is<00:02:09.630> one<00:02:09.869> point<00:02:10.200> zero<00:02:10.560> one<00:02:10.860> zero<00:02:10.890> or<00:02:11.640> fourteen

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
is one point zero one zero or fourteen

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.530 
is one point zero one zero or fourteen
to<00:02:12.780> fifteen<00:02:12.959> percent<00:02:13.650> potential<00:02:14.220> alcohol<00:02:14.700> now

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
to fifteen percent potential alcohol now

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.089 
to fifteen percent potential alcohol now
as<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.780> said<00:02:15.840> before<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.380> may<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:16.950> that

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
as I said before that may not be that

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.130 
as I said before that may not be that
accurate<00:02:17.400> because<00:02:17.790> there<00:02:18.420> are<00:02:18.569> dissolved

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
accurate because there are dissolved

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.170 
accurate because there are dissolved
other<00:02:19.380> dissolved<00:02:19.950> solids<00:02:20.459> within<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:21.000> you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
other dissolved solids within this you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.199 
other dissolved solids within this you
know<00:02:21.300> they're<00:02:21.450> additives<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.170> stuff<00:02:23.209> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
know they're additives and stuff the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.570 
know they're additives and stuff the
raisin<00:02:24.690> mash<00:02:24.900> East<00:02:25.260> nutrient<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:25.980> ready<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.430> go

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
raisin mash East nutrient is ready to go

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.910 
raisin mash East nutrient is ready to go
I'll<00:02:26.730> add<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.569> second<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
I'll add that here in a second and the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.729 
I'll add that here in a second and the
yeast<00:02:29.550> starter<00:02:30.330> solution<00:02:31.050> or<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.349> just<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
yeast starter solution or it's just the

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.979 
yeast starter solution or it's just the
juice<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.250> cooling<00:02:33.060> down<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.599> had<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
juice is cooling down and all had the

00:02:33.989 --> 00:03:45.670 
juice is cooling down and all had the
yeast<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.590> here<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.980> second

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.770 

and<00:03:46.220> there<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.489> go<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.790> as<00:03:46.939> usual<00:03:47.480> I'll<00:03:47.629> let

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
and there we go and as usual I'll let

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.550 
and there we go and as usual I'll let
this<00:03:47.959> sit<00:03:48.409> for<00:03:48.439> you<00:03:49.040> know<00:03:49.129> maybe<00:03:50.200> between<00:03:51.200> 5

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
this sit for you know maybe between 5

and 14 days and then I'll rack in it and
all<00:03:55.459> depends<00:03:56.739> when<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.829> East<00:03:58.040> starts<00:03:58.310> going

right<00:03:59.900> it'll<00:04:00.019> be<00:04:00.079> fizzing<00:04:00.590> like<00:04:00.739> crazy<00:04:01.040> almost

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310

like<00:04:01.610> it's<00:04:01.790> carbonated<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:04.220> I<00:04:04.579> get<00:04:04.730> this

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
like it's carbonated and I get this

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.429 
like it's carbonated and I get this
question<00:04:05.209> a<00:04:05.480> lot<00:04:05.629> is<00:04:05.780> how<00:04:05.930> do<00:04:05.989> you<00:04:06.049> know<00:04:06.260> when
