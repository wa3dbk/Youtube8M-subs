00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.080
 ok how does that work in that 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.320
 gearboxes in that engine and me 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.670
 I still do wonder tool just a question of 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.110
 yes the clutch is not kicking what 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.510
 happens then or what do I feel now 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.680
 exactly through this image 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.820
 I explain very clearly what is there 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.950
 actually happened like you for example 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.510
 kick a clutch or a little one 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.710
 chat 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.600
 I can show very clearly too 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.250
 ultimately how that drive 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.690
 ultimately what comes about 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.940
 happens and whatever you have learned 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.050
 are slipping away 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.300
 link and so on 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.300
 well I'm going to tell something about it again 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.450
 the first thing you see that is on this 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.130
 The picture is that it is in its free position 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:01.700
 yes as here the boat is free 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.680
 the engine runs no that tour the third 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.540
 there are 800 rpm 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.710
 maria it's not in the region that comes 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.080
 because of course he is not in his 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.790
 gear state 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.090
 link is up as you see all of you 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.289
 may the linking and releasing show yes see 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.360
 you can then just turn it up 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.590
 not finish at times when the link 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.990
 go down stairs 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.520
 as we see here he has it when you have it 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.030
 there is no contact 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.540
 see that is empty with the gear and the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 engine in this are clutch plates 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.000
 so if you go that link now 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.890
 kicking in stupid is dramatic and then 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.150
 happens as follows nose and therefore kicked in 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.260
 this tank clutch plates go out 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.580
 each other 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.880
 where I still have no contact with one 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.189
 speed box honor that ok and you go 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.840
 miss a move so a stick 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.460
 put in his do but once yes then have 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.380
 you put the gear together 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.210
 for him the connection to the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.710
 clutch plate 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.170
 in each other 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.310
 as have compared this in pictures 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.840
 so then put in his well 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.740
 we go there as the starting point 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840
 let stand 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.020
 so if the link up nature later 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.510
 yes we are going to these two plates 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.820
 towards each other yes and so it 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.080
 drive sprint and let it stand 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.900
 let the clutch go up quietly 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.090
 and then will also connect then the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.530
 connection between the engine and 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.800
 the gearbox which ultimately 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.300
 so drive to the wheels 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.250
 So if you are in it is one drives up 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.780
 or gently what you just asked of him 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.760
 I now inhibit that the head does not enter 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.680
 what happens then he sees he stays 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.090
 then keep in touch with the engine through which 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.810
 which of course catches on at the moment that 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.700
 you are going to brake 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.680
 yes you want to stay but drive 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.810
 and that of course was not possible 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.190
 kicks you in there so the clutch again 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.410
 link 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.959
 and said plate apart kicks and has 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.720
 no more connection between it 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.580
 an engine and gearbox and so that 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.440
 what is actually quite a while yes 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.310
 simply said happens in the engine 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.530
 in other words 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.880
 and the gearbox yes well okay well me 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.080
 hope that is a bit clear that is 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.280
 not really very good to see on it 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.200
 picture 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.670
 at least celebrate the film then on so 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.930
 assuming the book is very good to play 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.310
 see 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.660
 and you can also do this again 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.950
 look again on youtube patient 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.390
 finds interesting 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.989
 happens later and I think there is one 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:30.750
 people here have something to 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.750
 yes well ok where will we continue?
