00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
to her father and as she's having this

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.260

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
conversation with him it's as if she's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.910

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.680 
being pulled over by the cops yeah it's
just<00:00:46.070> like<00:00:46.190> preposterous<00:00:46.940> amounts<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.510> light

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690
