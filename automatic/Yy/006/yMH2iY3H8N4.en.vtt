more kind of Simon like
three-dimensional<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.729> sometimes<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.360> we'll

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
three-dimensional or sometimes so we'll

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.720 
three-dimensional or sometimes so we'll
just<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:28.110> ahead

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
thing I have to say about it but for

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.860 
thing I have to say about it but for
three<00:03:35.379> RL<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.920> we're<00:03:36.220> not<00:03:36.400> compromising<00:03:36.970> like

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
three RL and we're not compromising like

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.909 
three RL and we're not compromising like
350<00:03:38.440> we're<00:03:38.620> not<00:03:38.769> compromising<00:03:39.280> on<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.819> color

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.119 
even worth drawing it because I mean but
I'm<00:05:14.360> pretty<00:05:14.539> sure<00:05:14.690> there's<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:15.379> shadows<00:05:15.860> that<00:05:15.889> I

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 
I'm pretty sure there's I shadows that I

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.029 
I'm pretty sure there's I shadows that I
bought<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.460> I've<00:05:16.819> been<00:05:17.000> more<00:05:17.240> expensive

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
bought that I've been more expensive

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.649 
bought that I've been more expensive
than<00:05:19.039> this<00:05:19.280> like<00:05:19.639> this<00:05:19.819> was<00:05:20.060> only<00:05:20.270> three<00:05:20.479> year

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
than this like this was only three year

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:26.550 
than this like this was only three year
old<00:05:20.810> 50<00:05:21.520> or<00:05:22.520> something<00:05:22.669> like<00:05:22.940> that<00:05:23.000> and

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.230 

they've<00:05:27.560> been<00:05:27.770> I<00:05:28.069> shadows<00:05:28.610> that<00:05:28.759> I<00:05:28.909> thought

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
they've been I shadows that I thought

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.850 
they've been I shadows that I thought
that<00:05:29.479> have<00:05:29.629> been<00:05:29.750> much<00:05:29.930> more<00:05:29.960> expensive<00:05:30.469> than

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
that have been much more expensive than

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.029 
that have been much more expensive than
this<00:05:31.009> and<00:05:32.050> just<00:05:33.050> been<00:05:33.259> crap<00:05:34.629> so<00:05:35.629> it's<00:05:36.439> nice<00:05:36.770> to

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
this and just been crap so it's nice to

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.879 
this and just been crap so it's nice to
point<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.759> get<00:05:37.909> something<00:05:38.210> really<00:05:39.199> cheap<00:05:39.439> that

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
point to get something really cheap that

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.040 
point to get something really cheap that
works<00:05:40.219> really<00:05:40.550> really<00:05:40.699> well<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.300> I<00:05:41.690> think<00:05:41.719> the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
works really really well and I think the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.600 
works really really well and I think the
ones<00:05:42.259> you<00:05:42.349> put<00:05:42.560> a<00:05:42.590> base<00:05:42.800> on<00:05:43.039> I<00:05:43.279> don't<00:05:43.550> think

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
ones you put a base on I don't think

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.050 
ones you put a base on I don't think
it's<00:05:43.879> gonna<00:05:44.029> Forge<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:47.500> yeah<00:05:48.500> so<00:05:49.430> that's

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
it's gonna Forge and yeah so that's

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.659 
it's gonna Forge and yeah so that's
really<00:05:50.419> really<00:05:50.870> good<00:05:51.020> bye<00:05:51.349> and<00:05:54.580> thanks<00:05:55.580> for

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669
