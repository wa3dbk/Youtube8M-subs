00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.679
 intelligence is in simplicity 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:14.570
 in everything starts with an idea with the 

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:16.460
 smartphones htc my passion for the 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.869
 cinema goes back to early childhood I 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.430
 dreamed of seeing horror movies and 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.900
 it was not allowed and my grandfather 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.490
 buy me horror film magazines 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.500
 I cut them out and and I made 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.750
 photo novels with frankenstein dracula 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.789
 he offered me also with the barbarian the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.289
 4 fantastic finally all this so the 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.269
 frozen cinema known first in photo and 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.469
 first by cutting and gluing this 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.809
 which makes that naturally I am 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.920
 became comics cartoonist the 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.880
 Rabbi's cat base is that I have 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.840
 bought a little cat that had 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.090
 big ears who was crazy in love 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.100
 from my wife and that was very funny and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.239
 he did not care about anything so at 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.350
 whenever I was concerned about 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.579
 something I look at it and I get 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.079
 was making my veils of the selfish oil he 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.430
 is right and after a while I get 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.899
 I'm going to draw it then I'm 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.980
 put it to talk and I got 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.329
 insight that he made others laugh 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.350
 so as soon as we make others laugh 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.270
 says good, it's good they want good 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.980
 me this is a door that opens 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.899
 the idea of ​​transposing the rabbi's cat 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.039
 in the movies it terrorizes me and because 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.750
 early I told myself that it was necessary to write 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.189
 a movie scenario as we see 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.630
 to do by staging a scene 2 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.770
 and now I know how to make bands 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.219
 drawn so I wrote in tape 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.319
 cartoon 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.549
 once we agree to be like 

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.319
 love i'm like popeye i'm what 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.609
 I am so my way of writing is 

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:14.749
 cartoon boxes then after 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.159
 I discovered that the guys who were doing 

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:17.599
 bob the sponged job is the same so I 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.679
 I said to myself I'm not the only one 

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.819
 I discovered that miyazaki was doing 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.259
 I like good bah there is at least one 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.869
 three motivation to put the cat 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.639
 from rabbi to cinema it's 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.109
 give a wider spread can 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:29.929
 be told to the ideas that defends this 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.810
 this story, that is to say de-dramatize 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.649
 religious issues accept that 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.529
 accept that we do not agree and 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.579
 we're going to have this friend put this 

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.689
 idea that in Jewish families and 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.609
 in Muslim families one can 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.229
 mess with religion I believe that 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.639
 everyone imagines that the Jews and 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.320
 the Muslims are likely this is 

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:47.690
 not so true 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.120
 I wanted to provoke 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.380
 I have the feeling that the cat 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.700
 of the rabbi that can be a subject of 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.020
 discussion even if we do not agree 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.850
 even if people come out of there saying 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.960
 you're too hard with the Jews were 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.220
 too hard with the Muslims were 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.110
 too hard with tintin I do not know 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.240
 but at least they come out of there with a 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.800
 discussion topic I am joann sfar 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.369
 I make drawings I make films 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.369
 as well 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.720
 it was all started with an idea with 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.720
 htc smartphones
