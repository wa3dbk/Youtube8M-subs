we're<00:00:01.410> gonna<00:00:01.500> do<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.800> demonstration<00:00:02.159> with<00:00:02.909> the

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
we're gonna do a demonstration with the

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.539 
we're gonna do a demonstration with the
pretreatment<00:00:03.540> application<00:00:04.230> onto<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> Gildan

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
pretreatment application onto a Gildan

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.179 
pretreatment application onto a Gildan
soft<00:00:05.910> style<00:00:06.180> shirt<00:00:06.420> with<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> Wagner<00:00:07.680> gun<00:00:07.890> we're

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
soft style shirt with a Wagner gun we're

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.589 
soft style shirt with a Wagner gun we're
going<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.370> keep<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.700> gun<00:00:08.849> moving<00:00:09.090> so<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.450> we

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
going to keep the gun moving so that we

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.509 
going to keep the gun moving so that we
have<00:00:09.840> an<00:00:09.929> even<00:00:10.139> application<00:00:10.440> process<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
have an even application process of the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.190 
have an even application process of the
pretreatment<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.599> we're<00:00:12.690> going<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.900> fill<00:00:13.049> in

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
pretreatment and we're going to fill in

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.650 
pretreatment and we're going to fill in
any<00:00:13.320> holes<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.889> see<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:15.000> very<00:00:15.299> end<00:00:15.509> of

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
any holes that we see at the very end of

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.800 
any holes that we see at the very end of
the<00:00:15.780> pretreatment<00:00:23.300> pretty<00:00:24.300> much<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.689> see

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the pretreatment pretty much you can see

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.750 
the pretreatment pretty much you can see
there's<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.080> nice<00:00:25.230> even<00:00:25.619> coating<00:00:25.859> here<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.400> can

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
there's a nice even coating here I can

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.099 
there's a nice even coating here I can
see<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> fibers<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:27.930> been

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
see that all of the fibers have been

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.529 
see that all of the fibers have been
pretty<00:00:28.619> well<00:00:28.859> coated<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.000> shirt<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
pretty well coated so this shirt is

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:41.270 
pretty well coated so this shirt is
ready<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.869> go<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.759> heat<00:00:32.759> press<00:00:40.280> we're

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
ready to go to the heat press we're

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.069 
ready to go to the heat press we're
using<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.640> standard<00:00:42.090> parchment<00:00:42.629> sheet<00:00:42.809> here

using a standard parchment sheet here

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.380 
using a standard parchment sheet here
just<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> prevent<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> pretreatment<00:00:44.910> from

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
just to prevent the pretreatment from

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.979 
just to prevent the pretreatment from
sticking<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> heat<00:00:46.620> press<00:00:46.649> directly<00:00:47.989> now

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
sticking to the heat press directly now

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
sticking to the heat press directly now
the<00:00:49.050> key<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.590> heat<00:00:50.039> press<00:00:50.250> securing

the key to the heat press securing

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.510 
the key to the heat press securing
process<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:52.020> even<00:00:52.520> medium

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
process is that we have an even medium

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.580 
process is that we have an even medium

pressure applied our stahls hotronix

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.560 
pressure applied our stahls hotronix
tells<00:00:56.340> us<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> pressure<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.270> three

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
tells us that the pressure is at three

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.930 
tells us that the pressure is at three
between<00:00:58.260> three<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.620> four<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> okay<00:00:59.250> too

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
between three and four is okay too

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490 
between three and four is okay too
little<00:01:00.149> pressure<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.079> heat<00:01:01.260> press

you're not going to be able to drive

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.240 
you're not going to be able to drive
down<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> fibers<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.350> shirt<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:05.010> with

the heat print with the pretreatment
that<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.170> been<00:01:07.320> applied<00:01:07.530> too<00:01:08.340> much

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that was just been applied too much

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
that was just been applied too much
pressure<00:01:08.909> we're<00:01:09.479> gonna<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
pressure we're gonna actually see that

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.010 
pressure we're gonna actually see that
the<00:01:10.619> moisture<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.729> gonna<00:01:11.939> stay<00:01:12.330> contained<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the moisture is gonna stay contained in

the moisture is gonna stay contained in
the<00:01:13.320> press<00:01:13.560> right<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:14.880> looking<00:01:15.210> at

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the press right now what I'm looking at

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.170 
the press right now what I'm looking at
is<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.869> wicking<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.820> aqueous

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
is the wicking off of the aqueous

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330 
is the wicking off of the aqueous
component<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> our<00:01:19.320> pretreatment<00:01:19.920> which<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
component of our pretreatment which is a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
component of our pretreatment which is a
good<00:01:20.580> sign<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.090> ensures<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.960> we're<00:01:22.049> going

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
good sign that ensures that we're going

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.350 
good sign that ensures that we're going
to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.320> drawing<00:01:22.560> off<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.009> shirt<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> there's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to be drawing off the shirt and there's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
to be drawing off the shirt and there's
going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> nice<00:01:24.869> level<00:01:25.110> application<00:01:25.890> of

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
going to be a nice level application of

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.819 
going to be a nice level application of
the<00:01:26.070> pretreatment<00:01:26.570> remaining<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.439> setting

demonstrating that after this shirt has
been<00:01:41.369> pressed<00:01:41.640> we're<00:01:41.820> gonna<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> nice

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
been pressed we're gonna have a nice
