is<00:02:45.540> slower<00:02:46.140> but<00:02:46.380> if<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.560> wanted<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.040> we'll

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
is slower but if you wanted to we'll

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.460 
is slower but if you wanted to we'll
cover<00:02:47.489> ground<00:02:47.760> quite<00:02:48.390> quickly<00:02:48.630> but<00:02:49.349> it's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
cover ground quite quickly but it's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.710 
cover ground quite quickly but it's
always<00:02:49.739> slightly<00:02:50.430> unengaging<00:02:51.000> slightly<00:02:51.630> on

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
always slightly unengaging slightly on

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
it it's not a bad way to to cross

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.490 
it it's not a bad way to to cross
country<00:02:59.819> but<00:03:00.330> it's<00:03:00.480> not<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.810> particularly

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
country but it's not a particularly

a<00:03:20.670> disappointment<00:03:21.390> well<00:03:22.110> no<00:03:22.290> it's

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
a disappointment well no it's

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.710 
a disappointment well no it's
unsurprising<00:03:23.519> really<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.599> way

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
unsurprising really that it is the way

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.199 
unsurprising really that it is the way
it<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:24.930> fast<00:03:25.590> polos<00:03:25.980> have<00:03:26.549> always<00:03:26.849> been<00:03:26.970> that

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
it is fast polos have always been that

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.660 
it is fast polos have always been that
well<00:03:27.870> there's<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.140> bad<00:03:28.349> car<00:03:28.650> far<00:03:29.250> from<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.489> in

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
well there's a bad car far from it in

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.069 
well there's a bad car far from it in
fact<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:30.209> just<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.480> it's<00:03:30.660> not<00:03:30.780> as<00:03:30.900> visible

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
fact it's just that it's not as visible

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.130 
fact it's just that it's not as visible
in<00:03:31.560> engaging<00:03:31.920> as<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.459> Renault<00:03:33.209> Sport<00:03:33.450> clio<00:03:33.750> or<00:03:33.870> a
