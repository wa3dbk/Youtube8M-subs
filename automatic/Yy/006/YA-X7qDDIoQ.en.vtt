searching<00:00:52.909> and<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:53.809> haven't<00:00:54.109> felt<00:00:54.379> like<00:00:54.679> I've

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
searching and I haven't felt like I've

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.950 
searching and I haven't felt like I've
found<00:00:55.190> anything<00:00:55.519> honestly<00:00:55.969> all<00:00:56.479> the<00:00:56.659> loot<00:00:56.839> is

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
found anything honestly all the loot is

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.660 
found anything honestly all the loot is
pretty<00:00:57.289> much<00:00:57.409> dried<00:00:57.679> up<00:00:57.859> after<00:00:58.280> this<00:00:58.399> update

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
pretty much dried up after this update

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.779 
pretty much dried up after this update
so<00:00:59.359> as<00:00:59.449> you<00:00:59.569> guys<00:00:59.690> probably<00:00:59.749> know<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:01.370> update

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
so as you guys probably know the update

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.309 
so as you guys probably know the update
brought<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.239> new<00:01:02.449> thing<00:01:02.780> where<00:01:03.049> you<00:01:03.170> can

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
brought a new thing where you can

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.530 
brought a new thing where you can
upgrade<00:01:03.499> walls<00:01:03.979> with<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.309> lick<00:01:04.640> sir<00:01:04.790> as<00:01:05.000> well<00:01:05.510> as

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
upgrade walls with a lick sir as well as

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.300 
upgrade walls with a lick sir as well as
gold<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.200> I'm<00:01:06.440> pretty<00:01:06.650> sure<00:01:06.740> we<00:01:07.010> can<00:01:07.040> all

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
gold and I'm pretty sure we can all

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.890 
gold and I'm pretty sure we can all
remember<00:01:07.670> going<00:01:08.060> through<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.480> loot<00:01:08.660> system

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
remember going through the loot system

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.170 
remember going through the loot system
and<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.740> know<00:01:09.770> searching<00:01:10.610> for<00:01:10.790> matches

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
and like you know searching for matches

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.390 
and like you know searching for matches
and<00:01:11.480> you<00:01:11.540> find<00:01:11.750> like<00:01:11.990> 100<00:01:12.410> k<00:01:12.620> gold<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.280> then

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
and you find like 100 k gold and then

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.970 
and you find like 100 k gold and then
300,000<00:01:14.330> elixir<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.230> probably<00:01:15.470> skip<00:01:15.830> it

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
300,000 elixir and you probably skip it

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.200 
300,000 elixir and you probably skip it
because<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.430> know<00:01:16.550> you<00:01:16.610> don't<00:01:16.790> really<00:01:16.880> care

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
because you know you don't really care

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.540 
because you know you don't really care
about<00:01:17.360> elixir<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.050> it<00:01:18.620> made<00:01:18.890> upgrades<00:01:19.340> like

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
about elixir and it made upgrades like

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.550 
about elixir and it made upgrades like
troops<00:01:20.000> in<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.690> lab<00:01:20.990> you'd<00:01:21.290> always<00:01:21.440> have

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
troops in the lab you'd always have

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.890 
troops in the lab you'd always have
something<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.130> do<00:01:22.340> always<00:01:23.300> have<00:01:23.480> something<00:01:23.720> to

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
something to do always have something to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.780 
something to do always have something to
spend<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.350> big<00:01:24.530> elixir<00:01:24.920> on<00:01:25.100> but<00:01:25.400> now<00:01:25.550> that

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
spend that big elixir on but now that

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.880 
spend that big elixir on but now that
there<00:01:25.940> is<00:01:26.090> nothing<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.840> I<00:01:27.170> mean<00:01:27.200> like<00:01:27.620> I

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
there is nothing and I mean like I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.490 
there is nothing and I mean like I
usually<00:01:28.340> would<00:01:28.730> farm<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.270> gold<00:01:29.540> one<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.080> now

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
usually would farm in gold one and now

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.410 
usually would farm in gold one and now
I've<00:01:30.770> switched<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.250> up<00:01:31.370> and<00:01:31.610> try<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.030> find<00:01:32.300> a

of<00:01:39.500> low<00:01:39.800> champs<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.400> pretty<00:01:40.760> dry<00:01:40.940> right<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:41.500> so

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
of low champs is pretty dry right now so

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.200 
of low champs is pretty dry right now so
hopefully<00:01:42.740> they<00:01:43.310> can<00:01:43.370> fix<00:01:43.550> this<00:01:43.940> in<00:01:44.120> the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
hopefully they can fix this in the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.700 
hopefully they can fix this in the
future<00:01:44.390> but<00:01:44.690> I<00:01:44.750> really<00:01:45.050> think<00:01:45.200> it's<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.500> big

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
future but I really think it's a big

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.320 
future but I really think it's a big
issue<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.250> game<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.180> making

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
issue to the game and it is making

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.900 
issue to the game and it is making
farming<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.170> big<00:01:48.440> pain<00:01:48.680> in<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.890> ass<00:01:49.010> because

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
farming a big pain in the ass because

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.940 
farming a big pain in the ass because
honestly<00:01:50.480> even<00:01:50.900> with<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.170> old<00:01:51.320> blue<00:01:51.500> system

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
honestly even with the old blue system

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.560 
honestly even with the old blue system
the<00:01:52.100> loot<00:01:52.250> was<00:01:52.430> pretty<00:01:52.760> decent<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.210> was<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.360> good

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
the loot was pretty decent it was a good

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.720 
the loot was pretty decent it was a good
loot<00:01:53.810> system<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.920> could<00:01:55.070> find<00:01:55.280> abandoned

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
loot system you could find abandoned

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.880 
loot system you could find abandoned
bases<00:01:56.240> pretty<00:01:56.540> easily<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.200> stuff<00:01:57.680> like<00:01:57.830> that

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
bases pretty easily and stuff like that

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.070 
bases pretty easily and stuff like that
but<00:01:58.340> now<00:01:58.520> it's<00:01:58.820> uh<00:01:58.909> it's<00:01:59.240> getting<00:01:59.870> a<00:01:59.930> lot

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
but now it's uh it's getting a lot

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.020 
but now it's uh it's getting a lot
harder<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.650> it's<00:02:00.740> making<00:02:01.130> upgrades<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.820> know

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
harder and it's making upgrades you know

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.620 
harder and it's making upgrades you know
not<00:02:02.540> as<00:02:02.840> easy<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.409> do<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.790> could<00:02:05.450> definitely

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
not as easy to do so I could definitely

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.199 
not as easy to do so I could definitely
see<00:02:05.900> this<00:02:06.200> could<00:02:06.440> promote<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.820> spending

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
see this could promote the the spending

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.330 
see this could promote the the spending
of<00:02:08.300> gems<00:02:08.629> more<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.289> game<00:02:09.530> but<00:02:09.890> who<00:02:10.190> really

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
of gems more in the game but who really

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.950 
of gems more in the game but who really
wants<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.759> do<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:10.970> go<00:02:11.330> out<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.660> way<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
wants to do that go out of the way and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.340 
wants to do that go out of the way and
spend

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
spend

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.190 
spend
chance<00:02:12.620> cuz<00:02:12.860> i<00:02:13.010> really<00:02:13.040> don't<00:02:13.730> i<00:02:14.240> mean<00:02:14.930> if

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
chance cuz i really don't i mean if

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.220 
chance cuz i really don't i mean if
that's<00:02:15.680> how<00:02:16.160> if<00:02:17.000> if<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.540> model<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.050> game

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
that's how if if the model of the game

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.820 
that's how if if the model of the game
is<00:02:18.470> gonna<00:02:18.620> change<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> pay-to-play<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:21.140> in

is gonna change to a pay-to-play and in

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.440 
is gonna change to a pay-to-play and in
order<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.190> get<00:02:22.310> all<00:02:22.430> your<00:02:22.550> upgrades<00:02:22.940> going<00:02:23.300> up

order to get all your upgrades going up

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.560 
order to get all your upgrades going up

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
then they're gonna start losing members

recommend you like possibly either

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.720

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
something about it maybe giving us a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.200 
something about it maybe giving us a
couple<00:03:03.440> more<00:03:03.650> levels<00:03:04.070> on<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.310> collectors<00:03:04.940> I

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
couple more levels on the collectors I

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.880 
couple more levels on the collectors I
actually<00:03:05.570> think<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:06.020> would<00:03:06.200> be<00:03:06.320> super<00:03:06.560> dope

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
actually think that would be super dope

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.120 
actually think that would be super dope
to<00:03:07.160> have<00:03:07.340> like<00:03:07.670> level<00:03:08.180> 13<00:03:08.780> or<00:03:09.110> 14<00:03:09.290> collectors

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
to have like level 13 or 14 collectors

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.030 
to have like level 13 or 14 collectors
you<00:03:10.400> know<00:03:10.430> give<00:03:11.360> us<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.660> little<00:03:11.840> bit<00:03:12.020> more<00:03:12.290> cash

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
you know give us a little bit more cash

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.770 
you know give us a little bit more cash
flow<00:03:13.340> going<00:03:13.610> into<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.060> game<00:03:14.210> I<00:03:14.270> think<00:03:14.660> that

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
flow going into the game I think that

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.570 
flow going into the game I think that
really<00:03:14.990> benefited<00:03:15.650> because<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.430> don't

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
really benefited because I don't

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.950 
really benefited because I don't
remember<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.030> last<00:03:17.060> time<00:03:17.360> they<00:03:17.630> actually

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
remember the last time they actually

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.780 
remember the last time they actually
upgraded<00:03:18.350> those<00:03:18.590> but<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:19.160> would<00:03:19.310> be<00:03:19.490> actually

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
upgraded those but it would be actually
