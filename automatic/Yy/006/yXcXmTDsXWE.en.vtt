find my remote control is chelsea you
won't

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.940 

so<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:08.620> took<00:04:09.620> my<00:04:09.860> trusted<00:04:10.870> statistics<00:04:11.950> these

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
so I took my trusted statistics these

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.229 
so I took my trusted statistics these
are<00:04:13.160> extremely<00:04:13.640> useful<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.900> keep<00:04:16.030> things<00:04:17.030> like

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
are extremely useful to keep things like

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.039 
are extremely useful to keep things like
a<00:04:17.269> picker<00:04:17.600> in<00:04:17.930> place<00:04:18.200> and<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.860> determine<00:04:20.049> where

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
a picker in place and to determine where

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.320 
a picker in place and to determine where
the<00:04:21.260> holes<00:04:21.500> are<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:22.010> do<00:04:22.220> not<00:04:22.430> match<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:25.330> we

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
the holes are that do not match and we

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.620 
the holes are that do not match and we
can<00:04:26.630> see<00:04:27.590> there<00:04:27.980> are<00:04:28.220> two<00:04:28.250> places<00:04:28.790> here<00:04:29.390> where

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
can see there are two places here where

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.680 
can see there are two places here where
the<00:04:29.810> holes<00:04:30.340> have<00:04:31.340> an<00:04:31.520> absolute<00:04:32.030> miss<00:04:32.480> base

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
the holes have an absolute miss base

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.350 
the holes have an absolute miss base
which<00:04:33.110> are<00:04:33.260> these<00:04:33.470> two<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:34.270> I'll<00:04:35.270> lamb<00:04:37.360> drill

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
which are these two and I'll lamb drill

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.230 
which are these two and I'll lamb drill
few<00:04:38.630> holes<00:04:38.870> now<00:04:39.080> there<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:40.010> no<00:04:40.610> two<00:04:40.670> ways<00:04:41.000> about

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
few holes now there is no two ways about

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.200 
few holes now there is no two ways about
it<00:04:41.800> if<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:42.980> won't<00:04:43.130> hold<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.490> screw<00:04:43.700> that<00:04:43.940> you

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
it if you won't hold the screw that you

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:52.620 
it if you won't hold the screw that you
need<00:04:44.420> oles<00:04:46.810> place<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.990> middle<00:04:50.230> mark

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
need oles place the middle mark

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.900 
need oles place the middle mark
low-speed<00:04:55.030> will<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.340> one<00:04:58.520> will<00:04:58.670> help<00:04:58.760> me

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
low-speed will and the one will help me

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.020 
low-speed will and the one will help me
neither<00:04:59.300> a<00:05:01.960> bit<00:05:03.340> will<00:05:04.340> do<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.610> other<00:05:04.760> one<00:05:04.790> as

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
neither a bit will do the other one as

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:14.560 
neither a bit will do the other one as
well<00:05:12.250> so<00:05:13.250> you<00:05:13.400> can<00:05:13.610> see<00:05:13.820> what<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.180> real<00:05:14.360> thing

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
well so you can see what the real thing

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.850 
well so you can see what the real thing
is<00:05:14.690> about<00:05:15.370> drawing<00:05:16.370> drilling<00:05:17.300> making<00:05:18.020> home

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.210 

obviously<00:05:21.860> there<00:05:22.610> were<00:05:22.850> some<00:05:23.090> old<00:05:23.360> holes<00:05:24.220> next

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
obviously there were some old holes next

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.650 
obviously there were some old holes next
to<00:05:25.430> these<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:26.000> I<00:05:26.930> am<00:05:27.550> already<00:05:28.550> filled<00:05:29.390> these

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
to these and I am already filled these

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.640 
to these and I am already filled these
again<00:05:30.169> with<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:31.280> little<00:05:31.520> points<00:05:32.140> of<00:05:33.140> satay

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
again with the little points of satay

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:44.170 
again with the little points of satay
sticks<00:05:35.740> so<00:05:37.480> there<00:05:38.480> is<00:05:39.520> right<00:05:40.520> now<00:05:42.070> we<00:05:43.070> are<00:05:43.430> in<00:05:43.730> a

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
sticks so there is right now we are in a

Google statistics are wonderful help so
I<00:06:03.400> put<00:06:04.400> in<00:06:04.520> two<00:06:04.760> screws<00:06:05.150> in<00:06:05.420> the<00:06:05.600> new<00:06:05.750> holes<00:06:06.730> and

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
I put in two screws in the new holes and

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:14.530 
I put in two screws in the new holes and
now<00:06:07.940> I'll<00:06:08.240> take<00:06:12.130> don't<00:06:13.130> fix<00:06:13.430> them<00:06:13.640> hold

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
now I'll take don't fix them hold

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.810 
now I'll take don't fix them hold
tightly<00:06:15.050> at<00:06:15.560> first<00:06:16.070> go<00:06:16.540> but<00:06:17.540> leave<00:06:17.750> some<00:06:18.820> some

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
tightly at first go but leave some some

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.850 
tightly at first go but leave some some
space<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.360> wriggle<00:06:20.690> around<00:06:22.900> it<00:06:23.900> might<00:06:24.350> just<00:06:24.560> be

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
space to wriggle around it might just be

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.080 
space to wriggle around it might just be
a<00:06:25.040> little<00:06:25.280> bit<00:06:25.490> off<00:06:25.700> center<00:06:26.030> in<00:06:26.450> one<00:06:26.690> and<00:06:27.020> that

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
a little bit off center in one and that

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.880 
a little bit off center in one and that
could<00:06:29.090> prevent<00:06:29.420> you<00:06:29.630> from<00:06:29.660> fitting<00:06:30.320> the<00:06:30.740> whole

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
could prevent you from fitting the whole

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.500 
could prevent you from fitting the whole
thing<00:06:31.130> nicely<00:06:33.340> you<00:06:34.340> need<00:06:34.880> to<00:06:35.000> live<00:06:35.180> a<00:06:35.210> little

thing nicely you need to live a little

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.930 
thing nicely you need to live a little
bit<00:06:35.720> of<00:06:35.840> space<00:06:36.080> to<00:06:36.830> work<00:06:37.160> to<00:06:37.550> move<00:06:37.700> with<00:06:37.850> the

bit of space to work to move with the
round<00:06:38.120> or<00:06:39.050> finalized<00:06:39.620> it<00:06:39.860> and<00:06:40.660> then<00:06:41.660> we'll

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
round or finalized it and then we'll

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.600 
round or finalized it and then we'll
come<00:06:42.440> back<00:06:42.470> and<00:06:44.500> of<00:06:45.500> interest<00:06:46.010> of<00:06:46.160> course<00:06:46.370> is

that the the bridge pickup is no problem

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.480 
that the the bridge pickup is no problem
because<00:06:50.210> that's<00:06:50.750> always<00:06:51.020> accessible<00:06:51.560> to<00:06:51.980> to
