just up to September the 4th this is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
just up to September the 4th this is
when<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> stopped<00:00:27.930> using<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.380> phone<00:00:28.590> because

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
when I stopped using the phone because

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.479 
when I stopped using the phone because
I'd<00:00:29.670> had<00:00:30.000> enough<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.380> didn't<00:00:31.769> take<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.340> many

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
I'd had enough and I didn't take as many

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.900 
I'd had enough and I didn't take as many
screenshots<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.270> I'd<00:00:33.510> hoped<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.870> but

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
screenshots as I'd hoped to but

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.250 
screenshots as I'd hoped to but
occasionally<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.329> battery<00:00:36.690> wasn't<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> best

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
occasionally the battery wasn't the best

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.360 
occasionally the battery wasn't the best
so<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.950> gave<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.370> eventually<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:40.370> going

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
so I just gave up eventually but going

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.700 
so I just gave up eventually but going
to<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> few<00:00:41.820> shots<00:00:42.420> here<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.500> there

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
to a few shots here so you can see there

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.709 
to a few shots here so you can see there
I<00:00:44.090> was<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.180> 31%<00:00:47.030> after<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> phone<00:00:48.270> had<00:00:48.420> been<00:00:48.480> on

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
I was at 31% after the phone had been on

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.010 
I was at 31% after the phone had been on
for<00:00:48.989> 17<00:00:49.530> hours<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:50.399> isn't<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.300> bad<00:00:51.570> when

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
for 17 hours which isn't that bad when

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.840 
for 17 hours which isn't that bad when
you<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.379> about<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.219> screen<00:00:53.579> had<00:00:53.820> been

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
you think about it the screen had been

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.830 
you think about it the screen had been
on<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:55.250> did<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.340> capture<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.059> time<00:00:57.329> no

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
on for did I capture that this time no

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.540 
on for did I capture that this time no
unfortunately<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.680> didn't<00:00:59.010> manage<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.370> capture

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
unfortunately I didn't manage to capture

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.069 
unfortunately I didn't manage to capture
how<00:00:59.850> long<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> screen<00:01:00.539> had<00:01:00.660> been<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
how long the screen had been on that

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.310 
how long the screen had been on that
time<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:02.070> hopefully<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.520> another<00:01:03.290> set<00:01:04.290> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
time but hopefully in another set of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
time but hopefully in another set of
pictures<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.949> did<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:08.310> 24

between the 24th and the 28th of August

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.789

things Instagram was at five percent so
there<00:02:02.670> wasn't<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.939> much<00:02:03.210> done<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.659> that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
there wasn't that much done on that

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.889 
there wasn't that much done on that
phone<00:02:04.460> for<00:02:05.460> his<00:02:05.579> calls<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:05.969> 16<00:02:06.390> minutes<00:02:06.750> so

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
phone for his calls with 16 minutes so

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.460 
phone for his calls with 16 minutes so
it<00:02:07.020> wasn't<00:02:07.380> much

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.520 

Instagram<00:02:11.870> nostril<00:02:12.870> had<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.170> read<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
Instagram nostril had to read the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.020 
Instagram nostril had to read the
Instagram<00:02:13.950> one<00:02:14.130> properly<00:02:14.550> but<00:02:14.670> I'm<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.970> to

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
Instagram one properly but I'm going to

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.180 
Instagram one properly but I'm going to
guess<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:16.020> was<00:02:16.140> 34<00:02:16.590> minutes<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:18.540> that's<00:02:19.190> for

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
guess it was 34 minutes and that's for

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.940 
guess it was 34 minutes and that's for
another<00:02:20.340> day<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.360> now<00:02:21.630> if<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:21.960> go<00:02:22.110> into<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.440> 2nd

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
another day so now if we go into the 2nd

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.580 
another day so now if we go into the 2nd
of<00:02:23.070> September<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> screen<00:02:25.110> had<00:02:25.290> been<00:02:25.320> on

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
of September so the screen had been on

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.360 
of September so the screen had been on
for<00:02:26.810> two<00:02:27.810> hours<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.170> five<00:02:28.290> minutes<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
for two hours and five minutes and the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.750 
for two hours and five minutes and the
battery<00:02:30.090> life<00:02:30.300> was<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.690> 9%<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:32.130> before<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.670> had

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
battery life was at 9% so before it had

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.850 
battery life was at 9% so before it had
been<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.090> for<00:02:33.120> over<00:02:33.810> three<00:02:34.080> hours<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.770> was

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
been on for over three hours and it was

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.140 
been on for over three hours and it was
at<00:02:35.010> 4%<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:36.360> time<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.930> at<00:02:37.550> 9%<00:02:38.550> with<00:02:38.850> two

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
at 4% this time it's at 9% with two

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.990 
at 4% this time it's at 9% with two
hours<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:40.220> there<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.460> see<00:02:41.640> I'd<00:02:41.820> only

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
hours and there you can see I'd only

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.120 
hours and there you can see I'd only
been<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.300> for<00:02:42.360> 16<00:02:42.900> hours<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.320> that's<00:02:43.500> not<00:02:43.740> great

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
been on for 16 hours so that's not great

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.210 
been on for 16 hours so that's not great
at<00:02:44.400> all<00:02:44.430> even<00:02:45.270> though<00:02:45.690> tuning<00:02:46.500> radio<00:02:46.680> had<00:02:47.040> been

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
at all even though tuning radio had been

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.940 
at all even though tuning radio had been
used<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.760> quite<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.690> while<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.230> still<00:02:49.590> not

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
used for quite a while it's still not

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.670 
used for quite a while it's still not
the<00:02:50.130> best<00:02:50.280> experience<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:51.600> me<00:02:51.750> personally<00:02:51.959> I

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the best experience for me personally I

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.180 
the best experience for me personally I
found<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.820> had<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.000> charge<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.720> phone<00:02:55.190> and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
found that I had to charge the phone and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.380 
found that I had to charge the phone and
this<00:02:56.310> was<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.580> middle<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> day<00:02:57.180> which<00:02:57.360> you

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
this was the middle of the day which you

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.860 
this was the middle of the day which you
can<00:02:57.570> see<00:02:57.720> 1412<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.430> if<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.730> was<00:02:59.910> working<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.540> 95

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
can see 1412 so if you was working a 95

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.370 
can see 1412 so if you was working a 95
and<00:03:01.459> you'd<00:03:02.459> been<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.910> gym<00:03:03.140> you'd<00:03:04.140> probably

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
and you'd been to the gym you'd probably

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.110 
and you'd been to the gym you'd probably
find<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.830> your<00:03:05.040> battery's<00:03:05.490> not<00:03:05.520> going<00:03:06.060> to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
find that your battery's not going to

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
find that your battery's not going to
get<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.360> through<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.780> whole<00:03:06.930> day<00:03:07.520> they<00:03:08.520> can

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
get you through the whole day they can

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.790 
get you through the whole day they can
see<00:03:08.940> tuning<00:03:09.540> radio<00:03:09.660> was<00:03:09.959> only<00:03:10.170> been<00:03:10.320> as<00:03:10.590> only

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
see tuning radio was only been as only

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.350 
see tuning radio was only been as only
been<00:03:11.040> running<00:03:11.130> for<00:03:11.459> one<00:03:11.610> hour<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.060> five

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
that had been running I had played a

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.770 
that had been running I had played a
game<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.800> hardest<00:03:23.190> game<00:03:23.370> ever<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:24.630> was

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
suggested by someone so I figured I'd

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.520 
suggested by someone so I figured I'd
give<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.989> quick<00:03:28.110> girl<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:31.019> that's<00:03:31.200> just<00:03:31.380> one

give it a quick girl and that's just one

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.030 
give it a quick girl and that's just one
less<00:03:31.709> screenshot<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:34.890> are

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
less screenshot of it and there are

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.990 
less screenshot of it and there are
another<00:03:35.580> in-depth<00:03:36.450> one<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.550> here<00:03:38.550> is<00:03:38.730> a

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
another in-depth one and here is a

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.080 
minutes which is not that long it's
normal<00:04:04.860> amount<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.340> course<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.850> could

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
normal amount of course that you could

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.430 
normal amount of course that you could
have<00:04:06.299> in<00:04:06.570> one<00:04:07.170> day<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:08.900> then<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.019> screen<00:04:10.200> was

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
have in one day and then the screen was

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.039 
have in one day and then the screen was
only<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:10.769> for<00:04:11.010> one<00:04:11.280> hour<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.730> 22<00:04:12.150> when<00:04:12.930> you

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
only on for one hour and 22 when you

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.930 
only on for one hour and 22 when you
compare<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.590> how<00:04:13.769> long<00:04:14.100> it's<00:04:14.250> been<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.640> in

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
compare that to how long it's been on in

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.990 
compare that to how long it's been on in
previous<00:04:15.570> screen<00:04:16.530> shots<00:04:16.799> it's<00:04:17.519> a<00:04:17.609> really<00:04:17.880> long

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
previous screen shots it's a really long

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.810 
previous screen shots it's a really long
time<00:04:18.680> so<00:04:19.680> that's<00:04:19.830> not<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.160> best<00:04:20.190> day<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:21.120> them

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
time so that's not the best day of them

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.970 
time so that's not the best day of them
I<00:04:22.850> think<00:04:23.540> this<00:04:23.780> final<00:04:24.350> screenshot<00:04:24.830> is

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
I think this final screenshot is

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.640 
I think this final screenshot is
probably<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.430> best<00:04:25.730> time<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:26.870> had<00:04:27.290> on<00:04:27.530> the

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
probably the best time I had on the

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.450 
probably the best time I had on the
phone<00:04:27.860> so<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:28.730> can<00:04:28.850> see<00:04:29.030> there<00:04:29.270> it's<00:04:29.870> at<00:04:29.960> 1%

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460
