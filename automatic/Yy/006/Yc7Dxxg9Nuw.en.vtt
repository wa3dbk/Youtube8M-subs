so many slots for weapons and I'm pretty

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.929

stoked<00:01:37.590> also<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> think<00:01:38.460> there's<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.909> be

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
stoked also I think there's going to be

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.520 
stoked also I think there's going to be
more<00:01:39.150> than<00:01:39.329> three<00:01:39.570> classes<00:01:40.049> which<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.320> badass

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
more than three classes which is badass

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
more than three classes which is badass
and<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> guys<00:01:41.159> didn't<00:01:41.400> know<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.640> every

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
and if you guys didn't know this every

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.819 
and if you guys didn't know this every
class<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.630> play<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> level<00:01:43.560> them<00:01:43.710> up

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
class you play you have to level them up

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
class you play you have to level them up
so<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.369> adds<00:01:44.520> even<00:01:44.640> more<00:01:44.820> longevity<00:01:45.119> to

me<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.849> halo<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.569> faster-paced<00:02:27.049> halo<00:02:27.560> a

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
me of a halo a faster-paced halo a

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.949 
me of a halo a faster-paced halo a
little<00:02:28.099> bit<00:02:28.220> easier<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:28.790> well<00:02:28.819> this<00:02:29.780> game

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
little bit easier as well this game

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.600 
little bit easier as well this game
feels<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.319> little<00:02:30.530> bit<00:02:30.739> easier<00:02:30.920> than<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> normal

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
feels a little bit easier than a normal

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.970 
feels a little bit easier than a normal
halo<00:02:32.000> two<00:02:32.269> or<00:02:32.390> halo<00:02:32.510> three<00:02:32.870> games<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.650> think

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
halo two or halo three games so I think

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.649 
halo two or halo three games so I think
you<00:02:34.190> guys<00:02:34.310> will<00:02:34.610> enjoy<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.329> think<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:35.599> a

just<00:04:20.120> hit<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.269> ground<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.840> everyone

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
just hit the ground and everyone

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.090 
just hit the ground and everyone
she<00:04:21.729> just<00:04:21.910> blows<00:04:22.120> up<00:04:22.180> which<00:04:22.720> I'm<00:04:22.930> not<00:04:23.290> to<00:04:23.650> I

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
she just blows up which I'm not to I

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.310 
she just blows up which I'm not to I
think<00:04:24.760> that's<00:04:24.910> a<00:04:25.030> little<00:04:25.180> too<00:04:25.449> easy<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:26.080> don't

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
think that's a little too easy I don't

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.870 
think that's a little too easy I don't
think<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.800> think<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.280> needs<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.490> be<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.610> little

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
think I think it needs to be a little

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.390 
think I think it needs to be a little
bit<00:04:28.000> harder<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:29.530> can<00:04:29.560> kill<00:04:29.860> like<00:04:30.070> three<00:04:30.310> to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
bit harder you can kill like three to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.310 
bit harder you can kill like three to
four<00:04:30.580> guys<00:04:30.760> in<00:04:31.120> one<00:04:31.270> little<00:04:31.479> area<00:04:31.690> if<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.110> if

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
four guys in one little area if you if

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.320 
four guys in one little area if you if
you<00:04:32.440> do<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.800> right<00:04:32.949> so<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.280> feel<00:04:33.760> like<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.060> tying

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
you do it right so I feel like the tying

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.700 
you do it right so I feel like the tying
ability<00:04:34.750> needs<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.080> have<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.290> little<00:04:35.440> bit<00:04:35.590> more

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
ability needs to have a little bit more

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.760 
ability needs to have a little bit more
skill-based<00:04:36.040> to<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.490> at<00:04:37.000> least<00:04:37.380> having<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.560> aim

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
skill-based to it at least having to aim

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.610 
skill-based to it at least having to aim
or<00:04:39.040> something<00:04:39.400> I'm<00:04:39.610> not<00:04:39.820> too<00:04:40.000> sure<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:40.570> if<00:04:41.500> you

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
the Warlock ability in my opinion is a

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.830 
the Warlock ability in my opinion is a
little<00:04:47.500> weak<00:04:47.740> as<00:04:47.949> well<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:49.060> doesn't<00:04:49.479> I<00:04:49.630> mean

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
little weak as well it doesn't I mean

like i know for a fact i don't i I put
it<00:05:25.180> on<00:05:25.330> their<00:05:25.510> head<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:25.870> it<00:05:26.410> won't<00:05:26.620> kill<00:05:26.830> them

and what I think I don't know if they

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.310 
and what I think I don't know if they
change<00:05:30.760> the<00:05:30.970> hitbox<00:05:31.360> when<00:05:31.870> people<00:05:32.110> are<00:05:32.169> in<00:05:32.200> the

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
change the hitbox when people are in the

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.450 
change the hitbox when people are in the
vehicles<00:05:32.650> but<00:05:32.800> it's<00:05:32.950> really<00:05:33.130> really

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
vehicles but it's really really

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.950 
vehicles but it's really really
difficult<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:34.300> kill<00:05:34.419> people<00:05:34.720> with<00:05:34.840> the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
difficult to kill people with the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.140 
difficult to kill people with the
vehicles<00:05:35.349> um<00:05:36.160> if<00:05:36.370> you<00:05:36.580> don't<00:05:36.729> have<00:05:36.849> a<00:05:36.910> very

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
vehicles um if you don't have a very

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.820 
vehicles um if you don't have a very
good<00:05:37.330> team<00:05:37.510> it's<00:05:37.720> really<00:05:37.960> hard<00:05:38.200> to<00:05:38.380> carry<00:05:38.620> your

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
good team it's really hard to carry your

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.180 
good team it's really hard to carry your
team<00:05:39.039> on<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.400> snow<00:05:39.610> or<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.120> moon<00:05:40.300> map<00:05:41.190> because

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
team on the snow or the moon map because

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.100 
team on the snow or the moon map because
the<00:05:42.310> vehicles<00:05:42.729> are<00:05:42.849> so<00:05:43.090> they're<00:05:43.510> so<00:05:43.660> dominant

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
the vehicles are so they're so dominant

don't even know what I was shooting at
but<00:05:47.770> vehicles<00:05:48.280> are<00:05:48.400> pretty<00:05:48.610> annoying<00:05:48.880> in<00:05:49.060> this

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
but vehicles are pretty annoying in this

bullets<00:05:51.550> don't<00:05:51.669> really<00:05:51.940> register<00:05:52.330> that<00:05:52.479> wall

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
bullets don't really register that wall

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.360 
bullets don't really register that wall
on<00:05:52.870> them<00:05:52.990> and<00:05:53.139> that<00:05:53.740> could<00:05:53.889> be<00:05:53.919> a<00:05:54.010> real<00:05:54.190> big

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
on them and that could be a real big

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.610 
on them and that could be a real big
problem<00:05:54.550> also<00:05:54.910> turrets<00:05:55.449> in<00:05:55.510> this<00:05:55.660> game<00:05:55.870> so<00:05:56.440> how

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
when you're on the turret you're pretty

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.510 
when you're on the turret you're pretty
vulnerable<00:06:07.870> your<00:06:08.320> head<00:06:08.440> sticking<00:06:08.740> out<00:06:08.979> you're

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
vulnerable your head sticking out you're

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.969 
vulnerable your head sticking out you're
pretty<00:06:09.789> easy<00:06:09.970> shot<00:06:10.360> to<00:06:10.510> kill<00:06:10.690> with<00:06:11.470> destiny

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.830 
pretty easy shot to kill with destiny
one<00:06:12.760> thing<00:06:12.940> i<00:06:13.030> don't<00:06:13.090> like<00:06:13.240> about<00:06:13.360> is<00:06:13.690> the

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
one thing i don't like about is the

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.600 
one thing i don't like about is the
turrets<00:06:14.199> they<00:06:14.530> actually<00:06:14.949> take<00:06:15.130> 2<00:06:15.340> sniper

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
turrets they actually take 2 sniper

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.730 
turrets they actually take 2 sniper
shots<00:06:15.940> to<00:06:16.120> take<00:06:16.330> away<00:06:16.539> the<00:06:16.690> shield<00:06:16.960> and<00:06:17.229> then

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
shots to take away the shield and then

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.620 
shots to take away the shield and then
after<00:06:18.099> that<00:06:18.250> you<00:06:18.520> can<00:06:18.639> take<00:06:18.880> oh<00:06:18.940> you<00:06:19.270> can<00:06:19.419> take

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
after that you can take oh you can take

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.000 
after that you can take oh you can take
that<00:06:19.660> player<00:06:20.050> out<00:06:20.260> but<00:06:20.470> most<00:06:20.680> of<00:06:20.770> the<00:06:20.830> times

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
that player out but most of the times

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.920 
that player out but most of the times
you<00:06:21.250> shoot<00:06:21.729> the<00:06:21.849> shield<00:06:22.120> twice<00:06:22.360> and<00:06:22.750> they're

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
you shoot the shield twice and they're

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.689 
you shoot the shield twice and they're
already<00:06:23.080> jumping<00:06:23.470> off<00:06:23.650> I<00:06:23.889> really<00:06:24.520> feel<00:06:24.669> like

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
already jumping off I really feel like

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.939 
already jumping off I really feel like
they<00:06:25.300> should<00:06:25.330> at<00:06:25.599> least<00:06:25.780> have<00:06:25.990> a<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.680> shield

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949 
they should at least have a the shield

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.089 
they should at least have a the shield
only<00:06:27.479> only<00:06:28.479> be<00:06:28.630> able<00:06:28.720> to<00:06:28.990> absorb<00:06:29.500> one<00:06:29.860> sniper

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
only only be able to absorb one sniper

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.800 
only only be able to absorb one sniper
bullet<00:06:30.520> and<00:06:31.000> then<00:06:31.090> after<00:06:31.360> that<00:06:31.479> you<00:06:31.630> can<00:06:31.750> come

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
bullet and then after that you can come

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.029 
bullet and then after that you can come
I<00:06:32.200> think<00:06:32.409> that'd<00:06:32.530> be<00:06:32.650> a<00:06:32.680> really<00:06:32.830> good<00:06:32.979> idea

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
I think that'd be a really good idea

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:33.790 
I think that'd be a really good idea
because<00:06:33.310> turn

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
weapons are really strong and really

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.089 
weapons are really strong and really
annoying<00:06:37.039> to<00:06:37.129> deal<00:06:37.220> with<00:06:37.580> also<00:06:38.919> grenades<00:06:39.919> in

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099

not too sure how I feel about this I
know<00:06:50.120> in<00:06:50.680> Halo<00:06:51.680> if<00:06:51.919> a<00:06:52.370> plasma<00:06:52.759> your<00:06:52.879> name<00:06:53.000> is

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
know in Halo if a plasma your name is

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.230 
know in Halo if a plasma your name is
directly<00:06:53.479> thrown<00:06:53.810> on<00:06:53.990> to<00:06:54.110> you<00:06:54.229> it<00:06:54.500> kill<00:06:54.800> you

directly thrown on to you it kill you

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.790 
directly thrown on to you it kill you
but<00:06:56.240> a<00:06:56.300> normal<00:06:56.810> frag<00:06:57.050> grenade<00:06:57.349> you<00:06:57.470> wanted<00:06:57.740> to

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
but a normal frag grenade you wanted to

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.260 
but a normal frag grenade you wanted to
kill<00:06:57.949> you<00:06:58.099> just<00:06:58.340> take<00:06:58.490> off<00:06:58.639> your<00:06:58.819> shield<00:06:59.060> which
