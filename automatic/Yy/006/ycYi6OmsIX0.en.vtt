will take either two cr123a 18 650 so

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.899 
will take either two cr123a 18 650 so
we're<00:01:05.449> going<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.659> use<00:01:05.690> in<00:01:05.870> 18<00:01:06.110> 650<00:01:06.579> put<00:01:07.579> that<00:01:07.759> in

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
we're going to use in 18 650 put that in

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.510 
we're going to use in 18 650 put that in
there<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.930> we've<00:01:09.020> got<00:01:09.170> an<00:01:09.259> 18<00:01:09.530> 650<00:01:09.890> in<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.189> r2

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
there and we've got an 18 650 in the r2

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.020 
there and we've got an 18 650 in the r2
version<00:01:10.880> as<00:01:11.000> well<00:01:12.159> so<00:01:13.159> there<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.460> on<00:01:13.670> strobe

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
version as well so there it is on strobe

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.410 
version as well so there it is on strobe
and<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:14.630> headed<00:01:14.990> on<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.640> if<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:16.820> don't<00:01:17.000> change

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
and so headed on in if you don't change

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.630 
and so headed on in if you don't change
the<00:01:17.630> modes<00:01:17.869> using<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.500> selector<00:01:18.920> ring<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
the modes using the selector ring the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.980 
the modes using the selector ring the
backs<00:01:19.850> which<00:01:20.119> is<00:01:20.299> always<00:01:20.570> going<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:20.780> go<00:01:20.899> on

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
backs which is always going to go on

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.450 
backs which is always going to go on
into<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.320> mode<00:01:21.469> you<00:01:21.590> left<00:01:21.799> it<00:01:21.920> off<00:01:22.040> on<00:01:22.219> and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
into the mode you left it off on and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.880 
into the mode you left it off on and
then<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.360> can<00:01:23.509> just<00:01:23.689> use<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.170> ring<00:01:24.350> switch

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
then you can just use the ring switch

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.289 
then you can just use the ring switch
between<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.310> modes<00:01:25.520> which<00:01:25.880> of<00:01:26.000> course<00:01:26.030> you

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
between the modes which of course you

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.810 
between the modes which of course you
can<00:01:26.420> do<00:01:26.540> when<00:01:26.659> it's<00:01:26.780> off<00:01:26.930> as<00:01:27.110> well<00:01:27.729> so<00:01:28.729> you've

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
can do when it's off as well so you've

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.399 
can do when it's off as well so you've
got<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.060> ring<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.600> switch<00:01:29.810> between<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.200> three

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
got the ring to switch between the three

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.139 
got the ring to switch between the three
different<00:01:30.649> brightnesses<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.369> then<00:01:31.969> your

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
different brightnesses and then your

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.350 
different brightnesses and then your
strobe<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:33.039> then<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.159> back<00:01:34.310> switch<00:01:34.640> turn<00:01:35.210> it

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
strobe and then the back switch turn it

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.240 
strobe and then the back switch turn it
off<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.479> on<00:01:35.719> and<00:01:35.990> then<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.649> have<00:01:36.740> momentary

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
off and on and then you have momentary

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.819 
off and on and then you have momentary
as<00:01:37.399> well<00:01:37.579> if<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:37.850> just<00:01:38.000> slightly<00:01:38.180> press<00:01:38.450> it

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.020 

okay<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:42.979> exposure<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.549> turned<00:01:43.789> way<00:01:44.000> down

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
okay the exposure is turned way down

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.039 
okay the exposure is turned way down
because<00:01:44.539> i'm<00:01:44.600> going<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:44.780> show<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:44.899> the

because i'm going to show you the

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.010 
because i'm going to show you the
difference<00:01:45.380> between<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.859> r5<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:47.210> r2<00:01:47.570> LED

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
difference between the r5 and the r2 LED

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.630 
difference between the r5 and the r2 LED
just<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:48.500> can<00:01:48.560> see<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.829> difference<00:01:49.189> so

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
just so you can see the difference so

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.779 
just so you can see the difference so
here's<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.969> r5<00:01:50.299> on<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.600> right<00:01:51.670> there's<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
here's the r5 on the right there's the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.999 
here's the r5 on the right there's the
are<00:01:52.939> two<00:01:53.149> on<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.420> left<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:54.229> can<00:01:54.380> see<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.619> r5

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
are two on the left you can see the r5

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.920 
are two on the left you can see the r5
has<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.340> pretty<00:01:55.729> significantly<00:01:56.450> larger

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
has a pretty significantly larger

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.069 
has a pretty significantly larger
hotspot<00:01:57.700> using<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.789> same<00:01:59.000> reflector<00:01:59.600> and

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
hotspot using the same reflector and

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.410 
hotspot using the same reflector and
Driver<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:00.619> everything<00:02:01.219> on<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.460> inside<00:02:01.789> it's

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
Driver and everything on the inside it's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.440 
Driver and everything on the inside it's
just<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.719> type<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:02.929> LED<00:02:03.500> is<00:02:03.770> just<00:02:04.100> larger<00:02:04.520> so

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
just the type of LED is just larger so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.849 
just the type of LED is just larger so
you're<00:02:05.570> going<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.719> get<00:02:05.869> our<00:02:06.020> hot<00:02:06.380> spot<00:02:06.619> on<00:02:06.770> this

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
you're going to get our hot spot on this

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.340 
you're going to get our hot spot on this
more<00:02:07.189> overall<00:02:07.579> lumens<00:02:08.149> but<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.110> doesn't

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
more overall lumens but it doesn't

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.260 
more overall lumens but it doesn't
really<00:02:09.410> show<00:02:09.649> up<00:02:09.740> as<00:02:09.860> well<00:02:10.070> on<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.520> video<00:02:10.760> but

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
really show up as well on the video but

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.010 
really show up as well on the video but
the<00:02:11.300> are<00:02:11.720> two<00:02:11.990> on<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.410> left<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.950> actually<00:02:13.760> a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
the are two on the left is actually a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.090 
the are two on the left is actually a
brighter<00:02:15.020> hot<00:02:15.350> spot<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:15.800> it's<00:02:15.920> going

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
brighter hot spot so it's going

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.710 
brighter hot spot so it's going
give<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.370> better<00:02:16.550> throw<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:17.600> you're

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
give you better throw so if you're

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.990 
give you better throw so if you're
looking<00:02:17.960> for<00:02:17.990> distance<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:19.040> want<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.310> r2<00:02:19.700> if

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
looking for distance you want the r2 if

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.700 
looking for distance you want the r2 if
you<00:02:20.450> want<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.690> be<00:02:20.780> able<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.990> light<00:02:21.140> up<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.380> larger

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
you want to be able to light up a larger

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.950 
you want to be able to light up a larger
area<00:02:21.890> with<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.310> hot<00:02:22.490> spot<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.300> want<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.570> r5

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
area with that hot spot you want the r5

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.540 
area with that hot spot you want the r5
hey<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.560> see<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:24.890> get<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.040> little<00:02:25.190> bit<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
hey you see you get a little bit of the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.330 
hey you see you get a little bit of the
Rings<00:02:25.790> going<00:02:26.630> on<00:02:26.750> with<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.020> r2<00:02:27.380> not<00:02:27.890> too<00:02:28.100> bad

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
Rings going on with the r2 not too bad

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.850 
Rings going on with the r2 not too bad
but<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.820> little<00:02:29.360> bit<00:02:29.450> cleaner<00:02:29.690> beam<00:02:29.960> on<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.260> r5

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
but a little bit cleaner beam on the r5

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.950 
but a little bit cleaner beam on the r5
so<00:02:31.580> that's<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.850> difference<00:02:32.060> between<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.630> r<00:02:32.720> 2

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
so that's the difference between the r 2

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.260 
so that's the difference between the r 2
and<00:02:32.990> r<00:02:33.350> 5<00:02:33.620> LEDs<00:02:34.100> we're<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.910> go<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.120> take

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
and r 5 LEDs we're going to go and take

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.030 
and r 5 LEDs we're going to go and take
both<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.450> these<00:02:35.660> outside<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.440> see<00:02:36.830> how<00:02:36.920> they

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
both of these outside and see how they

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.330 
both of these outside and see how they
do<00:02:37.160> outside<00:02:38.050> okay<00:02:39.050> here<00:02:39.320> are<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.440> two<00:02:39.710> sunway

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
do outside okay here are the two sunway

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.450 
do outside okay here are the two sunway
m20<00:02:41.120> sees<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:42.410> see<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.710> leds<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.100> they're

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
m20 sees you see the leds and they're

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.060 
m20 sees you see the leds and they're
kind<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.970> got<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.630> r5<00:02:44.990> on<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> left<00:02:45.530> are<00:02:45.770> two

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
kind of got the r5 on the left are two

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.550 
kind of got the r5 on the left are two
on<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> right<00:02:46.750> but<00:02:47.750> first<00:02:48.050> off<00:02:48.260> we're<00:02:48.440> going

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
on the right but first off we're going

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.130 
on the right but first off we're going
to<00:02:48.650> show<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:48.860> big<00:02:49.490> 40<00:02:49.910> maglite<00:02:50.360> cuz<00:02:50.660> everybody

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
to show you big 40 maglite cuz everybody

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.480 
to show you big 40 maglite cuz everybody
knows<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.380> one<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.680> those<00:02:51.800> looks<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.220> how

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
knows that one of those looks like how

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.960 
knows that one of those looks like how
they<00:02:52.670> work<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.750> we'll<00:02:53.870> try<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.200> out<00:02:54.230> first

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
they work so we'll try that out first

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.450 
they work so we'll try that out first
little<00:02:55.970> bush<00:02:56.120> at<00:02:56.270> about<00:02:56.450> 15<00:02:56.810> feet<00:02:57.280> tree<00:02:58.280> out

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
little bush at about 15 feet tree out

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.910 
little bush at about 15 feet tree out
there<00:02:58.490> at<00:02:58.700> 100<00:02:59.030> feet<00:02:59.620> shining<00:03:00.620> around<00:03:00.740> a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
there at 100 feet shining around a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.990 
there at 100 feet shining around a
little<00:03:01.070> bit<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.490> so<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.670> can<00:03:01.730> get<00:03:01.820> an<00:03:01.910> idea

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
little bit just so you can get an idea

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.480 
little bit just so you can get an idea
that's<00:03:02.600> his<00:03:02.750> focus<00:03:02.960> as<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.350> gets<00:03:03.500> fresh<00:03:04.190> bulb

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
that's his focus as it gets fresh bulb

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.420 
that's his focus as it gets fresh bulb
fresh<00:03:04.730> batteries<00:03:05.650> not<00:03:06.650> all<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:06.860> bright<00:03:07.010> does

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
fresh batteries not all that bright does

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.060 
fresh batteries not all that bright does
okay<00:03:07.730> not<00:03:08.120> great<00:03:08.240> so<00:03:09.110> let's<00:03:09.230> try<00:03:09.380> those<00:03:09.530> n<00:03:09.680> 20s

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
okay not great so let's try those n 20s

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.060 
okay not great so let's try those n 20s
again<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.930> r5<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.650> going<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:12.830> be<00:03:12.920> on<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
again the the r5 is going to be on the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.380 
again the the r5 is going to be on the
left<00:03:13.280> are<00:03:13.550> two<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.760> going<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.940> be<00:03:14.030> on<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.240> right

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
left are two is going to be on the right

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.570 
left are two is going to be on the right
there's<00:03:15.110> your<00:03:15.200> are<00:03:15.410> five<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.100> see<00:03:16.340> it

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
there's your are five and you see it

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.640 
there's your are five and you see it
does<00:03:16.790> great<00:03:17.060> lights<00:03:17.900> up<00:03:18.050> everything<00:03:18.470> really

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
does great lights up everything really

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.140 
does great lights up everything really
well<00:03:18.770> pretty<00:03:19.310> much<00:03:19.430> everything<00:03:19.490> in<00:03:19.910> front<00:03:20.000> of

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
well pretty much everything in front of

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.030 
well pretty much everything in front of
me<00:03:20.240> I<00:03:20.270> can<00:03:20.480> see<00:03:20.600> really<00:03:20.780> well<00:03:21.050> obviously<00:03:21.740> what

me I can see really well obviously what

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.230 
me I can see really well obviously what
I'm<00:03:22.130> shining<00:03:22.430> at<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.880> then<00:03:23.000> everything

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
I'm shining at and then everything

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.720 
I'm shining at and then everything
around<00:03:23.570> that<00:03:23.810> as<00:03:23.960> well<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.350> that's<00:03:25.160> only<00:03:25.310> 100

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
feet there you can go a lot further than

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.720 
feet there you can go a lot further than
that<00:03:27.260> if<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.500> needed<00:03:27.740> to<00:03:27.770> so<00:03:28.490> there's<00:03:28.670> your

that if you needed to so there's your
are<00:03:28.910> five<00:03:29.290> there's<00:03:30.290> your<00:03:30.410> are<00:03:30.560> two<00:03:30.740> on<00:03:30.890> the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
are five there's your are two on the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.660 
are five there's your are two on the
right<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:33.110> can<00:03:33.260> see<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.500> r2<00:03:33.860> has<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.460> little

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
right you can see the r2 has a little

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.130 
right you can see the r2 has a little
bit<00:03:34.820> better<00:03:34.940> throw<00:03:35.330> so<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.600> center<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.960> its

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
bit better throw so the center of its

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.230 
bit better throw so the center of its
going<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.350> be<00:03:36.470> brighter<00:03:36.710> and<00:03:37.070> it's<00:03:38.060> going<00:03:38.180> to

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
going to be brighter and it's going to

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.090 
going to be brighter and it's going to
go<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.630> little<00:03:38.750> bit<00:03:38.930> better<00:03:39.050> distance<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.040> if

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
go a little bit better distance so if

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.200 
go a little bit better distance so if
you're<00:03:40.160> trying<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.460> lie<00:03:40.580> something<00:03:40.940> up<00:03:41.060> at<00:03:41.180> a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
you're trying to lie something up at a

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.760

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
distance then you want to go for the r2

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.430 
distance then you want to go for the r2
version<00:03:43.190> over<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.790> r5<00:03:44.120> as<00:03:44.960> you<00:03:45.140> can<00:03:45.230> see<00:03:45.320> they
