replace<00:02:07.020> them<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.920> deletes<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
replace them then it deletes it and it

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.910 
replace them then it deletes it and it
will<00:02:09.300> render<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.750> system<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.289> booble<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.830> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
will render the system on booble so you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.199 
will render the system on booble so you
going<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:11.160> very<00:02:11.459> careful<00:02:11.700> when<00:02:12.000> using

the system errors and stuff like that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.910 
the system errors and stuff like that
and<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> will<00:02:39.120> check<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.330> drive<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:40.470> will<00:02:40.709> take

and it will check the drive it will take

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.970 
and it will check the drive it will take
some<00:02:41.160> time<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.670> run<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:43.200> will<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.860> be

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
some time to run so you will have to be

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.559 
some time to run so you will have to be
patient<00:02:44.430> when<00:02:44.580> running<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.390> won't

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
patient when running this now you won't

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.990 
patient when running this now you won't
have<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.989> run<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.410> unless<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.370> need<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.850> if

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
have to run this unless you need to if

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.910 
have to run this unless you need to if
you've<00:02:48.150> got<00:02:48.360> some<00:02:48.780> problems<00:02:49.260> or<00:02:49.530> stuff<00:02:49.799> like

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.880 
you've got some problems or stuff like
that<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.549> can<00:02:50.580> use<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:51.180> ok<00:02:51.860> right<00:02:52.860> so

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
that then you can use this ok right so

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.720 
that then you can use this ok right so
let's<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.549> look<00:02:53.700> at<00:02:53.880> step<00:02:54.239> three<00:02:54.569> here<00:02:55.730> now

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
let's have a look at step three here now

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.789 
let's have a look at step three here now
step<00:02:57.000> three<00:02:57.239> system<00:02:57.810> file<00:02:58.080> checker<00:02:58.110> now<00:02:58.620> this

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
step three system file checker now this

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.550 
step three system file checker now this
is<00:02:58.980> really<00:02:59.340> good<00:02:59.549> if<00:02:59.730> you've<00:03:00.390> got<00:03:00.720> corrupt

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
is really good if you've got corrupt

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.800 
is really good if you've got corrupt
file<00:03:01.890> system<00:03:02.430> files<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.209> system<00:03:03.390> or

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
file system files on the system or

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.039 
file system files on the system or
they've<00:03:04.470> got<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.890> wrong<00:03:05.640> window<00:03:06.180> system<00:03:06.810> file

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
they've got the wrong window system file

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.140 
they've got the wrong window system file
what<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.440> will<00:03:07.590> do<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.519> will<00:03:08.640> correct<00:03:09.000> that

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
what it will do is it will correct that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.380 
what it will do is it will correct that
by<00:03:09.540> putting<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> right<00:03:10.650> one<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.430> now<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.060> may

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
by putting the right one on now you may

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.860 
by putting the right one on now you may
also<00:03:12.690> need<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.230> use<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.769> Windows<00:03:14.280> CD<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:15.540> replace

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
also need to use a Windows CD to replace

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.380 
also need to use a Windows CD to replace
these<00:03:16.049> files<00:03:16.349> as<00:03:16.709> well<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.400> bear<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.359> mind

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
these files as well so bear that in mind

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.240 
these files as well so bear that in mind
that<00:03:18.840> all<00:03:18.959> you'd<00:03:19.109> need<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.410> do<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.799> click<00:03:20.190> on

the Do It Now button and it will

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.710 
the Do It Now button and it will
actually<00:03:22.320> do<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.180> do<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.209> for<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.570> now

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
actually do that and do it for you now

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.599 
actually do that and do it for you now
you<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:24.900> do<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.470> also<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.829> command<00:03:26.280> prompt

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
you can do this also in command prompt

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.059 
you can do this also in command prompt
again<00:03:27.000> but<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.410> for<00:03:28.530> probably

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
again but this is just for probably

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.610 
again but this is just for probably
beginners<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.150> help<00:03:30.359> them<00:03:30.510> out<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.959> let<00:03:31.440> them

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
beginners to help them out and let them

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.440 
beginners to help them out and let them
do<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:31.920> now<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.250> not<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.579> bad<00:03:32.819> thing<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.120> run

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
do it now this is not a bad thing to run

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.449 
do it now this is not a bad thing to run
if<00:03:33.780> you've<00:03:33.930> got<00:03:34.140> issues<00:03:34.590> with<00:03:34.620> your<00:03:35.010> system

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
if you've got issues with your system

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.630 
if you've got issues with your system
it's<00:03:36.000> also<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:37.530> know<00:03:37.590> pretty<00:03:37.950> useful<00:03:38.370> Afflalo

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
it's also you know pretty useful Afflalo

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.000 
it's also you know pretty useful Afflalo
you<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.090> run<00:03:39.329> this<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:40.560> will<00:03:40.739> actually

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
you can run this and this will actually

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.610 
you can run this and this will actually
check<00:03:41.400> all<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.880> files<00:03:42.120> operating<00:03:42.690> system<00:03:43.019> for

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
check all the files operating system for

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.800 
check all the files operating system for
any<00:03:43.769> corrupt<00:03:44.430> files<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.060> stuff<00:03:45.269> like<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.630> so

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
any corrupt files and stuff like that so

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.660 
any corrupt files and stuff like that so
it's<00:03:45.930> pretty<00:03:46.109> useful<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:47.250> let's<00:03:47.280> have<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.579> look

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
it's pretty useful so let's have a look

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.300 
it's pretty useful so let's have a look
at<00:03:47.819> step<00:03:48.030> 4<00:03:48.359> or<00:03:48.840> step<00:03:49.139> 4<00:03:49.380> is<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.680> most<00:03:49.889> probably

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
at step 4 or step 4 is the most probably

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.309 
at step 4 or step 4 is the most probably
important<00:03:50.760> part<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.090> computers<00:03:51.600> which<00:03:52.139> is

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
important part of computers which is

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.069 
important part of computers which is
taking<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.130> restore<00:03:53.549> point<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:54.060> also<00:03:54.540> making

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
taking a restore point and also making

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.319 
taking a restore point and also making
registry<00:03:55.590> backups<00:03:56.010> people<00:03:56.910> don't<00:03:57.090> back<00:03:57.299> up

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
registry backups people don't back up

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.449 
registry backups people don't back up
regular<00:03:57.900> enough<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.950> real<00:03:59.250> pet

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
regular enough and this is a real pet

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.710 
regular enough and this is a real pet
hate<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.819> mine<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.239> it's<00:04:00.359> been<00:04:00.540> happening

since time begun really and there's no

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.750 
since time begun really and there's no
need<00:04:04.170> for<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.410> nowadays<00:04:04.590> there's<00:04:05.100> plenty<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.489> a

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
need for it nowadays there's plenty of a

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.199 
need for it nowadays there's plenty of a
software<00:04:06.690> out<00:04:06.840> there<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.920> make<00:04:08.400> backups<00:04:08.940> for

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
software out there to make backups for

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.910 
software out there to make backups for
your<00:04:09.389> system<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.810> even<00:04:09.989> built<00:04:10.260> into<00:04:10.560> Windows

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
your system is even built into Windows

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.640 
your system is even built into Windows
itself<00:04:11.459> now<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.269> is<00:04:12.420> done<00:04:12.660> by<00:04:12.840> iran's<00:04:13.410> i

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
itself now this is done by iran's i

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.170 
itself now this is done by iran's i
think<00:04:13.889> which<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.190> very<00:04:14.519> good<00:04:14.700> tool<00:04:14.940> and

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
think which is a very good tool and

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.330 
think which is a very good tool and
though<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.870> can<00:04:16.049> backup<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.620> restore<00:04:16.919> your

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
though you can backup and restore your

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.159 
though you can backup and restore your
registry<00:04:17.700> from<00:04:17.910> here<00:04:18.239> now<00:04:18.389> you<00:04:18.450> can<00:04:18.660> also<00:04:18.810> do

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
registry from here now you can also do

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.960 
registry from here now you can also do
this<00:04:19.350> inside<00:04:19.799> windows<00:04:20.280> itself<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:20.850> don't

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
this inside windows itself you don't

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.969 
this inside windows itself you don't
need<00:04:21.180> this<00:04:21.329> tool<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.780> do<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:22.140> but<00:04:22.710> it's<00:04:22.860> very

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
need this tool to do that but it's very

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.040 
need this tool to do that but it's very
nice<00:04:23.159> to<00:04:23.220> have<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.760> feature<00:04:23.970> here<00:04:24.419> you<00:04:24.900> can

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
nice to have that feature here you can

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.110 
nice to have that feature here you can
also<00:04:25.200> do<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.680> inside<00:04:26.099> windows<00:04:26.550> as<00:04:26.729> well

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
also do this inside windows as well

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.510

and<00:06:40.320> that

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:40.729 
and that

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.659 
and that
also<00:06:41.120> is<00:06:41.389> a<00:06:41.719> male<00:06:42.229> related<00:06:42.800> issue<00:06:42.979> because

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
also is a male related issue because

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.510 
also is a male related issue because
male<00:06:44.240> where<00:06:44.449> does<00:06:44.659> that<00:06:45.099> repair<00:06:46.099> the<00:06:46.219> windows

male where does that repair the windows

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.670 
male where does that repair the windows
update<00:06:46.909> another<00:06:47.210> thing<00:06:47.479> which<00:06:48.080> is<00:06:48.259> related<00:06:48.650> to

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
update another thing which is related to

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.649 
update another thing which is related to
malware<00:06:48.979> so<00:06:49.279> I<00:06:49.309> would<00:06:49.729> say<00:06:49.969> these<00:06:50.599> are

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
malware so I would say these are

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:52.779 
malware so I would say these are
probably<00:06:51.169> all<00:06:51.289> related<00:06:51.740> to<00:06:51.889> malware<00:06:52.219> related

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
probably all related to malware related

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.499 
probably all related to malware related
issues<00:06:53.300> very<00:06:53.779> very<00:06:54.080> good<00:06:54.309> so<00:06:55.309> we've<00:06:55.909> got<00:06:56.029> MSI

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:58.989 
issues very very good so we've got MSI
installer<00:06:57.009> which<00:06:58.009> is<00:06:58.189> another<00:06:58.370> common<00:06:58.759> thing

00:06:58.989 --> 00:06:58.999 
installer which is another common thing

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:01.959

there so as you can see pretty useful

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:04.029 
there so as you can see pretty useful
and<00:07:02.240> all<00:07:02.809> you<00:07:02.990> would<00:07:03.110> need<00:07:03.289> to<00:07:03.439> do<00:07:03.589> here<00:07:03.889> is

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
and all you would need to do here is

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.649 
and all you would need to do here is
tick<00:07:04.339> the<00:07:04.520> ones<00:07:04.550> that<00:07:04.939> you<00:07:05.059> want<00:07:05.240> to<00:07:05.330> repair

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:07.729 
and then click on the start button now

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:09.909 
and then click on the start button now
would<00:07:07.969> say<00:07:08.240> a<00:07:08.779> word<00:07:09.199> of<00:07:09.349> caution<00:07:09.559> here

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
would say a word of caution here

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.129 
would say a word of caution here
I<00:07:10.009> won't<00:07:10.159> go<00:07:10.370> running<00:07:10.849> all<00:07:11.270> of<00:07:11.569> these<00:07:11.719> if<00:07:12.020> you
