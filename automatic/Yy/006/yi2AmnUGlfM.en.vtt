continue<00:01:50.990> inside<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.829> then<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:52.490> get<00:01:52.610> insight

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
continue inside and then you get insight

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.270 
continue inside and then you get insight
and<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.119> see<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.450> ultra<00:01:54.079> slim<00:01:54.409> baller<00:01:54.890> and

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
and you see the ultra slim baller and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.730 
and you see the ultra slim baller and
yeah<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.030> really<00:01:56.540> really<00:01:56.689> slim<00:01:57.079> I've<00:01:57.500> got

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
yeah it is really really slim I've got

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.130 
yeah it is really really slim I've got
so<00:01:57.950> thick<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:59.060> let's<00:01:59.540> just<00:01:59.720> move<00:01:59.840> this<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.110> a

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
so thick so let's just move this to a

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.630 
so thick so let's just move this to a
site<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.560> looks<00:02:01.040> it's<00:02:01.280> definitely

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
site and it looks it's definitely

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.240 
site and it looks it's definitely
slimmer<00:02:01.850> than<00:02:02.030> their<00:02:02.240> original<00:02:02.360> Dex<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.920> first

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
slimmer than their original Dex so first

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.800 
slimmer than their original Dex so first
off<00:02:04.399> you<00:02:04.430> receive<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.790> two<00:02:04.969> jokers<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.659> have

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
off you receive the two jokers you have

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.929 
off you receive the two jokers you have
Joker<00:02:06.200> Joker<00:02:06.380> these<00:02:07.070> are<00:02:07.219> exactly<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.700> same

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
Joker Joker these are exactly the same

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.669 
Joker Joker these are exactly the same
but<00:02:08.209> obviously<00:02:08.540> one<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.959> like<00:02:09.320> this<00:02:09.530> is

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
but obviously one is it like this is

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.220 
but obviously one is it like this is
printed<00:02:10.040> with<00:02:10.190> metallic<00:02:10.729> inks<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.049> I<00:02:12.079> think

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
printed with metallic inks so I think

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.720 
printed with metallic inks so I think
this<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.500> very<00:02:12.590> shiny<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.220> have<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:13.430> blue<00:02:13.700> one

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
whole way through same idea with the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.370 
whole way through same idea with the
kind<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.519> scratch<00:03:33.850> look<00:03:34.120> like<00:03:34.299> clubs<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.930> the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
kind of scratch look like clubs and the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.069 
kind of scratch look like clubs and the
same<00:03:35.590> with<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.950> harps<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:37.450> it's<00:03:37.720> quite<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.930> nice

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
same with the harps so it's quite a nice

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.720 
same with the harps so it's quite a nice
looking<00:03:38.440> deck<00:03:38.709> but<00:03:39.100> how<00:03:39.400> does<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:39.700> actually

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
looking deck but how does it actually

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.180 
looking deck but how does it actually
handle<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:41.140> one<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.620> my<00:03:41.890> main<00:03:42.160> things

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
handle and that is one of my main things

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.280 
handle and that is one of my main things
because<00:03:42.910> obviously<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.329> like<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.660> debt<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.019> last

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
because obviously I like a debt to last

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.949 
because obviously I like a debt to last
so<00:03:44.980> how<00:03:45.130> does<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.400> handle<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:45.940> first<00:03:46.209> off<00:03:46.450> it

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
so how does it handle so first off it

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.900 
so how does it handle so first off it
does<00:03:47.140> dribble<00:03:47.500> really<00:03:47.890> well<00:03:48.100> it's<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.670> really

problem with the springs we can do a

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.789 
problem with the springs we can do a
riffle<00:04:00.310> shuffle<00:04:01.200> easy<00:04:02.200> peasy

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
glass table it's a little bit easier

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:25.980

than<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.210> other<00:04:25.360> one<00:04:25.570> because<00:04:25.720> it<00:04:25.870> actually

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990
