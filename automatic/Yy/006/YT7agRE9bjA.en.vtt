00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.570
 to 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.350
 clear that if we continue here in the 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.870
 little corner the crafts and it was arrived 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.450
 the moment to give the final touch to 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.000
 this album of your good baby lived 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.360
 Tell us then how did you finish this 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.700
 good project we already finished with several 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.710
 details then we use what they are 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.860
 the buttons show him ar-15 and of course 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.860
 yes 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.370
 then what we use we use 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.489
 star buttons we use some 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.500
 figures that come with adhesive 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.470
 we use paper flowers and 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.230
 We began distributing the images 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.519
 that we had that we had four what 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.890
 I want to like the viewers of 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.660
 soon understand is that they can 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.090
 delay the time you want is 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.190
 design is to create is to have all 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.110
 items on the table you can have ribbons 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.879
 you can have thousands of things in any 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.680
 moment you can use something and it's like 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.720
 that the little spark is on you and it's 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.150
 here then it's just having it 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.490
 many elements that at the right time 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.780
 you are going to use it and I like that technique 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.119
 for lovers of crafts 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.640
 live because they keep everything in those 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.460
 small boxes that indicates that moÃ±ito 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.080
 the little button that the accessories then 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.150
 it's very nice to know that we have them to the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.590
 hand and that we can go using them 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.510
 depending on the project that we are going to 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.330
 make with the scrapbook yes clear that 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.130
 yes and it is and it is also I want to like that 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.780
 have patience that suddenly in the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.810
 moment they are going to sit down to be done 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.340
 do then let's say the album sheet does not 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.980
 have a lot of creation and you work like 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.350
 waiting for 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.510
 and come out rather like to breathe to take 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.090
 air and it comes back again like to create 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.800
 it's true and another message that I 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.780
 it happens to live that many times we are 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.670
 looking like the perfect moment and 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.830
 we want to sit down let's say a whole 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.930
 whole afternoon and say good then this 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.300
 I'm going to do six pages later and I'm leaving 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.370
 to sit you can not have it there at hand 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.410
 and if we have a space cited free then 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.600
 start and what does it matter if we leave it 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.030
 started nothing happens and nothing happens no 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.380
 is to let is let creativity 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.390
 surprise us 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 it does not surprise us because 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.920
 that we have done so many things and when 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.680
 we ended up as bill I did the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.810
 happiness that is not to be afraid of 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.300
 risk for example in the case of 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.990
 maria camila of this princess that was the 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.910
 responsible for giving life to this album 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.770
 because when it's big it's a big 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.050
 legacy and a gift that is leaving you 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.940
 lina to her daughter to know that she has her 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.290
 small album and not only that but 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.840

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.610
 new clear that yes is that of these something 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.250
 it is about when one is already 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.710
 bigger and the sit down to see see 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.900

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.270

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.740
