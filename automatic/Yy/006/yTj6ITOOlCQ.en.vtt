00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
six in a row thoughts on that match I

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.250

think you played wonderful today against

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.280 
think you played wonderful today against
Rafa<00:03:55.450> against<00:03:56.450> Raph<00:03:56.629> you<00:03:56.750> always<00:03:56.959> need<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.170> good

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
Rafa against Raph you always need a good

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.199 
Rafa against Raph you always need a good
performance<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:57.860> come<00:03:58.040> through<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.489> I<00:03:58.849> think

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
performance to come through and I think

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.960 
performance to come through and I think
he's<00:03:59.480> proved<00:04:00.260> that<00:04:00.470> he's<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.650> grandson<00:04:01.519> contend

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
he's proved that he's a grandson contend

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.699 
he's proved that he's a grandson contend
I<00:04:02.120> mean<00:04:02.239> he's<00:04:02.329> not<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.019> final<00:04:03.260> for<00:04:03.379> nothing

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
I mean he's not in the final for nothing

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.559 
I mean he's not in the final for nothing
and<00:04:03.890> I'm<00:04:04.370> looking<00:04:04.609> forward<00:04:04.879> to<00:04:04.910> play<00:04:05.239> against
