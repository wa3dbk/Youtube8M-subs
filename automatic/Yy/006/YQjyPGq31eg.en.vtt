00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.410
 dough she pancake had raptor had 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.050
 Lasagna and what more humiliation 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.800
 thinking is a super practical and easy to 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.900
 do 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.180
 released from the cruise phase of the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.129
 dukan diet and this recipe is not 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.489
 My universal, in fact, I do not know 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.019
 who is she runs the internet a lot like 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.250
 pancake batter recipe 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.470
 but I discovered that it has several 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.180
 other utilities so I've made pizza with 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.460
 This is ours, I already did is is to discuss the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.680
 that will differentiate is the amount that 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.449
 You will use this recipe that I will 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.670
 come to you if you're going to do the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.430
 woman for example , or for one 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.339
 Hard dough it's two servings 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.110
 if you are going to do for example a 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.049
 tortilla or a pancake you will use 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.260
 this recipe to make a good taste 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.320
 Let's start, I'll add the milk. 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320
 skimmed 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.780
 my other party 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.560
 to condition the skimmed-milk powder 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.720
 mixing in a tablespoon of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.720
 maize starch 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.760
 and a pinch of salt 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.510
 It is very simple and there are five years not only 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.510
 mix to leave this mass well homogeneous 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.470
 will be yes one of them is the same and now 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.470
 we are going to take the actress of d 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.599
 ah 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.730
 hours stirring a little bit 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.780
 the skillet so as not to run the risk of 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.780
 burn edge 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.620
 here I am making the entire recipe 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.750
 but it's like I told you 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.540
 You can only make half a dough. 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.920
 thinner and want to do it is to do 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.040
 dough for there 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.040
 Hmm 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.440
 This is totally useless after I go. 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.810
 to pass on various ethnicities to you not 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.950

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.950
 You're going to have to wonder. 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.060
 affirmed 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.030
