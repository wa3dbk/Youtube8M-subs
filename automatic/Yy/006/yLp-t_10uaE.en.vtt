00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.240
 as a ping-pong for you to tell us 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.050
 a little bit more about you which considers that 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.050
 It is your greatest virtue 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.279
 I believe that the delivery 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.279
 you had an idol, you have an idol 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.650
 I always said what 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.980
 my brother because I saw him grow up because 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.980
 I gave it 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.039
 give the maximum and it was from him where 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.840
 sincerely well is the building that 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.269
 had to be done and before taking the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.760
 things the best things to revert 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.200
 to be a professional like the game the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.050
 goal more screams you 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.050
 there is one there are several goals 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.220
 If I had to choose there are many goals 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.220
 that first they take to mind 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.650
 surely the first goal I do in 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.350
 Italy 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.920
 what it meant to arrive at that moment 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.640
 young and how he had given 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.560
 the situation of that fair party 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.670
 he left players in front of what he had 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.200
 what to go 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.810
 sick 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.119
 it's not that there was a fever the technician 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.820
 leaves in his house the technician had 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.320
 declared during the week that I dug 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.810
 he was not ready yet he was missing 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.429
 a lot to start playing and that's 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.190
 it came and it was in my first game and we're going 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.740
 seeing 1 to 0 and also let's say 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.510
 is football really edited with a lot 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 quarrel but not white and anahÃ­ but that 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.080
 quarrel about the situation as it was 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.430
 giving so 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.170
 once the goals that marked me that 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.360
 He sincerely opened many doors because 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.740
 in italy gave me the good chance of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.460
 be a little more named and start to 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.650
 have a respect 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.390
 another difficult question I say the cutest 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.030
 what have you done 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.869
 and there are some 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.869
 a little 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:19.470
 but that are beautiful the importance of 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.270
 match according to good what 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.520
 which is being played like this is a 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.860
 final or if we did not each have their 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.620
 feature are all one but almost 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.390
 I do not always remember myself honestly 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.000
 which was the cutest of all that 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.250
 I did and what a party you left saying 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.250
 I broke it today I broke it 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.790
 and there's no match so you know it's given 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.600
 account as a policy with little ball is given 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.820
 account that it went well that cheek 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.340
 let's say that he fulfilled a bit of everything 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.520
 the sacrifice the delivery were not lost 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.310
 ball became the simplest play 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.640
 the best decision was made and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.010
 the correct one at every moment then 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.100
 there are matches that happen to you I do not know if the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.300
 I broke but honestly hearing well that 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.300
 yes we hate 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.190
 which was the rival that best marked you if 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.990
 you remember 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.100
 if I remember because we say a rival 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.170
 what 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.130
 for many years let's say experience 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.130
 In Italy it was Kelly 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.440
 good 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.640
 play against because he has known good 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.860
 be three goals 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.480
 also also but good are matches 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.910
 those are situations that will be split 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.610
 I think it has been in the defense that 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.410
 more complicated 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.100
 you have a rival that you like 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.570
 deal 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.530
 I like me who face the most 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.020
 hard 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.420
 according to the situation after renting a 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.470
 classic I like to face the rivals 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.850
 by more known or not known that is 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.770
 depends on the situation 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.360
 for me always every foot every game is 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.650
 a final but the party that has a 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.380
 different flavor 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.270
 that kind of match by let's say 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.590
 the transcendence that may also have 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.590
 that match for me 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.380
 change little
