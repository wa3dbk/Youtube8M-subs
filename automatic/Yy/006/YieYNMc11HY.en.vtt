00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
physical buttons and the DualShock

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.820 
physical buttons and the DualShock
controller<00:00:20.279> right<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.869> what<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.470> is

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
controller right but what we do have is

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.070 
controller right but what we do have is
the<00:00:22.980> touchscreen<00:00:23.430> both<00:00:23.820> front<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.300> rear<00:00:24.420> so

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the touchscreen both front and rear so

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.259 
the touchscreen both front and rear so
we're<00:00:25.439> trying<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.800> incorporate<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we're trying to incorporate that in a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.790 
we're trying to incorporate that in a
lot<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.449> unique<00:00:27.810> ways<00:00:28.109> because<00:00:28.470> there's<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> lot

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
lot of unique ways because there's a lot

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500 
lot of unique ways because there's a lot
of<00:00:28.830> ideas<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.490> how<00:00:29.640> touch<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.330> be

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
of ideas of how touch can be

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.799 
of ideas of how touch can be
incorporated<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:32.009> how<00:00:32.130> six<00:00:32.640> axis<00:00:33.030> or<00:00:33.270> tilt<00:00:33.540> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
incorporated or how six axis or tilt you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.200 
incorporated or how six axis or tilt you
know<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:35.910> us<00:00:36.030> it's

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
you can see them start moving over to

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.520 
you can see them start moving over to
the<00:01:38.940> touch<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.450> start<00:01:39.810> using<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.110> more<00:01:40.409> up

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the touch and start using that more up

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.919 
the touch and start using that more up
so<00:01:40.709> the<00:01:40.920> ability<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.580> like<00:01:41.729> integrate<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
so the ability to like integrate to

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.469 
so the ability to like integrate to
stick<00:01:43.229> motion<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:44.009> touch<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.759> six<00:01:45.090> axis

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
stick motion with touch with six axis

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.699 
stick motion with touch with six axis
and<00:01:45.689> having<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.170> fit<00:01:46.289> as<00:01:46.409> long<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:46.619> it

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
and having it just fit as long as it

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:47.929 
and having it just fit as long as it
feels<00:01:46.830> natural<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.399> long<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.729> fun

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
feels natural as long as it's fun

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.760 
feels natural as long as it's fun
frankly<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.869> think<00:01:49.170> players<00:01:49.470> are<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.709> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
frankly I think players are going to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.169 
frankly I think players are going to
like<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.490> keep<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.759> mind<00:01:50.789> that<00:01:51.000> what

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
like it and just keep in mind that what

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.910 
like it and just keep in mind that what
you're<00:01:51.330> seeing<00:01:51.569> right<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.049> our<00:01:52.530> first

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you're seeing right now is our first

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
you're seeing right now is our first
generation<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.819> gp-engine<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:55.080> we<00:01:55.289> can<00:01:55.500> do

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
generation in gp-engine what we can do

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.440 
generation in gp-engine what we can do
in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> future<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.789> it's<00:01:57.119> only<00:01:57.209> going<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
in the future I think it's only going to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.690 
in the future I think it's only going to
be<00:01:57.569> limited<00:01:57.750> by<00:01:58.080> our<00:01:58.220> imaginations<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.490> what

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
be limited by our imaginations and what

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.190 
be limited by our imaginations and what
we<00:01:59.819> can<00:02:00.000> come<00:02:00.119> up<00:02:00.179> with<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.080> that's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
we can come up with and I think that's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.389 
we can come up with and I think that's
probably<00:02:01.349> the<00:02:01.560> most<00:02:01.709> important<00:02:02.220> thing<00:02:02.310> about

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
probably the most important thing about

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.449 
probably the most important thing about
NGP<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.209> it<00:02:03.689> really<00:02:03.959> does<00:02:04.259> enable<00:02:04.590> game

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
NGP is it it really does enable game

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.699 
NGP is it it really does enable game

equally well and i think that's what has
us<00:02:18.780> excited
