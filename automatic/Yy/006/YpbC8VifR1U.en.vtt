mugshot and trainer mug shots art style

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.380 
mugshot and trainer mug shots art style
that<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:04.979> used<00:01:05.189> back<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.430> x<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.909> y<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> i

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
normal sprites that we used to have then

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
normal sprites that we used to have then
next<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.060> get<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> updated

style<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.689> only<00:01:18.780> thing<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
style of how it is the only thing that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.140 
style of how it is the only thing that
really<00:01:19.200> bothers<00:01:19.619> me<00:01:19.619> about<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.909> just

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
really bothers me about this is it just

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.789 
really bothers me about this is it just
seems<00:01:21.390> very<00:01:21.630> spacious<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.560> they're<00:01:22.680> like

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
seems very spacious and they're like

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.679 
seems very spacious and they're like
there's<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> whole<00:01:23.100> bunch<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.340> empty<00:01:23.580> space<00:01:23.880> but

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
there's a whole bunch of empty space but

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.510 
there's a whole bunch of empty space but
that's<00:01:24.960> how<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.530> original<00:01:25.860> game<00:01:25.950> so

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that's how it was the original game so

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
that's how it was the original game so
there's<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.090> much<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.330> complain<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.689> their

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960

believe<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.400> fall<00:03:01.700> through<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:01.970> floor<00:03:02.000> and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
believe you fall through the floor and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.430 
believe you fall through the floor and
there<00:03:02.480> are<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.570> whole<00:03:02.660> bunch<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.870> trainers<00:03:03.230> down

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
there are a whole bunch of trainers down

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.350 
there are a whole bunch of trainers down
there<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.430> water<00:03:04.670> in<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.910> background

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
there and the water in the background

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.760 
there and the water in the background
with<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.570> girl<00:03:05.840> who<00:03:06.080> appears<00:03:06.440> being<00:03:06.710> a

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
with the girl who appears being a

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.320 
with the girl who appears being a
bathing<00:03:07.160> suit<00:03:07.310> just<00:03:07.550> standing<00:03:07.970> on<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.150> water

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
bathing suit just standing on the water

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.360 
bathing suit just standing on the water
like<00:03:08.570> she<00:03:08.750> could<00:03:08.900> fly<00:03:09.140> or<00:03:09.320> something<00:03:09.740> it<00:03:10.250> would

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
like she could fly or something it would

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.890 
like she could fly or something it would
definitely<00:03:10.550> make<00:03:10.730> sense<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.660> most

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
definitely make sense so this is most

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.990 
definitely make sense so this is most
likely<00:03:12.110> through<00:03:12.470> topless<00:03:12.860> cities<00:03:13.160> gym<00:03:13.430> then

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
likely through topless cities gym then

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.520 
likely through topless cities gym then
next<00:03:14.180> up<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.510> have<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.660> really<00:03:14.900> nice<00:03:15.020> addition

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
next up we have a really nice addition

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.440 
next up we have a really nice addition
Steven<00:03:16.070> talking<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.580> Brendan<00:03:16.970> about<00:03:17.090> mega

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
Steven talking to Brendan about mega

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.570 
Steven talking to Brendan about mega
evolution<00:03:18.050> now<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.590> makes<00:03:18.860> perfect<00:03:19.400> sense

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
evolution now this makes perfect sense

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.760 
evolution now this makes perfect sense
because<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.060> original<00:03:20.150> Steven<00:03:21.140> was<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.380> Stone

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
because the original Steven was a Stone

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.860 
because the original Steven was a Stone
collector<00:03:21.850> but<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:23.060> didn't<00:03:23.270> really<00:03:23.300> understand

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
collector but I didn't really understand

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.910 
collector but I didn't really understand
that<00:03:24.050> because<00:03:24.230> why<00:03:24.560> would<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.709> collect

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
that because why would you collect

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.949 
that because why would you collect
stones<00:03:25.310> but<00:03:26.060> now<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.510> all<00:03:26.630> makes<00:03:26.660> sense

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
stones but now it all makes sense

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.660 
stones but now it all makes sense
because<00:03:27.260> he<00:03:27.920> might<00:03:28.070> have<00:03:28.160> been<00:03:28.250> collecting

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
because he might have been collecting

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.730 
because he might have been collecting
mega<00:03:28.910> stones<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.600> who<00:03:29.690> knows<00:03:29.840> Nintendo<00:03:30.530> might

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
mega stones and who knows Nintendo might

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.530 
mega stones and who knows Nintendo might
have<00:03:30.860> planned<00:03:31.070> out<00:03:31.220> mega<00:03:31.490> evolutions<00:03:32.030> all<00:03:32.209> the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
have planned out mega evolutions all the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.420 
have planned out mega evolutions all the
way<00:03:32.630> back<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:33.020> ruby<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.350> sapphire<00:03:33.380> but<00:03:34.310> then

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
way back in ruby and sapphire but then

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.790 
way back in ruby and sapphire but then
scrap<00:03:34.820> them<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.420> just<00:03:35.930> left<00:03:36.140> Steven<00:03:36.620> as<00:03:36.770> a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
scrap them and just left Steven as a

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.160 
scrap them and just left Steven as a
freaky<00:03:37.370> Stone<00:03:37.610> collector<00:03:37.790> diet<00:03:38.240> I<00:03:38.510> really

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
freaky Stone collector diet I really

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
freaky Stone collector diet I really
like<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.440> because<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:39.890> shows<00:03:40.160> that

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
like this because this shows that

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.010 
like this because this shows that
they're<00:03:40.610> adding<00:03:41.090> new<00:03:41.300> stuff<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.900> the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
they're adding new stuff to the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.750 
they're adding new stuff to the
storyline<00:03:42.530> even<00:03:42.890> though<00:03:43.010> this<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.340> remake

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
storyline even though this is a remake

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.910 
storyline even though this is a remake
and<00:03:44.030> Ruby<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.050> Sapphire<00:03:45.440> could<00:03:45.620> definitely

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
and Ruby and Sapphire could definitely

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.130 
and Ruby and Sapphire could definitely
use<00:03:46.040> some<00:03:46.340> help<00:03:46.730> with<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.030> storyline<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:47.900> I

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
use some help with the storyline so I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.590 
use some help with the storyline so I
just<00:03:48.709> think<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.220> great<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.730> next<00:03:50.300> up<00:03:50.480> we

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600

instead<00:04:42.640> of<00:04:42.730> mega<00:04:42.940> evolutions<00:04:43.570> I'm<00:04:43.930> guessing

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
instead of mega evolutions I'm guessing

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.870 
instead of mega evolutions I'm guessing
this<00:04:44.590> indicates<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.250> they're<00:04:45.460> like<00:04:45.610> ancient
