00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
ado I guess let's get started the first

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.350 
ado I guess let's get started the first
object<00:00:37.530> I'm<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.309> find<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> roomed

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
object I'm going to find is a roomed

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.430 
object I'm going to find is a roomed
book<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.410> choose<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:42.090> guess<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> find<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
book and I choose I I guess to find it I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200 
book and I choose I I guess to find it I
think<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:43.980> sure<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.399> borrow<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.090> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
think I'm not sure which borrow it is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270 
think I'm not sure which borrow it is
but<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.780> Iver<00:00:46.020> stead<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.980> reason<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
but it's in Iver stead and the reason I

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
but it's in Iver stead and the reason I
chose<00:00:47.520> Iver<00:00:48.300> stead<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.930> video<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
chose Iver stead for this video is

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.369 
chose Iver stead for this video is
because<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.219> need<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.700> go<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> Iver<00:00:51.510> stead<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
because you need to go to Iver stead to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.959 
because you need to go to Iver stead to
get<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> high<00:00:52.680> Hrothgar<00:00:52.920> which<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.610> early

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
get to high Hrothgar which is very early

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
get to high Hrothgar which is very early
in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> game<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.840> probably<00:00:55.140> should<00:00:55.379> go

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
in the game and you probably should go

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
in the game and you probably should go
there<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:55.739> soon<00:00:55.860> as<00:00:55.949> possible<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.640> there's<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
there as soon as possible so there's a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.060 
there as soon as possible so there's a
bar<00:00:58.050> oh<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.649> next<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> Nordic<00:00:59.609> tomb

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
bar oh right next to it or a Nordic tomb

so in any Nordic tomb there are rune
books<00:01:04.199> everywhere<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.189> you're<00:01:05.369> already
