alright so on low carbon no carb days

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.499 
alright so on low carbon no carb days
you<00:06:03.680> increase<00:06:04.039> your<00:06:04.129> fats<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:04.460> little<00:06:04.669> bit<00:06:04.789> 25

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
you increase your fats a little bit 25

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.809

to<00:06:05.750> 50<00:06:06.080> grams<00:06:06.319> maximum<00:06:07.129> because<00:06:07.310> if<00:06:07.550> you<00:06:07.639> do

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:07.819 
to 50 grams maximum because if you do

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.679 
to 50 grams maximum because if you do
more<00:06:08.089> than<00:06:08.150> that<00:06:08.449> then<00:06:09.439> it's<00:06:09.620> it<00:06:10.129> basically<00:06:10.729> it

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:11.689 
more than that then it's it basically it

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.320 
more than that then it's it basically it
hurts<00:06:12.589> this<00:06:12.860> process<00:06:13.400> because<00:06:13.969> your<00:06:14.089> body

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
hurts this process because your body

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.730 
hurts this process because your body
doesn't<00:06:14.419> go<00:06:14.719> into<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.080> fat<00:06:15.229> stores<00:06:15.469> and<00:06:15.650> start

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
doesn't go into the fat stores and start

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.890 
doesn't go into the fat stores and start
and<00:06:16.189> burn<00:06:16.550> them<00:06:16.759> because<00:06:17.029> it<00:06:17.210> still<00:06:17.599> has<00:06:17.750> to

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
and burn them because it still has to

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.110 
and burn them because it still has to
burn<00:06:18.050> the<00:06:18.169> fat<00:06:18.259> that<00:06:18.319> you<00:06:18.529> ate<00:06:18.740> okay<00:06:19.189> so<00:06:19.400> that's

really<00:06:20.659> really<00:06:20.960> important<00:06:21.439> to<00:06:21.469> understand

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009
