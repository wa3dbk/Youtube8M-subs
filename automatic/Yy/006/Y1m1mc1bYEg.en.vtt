to get their inspirations for what the
Superbike<00:00:51.800> should<00:00:52.159> be<00:00:52.339> an<00:00:52.670> innovation<00:00:53.210> from

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
Superbike should be an innovation from

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.079 
Superbike should be an innovation from
there<00:00:54.019> we<00:00:54.170> went<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.589> some<00:00:54.829> 2d<00:00:55.219> drawings<00:00:55.699> and

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
there we went to some 2d drawings and

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.669 
there we went to some 2d drawings and
three-dimensional<00:00:56.899> drawings<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:57.440> get<00:00:57.589> the

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
three-dimensional drawings to get the

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.130 
three-dimensional drawings to get the
basic<00:00:58.069> concept<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:58.850> what<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.719> bike<00:00:59.899> should

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
basic concept of what the bike should

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.349 
basic concept of what the bike should
look<00:01:00.289> like<00:01:00.319> in<00:01:00.710> doing<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:01.699> we<00:01:01.909> looked<00:01:02.089> at<00:01:02.210> two

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
look like in doing that we looked at two

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.920 
look like in doing that we looked at two
key<00:01:02.600> areas<00:01:03.040> aerodynamics<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.250> weight<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:05.690> was

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
key areas aerodynamics and weight it was

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.870 
key areas aerodynamics and weight it was
also<00:01:06.140> at<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.500> forefront<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:07.010> our<00:01:07.130> thinking<00:01:07.190> so

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
also at the forefront of our thinking so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.300 
also at the forefront of our thinking so
with<00:01:08.060> that<00:01:08.210> we<00:01:08.479> created<00:01:08.780> seven<00:01:09.200> size<00:01:09.439> is<00:01:09.770> the

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
with that we created seven size is the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.700 
with that we created seven size is the
first<00:01:10.610> time<00:01:10.939> trial<00:01:11.329> travel<00:01:11.960> advice<00:01:12.259> that<00:01:12.590> has

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
first time trial travel advice that has

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.160 
first time trial travel advice that has
set<00:01:12.979> is<00:01:13.100> available<00:01:13.549> in<00:01:13.640> seven<00:01:13.880> sizes<00:01:14.180> it's

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
set is available in seven sizes it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.899 
set is available in seven sizes it's
also<00:01:15.409> one<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.950> lightest<00:01:16.310> frames<00:01:16.610> on<00:01:16.790> the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
also one of the lightest frames on the

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.840 
also one of the lightest frames on the
market<00:01:17.329> so<00:01:18.079> this<00:01:18.320> frame<00:01:18.680> is<00:01:18.829> based<00:01:19.070> on<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.280> 56

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
that we packed into this bike first

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.910 
that we packed into this bike first
internal<00:01:34.939> cable<00:01:35.299> routing<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:36.560> when<00:01:36.680> we<00:01:36.770> did

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
internal cable routing and when we did

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.130 
internal cable routing and when we did
the<00:01:36.979> internal<00:01:37.460> cable<00:01:37.789> routing<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.780> want<00:01:39.020> to

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the internal cable routing we want to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.109 
the internal cable routing we want to
make<00:01:39.289> it<00:01:39.409> very<00:01:39.590> easy<00:01:39.740> for<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.250> end-user<00:01:40.729> or

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
make it very easy for the end-user or

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.660 
make it very easy for the end-user or
mechanic<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.899> assemble<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.350> bike<00:01:42.500> once<00:01:43.219> from

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
mechanic to assemble the bike once from

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.599 
mechanic to assemble the bike once from
tip<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.140> tail<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.469> every<00:01:45.859> single<00:01:46.250> port

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
tip to tail of every single port

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.410 
tip to tail of every single port
initiative<00:01:47.299> is<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.689> full<00:01:48.170> PVC<00:01:49.039> housing<00:01:49.520> that

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
initiative is a full PVC housing that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.779 
initiative is a full PVC housing that
runs<00:01:50.689> from<00:01:50.960> tip<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.500> tail<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:52.490> can<00:01:52.609> just

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
runs from tip to tail so you can just

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.130 
runs from tip to tail so you can just
shove<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.149> cables<00:01:53.539> right<00:01:53.780> through

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
shove the cables right through

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.200 
shove the cables right through
seamlessly<00:01:54.799> just<00:01:55.219> without<00:01:55.399> having<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.939> fish

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
seamlessly just without having to fish

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.539 
seamlessly just without having to fish
the<00:01:56.659> cables<00:01:57.020> out<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.409> system<00:01:57.859> so<00:01:58.429> it's

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
the cables out of the system so it's

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.340 
the cables out of the system so it's
really<00:01:58.789> intuitive<00:01:59.149> really<00:01:59.869> simple<00:02:00.229> to
