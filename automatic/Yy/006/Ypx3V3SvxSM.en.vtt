00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.400
 Hello guys how are you 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.539
 welcome again to see what I 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 does in this video as I have seen is a 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.380
 small update of my room 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.150
 more or less where I have the laptops 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.529
 here as you see you have seen where I have 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.750
 the blackout I already told you one 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.760
 lots of times Mrs. Edwin and like 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.010
 seen connected here the transformer and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.850
 one thing thermostat controls what 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.320
 is light and something else controls what it is 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.570
 the temperature that many have me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 asked several times does not melt not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.980
 it melts because it does not melt if 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.469
 you have properly connected to a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.750
 thermostat that is what you graduate it and 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.220
 here you go to tiny as I have 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.840
 he is also happy that he had in a 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.690
 tupper a terrarium as you see I have it 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.280
 now functionally 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.949
 and well let's move on with the next 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.750
 side here we have the snake that 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.850
 is out there do not think about it much because 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.920
 Most are natural if it is daytime 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.440
 then the more or less so you see like this 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.720
 quickly as I have them located by 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.580
 here is the snake here we have 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.670
 tweezers that everything I have more or less the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.100
 utensils that I use to for my 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.540
 animals here are the evolutions 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.390
 you remember a lot of time ago 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.190
 that I made a video that I have the 2000 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.200
 feet of red-footed Africans what 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.119
 happens that it is always in the container and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.580
 it's impossible to see them get under there 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.229
 of the earth and well there we have them 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.759
 whenever I search with casey with a 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.000
 strainer if it's not because I scrap something of 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.770
 eat 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.390
 and we come back here down here as 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.490
 You see I have the box where I have rented 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.860
 from tenebrous 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.680
 once as I have them with just moving 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.320
 so everything here I have to mesh up 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.000
 that broke me and then there is a fix 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.100
 and all this is basically food here 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.840
 we have the behrouz table we have worms 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.350
 of honey we have there the rivers that do not 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.270
 I know if they get to see it does not sell good anymore 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.909
 or less we have it so it's worth here I have 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.979
 to the new one that by the way I'll say it later and 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.479
 I'm going to put a picture of how is it 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.830
 I have here at rest because as I carry 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.119
 a couple of days ago I do not want to bother 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.039
 look at it you've already finished there as always 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.450
 here we have the skull here we have 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.830
 the newts just to the right of 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.470
 passed very fast but this bullet 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.180
 I stayed with the board that is also 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.830
 sleeping I tell you here in this video 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.900
 it's not to teach the animals but 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.160
 just as I have more or less the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.810
 organization to give you an idea 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.890
 of how you can do it simply 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.690
 also tell you that I do it by request 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.640
 popular this has already been dismissed a 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.650
 center pile here you have a tad of 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.600
 schedule that I have for for the frog 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.790
 palman that you have already seen a couple of 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.520
 videos also to update by 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.260
 course and good here as you see us 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.480
 explains the importance of putting him though 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.920
 is not even a little bit of cable 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.450
 thermal down to give you a 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.090
 little bit of heat 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.070
 It's a trick so I think it's going 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.720
 pretty good here we also have another 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.010
 other than placing a male that also 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.570
 is sleeping there so we will see 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.280
 also the area to the hot zone 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.410
 there the bottom east yes here it is and 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.300
 vÃ­ctor stop advertising that is trichet 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.160
 subscribe or if you want I'll leave it there 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.680
 drop here you see the thermostat that 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.360
 control everything let's say what is the part 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.680
 from the shelf where I have the most 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.720
 of animals 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.970
 I want beige cotton this one if this one 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.430
 put to sleep where I want this one 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.160
 has regards so this is one of 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.750
 those in the terrarium not in 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.220
 future projects I do not know if it will end 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.070
 changing terrarium will end up seeing 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.420
 racks at the moment I have mixed and here then 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.239
 I have come to females 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.220
 they are also all asleep and already what 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.800
 you see also this is the one that we say more 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.940
 wide a little bit bigger because 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.380
 you know with more animals 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.010
 so you have to do a little bit to alter 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.560
 me more adequate proportionally good 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.080
 well here you see it basically was a 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.180
 quick update of how I have of 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.459
 as I have the animals put and good 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.110

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.170

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.700
