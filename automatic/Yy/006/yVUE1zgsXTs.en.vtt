00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.739
 hello good evening today we are here 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.019
 for the first episode of my series which 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.809
 is called becoming a millionaire 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.320
 so what does this series consist of 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:33.199
 this series is to introduce yourself to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.620
 every time so where a tip for 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.879
 increase your credits or manage them 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.320
 so we'll start right now so 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.110
 for the fans who follow me on my page 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.379
 you can see that I am in about 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.570
 1 million 700 thousand credit and there you 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.610
 you ask how ben the beginning at 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.710
 start for those who remember I 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.059
 you had not bought any big players or 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.479
 chifa beats because they are a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.030
 huge price in montillot could cost 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.830
 up to 7000 broadband chief at these 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.439
 standards for a player who now does not 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.329
 worth not even 1000 2000 I think look 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.460
 it's really exaggerated plays there I 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.659
 you warned me I do not know if I 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.079
 passed to people who followed my 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.479
 advice 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.240
 if you did it you already did 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.070
 of the household but the tip of today 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.950
 is not this one so it's 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.720
 the trick that concerns the crash market 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.650
 is there you'll tell me but it's 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.060
 what crash markets 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.370
 I will explain to you right away 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.250
 so with the release of the tati so the 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.890
 tati what are the blue cards and near 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.479
 players have fallen and so by 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.299
 example I give you a nice example a 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.790
 kind that costs 20 thousand today 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.790
 lease may cost 15 thousand or less 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.990
 after that, it's already been five thousand 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.940
 imagine if you do it on ten 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.150
 players fifty thousand yards already 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.610
 not bad why I'm so sure 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.440
 that it does work sq year 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.210
 gone that was the same move you go 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.400
 see a lot of people will open 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.080
 packs so proof receive from 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.000
 players the tactics a lot a lot of 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.130
 players will discover what will 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.530
 cause more players in the market 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.970
 transfers so more sales so 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.789
 plus twice the same player who gets 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.799
 sells so fewer buyers finally the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.870
 same number of buyers earlier but 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.720
 more choices so players will be 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.220
 a lot cheaper so the advice that 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.260
 I give you true advice 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.599
 excuse me the central council that I 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.680
 give you today it's sell your 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.150
 big teams 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.990
 what they were going to make a profit from 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.970
 crowd or in a week see 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.650
 two weeks earlier his letter is a 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.330
 crazy thing you're going to win up 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.700
 for people who really invest 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.660
 many who are you going sounds 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.180
 millet etc 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.120
 so here's the tip of today's I 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.220
 repeat it is sell your players if they 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.560
 have huge value like for example 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.850
 a Russian who has already gone down there 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.590
 two weeks it is 100 miles 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.950
 now he's down to 90 I think 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.930
 so already there you can see that the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.060
 prices start going down to christmas the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.860
 prices went down too why pascal 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.930
 boccou easter opening for christmas 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.610
 so people who are ready cards 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.920
 psn 1 opened early easter is often and 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.990
 north-south is bad player or not and the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.600
 its directly put on sale what has 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.930
 provoked as I explained to you more 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.640
 more players offers the same number of 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.010
 requests but more offer so more 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.630
 choice so the highest so voila 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.060
 it was lasted today i hope that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.620
 you enjoyed if I had appreciated 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.120

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.120
