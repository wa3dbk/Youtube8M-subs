00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
be a good thing we will use that as a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.220 
be a good thing we will use that as a
positive<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.330> hope<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.690> there's<00:03:57.930> still

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
positive and hope that there's still

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.140

some<00:03:58.410> problems<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.400> changing<00:03:59.790> room<00:03:59.940> come

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
some problems in the changing room come

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.430 
some problems in the changing room come
the<00:04:00.239> world<00:04:00.420> cup<00:04:00.630> as<00:04:00.810> they<00:04:00.959> are<00:04:01.110> one<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.320> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
the world cup as they are one of the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.090 
the world cup as they are one of the
favourites

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
favourites

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.330 
favourites
as<00:04:03.580> a<00:04:03.610> captain<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.240> respect<00:04:04.660> John<00:04:05.620> as<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:05.860> captain

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.460 
and I suppose that the less said about
that<00:04:09.070> one<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.430> better<00:04:09.610> do<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.660> think<00:04:10.960> though

that one the better do you think though

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.930 
that one the better do you think though
Capello<00:04:11.860> has<00:04:12.010> made<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.280> right<00:04:12.460> decision<00:04:12.820> for

Capello has made the right decision for
the<00:04:13.180> sake<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.690> team<00:04:13.840> more<00:04:14.110> than<00:04:14.140> anything

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
the sake of the team more than anything

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.780 
the sake of the team more than anything

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.820 
else he's a highly respected manager and
I'm<00:04:19.510> sure<00:04:19.750> he's<00:04:19.959> done<00:04:20.170> what<00:04:20.320> he<00:04:20.440> thought<00:04:20.680> his

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
I'm sure he's done what he thought his
