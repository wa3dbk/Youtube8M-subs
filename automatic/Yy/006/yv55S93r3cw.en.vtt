by<00:00:01.410> now<00:00:01.620> you've<00:00:01.920> got<00:00:02.190> straight<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.760> level

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
by now you've got straight and level

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.079 
by now you've got straight and level

flight all figured out things get only a
little<00:00:06.569> more<00:00:06.930> complicated<00:00:07.500> if<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.309> decide<00:00:08.880> to

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
little more complicated if you decide to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.360 
little more complicated if you decide to
abandon<00:00:09.599> straight<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.469> level<00:00:10.620> flight<00:00:10.800> and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
abandon straight and level flight and

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.940 
abandon straight and level flight and
change<00:00:11.969> your<00:00:12.240> altitude<00:00:12.719> your<00:00:13.230> heading<00:00:13.710> or

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
change your altitude your heading or

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.240 
change your altitude your heading or
your<00:00:14.400> airspeed<00:00:14.969> now<00:00:15.750> when<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.650> instrument

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
your airspeed now when you do instrument

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.820 
your airspeed now when you do instrument
approaches<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.000> often<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.810> descend<00:00:19.470> at

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
approaches you often have to descend at

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.150 
approaches you often have to descend at
a<00:00:19.859> constant<00:00:20.520> airspeed<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.470> use<00:00:22.680> time

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
a constant airspeed so you can use time

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.460 
a constant airspeed so you can use time
to<00:00:23.939> keep<00:00:24.150> track<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> distance<00:00:25.380> that

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to keep track of the distance that

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.679 
to keep track of the distance that
you've<00:00:25.769> flown<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.369> approach<00:00:26.939> so

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
you've flown on the approach so

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.349 
you've flown on the approach so
descending<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> constant<00:00:29.189> airspeed<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
descending at a constant airspeed is a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.209 
descending at a constant airspeed is a
skill<00:00:30.929> you'll<00:00:31.199> need<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.859> flying

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
skill you'll need when flying

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.819 
skill you'll need when flying
instruments<00:00:33.120> now<00:00:33.630> we'll<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.710> a

the control pressure now suppose that

the control pressure now suppose that
what<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.680> want<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.980> do<00:02:23.100> instead<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
what you want to do instead is a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.530 
what you want to do instead is a
constant<00:02:24.810> airspeed<00:02:25.080> climb<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.880> remember<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
constant airspeed climb you remember the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.660 
constant airspeed climb you remember the
old<00:02:27.660> expression<00:02:27.960> from<00:02:28.650> your<00:02:28.830> private<00:02:29.220> pilot

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
old expression from your private pilot

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.080 
old expression from your private pilot
training<00:02:30.000> pitch<00:02:30.840> plus<00:02:31.620> power<00:02:32.090> equals

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
training pitch plus power equals

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.190 
training pitch plus power equals
performance

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
performance

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.440 
performance
well<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.800> expression<00:02:35.490> comes<00:02:35.850> into<00:02:36.210> play

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
well that expression comes into play

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.470 
well that expression comes into play
here<00:02:36.960> if<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.590> pitch<00:02:37.890> up<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.250> add<00:02:38.460> power<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
here if you pitch up and add power the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.770 
here if you pitch up and add power the
airplane<00:02:40.110> will<00:02:40.620> climb<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.880> start<00:02:42.270> by<00:02:42.510> using

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
airplane will climb so start by using

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.230 
airplane will climb so start by using
the<00:02:43.110> attitude<00:02:43.770> indicator<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.700> pitch<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
the attitude indicator to pitch the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.720 
the attitude indicator to pitch the
airplane<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:46.020> an<00:02:46.170> attitude<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:47.430> think

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
airplane to an attitude that you think

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.180 
airplane to an attitude that you think
will<00:02:47.940> result<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.690> climb<00:02:49.080> at<00:02:49.440> your<00:02:49.590> selected

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
will result in a climb at your selected

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.150 
will result in a climb at your selected
airspeed<00:02:50.790> with<00:02:51.030> full<00:02:51.300> power<00:02:51.570> say<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> bar<00:02:52.890> width

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
airspeed with full power say a bar width

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.420 
airspeed with full power say a bar width
up<00:02:53.460> now<00:02:54.330> when<00:02:54.540> your<00:02:54.720> airspeed<00:02:55.290> decreases<00:02:56.190> to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
up now when your airspeed decreases to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.330 
up now when your airspeed decreases to
your<00:02:56.640> desired<00:02:57.060> climb<00:02:57.570> airspeed<00:02:58.350> come<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.130> with

your desired climb airspeed come in with

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030 
your desired climb airspeed come in with
