and chances are that things will change

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.780 
and chances are that things will change
I'm<00:03:43.440> not<00:03:43.680> one<00:03:43.860> hundred<00:03:43.980> percent<00:03:44.160> sure<00:03:44.519> how

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
I'm not one hundred percent sure how

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.949 
I'm not one hundred percent sure how
long<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.150> software<00:03:45.480> will<00:03:45.600> be<00:03:45.690> available

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
long the software will be available

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.290 
long the software will be available
before<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.920> raise<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.220> price<00:03:47.459> when

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
before I have to raise the price when

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.820 
before I have to raise the price when
the<00:03:48.390> price<00:03:48.600> goes<00:03:48.630> up<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:49.170> know<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.560> will<00:03:49.680> limit

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
the price goes up I know that will limit

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.770 
the price goes up I know that will limit
the<00:03:50.040> access<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.640> plug<00:03:50.850> into<00:03:51.030> fewer<00:03:51.390> people

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
the access to the plug into fewer people

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.870 
the access to the plug into fewer people
so<00:03:52.500> it's<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.739> pretty<00:03:52.920> smart<00:03:53.190> move<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.430> pick<00:03:53.760> it

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
so it's a pretty smart move to pick it

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.580 
so it's a pretty smart move to pick it
up<00:03:54.000> now<00:03:54.209> while<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> price<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.959> low<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.350> fewer

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
up now while the price is low and fewer

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.240 
up now while the price is low and fewer
people<00:03:55.950> have<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.280> right<00:03:56.750> makes<00:03:57.750> sense<00:03:58.019> ok<00:03:58.800> just

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
people have it right makes sense ok just
