00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello the theme of our conversation in the country 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.720
 between today's explain will be the call 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.450
 spine surgery failure syndrome 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.040
 or post lamneck economy syndrome 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.230
 this syndrome occurs when a person 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.330
 after a spine surgery 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.240
 remains with the same pain 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.260
 before this surgery or the pains that she 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.269
 already felt intensified or even 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.849
 to feel pains that before the surgery 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.680
 occurred so I can not sleep in 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 economy is a risk according to some 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.329
 authors in 20 to 40 percent of the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.690
 surgery procedures in the spine or 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.040
 inherent in the procedure. 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.379
 clinical factors such as 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.440
 diabetes vascular diseases beyond the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.120
 smoking or a technical failure 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 for this patient 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 or an accurate indication of surgery 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.600
 that is, a surgery where 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.360
 would require a surgical approach 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 are also identified as causes for 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.059
 increased risk of post- lamechal syndrome 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.550
 economy with the procedures to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.989
 treating post-mortem syndrome in the economy 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.489
 first of them and maybe the most 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.960
 important is the procedures 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.299
 diagnoses and procedures 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.000
 diagnoses that we carry out with 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 radios aid copied to be x-ray in 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.450
 real time 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.280
 so I can get there accurately 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.189
 with my needle and test some 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.880
 structures that are possible causes of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.170
 pain in the patient's spine 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 however sometimes it is not possible 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.400
 accurately arrive at the structure 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.820
 cause the patient's pain in the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.350
 post-surgical procedure then some procedures 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.350
 These palliative measures must be 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.450
 to improve the pain of this patient and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.140
 cause an improvement in the quality of life 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.540
 of this patient also the first one is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.180
 the placement of an electro-stimulator 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.670
 medullary or spinal cord stimulator 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.250
 it's like an implanted pacemaker 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.159
 well below the skin of the patient in the region 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.649
 subcutaneous and this pacemaker will 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.500
 emitting electrical impulses that are 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.390
 transmitted by means of an electrode until 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.149
 the patient's bone marrow 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.280
 this electric impulse will try to neuro 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.590
 modular will try to modulate 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.440
 the painful uptake in the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.550
 patient and thereby cause an improvement 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.870
 in pain an analgesia for this patient 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.930
 the second to the second procedure 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.720
 are the infusion pumps of medication 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.940
 usually analgesic medication 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.310
 the pumps as well as the electrodes 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.920
 They are implanted subcutaneously on the right 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.590
 below the patient's skin and instead of 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.069
 if you have an electrode emitting impulses 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.010
 a small catheter 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.070
 In this patient's column this catheter 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.250
 to drip steadily from 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.650
 analgesic medication with this aiming 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.130
 also the improvement in the patient 's pain is 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.840
 better the functionality of this patient 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.700
 successful treatment of pain in the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.310
 in these patients who have already 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.900
 underwent a spinal surgery is 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.380
 smaller than those who never did 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.970
 any procedure in your column 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.730
 but this does not mean that there is no 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.560
 nothing to do with these patients 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.000
 as shown here with the advancement of 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.160
 medical technology 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.940
 it is not justified that a patient with pain 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.730
 even after a spinal surgery 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.720
 feeling pain and having your life limited 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.720
 on account of this process
