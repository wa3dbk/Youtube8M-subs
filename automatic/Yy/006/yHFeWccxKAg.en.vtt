00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.300
 Cookers such as the mentees title are 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.730
 because of her small pack size and the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.250
 very low weight, though perfect for 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.529
 the transport of sick really 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 toddler safely stand pots and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.609
 pans are not here by now 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.190
 I believe that integrated 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.379
 cooking systems quite a safe 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.629
 system represent the children come 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.190
 not so close to the heat source we ran 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.710
 for example, with a spider leg 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.839
 cooker and if you still have the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.330
 isolate cuff on it does then 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.000
 it is also relatively safe if times completely 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.820
 short is reached in the case of one 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.040
 children are rushing with systems 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.989
 spider legs only with acrobatic 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.000
 quick to clear away 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.129
 nice if you take the whole kitchen in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.019
 this case simply s.einer grip 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.880
 Raise and out of reach 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.680
 can hang the child are medium 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.990
 By the way, you do not have to be in safety 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.240
 bring the aua cook one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 reliable pc igniter has integrated 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.280
 the easy to use is 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.530
 only disadvantage in practice takes 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.109
 such a system quite a lot of space away 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.460
 but then go on or off for two 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.000
 just a few things 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.000
 renounce 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.750
 what to cook with a little child 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.860
 on tour right now we have winter 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.980
 weather conditions that means it has to 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.570
 really fast because so try 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.420
 I just have a guy today 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.550
 dish water here in the penguin aura 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.680
 Cooker made hot rhein tilted 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.030
 stirred and already can 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.030
 start eating 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.179
 Does not look so delicious even if it is 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.950
 get out of school 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.280
 Canada would be paper now 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.280
 friend 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.549
 therefore 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.090
 the Vorkoster says really well so 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.320
 especially now for children from now here 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.220
 adventure food as a company is that 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.410
 first finished eating this after my 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.140
 do not feel it over spice it too 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.720
 Here clear recommendation should be outside 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.700
 Then it's better to be cold 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:58.770
 the snack from the cold kitchen 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:03:03.210
 dodge habemus papam we have one 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:06.110
 new pope or our water is ready 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.110
