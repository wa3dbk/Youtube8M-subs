plated and it is 180 centimeters that at
the<00:02:17.920> cable<00:02:18.280> length<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.390> it's<00:02:19.660> find<00:02:20.290> no

them and we put the DPI rich it goes up

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.300 
them and we put the DPI rich it goes up
it's<00:02:43.180> quite<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.450> nice<00:02:43.720> button<00:02:44.110> when<00:02:44.590> we<00:02:44.769> press

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.880 
it's quite a nice button when we press
it<00:02:45.519> bit<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.849> DPI<00:02:46.330> let's<00:02:47.110> say<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.260> want<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.530> bit

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
it bit of DPI let's say you want a bit

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.699 
it bit of DPI let's say you want a bit
more<00:02:47.920> finer<00:02:48.489> movements<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.390> can<00:02:49.599> always<00:02:49.989> just

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
more finer movements you can always just

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.699 
more finer movements you can always just
change<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.069> DPI<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.120> do<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.709> so

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
change the DPI and you can do that so

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.789 
change the DPI and you can do that so

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
might be buying them of course but it

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.059 
might be buying them of course but it
all<00:03:27.790> easily<00:03:28.060> rebind<00:03:28.720> bald<00:03:29.019> inside<00:03:29.530> at<00:03:29.829> your

all easily rebind bald inside at your
software<00:03:30.760> they<00:03:31.420> come<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:31.959> on<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.109> disk

is<00:03:39.480> default<00:03:40.480> lee<00:03:40.690> we<00:03:41.049> pointed<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.980> saying<00:03:42.880> in

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
is default lee we pointed to saying in

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.780 
is default lee we pointed to saying in
the<00:03:43.150> mouse<00:03:43.359> color<00:03:43.750> with<00:03:44.230> at<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.829> moment<00:03:44.859> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the mouse color with at the moment the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.509 
the mouse color with at the moment the
default<00:03:46.150> ones<00:03:46.480> are<00:03:46.780> green<00:03:47.880> let<00:03:48.880> me<00:03:49.000> red<00:03:49.930> and

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
default ones are green let me red and

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.000 
default ones are green let me red and
blue<00:03:51.519> so<00:03:52.120> i<00:03:52.419> don't<00:03:52.959> really<00:03:53.049> care<00:03:53.769> about<00:03:53.799> that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
blue so i don't really care about that

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.670 
blue so i don't really care about that
as<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.489> hand<00:03:54.880> discovers<00:03:55.389> anyway<00:03:55.810> but<00:03:56.530> it's

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
as a hand discovers anyway but it's

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.220 
as a hand discovers anyway but it's
still<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:56.889> nice<00:03:57.160> thing<00:03:57.519> I<00:03:57.639> illuminated<00:03:58.419> logo<00:03:58.870> so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
still a nice thing I illuminated logo so

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.190 
still a nice thing I illuminated logo so
still<00:03:59.590> looks<00:03:59.859> pretty<00:03:59.950> good<00:04:00.340> now<00:04:01.019> with<00:04:02.019> the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
still looks pretty good now with the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.409 
still looks pretty good now with the
buttons<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.919> would<00:04:03.160> say<00:04:03.370> they're<00:04:03.579> mainly<00:04:03.910> high

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
buttons I would say they're mainly high

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.640 
buttons I would say they're mainly high
quality<00:04:04.959> however<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:06.340> middle<00:04:06.989> scroll<00:04:07.989> button

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
quality however the middle scroll button

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.509 
quality however the middle scroll button
I<00:04:08.859> have<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.099> say<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.489> feels<00:04:10.329> a<00:04:10.540> bit<00:04:10.569> cheap<00:04:11.139> I

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
I have to say it feels a bit cheap I

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.819 
I have to say it feels a bit cheap I
don't<00:04:12.519> really<00:04:12.819> tend<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.239> use<00:04:13.419> a<00:04:13.450> lot<00:04:13.810> as<00:04:14.049> for

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
don't really tend to use a lot as for

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.060 
don't really tend to use a lot as for
some<00:04:15.010> games<00:04:15.310> it's<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:16.239> middle<00:04:16.359> button<00:04:17.070> middle

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
some games it's the middle button middle

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.969 
some games it's the middle button middle
scroller<00:04:18.400> button<00:04:18.849> is<00:04:19.000> quite<00:04:19.359> useful<00:04:19.709> but<00:04:20.709> for

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
scroller button is quite useful but for

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.440 
scroller button is quite useful but for
this<00:04:21.130> mouth<00:04:21.400> have<00:04:21.609> just<00:04:21.820> said<00:04:21.940> wasn't<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.600 
this mouth have just said wasn't the
best<00:04:22.690> quality<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.229> really<00:04:23.620> didn't<00:04:23.889> like<00:04:24.039> it<00:04:24.340> but

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
best quality I really didn't like it but

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.900 
best quality I really didn't like it but
still<00:04:24.940> it's<00:04:25.690> not<00:04:25.870> like<00:04:26.139> a<00:04:26.380> massive<00:04:26.950> expensive

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
still it's not like a massive expensive

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.460 
still it's not like a massive expensive
mouse<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:28.330> there's<00:04:28.479> only<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.750> small<00:04:28.900> thing<00:04:29.349> I

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
mouse so there's only a small thing I

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.100 
mouse so there's only a small thing I
would<00:04:29.680> say<00:04:29.710> as<00:04:30.190> other<00:04:30.849> buttons<00:04:31.270> are<00:04:31.539> fine<00:04:31.840> in

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
would say as other buttons are fine in

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.930 
would say as other buttons are fine in
my<00:04:32.289> opinion<00:04:32.590> so<00:04:33.490> as<00:04:33.820> I<00:04:34.030> said<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.539> Mac<00:04:34.780> GPI<00:04:35.349> is

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
my opinion so as I said the Mac GPI is

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.990 
my opinion so as I said the Mac GPI is
5000<00:04:36.940> which<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.870> personally<00:04:38.410> never<00:04:39.400> put<00:04:39.729> it<00:04:39.820> up

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
5000 which I personally never put it up

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.959 
5000 which I personally never put it up
to<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.330> but<00:04:40.599> some<00:04:40.810> people<00:04:41.200> do<00:04:41.380> like<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.550> DPI

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 
to that but some people do like the DPI

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:44.390 
to that but some people do like the DPI
that's<00:04:43.240> high

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
that's high

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.270 
that's high
it's<00:04:44.759> easily<00:04:45.120> controllable<00:04:45.690> by<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.350> button<00:04:47.040> in

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
it's easily controllable by a button in

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.570 
it's easily controllable by a button in
the<00:04:47.430> center<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.910> mouse<00:04:48.240> underneath<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
the center of the mouse underneath the

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.050 
the center of the mouse underneath the
scroll<00:04:51.060> wheel<00:04:51.199> so<00:04:52.199> easy<00:04:53.009> we<00:04:53.250> can<00:04:53.400> just<00:04:53.580> press

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
scroll wheel so easy we can just press

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.860 
scroll wheel so easy we can just press
it<00:04:54.120> forward<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:55.009> put<00:04:56.009> it<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.220> max<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.820> also<00:04:57.720> to

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
it forward and put it to max and also to

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.170 
it forward and put it to max and also to
spit<00:04:58.080> at<00:04:58.199> them<00:04:58.229> so<00:04:59.100> that's<00:04:59.340> pretty<00:04:59.610> really

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
spit at them so that's pretty really

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.650 
spit at them so that's pretty really
good<00:05:00.570> ease<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.410> access<00:05:01.820> no<00:05:02.820> problems<00:05:03.300> of<00:05:03.419> that

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
good ease of access no problems of that

this anyway as as i said you're my hand
is<00:06:12.539> going<00:06:12.659> to<00:06:12.720> be<00:06:12.810> covering<00:06:13.199> it<00:06:13.380> anyway<00:06:13.770> so

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
is going to be covering it anyway so

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.430 
is going to be covering it anyway so
what's<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.220> point<00:06:14.810> also<00:06:15.810> you<00:06:15.870> can<00:06:15.930> adjust<00:06:16.080> a

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
what's the point also you can adjust a

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.159 
what's the point also you can adjust a
light<00:06:16.710> effect<00:06:17.159> but<00:06:17.520> yet<00:06:18.090> not<00:06:18.330> really<00:06:18.840> a<00:06:18.870> point

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
light effect but yet not really a point

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.830 
light effect but yet not really a point
here<00:06:19.320> in<00:06:19.590> my<00:06:19.740> opinion<00:06:20.360> also<00:06:21.360> you<00:06:21.419> can<00:06:21.570> have

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
here in my opinion also you can have

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.939 
here in my opinion also you can have
gaming<00:06:22.409> profiles<00:06:23.159> so<00:06:23.789> let's<00:06:24.360> say<00:06:24.599> you<00:06:25.470> have<00:06:25.740> a
