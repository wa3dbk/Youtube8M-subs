00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.380 
little loop put that through and put
this<00:01:33.990> through<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.229> other<00:01:34.380> loop<00:01:35.270> pulling<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
this through the other loop pulling that

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.539 
this through the other loop pulling that
down<00:01:36.659> now<00:01:37.409> reveals<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.040> obviously<00:01:38.369> what

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
down now reveals that obviously what

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.249 
down now reveals that obviously what
that's<00:01:38.729> done<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.150> removed<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.689> shelf<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that's done is is removed the shelf and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.960 
that's done is is removed the shelf and
you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.560> fit<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.189> whole<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> main

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you can fit the whole of the main

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.249 
you can fit the whole of the main
compartment<00:01:42.210> down<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> bottom<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
compartment down to the bottom of the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.510 
compartment down to the bottom of the
bag<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:43.979> great<00:01:44.100> feature<00:01:44.340> to
