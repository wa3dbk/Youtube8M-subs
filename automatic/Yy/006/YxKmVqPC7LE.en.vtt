00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
so first of all I'm going to show you

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.330 
so first of all I'm going to show you
how<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.540> put<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.929> paper<00:00:10.139> tray<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
how to put the paper tray and the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.160 
how to put the paper tray and the
printer<00:00:11.700> together<00:00:12.030> pretty<00:00:12.509> easy<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.049> but

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
printer together pretty easy to do but

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.900 
printer together pretty easy to do but
you<00:00:13.290> will<00:00:13.469> need<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:13.920> quite<00:00:14.130> strong<00:00:14.549> because

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
you will need to be quite strong because

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.040 
you will need to be quite strong because
this<00:00:15.030> machine<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.960> quite<00:00:16.289> heavy<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.900> lift<00:00:18.900> it

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
this machine is quite heavy so lift it

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.640 
this machine is quite heavy so lift it
up<00:00:19.230> align<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:21.510> simply<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:21.900> clips<00:00:22.380> in

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
up align it and it simply just clips in

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.460 
up align it and it simply just clips in
and<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.430> train<00:00:23.760> has<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.539> special<00:00:25.109> locking

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and this train has a special locking

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.230 
and this train has a special locking
mechanism<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> undo<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> tray<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.029> have

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
mechanism so to undo the tray you have

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.089 
mechanism so to undo the tray you have
to<00:00:27.359> push<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.750> one<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.769> other<00:00:28.859> one

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to push this one and the other one

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009 
to push this one and the other one
before<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.849> lift<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.150> off<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.599> it's

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
before you can lift it off so it's

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
before you can lift it off so it's
actually<00:00:31.230> now<00:00:31.710> walk<00:00:32.009> together<00:00:32.460> which<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
actually now walk together which is

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.380 
actually now walk together which is
quite<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> nice<00:00:33.270> feature<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.460> then<00:00:35.460> simply<00:00:36.180> put

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
quite a nice feature and then simply put

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.970 
quite a nice feature and then simply put
the<00:00:36.420> power<00:00:36.660> cable<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.230> which<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> at<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> back

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the power cable in which is at the back

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
the power cable in which is at the back
and<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.790> USB<00:00:39.180> cable<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.690> I'm<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> do

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
and the USB cable so I'm going to do

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200 
and the USB cable so I'm going to do
that<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.489> talk<00:00:41.700> about<00:00:41.760> some

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that now and then we can talk about some

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.869 
that now and then we can talk about some
of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> specs<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> machine

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
of the specs on the machine

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.670 
of the specs on the machine
now<00:00:44.879> I've<00:00:45.210> plugged<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.960> installed<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
now I've plugged in and installed the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
now I've plugged in and installed the
machine<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.340> demo<00:00:47.760> I'm<00:00:47.969> using<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
machine for this demo I'm using the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.250 
machine for this demo I'm using the
Lexmark<00:00:48.870> t6<00:00:49.710> 54<00:00:50.340> DTM<00:00:51.000> however<00:00:51.719> Lexmark<00:00:52.110> do

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
Lexmark t6 54 DTM however Lexmark do

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.290 
Lexmark t6 54 DTM however Lexmark do
have<00:00:52.410> four<00:00:52.680> variations<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.670> toads<00:00:53.969> which<00:00:54.210> you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
have four variations in toads which you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.160 
have four variations in toads which you
may<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> website<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.890> t6<00:00:56.489> 50<00:00:56.940> t<00:00:57.239> 652

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
may see on the website the t6 50 t 652

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
may see on the website the t6 50 t 652
t6<00:00:59.100> 54<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.989> t6<00:01:00.989> 56<00:01:01.829> now<00:01:02.550> there's<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.850> load

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
t6 54 and the t6 56 now there's a load

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.729 
t6 54 and the t6 56 now there's a load
of<00:01:03.090> differences<00:01:03.870> between<00:01:04.019> these<00:01:04.379> models

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
of differences between these models

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
of differences between these models
which<00:01:05.100> will<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.339> hard<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.820> over<00:01:05.880> verbally

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
which will be hard to get over verbally

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
which will be hard to get over verbally
and<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.439> end<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> video<00:01:08.159> we're

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and so at the end of the video we're

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
and so at the end of the video we're
going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.880> display<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.540> differences<00:01:10.200> using

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
going to display the differences using

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.859 
going to display the differences using
an<00:01:10.920> easy-to-read<00:01:11.610> chart<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.750> go

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
an easy-to-read chart which you can go

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.109 
an easy-to-read chart which you can go
over<00:01:13.020> your<00:01:13.200> leisure<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.520> want<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> go

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
over your leisure now I just want to go

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.330 
over your leisure now I just want to go
through<00:01:15.420> some<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> overall<00:01:16.590> specs<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
through some of the overall specs of the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.450 
through some of the overall specs of the
t6<00:01:17.850> 54<00:01:18.600> DTM<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.280> there's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
there's a hundred sheep multi-purpose

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.469 
there's a hundred sheep multi-purpose
feeder<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.220> which<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.270> by

pressing the button and pulling down the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.300 
pressing the button and pulling down the
front<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> big<00:01:31.040> advantages<00:01:32.040> which

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
front one of the big advantages which

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.609 
front one of the big advantages which
you<00:01:32.729> may<00:01:32.909> overlook<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.170> fact<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you may overlook is the fact that the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.620 
you may overlook is the fact that the
output<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> top<00:01:35.939> could<00:01:36.390> hold

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
output right here on the top could hold

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.440 
output right here on the top could hold
a<00:01:36.750> full<00:01:37.020> ream<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.740> paper<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.430> 500<00:01:39.180> sheets

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
a full ream of paper that's 500 sheets

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.660 
a full ream of paper that's 500 sheets
of<00:01:39.750> paper<00:01:40.350> there<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> roll<00:01:41.549> them

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
of paper there and it can roll them

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.420 
of paper there and it can roll them
quite<00:01:41.939> easily<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.680> job<00:01:43.950> isn't<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
quite easily so the job isn't going to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.340 
quite easily so the job isn't going to
stop<00:01:44.670> printing<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.689> output<00:01:46.079> tray

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
stop printing because your output tray

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.319 
stop printing because your output tray
is<00:01:46.409> full

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
is full

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.910
