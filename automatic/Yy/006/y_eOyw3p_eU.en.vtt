00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
beef that's just how that's how it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.860 
beef that's just how that's how it
tastes<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.070> be<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.239> course<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.570> chicken

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
tastes to be and of course the chicken

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.390 
tastes to be and of course the chicken
is<00:02:30.019> right<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.410> middle<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:30.860> it's<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
is right in the middle so it's like the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.820 
is right in the middle so it's like the
center<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.760> attention<00:02:31.910> no<00:02:32.450> pun<00:02:32.630> intended

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
center of attention no pun intended

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.360 
center of attention no pun intended
that's<00:02:33.830> pretty<00:02:34.160> good<00:02:34.340> even<00:02:34.910> since<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
that's pretty good even since the the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.039 
that's pretty good even since the the
cheese<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.820> melting<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.420> chicken<00:02:38.780> patty

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
cheese is melting to the chicken patty

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.090 
cheese is melting to the chicken patty
now<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.470> that's<00:02:39.650> good<00:02:41.709> because<00:02:42.709> they're<00:02:42.950> both

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
now so that's good because they're both

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.720 
now so that's good because they're both
fresh<00:02:43.430> they're<00:02:43.700> both<00:02:43.820> hot

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.270 

and<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.790> think<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.060> made<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.240> great<00:02:50.300> choice<00:02:51.280> final

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
and I think I made a great choice final

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:04.990 
and I think I made a great choice final
countdown<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.930> only<00:03:03.200> gripe<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.100> i<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.700> is

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
countdown the only gripe that i have is

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.870

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
yes the chicken does overpower the beef

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.070 
yes the chicken does overpower the beef
I<00:03:08.320> barely<00:03:09.320> tasted<00:03:09.800> any<00:03:10.070> burger<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.870> was

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
I barely tasted any burger it was

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.650 
I barely tasted any burger it was

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.720 
basically just a mcchicken with cheese
and<00:03:14.690> ketchup<00:03:16.330> pickles<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.750> onions<00:03:18.520> so<00:03:19.520> I<00:03:19.550> mean

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
and ketchup pickles and onions so I mean

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.220 
and ketchup pickles and onions so I mean

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
like it was it's pretty good it's really

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.230

good<00:03:21.440> there's<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.490> little<00:03:22.820> hint<00:03:23.240> of<00:03:23.450> a

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
good there's a little hint of a

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.220 
good there's a little hint of a
cheeseburger<00:03:26.240> but<00:03:26.390> not<00:03:26.600> very<00:03:26.960> much<00:03:27.320> so<00:03:27.710> of<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
cheeseburger but not very much so of the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.190 
cheeseburger but not very much so of the
whole<00:03:30.410> entirety<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.430> cheeseburger<00:03:32.200> but

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
whole entirety of the cheeseburger but

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.020 
whole entirety of the cheeseburger but
the<00:03:33.350> chicken<00:03:33.590> does<00:03:34.010> overpower<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.550> but<00:03:34.940> the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
the chicken does overpower it but the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.590 
the chicken does overpower it but the
chicken<00:03:35.270> was<00:03:35.570> good<00:03:35.600> fresh<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:38.300> course
