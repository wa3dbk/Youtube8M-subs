wheat images for DLC three supremacy map
pack<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.539> we're<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.289> go<00:00:19.350> right<00:00:19.590> into

this<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> first<00:00:20.580> image<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.890> basically<00:00:22.890> I

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
this so the first image is basically I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.120 
this so the first image is basically I
guess<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.269> looks<00:00:24.300> like<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.439> zombie

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
guess it looks like one of like a zombie

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.339 
guess it looks like one of like a zombie
window<00:00:26.460> i<00:00:26.490> guess<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> back<00:00:27.150> one<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.660> then<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
window i guess the back one and then the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
window i guess the back one and then the
left<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.890> sort<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> circular

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
left one is sort of like the circular

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.930 
left one is sort of like the circular
structure<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.560> has<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> spiral<00:00:32.489> thing

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
structure and it has like a spiral thing

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.270 
structure and it has like a spiral thing
to<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.420> i<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.989> some<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.350> sort<00:00:35.190> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
to it and i think it's some like sort of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.110 
to it and i think it's some like sort of
huge<00:00:35.640> machine<00:00:36.239> tool<00:00:37.070> I'm<00:00:38.070> gonna<00:00:38.280> go<00:00:38.520> over<00:00:38.640> I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
huge machine tool I'm gonna go over I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.750 
huge machine tool I'm gonna go over I
guess<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> main<00:00:39.719> emphasis<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.530> factory<00:00:41.430> but

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
guess the main emphasis of factory but

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.459 
guess the main emphasis of factory but
then<00:00:41.879> I'm<00:00:42.120> gonna<00:00:42.270> tell<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.780> guys<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
then I'm gonna tell you guys what I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.100 
then I'm gonna tell you guys what I
really<00:00:43.860> think<00:00:43.890> about<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.750> you

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
really think about this because if you

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.479 
really think about this because if you
look<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.469> later<00:00:46.710> images<00:00:47.129> you're<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
look at the later images you're going to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
look at the later images you're going to
see<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.910> we're<00:00:48.059> actually<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.539> space<00:00:48.750> in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
see that we're actually in space in

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.790 
see that we're actually in space in
these<00:00:49.680> images<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.460> what's<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.320> exactly

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
these images so what's I'm not exactly

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.130 
these images so what's I'm not exactly
sure<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.309> true<00:00:53.699> or<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.480> know<00:00:54.690> real<00:00:54.930> or

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
sure if this is true or you know real or

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319 
sure if this is true or you know real or
fake<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> mean<00:00:56.129> again<00:00:56.670> these<00:00:56.850> images<00:00:57.210> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
fake but I mean again these images is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.080 
fake but I mean again these images is
super<00:00:57.809> high<00:00:57.930> quality<00:00:57.960> super<00:00:58.710> crazy<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.280> they

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
super high quality super crazy and they

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
super high quality super crazy and they
can<00:01:00.239> definitely<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.690> real<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.260> here's<00:01:01.649> just

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
can definitely be real and here's just

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
can definitely be real and here's just
another<00:01:01.920> image<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.820> them<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.329> guess<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
another image of them I guess like a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
another image of them I guess like a
little<00:01:04.199> radio<00:01:04.559> station<00:01:05.159> type<00:01:05.369> thing<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.850> little

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
little radio station type thing a little

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.050 
little radio station type thing a little
um<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.689> guess<00:01:07.340> what<00:01:08.340> would<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.729> space

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
um I guess what would they have in space

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.399 
um I guess what would they have in space
stations<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.080> done<00:01:10.229> though

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
stations they have I get done though

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.000 
stations they have I get done though
controlling<00:01:11.130> everything<00:01:11.720> making<00:01:12.720> sure

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
controlling everything making sure

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.320 
controlling everything making sure
everything's<00:01:14.010> running<00:01:14.250> properly<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
everything's running properly all the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
everything's running properly all the
mechanics<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> buttons<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.830> make<00:01:16.920> sure

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
mechanics the buttons to make sure

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.090 
mechanics the buttons to make sure
everything<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.670> know<00:01:17.729> add<00:01:18.890> stable<00:01:19.890> point

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
everything is you know add stable point

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
everything is you know add stable point
because<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> space<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
because you are in space and you have to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600 
because you are in space and you have to
have<00:01:22.170> everything<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> good<00:01:22.979> point<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
have everything at a good point so you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.940 
have everything at a good point so you
don't<00:01:23.759> die<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> mean<00:01:24.900> maybe<00:01:25.080> that's<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
don't die so I mean maybe that's the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.370 
don't die so I mean maybe that's the
premise<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.580> EXO<00:01:27.000> zombies<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.780> DLC<00:01:28.200> three

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
premise of EXO zombies for DLC three

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
premise of EXO zombies for DLC three
supremacy<00:01:28.950> you're<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.850> space<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.299> have

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
supremacy you're in space and you have

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
supremacy you're in space and you have
to<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:31.140> only<00:01:31.320> fight<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> zombies<00:01:32.009> but

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to like not only fight the zombies but

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
to like not only fight the zombies but
maybe<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.450> space<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:34.079> space<00:01:34.470> stations

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
maybe your space your space stations

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.039 
maybe your space your space stations
like<00:01:35.130> being<00:01:35.430> run<00:01:35.610> down<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.210> I'm<00:01:36.810> stuffs

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
like being run down and I'm stuffs

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.749 
like being run down and I'm stuffs
happening<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.650> getting<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.130> crazy<00:01:38.400> now

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
happening it's getting really crazy now

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.179 
happening it's getting really crazy now
here's<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> little<00:01:39.860> bedroom<00:01:40.860> type

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
here's just like a little bedroom type

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.139 
here's just like a little bedroom type
area<00:01:41.430> um<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> space<00:01:44.520> station<00:01:44.790> so

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
area um this is a space station so

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.730 
area um this is a space station so
obviously<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.200> something<00:01:46.560> like

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
obviously it would have something like

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.710 
obviously it would have something like
that<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.220> definitely<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:48.180> advanced

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that that's definitely really advanced

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.780 
that that's definitely really advanced
because<00:01:48.840> usually<00:01:49.049> um<00:01:49.470> they<00:01:50.340> don't<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.640> that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
because usually um they don't have that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.280 
because usually um they don't have that
in<00:01:50.880> real<00:01:51.000> life<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.420> obviously<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
in real life but obviously this is

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.469 
in real life but obviously this is
advanced<00:01:52.500> warfare<00:01:52.890> EXO<00:01:53.549> zombies<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.299> have

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
advanced warfare EXO zombies and we have

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
think this is fake or not i think it is

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.659 
think this is fake or not i think it is
obviously<00:02:59.959> it<00:03:00.349> just<00:03:00.980> doesn't<00:03:01.250> seem<00:03:01.519> right

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
obviously it just doesn't seem right

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.009 
obviously it just doesn't seem right
that<00:03:01.730> they<00:03:01.969> would<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.599> image<00:03:02.930> i

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
that they would do that the image i

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.330 
that they would do that the image i
don't<00:03:03.379> think<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:03.590> fake<00:03:03.799> because<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.219> the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
don't think it's fake because of the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.399 
don't think it's fake because of the
images<00:03:04.700> okay<00:03:05.090> i<00:03:05.269> think<00:03:05.540> it's<00:03:05.719> fake<00:03:05.930> because<00:03:06.139> of

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
images okay i think it's fake because of

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.550 
images okay i think it's fake because of
the<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:07.069> guess<00:03:07.400> idea<00:03:07.879> behind<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.719> what<00:03:09.139> it's

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
the I guess idea behind it and what it's

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.259 
the I guess idea behind it and what it's
basically<00:03:09.889> showing<00:03:10.189> us<00:03:10.400> like<00:03:10.549> these<00:03:11.150> were

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
basically showing us like these were

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.119 
basically showing us like these were
images<00:03:11.629> of<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.900> different<00:03:12.260> area<00:03:12.500> maybe<00:03:12.680> like<00:03:12.919> a

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
images of a different area maybe like a

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.940 
images of a different area maybe like a
mountain<00:03:13.879> or<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.569> snowy<00:03:14.959> village<00:03:15.439> or<00:03:15.590> something

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
mountain or a snowy village or something

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.409 
mountain or a snowy village or something
then<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.310> can<00:03:16.519> believe<00:03:16.639> it<00:03:16.909> more<00:03:17.090> because<00:03:17.180> it's

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
then I can believe it more because it's

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.539 
then I can believe it more because it's
just<00:03:17.479> believable<00:03:18.049> you<00:03:18.229> know<00:03:18.319> you<00:03:18.409> just<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:19.340> go

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
just believable you know you just you go

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.449 
just believable you know you just you go

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
with what was from before and nothing

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.569

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
somewhere they actually got them from a

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.339 
somewhere they actually got them from a
leaked<00:03:42.709> website<00:03:43.189> or<00:03:43.489> from<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.329> coding<00:03:45.019> or

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
leaked website or from the coding or

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.170 
leaked website or from the coding or
maybe<00:03:45.919> this<00:03:46.069> is<00:03:46.220> actually<00:03:46.699> what<00:03:46.879> it's<00:03:47.000> going

maybe this is actually what it's going

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.839 
maybe this is actually what it's going
to<00:03:47.269> be<00:03:47.359> or<00:03:47.720> like<00:03:48.439> I<00:03:48.530> usually<00:03:48.680> say<00:03:49.099> maybe<00:03:49.400> it'll

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
to be or like I usually say maybe it'll

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.939
