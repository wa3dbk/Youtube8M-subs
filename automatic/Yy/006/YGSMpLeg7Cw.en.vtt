00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.059
 batman arkham night is running in the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.219
 pc-version still not round 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.380
 we took the spectacular false start 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.450
 the superhero already on occasion 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.310
 some thoroughly case kokste pc 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.900
 Looking back at the transposition of games 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.900
 and while the developers are at 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
 rocksteady and a galaxy continue to envy 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.920
 we deliver another file 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:37.739
 momentum on examples of disappointing 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:39.989
 portals in the fourth part of gta 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.360
 comes nico full of hopes 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.340
 But then Liberty City will be turned off 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.440
 a mess in the next 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.329
 it was terrifyingly similar to players 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 just under seven months after the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.640
 Consoles release the pc version 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.350
 gta 4 the lot bought for example 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.480
 in that they have several 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.550
 copy protection and mechanisms 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.440
 used without a membership in the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.329
 rockstar social club gets nicos 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.519
 namely adventure in the full extent 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.890
 play and also an account at games 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.840
 for windows live is required where 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 strictly speaking, games for windows 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.030
 gta 4 can be played live as an optional extra 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.080
 namely without if you save on 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.270
 can do without 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.189
 and as if that were not absurd 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.950
 enough, even the secur will come around 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.420
 Copy protection for use 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.700
 who the hurdles in the installation and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.590
 had taken the start was directly to 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.750
 but then probably did not let in 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.590
 liberty city on the way but in 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.130
 internet forums of trouble over wall 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.650
 Settings options diverse 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.810
 Crash problems tormenting loading times and 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.909
 one on many systems modest 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.549
 performance made the just mentioned 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.470
 drm gÃ¤ngelei almost forgotten again 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 the gross technical problems were 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.310
 fixed by patches and the modding 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.920
 The scene was foreseeable 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 with some annoyances stay though and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.219
 on many a system it is supposed to be today 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.369
 not run properly 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.229
 Overall, gta 4 is synonymous without mods on 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.630
 but the pc has long been in a clear 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.119
 better condition you will forget the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.119
 botched start but either way wollny 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.340
 if you think of borderlands, you think 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.930
 primarily presumably a fun one 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.030
 crazy action roleplaying 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.489
 but many probably remember too 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.530
 the pc version of 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.450
 borderlands did not throw the players 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.030
 technical stumbling blocks in the way 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.200
 But the menu without controller was quasi 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.120
 not to use 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.800
 Borderlands was so up 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.480
 console control designed that 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.730
 do not even click menu entries 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.580
 who left a classic pc control 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.220
 was used to cursing examples of 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.170
 similar still relatively harmless 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.150
 sloppy pc porting exists 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.850
 By the way, various even the otherwise 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.860
 often praised skyrim was regularly used for 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.959
 his standard interface scolded that 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.630
 obviously primary for controllers 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.700
 was developed 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.680
 6.9 felt like a lot of pc players too 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.360
 Of course, console can not do that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.940
 meant that it was a bad overall 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.459
 game would have been and the pc version 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.709
 from final fantasy 13 allowed a long time 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.590
 not the free choice of resolution 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.720
 was namely at 720p firmly wins 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.480
 On top of that, there were also graphics options 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.820
 none like the examples just mentioned 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.739
 is final fantasy 13 on the pc with it 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.780
 still got away much better 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.510
 as many others play in this special 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.260
 but good pc portals see clearly 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.260
 different 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.190
 For example, it was more drastic 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.200
 at saints row 2 to whose pc 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.850
 did not want to play the release version 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.040
 to start fighting with another gang 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.870
 but rather with the developers 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.030
 Game was by no means a graphic miracle 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.010
 However, ate up hardware as if it were the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.250
 next polygon reference from epic games 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.240
 or software rather useful 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.550
 image repetition needed needed one 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.290
 really strong computer and then heard the 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.740
 not even with performance problems 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.810
 the framerate on input was down and 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.490
 an error due to the gameplay 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.710
 permanently or occasionally much too 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.720
 the PC version is greatly accelerated 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.670
 from saints row 2 has so many 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.680
 problems that you without specific mods 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.810
 and mostly from the community 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.390
 developed fixed and help contributions 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.390
 still considered almost unplayable 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.500
 a similar fate meets devil may 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.590
 cry 3 that in the so-called special 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.560
 edition came to the pc and jawoll ti is 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.820
 specifically missing setting options 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.710
 wobbly controller support and 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.020
 occasional speed breaks 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.180
 which, after all, at least remedy 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.850
 should let by the music to 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.860
 boss fight deletes not treasure the 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.930
 devil may release cry 3 special edition 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.330
 after extensive study of 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.070
 community tutorials and after the 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.570
 installation of mods whose 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.460
 Descriptions partly like 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.470
 official patchnotes read right 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.540
 decent play these steps 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.320
 are necessary at all but says 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.320
 already everything 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.169
 I did not always support 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.330
 we want to turn the second part of the 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.270
 specials about failed pc porting 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.099
 with batman warner bros in general 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.199
 and the arkham series in particular 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.300
 unfortunately no unknown what 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.610
 problematic publications 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.589
 cam origins this is about 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.330
 Of course, by no means reached the 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.520
 catastrophes degree of aken night 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.979
 nevertheless there were numerous mistakes of 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.389
 which many should fairly mention 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.279
 However, in the 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.589
 console versions were found 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.240
 especially bad are mistakes the complete one 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:42.719
 make storage stands unusable 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.909
 could 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:47.639
 because batman was no longer controllable 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.860
 here too, as usual, the 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.289
 Players themselves manage solutions 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.539
 work out and, for example, savegame 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.699
 make files ready to play again like 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.379
 a bad joke worked accordingly 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.629
 also an official statement 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.669
 therefore bug fixes in the 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.069
 slide down the list of priorities 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:09.749
 the developers should be with namely 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:11.459
 dlc content was busy and so 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:13.740
 we finish the second part of our 

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:16.050
 overviews specials sometimes more and more 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.620
 less bad pc versions of 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.779
 play 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.490
 let us know which pc ports 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.490
 have brought you to despair
