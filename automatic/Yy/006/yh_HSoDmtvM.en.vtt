00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.270 
skull so that we're basically going to
record<00:01:53.740> everything<00:01:54.740> while<00:01:55.130> we<00:01:55.160> were

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
record everything while we were

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.760 
record everything while we were
developing<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.330> game<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.810> then<00:01:56.900> have<00:01:57.470> Jim

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
developing the game and then have Jim

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.230 
developing the game and then have Jim
cut<00:01:58.040> up<00:01:58.160> like<00:01:58.190> hundreds<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:58.850> hundreds<00:01:59.150> and

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240

cut up like hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.600> hours<00:01:59.750> of<00:02:00.070> audio<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.700> would<00:02:01.790> have

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
hundreds of hours of audio it would have

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.730 
hundreds of hours of audio it would have
been<00:02:01.940> no<00:02:02.210> work<00:02:02.509> for<00:02:02.540> Marty<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.200> his<00:02:03.259> team<00:02:03.500> so

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
why we had to cut some of those spaces

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.610

out<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.270> ODST<00:03:52.600> because<00:03:53.020> it<00:03:53.080> was<00:03:53.170> never

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
out of ODST because it was never

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.590 
out of ODST because it was never
actually<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:53.980> game<00:03:54.270> it's<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.330> official

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
actually in the game it's the official

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.420 
actually in the game it's the official
party<00:03:55.930> line<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:57.040> we<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.570> very<00:03:58.810> limited

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
party line so we have a very limited

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.699 
party line so we have a very limited
resource<00:04:00.430> pool<00:04:00.670> with<00:04:01.420> memory<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.200> everything

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
resource pool with memory and everything

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.340 
resource pool with memory and everything
that<00:04:02.800> we<00:04:02.920> tried<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.250> jam<00:04:03.490> into<00:04:03.640> this<00:04:03.850> game<00:04:04.090> and

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
that we tried to jam into this game and

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.720 
that we tried to jam into this game and
when<00:04:05.350> we<00:04:05.470> looked<00:04:05.650> at<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.830> weapons<00:04:06.190> we<00:04:06.370> created

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
when we looked at the weapons we created

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.480 
when we looked at the weapons we created
the<00:04:06.850> two<00:04:07.240> new<00:04:07.480> weapons<00:04:07.980> they<00:04:08.980> actually<00:04:09.160> sort

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
the two new weapons they actually sort

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.979 
the two new weapons they actually sort
of<00:04:09.550> split<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:09.970> functionality<00:04:10.570> of<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.750> battle

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
of split the functionality of the battle

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.460 
of split the functionality of the battle
rifle<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:12.400> as<00:04:13.060> we<00:04:13.570> started<00:04:14.020> adding<00:04:14.290> all<00:04:14.380> the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
rifle and as we started adding all the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.409 
rifle and as we started adding all the
art<00:04:14.650> like<00:04:14.830> you've<00:04:15.280> seen<00:04:15.489> sort<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:15.820> all<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.150> all

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
art like you've seen sort of all the all

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.979 
art like you've seen sort of all the all
the<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.829> signage<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.669> just<00:04:19.329> sort<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:19.720> all<00:04:19.870> the

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
the the signage and just sort of all the

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.509 
the the signage and just sort of all the
texture<00:04:20.320> memory<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:20.739> we<00:04:20.829> always<00:04:21.190> struggle

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
texture memory that we always struggle

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.740 
texture memory that we always struggle
at<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.760> end<00:04:21.910> of<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.060> project<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.570> get

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
at the end of a project to get

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.870 
at the end of a project to get
everything<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.350> fit<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.430> get<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.669> game<00:04:24.850> to

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
everything to fit and to get the game to

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.730 
everything to fit and to get the game to
work<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.540> a<00:04:25.990> weapon<00:04:26.290> it's<00:04:26.410> actually<00:04:26.710> very

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
work and a weapon it's actually very

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.580 
work and a weapon it's actually very
expensive<00:04:27.400> resource<00:04:27.760> for<00:04:28.270> us<00:04:28.360> so<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:29.020> was<00:04:29.080> it

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
expensive resource for us so it was it

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.350 
expensive resource for us so it was it
was<00:04:29.710> sort<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:29.919> this<00:04:30.070> natural<00:04:30.310> calling<00:04:31.120> process

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
was sort of this natural calling process

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.810 
was sort of this natural calling process
where<00:04:31.750> we<00:04:31.780> we<00:04:32.380> really<00:04:32.650> had<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.800> really<00:04:33.550> wanted

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
where we we really had to really wanted

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.940 
where we we really had to really wanted
to<00:04:33.880> add<00:04:34.000> more<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.810> environment<00:04:35.200> side<00:04:35.590> to

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
to add more to the environment side to

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.560 
to add more to the environment side to
bring<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.460> city<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.820> life<00:04:37.000> which<00:04:37.240> meant<00:04:37.479> that

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
bring the city to life which meant that

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.900 
bring the city to life which meant that
on<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.290> gameplay<00:04:38.650> asset<00:04:39.010> side<00:04:39.190> we<00:04:39.400> we<00:04:39.669> sort<00:04:39.880> of

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
on the gameplay asset side we we sort of

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.030 
on the gameplay asset side we we sort of
took<00:04:40.030> some<00:04:40.210> stuff<00:04:40.390> out<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:41.620> didn't<00:04:41.800> like<00:04:41.890> it

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
took some stuff out and I didn't like it
