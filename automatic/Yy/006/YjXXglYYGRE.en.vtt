00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:18.300
 with dear friends with you i'm blue 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.910
 today a small cupcake 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.200
 dedicated to how to tie your twitch 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.030
 steam profile and everything is very simple 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.789
 why is it necessary then that you had 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.550
 little chance to get a nice present 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.400
 when watching the coolest matches 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.489
 World Cup e syl katowice with 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.890
 the prize fund here is 50 thousand dollars 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.980
 well and accordingly log in in twitch 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.210
 before you pass the registration stage 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.739
 let's start from scratch thousands of this i'm here 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.850
 you have no login yet, respectively 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.660
 press registration or some 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.630
 there is a register in English if you have 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.850
 again the site in English will be 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.119
 I, for example, have already registered that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.619
 studiocs with a guru but this is again steam 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.330
 more precisely from the HIV profile from which 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.780
 the broadcast will not be on this 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.450
 no matter this guide will not interfere go to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.070
 settings either chosen there or here 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:24.330
 clicked on this one 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:29.000
 go in connection and then but here 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:33.439
 choose steam profile 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.220
 connect further pops up a window 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:41.759
 which you write your steam name password 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.790
 Sides all a bunch of passed and you have here 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.170
 will be the same tick as mine 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.869
 a link with YouTube 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.270
 I hope everyone just understand them well, 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.180
 I apologize for the small noises on 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.240
 background matter is that so far 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.930
 I do not have a good headset in Kiev 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.939
 so there are some nuances let's say 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.710
 imposes it was necessary to write already hope 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.310
 you liked it, put your fingers 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.110
 up but if you have any questions write by the way 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.970
 it seems you can look like on mobile 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.730
 devices and so far but the main thing to be 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.010
 hall guide and accordingly associate your 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.660
 twitch with stim that's all 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.660
 just bye bye
