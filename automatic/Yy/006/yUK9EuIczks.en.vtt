00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.730
 hello that such good weather good that's the 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.139
 first video of this channel a channel that 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.510
 it's going to be for those people who 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.360
 want to learn to play keyboard to 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.219
 those people who have never touched 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.970
 keyboard on this channel are going to be able 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.400
 learn my name is and place you amezcua 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.650
 proposed the Christian religion indeed 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.380
 for that I started playing the keyboard to 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.300
 give honor and glory to God but 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.039
 regardless of the religion that you 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 professed in this channel you will be able to 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.630
 Learn to play the keyboard 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.300
 and well we went to the following 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.260
 good natural notes on the keyboard 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.000
 you have white keys and black keys 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.770
 overcome that the key is divided 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.770
 infection keys you have 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.170
 place yourself on the two black keys on the 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.350
 left part the white key the one of the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.940
 down 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.800
 this is the first natural tone and the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.310
 next is 9 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.310
 i 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.390
 ah 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 this field 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.150
 again 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
 down 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.960
 those are the seven natural stable 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.840
 well now how much have you never touched the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.280
 keyboard normally people 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.740
 we occupy our hands and fingers almost not 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.530
 we occupy them by the same the fingers the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.390
 we have very awkward to say the least 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.490
 way to say it in a way not 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.180
 you can move your fingers to your freedom 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.100
 then let's see in this class something 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.580
 that will help us improve that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.680
 movement of the fingers which is what 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.230
 following 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.929
 well let's see two exercises 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.530
 fingering this is the first one you're going to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.530
 place going 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.780
 and you're going to do this is going to get your five 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.300
 fingers 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.800
 then it's going to jump your fingers without you 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.930
 touch 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.370
 that are touching the keys and you're going to 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.370
 put your first 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.760
 then you are going to put your second finger but 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.760
 will jump your first finger 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.230
 then you will use the third finger but 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.409
 you are going to use your second finger 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.000
 after the fourth and being third 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:47.690
 after the fifth and rises of the chorus and 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.790
 after return 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.690
 i 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.060
 is 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.930
 so you're going to do the first 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.930
 you have to take out 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.120
 until second 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.170
 this is the second exercise of 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.209
 fingering this exercise is going to serve you 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.209
 a lot for later classes 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.570
 equally not but now your first finger 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.350
 is going to play with his second one is going to 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.350
 touch my 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.690
 and then we are going to play 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.910
 two 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.510
 do not 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.930
 and the movement that you have to do is 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.930
 this 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.580
 in that movement that you have to do 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.020
 now you wonder why he does not touch the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.200
 king because your hand 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.819
 from the first finger you have a space this 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.289
 space 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.709
 because at the order that you come back from 12 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.709
 are you going to do this 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.290
 and you jump 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.290
 a key 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.520
 to me 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.789
 they have to leave after the same advances 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.639
 with the left hand 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.639
 colom gas the five fingers with two 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.250
 well what we just saw the notes 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.260
 natural and fingering exercises 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.550
 they are the first thing you have to do 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.440
 so you can learn to play maybe 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.790
 it's going to seem boring but it's what 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.710
 first thing you have to do is what 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.930
 first that I did when I started 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.960
 touch 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.860
 I really recommend that you do this 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:32.520
 do it one hour a day that you dedicate 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.500
 20 minutes to the notes and 40 minutes to 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.610
 the clever fingering exercises that you 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.620
 devote more time to definitions 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.759
 fingering because I need your fingers 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.320
 begin to get agile to play the 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.289
 keyboard 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.850
 then the notes is important that you 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.280
 you learn them the seven notes 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.070
 natural that we saw so that you can 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.680
 move to the next video you have to 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.040
 learn the notes that when I played 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.320
 a note 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.230
 you know what is how much any 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.420
 note you know what is 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.490
 and the fingering exercises are so that 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.210
 they can facilitate what is going to come 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.940
 later on good this has been all for 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.540
 today and I hope to see you soon and good 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.540
 single
