still haven't done enough reviews for an

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.049 
still haven't done enough reviews for an
intro<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:08.970> here<00:00:09.269> it<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.840> now<00:00:10.969> for<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.570 
intro so here it is and now for the
review<00:00:14.660> after<00:00:15.660> ordering<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.400> chicken<00:00:17.400> I

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
review after ordering my chicken I

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.090 
review after ordering my chicken I
noticed<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.359> came<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.930> really<00:00:19.410> huge<00:00:19.650> box

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
noticed it came in this really huge box

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.400 
noticed it came in this really huge box
so<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.520> thought<00:00:20.820> these<00:00:21.330> chicken<00:00:21.869> strips<00:00:22.170> are

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
so I thought these chicken strips are

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.670 
so I thought these chicken strips are
gonna<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.920> huge<00:00:23.660> but<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:25.019> sadly<00:00:25.500> be

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
gonna be huge but to sadly be

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.279 
gonna be huge but to sadly be
disappointed<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.820> they<00:00:27.029> don't<00:00:27.390> really<00:00:27.840> need

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
disappointed that they don't really need

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.429 
disappointed that they don't really need
a<00:00:28.529> box<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.220> big<00:00:29.599> although<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.779> definitely

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
a box this big although it's definitely

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.350 
a box this big although it's definitely
taking<00:00:31.830> up<00:00:31.980> more<00:00:32.160> than<00:00:32.340> half<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> box<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
taking up more than half of the box it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.060 
taking up more than half of the box it
definitely<00:00:34.050> didn't<00:00:34.350> need<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.890> big<00:00:37.070> I've

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
definitely didn't need one this big I've

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.490 
definitely didn't need one this big I've
taken<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.760> strip<00:00:39.090> out<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.540> box<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
taken one strip out of this box what you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.889 
taken one strip out of this box what you
can't<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.219> see<00:00:41.550> too<00:00:41.579> well<00:00:41.850> although<00:00:42.510> it's

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
can't really see too well although it's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
can't really see too well although it's
present<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:43.890> four<00:00:44.309> strips<00:00:44.700> still<00:00:44.969> in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
present there are four strips still in

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.080 
present there are four strips still in
the<00:00:45.210> box<00:00:45.390> which<00:00:45.899> goes<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.469> show<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.430> Box<00:00:47.700> makes

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the box which goes to show the Box makes

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.290 
the box which goes to show the Box makes
everything<00:00:48.660> appear<00:00:49.370> much<00:00:50.370> bigger<00:00:50.730> than<00:00:51.090> what

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
everything appear much bigger than what

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.420 
everything appear much bigger than what
it<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:52.010> once<00:00:53.010> you've<00:00:53.219> opened<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:55.430> as

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it really is once you've opened it as

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.029 
it really is once you've opened it as
you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.440> fairly<00:00:58.739> well

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you can see here it is fairly well

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.670 
you can see here it is fairly well
breaded<00:00:59.489> however<00:01:00.230> breading<00:01:01.230> doesn't

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
breaded however breading doesn't

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
breaded however breading doesn't
overwhelm<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.670> McDonald's<00:01:03.390> chicken

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
overwhelm it like McDonald's chicken

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
overwhelm it like McDonald's chicken
strips<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.229> because<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> texture<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
strips do because the texture is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.929 
strips do because the texture is
slightly<00:01:05.970> limp<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.280> texture<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
slightly limp and that is the texture of

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.450 
slightly limp and that is the texture of
chicken<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> bad<00:01:11.040> thing<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
chicken so that is not a bad thing in

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.740 
chicken so that is not a bad thing in
this<00:01:11.640> case<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:13.700> we<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
this case as we can see here the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.990 
this case as we can see here the
breading<00:01:16.170> isn't<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:16.650> too<00:01:16.680> thick<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
breading isn't all too thick and like I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.270 
breading isn't all too thick and like I
said<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> good<00:01:18.960> thing<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.590> noted<00:01:20.159> by

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
said that is a good thing as noted by

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.940 
said that is a good thing as noted by
the<00:01:20.340> limpness<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.060> each<00:01:21.210> piece<00:01:21.680> that<00:01:22.680> means

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the limpness of each piece that means

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.609 
the limpness of each piece that means
that<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.369> taste<00:01:23.700> more<00:01:24.000> chicken<00:01:24.659> than<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.380> do

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
that you taste more chicken than you do

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.179 
that you taste more chicken than you do
breading<00:01:26.330> however<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.720> terms<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.380> this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
breading however in terms of this

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399 
breading however in terms of this
chicken<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.150> most<00:01:30.570> Burger<00:01:31.170> King

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
chicken just like most Burger King

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.550 
chicken just like most Burger King
chicken<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:33.119> little<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.960> weak<00:01:34.170> side

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
chicken it is a little on the weak side

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.490 
chicken it is a little on the weak side
and<00:01:34.890> most<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.240> you're<00:01:36.390> actually<00:01:36.630> tasting

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and most of what you're actually tasting

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.359 
and most of what you're actually tasting
is<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.520> grease<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.060> they<00:01:39.210> fry<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.630> in

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
is the grease that they fry it in

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.560 
is the grease that they fry it in
however<00:01:41.179> it<00:01:41.509> still<00:01:41.780> tastes<00:01:42.170> fairly<00:01:42.469> decent<00:01:43.570> of

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
however it still tastes fairly decent of

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.539 
however it still tastes fairly decent of
course<00:01:44.929> every<00:01:45.409> once<00:01:45.619> in<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.829> while<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:46.340> will

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
course every once in a while you will

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.059 
course every once in a while you will
get<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:46.789> piece<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.509> has<00:01:47.990> some<00:01:48.229> thick<00:01:48.500> breading

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
get a piece that has some thick breading

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.249 
get a piece that has some thick breading
which<00:01:49.789> does<00:01:50.060> take<00:01:50.299> away<00:01:50.569> from<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:51.020> little

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
which does take away from it a little

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.859 
which does take away from it a little
bit<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.189> it<00:01:52.490> also<00:01:52.640> adds<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:53.060> little<00:01:53.240> rigidity

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
bit and it also adds a little rigidity

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.300 
bit and it also adds a little rigidity
to<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.679> pieces<00:01:56.439> here's<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.530> view<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.039> box

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
to the pieces here's a view of the box

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.999 
to the pieces here's a view of the box
with<00:01:58.670> just<00:01:58.939> three<00:01:59.299> pieces<00:01:59.659> in<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.170> as<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.829> can

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
with just three pieces in it as you can

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.279 
with just three pieces in it as you can
see<00:02:01.189> it<00:02:02.000> pretty<00:02:02.179> much<00:02:02.299> justifies<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.049> fact

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
see it pretty much justifies the fact

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.539 
see it pretty much justifies the fact
the<00:02:03.530> box<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.979> just<00:02:04.009> too<00:02:04.520> big<00:02:05.709> and<00:02:06.709> now<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
the box is just too big and now the

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.419 
the box is just too big and now the
moment<00:02:07.819> you've<00:02:08.030> been<00:02:08.119> waiting<00:02:08.360> for<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:09.429> give

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
moment you've been waiting for I give

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:22.900 
moment you've been waiting for I give
these<00:02:11.090> chicken<00:02:11.660> strips<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.140> score<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.769> a<00:02:21.910> six
