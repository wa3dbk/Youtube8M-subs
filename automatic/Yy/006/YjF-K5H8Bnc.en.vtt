00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 
hello welcome to how to use ms config

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.089 
hello welcome to how to use ms config
first<00:00:06.480> off<00:00:06.720> how<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.140> get<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.589> screen<00:00:07.859> you

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
first off how to get this screen you

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.030 
first off how to get this screen you
would<00:00:08.189> need<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.519> go<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.849> start<00:00:09.450> then<00:00:11.480> run<00:00:12.480> and

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
would need to go to start then run and

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.109 
would need to go to start then run and
then<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.190> would<00:00:14.309> type<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.059> miss<00:00:15.330> config<00:00:15.809> and

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
then you would type in I miss config and

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.910 
then you would type in I miss config and
then<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.420> should<00:00:18.690> open<00:00:18.900> up<00:00:19.109> after<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.650> you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
then it should open up after that you

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.439 
then it should open up after that you
should<00:00:20.160> see<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> screen<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.060> you're<00:00:21.150> seeing

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
should see the screen that you're seeing

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.599 
should see the screen that you're seeing
now<00:00:23.420> its<00:00:24.420> first<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.740> start<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
now its first you start out on the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.560 
now its first you start out on the
general<00:00:26.910> tab<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.420> then<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:29.570> some

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
general tab and then you can see some

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.229 
general tab and then you can see some
options<00:00:31.219> the<00:00:32.219> first<00:00:32.250> option<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.880> normal

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
options the first option is normal

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.819 
options the first option is normal
startup<00:00:33.780> which<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:36.590> everything<00:00:37.590> runs

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
startup which is just everything runs

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.860 
startup which is just everything runs
regularly<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.700> second<00:00:39.090> one<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.360> diagnostic

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
regularly the second one is diagnostic

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.680 
regularly the second one is diagnostic
setup<00:00:40.469> which<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:42.230> similar<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.469> safe<00:00:44.040> mode<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
setup which is similar to safe mode and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.560 
setup which is similar to safe mode and
then<00:00:45.690> there's<00:00:46.070> selective<00:00:47.070> startup<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
then there's selective startup which it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
then there's selective startup which it
will<00:00:48.750> load<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:48.989> certain<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:52.430> individual

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
will load up certain like individual

it<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.280> pick<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.149> choose<00:00:57.329> which<00:00:57.629> one

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it you can pick and choose which one

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.920 
it you can pick and choose which one
it'll<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.320> load<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.280> boot<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.750> then

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it'll actually load up on boot and then

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.149 
it'll actually load up on boot and then
the<00:01:01.109> second<00:01:01.559> tab<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:01.920> boot<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.359> then<00:01:04.159> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the second tab is boot and then you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.469 
the second tab is boot and then you
should<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.369> how<00:01:05.760> many<00:01:05.909> operating<00:01:06.420> systems

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
should see how many operating systems

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.109 
should see how many operating systems
are<00:01:07.380> installed<00:01:07.790> currently<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:08.970> only

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
debug for it and then we got a boot you

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.150 
debug for it and then we got a boot you
have<00:02:22.000> timeout<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.900> timeouts<00:02:23.380> basically<00:02:23.890> when

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
have timeout the timeouts basically when

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.430 
have timeout the timeouts basically when
you<00:02:24.250> start<00:02:24.520> up<00:02:25.120> your<00:02:25.600> computer<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:26.410> should

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
you start up your computer you should

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.530 
you start up your computer you should
see<00:02:26.950> if<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:27.580> had<00:02:27.730> multiple<00:02:28.120> operating

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
see if you had multiple operating

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.160 
see if you had multiple operating
systems<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.770> get<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.100> boot<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:31.300> bootloader

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
systems you get a boot of a bootloader

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.290 
systems you get a boot of a bootloader
menu<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.430> would<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.730> select<00:02:34.030> which

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.030 
menu and you would have to select which
operating<00:02:34.600> system<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.050> boot<00:02:35.290> up<00:02:35.380> this

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
operating system you boot up this

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.510 
operating system you boot up this
basically<00:02:36.580> let's<00:02:37.320> let<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:38.470> designate<00:02:38.800> how

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
basically let's let you designate how

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520 
basically let's let you designate how
much<00:02:39.640> time<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.090> have<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.600> select<00:02:41.350> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
much time you have to select the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.130 
much time you have to select the
operating<00:02:41.980> system<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.340> boot<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.940> then<00:02:43.870> over

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
operating system to boot and then over

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.960

here on Boot Options is safe route

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.450 
here on Boot Options is safe route
basically<00:02:48.970> minimal<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.810> safe<00:02:50.170> mode<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:51.160> then

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
basically minimal is safe mode and then

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.510 
basically minimal is safe mode and then
alternate<00:02:52.420> shell<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.110> safe<00:02:54.070> mode<00:02:54.280> with<00:02:54.490> a

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.560 
command prompt active directory repair
is<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.800> loads<00:02:59.980> up<00:03:00.220> directory<00:03:01.000> services

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
is it just loads up directory services

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.120 
is it just loads up directory services
and<00:03:02.160> then<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> network<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:04.890> safe<00:03:05.890> mode<00:03:06.100> with

and then a network is safe mode with

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.510 
and then a network is safe mode with
networking<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:08.860> like<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.220> basic

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
networking and it's like a basic

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.680 
networking and it's like a basic
networking<00:03:10.230> generic<00:03:11.230> like<00:03:11.470> TCP<00:03:12.010> IP

configuration is only used over here you

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.240 
configuration is only used over here you
have<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.660> no<00:03:17.020> GUI<00:03:17.380> boot<00:03:17.709> which<00:03:18.490> is<00:03:19.770> disables<00:03:20.770> the

have a no GUI boot which is disables the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.340 
have a no GUI boot which is disables the
