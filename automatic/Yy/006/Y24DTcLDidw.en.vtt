cool lens let's see if it's going to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.479 
cool lens let's see if it's going to
work<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.530> furla<00:02:11.009> first<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.400> all

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
work here so it's it furla first of all

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.050 
work here so it's it furla first of all
it's<00:02:11.760> a

it's a
as<00:02:13.239> an<00:02:13.540> application<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.590> be

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
as an application that it's going to be

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.440 
as an application that it's going to be
integrated<00:02:15.160> into<00:02:15.250> maps<00:02:15.550> soon<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.300> you're

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
integrated into maps soon and you're

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.850 
integrated into maps soon and you're
able<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.750> see<00:02:17.020> all<00:02:17.200> around<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.560> different

that I'm are its need to calibrate the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.470 
that I'm are its need to calibrate the
compass<00:02:23.950> there<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.520> go<00:02:24.670> because<00:02:25.270> we<00:02:25.360> were

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
compass there you go because we were

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.510 
compass there you go because we were
inside<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.470> then<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.860> instantly<00:02:27.250> see

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
inside so then I can instantly see

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.550 
inside so then I can instantly see
what's<00:02:27.790> nearby<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.780> here<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:28.959> can<00:02:29.230> see<00:02:29.410> that

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
what's nearby so here I can see that

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.559 
what's nearby so here I can see that
close<00:02:29.769> by<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> son<00:02:30.430> key<00:02:30.640> restaurant<00:02:31.120> or<00:02:31.330> rainbow

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
so you can see that one for example it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.610 
so you can see that one for example it
brings<00:02:36.489> up<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.760> map<00:02:36.940> screen<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.599> it's<00:02:38.290> using

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
brings up a map screen and it's using

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.460 
brings up a map screen and it's using

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
device over LTE it brings up the

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.620
