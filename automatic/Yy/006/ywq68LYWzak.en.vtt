00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.620
 do in my hair is this monkey 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 carefree the first step is 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.620
 just make you a ponytail I'm going to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.260
 do 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.899
 brushing less hair with my own 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.399
 fingers to make it more carefree and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.219
 once we have the height that we want 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.649
 we take a rubber band we give the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.629
 necessary turns and in the last one not 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.659
 we spent the hair completely worth what 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.149
 we leave half- hearted as we take the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.340
 excess hair and we 're going to surround it 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.800
 base of the bow and we put a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.900
 hairpin and with the bow what we are going to 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.330
 to do is to open it on both sides 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.440
 just like that we hooked it on each side 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.350
 with a fork 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.600
 and we just have to put one or two 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.570
 hairpins here or there to hold the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.720
 hair rest super super easy and already 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.400
 is in our carefree muñoz let's go 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.540
 now for the second hairstyle that goes to 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.890
 do my sister's with my sister the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.620
 first thing you're going to do with my sister is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.320
 a braid in a braid in this case 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.210
 low very easy to do we start with 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.720
 a root braid and down we make a 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.160
 normal braid like all step we are going to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.040
 brush your hair first and let's 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.730
 set aside let's divide the part 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.070
 central the front of the hair and 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.280
 let's start creating a braid of 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.979
 root of three ends that means that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.840
 every time we cross a cape 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.690
 we take hair so much from the part 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.360
 front as in the back we try 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.100
 well and with the rest of the hair 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.290
 incorporating the braid we make a 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.670
 normal braid and let loose a popular 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.830
 super easy hair second picked 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 Greek goddess style is the same and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.680
 facilitates let's do the same thing first 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.079
 we brush and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.349
 Absolutely the whole part is removed 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.599
 from ear to ear on the front 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.480
 and we started to twist like this 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.879
 I'm doing here we take it to the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.709
 more forward area and we are twisting 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.450
 when we finish the whole central part 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.810
 let go of the rest of the hair that we have 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.269
 separately we perform well and we're going to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.909
 we keep twisting but we're going to 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.980
 Smoothing see to not stay a 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.110
 egg or anything at the same time we're going 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.780
 twisting we hold the ponytail 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.090
 and we are going to do a total twisted 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.220
 all the remaining hair and with that we do 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.000
 a bow and we hold it with forks 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.820
 chignon, and she is collected from the goddess 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.150
 third or fourth and forgive the headband 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.740
 in the form of braid this is super easy 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.760
 we take a lock a bit back 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.460
 of the envelope over the ear that does not 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.890
 be frontal we make a braid of three 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.040
 normal ends and we put a gum 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.380
 elastic we hold them well and what 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.110
 let's take is the whole part 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.790
 front this braid making effect of 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.459
 a clay of one of a headband and 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.220
 we hold and it's nice to see 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.600
 how easy it is and the last one is another braid 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.459
 in braid but this time in high ponytail 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.970
 we started doing the same thing as the one 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.500
 the third we separate the front 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.140
 but this time we're going to do let's 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.480
 start creating the root braid a 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.140
 little more upwards backwards like 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.080
 if it were from the front to the back 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:11.260
 we are taking tufts and adding the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.420
 from the head so that it is integrated 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.910
 the braid and then we get to the area 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.180
 the ear we continue with a braid 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.140
 normal you see how is this root braid 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.100
 I am adding 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.860
 a little hair 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.650
 to the area to the inn that touches that area 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.650
 to integrate the braid to our 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.740
 head 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.300
 and we finish the normal braid and 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.160
 we add a rubber band at the end to 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.580
 hold it 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.540
 I'm sorry the rest of the hair separating the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.540
 main braid 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.850
 and now what we are going to do is make 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.569
 a very tall pigtail we add our 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.490
 braid and put a rubber band 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:57.179
 once we have high our 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.089
 Braid our pigtail separated into three 

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:02.509
 this hair incorporating the braid and 

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:06.389
 created and we make a normal braid 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:08.219
 we hold and open a little the braid 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.770
 to make it more beautiful and carefree 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.929
