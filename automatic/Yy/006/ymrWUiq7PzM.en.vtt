00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 as sure that many of you to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.759
 I also called a lot the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.490
 attention to see someone in a delineate 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.400
 perfect I think that is the fundamental basis 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.440
 of any good makeup nowadays 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.120
 there are a lot of tutorials on youtube 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.940
 in which they teach us to make a 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.980
 incredible delineated using a technique and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.199
 doing only three or four simple 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.210
 stripes but the truth is that to me 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.420
 It is very difficult and I always 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.160
 it's fatal, that's why I thought that if 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.230
 there are some out there just as clumsy as 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.180
 I have the same, it's good to know the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.050
 techniques that I use to get a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.050
 good delineated 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.739
 if getting a good delineation is 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.980
 important so much more important is 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.930
 prepare the eye for the same use 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.180
 an eye test is going to help us 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.540
 the makeup lasts all day and the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.250
 shadows have much more intensity 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.800
 first we will use a color shade 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.290
 clarita skin around the eyelid well 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.899
 cover possible red spots and 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.909
 imperfections and at the same time we will give light to 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.579
 eye 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.710
 now we will give dimension and depth to 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.049
 the look applying a shadow color 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.479
 mole or brown light in the basin of 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.750
 eye and blurring the good so that it 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.450
 be very natural 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.250
 also if we apply a point of light in 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.130
 the arch of the eyebrow with a very shadow 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.030
 clarita and with brightness we will open much more 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.310
 the look 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.650
 now is when the interesting thing comes with 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.170
 a liquid eyeliner headliner we will make 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.060
 a line as fine as possible by the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.150
 upper line of lashes and the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.369
 we'll end up with a corner that does not matter 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.900
 we have the perfect line, the truth is 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.340
 that always comes to me totally 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.340
 unequal one from the other 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.590
 next with a black shadow and a 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.170
 very fine bevelled brush we will polish and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.690
 we will follow all the outline giving you the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.490
 shape and thickness that remain two to the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.680
 work with shadow is disguised 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.230
 much more the defects or failures that 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.790
 we can have the drawing done since 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.510
 at the same time that we apply it we are also going 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.820
 blurring 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.070
 and the best to get a finished 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.870
 incredible end is to use a 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.240
 rod with micellar water or 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.820
 desmaquillante and remove excess 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.050
 product precisely for this 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.390
 we have to have a little patience 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.170
 but I assure you that the result deserves 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.870
 the sorrow 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.800
 we will finish the makeup applying a 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.800
 good concealer of dark circles 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.620
 filling and fixing the tiles 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.200
 painting the water line of a skin tone 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.000
 for a better look and applying 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.069
 eyelash mask only by the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.510
 Upper lashes to give you even more 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.510
 prominence to the delineated 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.040
 as you can see the outline for awkward no 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.140
 has nothing to envy to an outlined 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.870
 professional I hope you liked it 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.170
 the video and see you in the next one 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.170
 Little kiss
