 Hey, guys, what's the second beauty video? 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.279
 In this video I want to show you 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.910
 for you how to build a pc gamer that 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.240
 run current games and maybe games that 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.670
 they will come with the legal quality ok maybe 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.949
 with that and 80 p 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.129
 depending on the game ok let's start with 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.110
 The video gives you that she collected all the 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.030
 products here on cable né 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.840
 but if you find a store that sells 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.460
 cheaper is better for you ok 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.000
 Wondering why it does not show up anymore? 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.309
 on here 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.219
 I 'm also asking this should 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.380
 be a fucking bug of my own 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.300
 The internet neither in yours will appear with 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.670
 attention all links here right? 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.829
 reminding the guys whats going on 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.030
 leaving you to have a cabinet is a 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.140
 dome hard drive that this is your 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.070
 government because this will not influence 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.200
 is napoli play in the graphic quality of 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.200
 Beauty game will only help until 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.539
 stabilizing is the heat of your 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.770
 computer and the speed it reads 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:23.569

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:29.360
