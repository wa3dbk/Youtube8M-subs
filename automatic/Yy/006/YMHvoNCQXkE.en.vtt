got to receiver itself USB and we got

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.660 
got to receiver itself USB and we got
the<00:00:58.840> controller<00:00:59.260> so<00:00:59.980> basically<00:01:00.340> this<00:01:00.489> is<00:01:00.610> a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
the controller so basically this is a

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.670 
the controller so basically this is a
analog<00:01:01.390> controller<00:01:01.840> which<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.379> a<00:01:02.440> wireless

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
analog controller which is a wireless

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.749 
analog controller which is a wireless
and<00:01:04.050> it<00:01:05.050> reminds<00:01:05.830> me<00:01:05.890> quite<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.280> bit<00:01:06.399> of<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
and it reminds me quite a bit of the

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.990 
and it reminds me quite a bit of the
xbox<00:01:07.180> 360<00:01:07.720> controller<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.399> doesn't<00:01:09.850> work

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
xbox 360 controller but it doesn't work

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.300 
xbox 360 controller but it doesn't work
for<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.240> 360<00:01:10.780> or<00:01:11.140> ps3<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.460> pc<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.770> it's

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
for a 360 or ps3 and the pc so it's

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.219 
for a 360 or ps3 and the pc so it's
going<00:01:15.430> to<00:01:15.490> be<00:01:15.580> interesting<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:16.030> see<00:01:16.450> feels<00:01:17.020> the

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
going to be interesting to see feels the

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.570 
going to be interesting to see feels the
same<00:01:18.899> circle<00:01:19.899> is<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.170> almost<00:01:21.569> although<00:01:22.569> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
same circle is it almost although the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.900 
same circle is it almost although the
finish<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.789> a<00:01:24.819> bit<00:01:25.030> classier<00:01:25.569> than<00:01:25.630> their<00:01:26.910> then

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
finish is a bit classier than their then

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.630 
finish is a bit classier than their then
on<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.240> 360<00:01:28.840> controllers<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:29.679> kind<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.369> feels

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
on the 360 controllers so kind of feels

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.719 
on the 360 controllers so kind of feels
so<00:01:30.849> slippery<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.860> we<00:01:33.130> have<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.310> same<00:01:33.520> four

in um doesn't weigh much actually feels
really<00:02:00.940> light<00:02:01.479> even<00:02:02.319> compared<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.709> a<00:02:02.770> 360

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
really light even compared to a 360

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.820 
really light even compared to a 360
controller<00:02:04.110> hopefully<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.259> doesn't<00:02:05.530> mean

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
controller hopefully it doesn't mean

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.889 
controller hopefully it doesn't mean
that<00:02:06.009> it's<00:02:06.160> lower<00:02:06.729> quality<00:02:07.330> than<00:02:07.360> any<00:02:07.720> other

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
that it's lower quality than any other

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.910 
that it's lower quality than any other
controllers<00:02:08.440> that<00:02:08.470> we<00:02:08.709> have<00:02:08.800> we<00:02:08.950> good<00:02:09.869> but

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
controllers that we have we good but

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.210 
controllers that we have we good but
yeah<00:02:11.920> anyways<00:02:12.849> I'll<00:02:13.450> take<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> look<00:02:13.870> at<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.220> give

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
yeah anyways I'll take a look at it give

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.070 
yeah anyways I'll take a look at it give
it<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.400> little<00:02:15.520> elevation<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.660> we<00:02:16.780> should<00:02:16.959> have

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
it a little elevation and we should have

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.930 
it a little elevation and we should have
