beadlocks there there really no good in

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.349 
beadlocks there there really no good in
general<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:28.550> only<00:00:28.699> thing<00:00:28.819> I<00:00:28.939> think<00:00:28.999> is<00:00:29.300> really

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
general the only thing I think is really

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.639 
general the only thing I think is really
good<00:00:29.659> about<00:00:29.749> it<00:00:29.929> was<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:30.079> fact<00:00:30.259> you<00:00:30.380> can<00:00:30.499> take

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
good about it was the fact you can take

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.290 
good about it was the fact you can take
them<00:00:30.769> off<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:30.919> get<00:00:31.069> the<00:00:31.220> tire<00:00:31.429> off<00:00:31.460> so<00:00:32.119> you<00:00:32.180> can

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
them off and get the tire off so you can

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.030 
them off and get the tire off so you can
use<00:00:32.450> a<00:00:32.480> different<00:00:32.870> room<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.590> I'm<00:00:33.739> just<00:00:33.950> going

to use these days this is like the
cheapest<00:00:36.039> this<00:00:37.039> is<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:37.309> cheapest<00:00:37.699> solution<00:00:37.820> I

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
cheapest this is the cheapest solution I

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.580 
cheapest this is the cheapest solution I
can<00:00:38.149> come<00:00:38.449> up<00:00:38.480> with<00:00:38.629> these<00:00:39.199> are<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.500> original

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
can come up with these are the original

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.250 
can come up with these are the original
rate<00:00:40.190> wheels<00:00:40.489> glue<00:00:40.760> on<00:00:40.940> wheels<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:41.449> that<00:00:42.079> blue

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
rate wheels glue on wheels and that blue

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.229 
rate wheels glue on wheels and that blue
on<00:00:42.440> wheels<00:00:42.649> will<00:00:42.800> be<00:00:42.890> fine<00:00:43.100> for<00:00:43.340> scooch<00:00:43.640> up<00:00:43.850> I

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
on wheels will be fine for scooch up I

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.319 
on wheels will be fine for scooch up I
don't<00:00:44.600> think<00:00:44.629> he'll<00:00:44.870> notice<00:00:45.050> any<00:00:45.379> difference

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
don't think he'll notice any difference

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.729 
don't think he'll notice any difference
between<00:00:47.329> this<00:00:47.480> tire<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:47.929> another<00:00:48.109> tire<00:00:48.379> so

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
between this tire and another tire so

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.310 
between this tire and another tire so
these<00:00:49.309> can<00:00:49.550> be<00:00:49.699> his<00:00:49.879> tires<00:00:50.149> for<00:00:50.269> for<00:00:51.079> as<00:00:51.170> long

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
these can be his tires for for as long

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.259 
these can be his tires for for as long
as<00:00:51.379> they<00:00:51.589> last<00:00:51.859> and<00:00:52.129> not<00:00:52.250> glue<00:00:52.789> on<00:00:52.910> wheels<00:00:53.120> will

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
as they last and not glue on wheels will

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:54.520 
as they last and not glue on wheels will
be<00:00:53.359> fine<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:53.690> we're<00:00:53.780> going<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:53.989> do<00:00:54.109> this<00:00:54.260> in

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
be fine so we're going to do this in

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.770 
be fine so we're going to do this in
addition<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.640> glue<00:00:55.940> on<00:00:56.120> wheels<00:00:56.329> we<00:00:56.480> have<00:00:56.600> to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
addition to glue on wheels we have to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.650 
addition to glue on wheels we have to
add<00:00:56.929> a<00:00:56.960> hex<00:00:57.410> hubs<00:00:57.679> so<00:00:58.399> I<00:00:58.429> bought<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.269> pack<00:00:59.480> of

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
add a hex hubs so I bought a pack of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.899 
add a hex hubs so I bought a pack of
them<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:02.559> last<00:01:03.559> but<00:01:03.679> not<00:01:03.890> least<00:01:03.949> last<00:01:04.580> but<00:01:04.730> not

horn<00:01:08.480> I<00:01:08.780> used<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.860> robotronic<00:01:10.580> server<00:01:10.910> worn<00:01:11.300> on

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
horn I used a robotronic server worn on

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.960 
horn I used a robotronic server worn on
on<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.350> rock<00:01:12.500> monkey<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:13.610> thing<00:01:13.790> looks

ahead and lock tight inviting this whole
thing<00:04:54.470> down<00:04:54.620> we<00:04:55.160> should<00:04:55.310> be<00:04:55.370> good<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:55.550> go

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.490 

well<00:05:19.969> that's<00:05:20.210> it<00:05:20.389> for<00:05:20.539> this<00:05:20.659> episode<00:05:20.719> of<00:05:21.199> the

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
well that's it for this episode of the

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.369 
well that's it for this episode of the
the<00:05:22.400> boys<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.789> huge<00:05:22.969> upgrade<00:05:23.180> series<00:05:23.750> hit<00:05:24.349> a

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379 
the boys and huge upgrade series hit a

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.110 
the boys and huge upgrade series hit a
couple<00:05:24.590> inexpensive<00:05:25.340> things<00:05:25.370> I<00:05:25.669> know<00:05:25.729> not<00:05:25.969> too

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
couple inexpensive things I know not too

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.550 
couple inexpensive things I know not too
many<00:05:26.300> people<00:05:26.629> would<00:05:26.750> think<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:27.110> go<00:05:27.289> from

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
many people would think to go from

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.679 
many people would think to go from
beadlock<00:05:28.430> wheels<00:05:28.460> to<00:05:28.849> blue<00:05:29.000> on<00:05:29.180> wheels<00:05:29.389> but<00:05:29.569> in

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:29.689 
beadlock wheels to blue on wheels but in

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:30.969 
beadlock wheels to blue on wheels but in
this<00:05:29.780> case<00:05:29.990> I<00:05:30.139> think<00:05:30.349> it<00:05:30.439> works<00:05:30.620> out<00:05:30.770> better

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
this case I think it works out better

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.670 
this case I think it works out better
for<00:05:31.250> us<00:05:31.370> and<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.689> servo<00:05:32.960> horn<00:05:33.080> is<00:05:33.289> definitely

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
for us and the servo horn is definitely

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.520 
for us and the servo horn is definitely
light<00:05:34.250> years<00:05:34.460> ahead<00:05:34.639> of<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:35.379> plastic<00:05:36.379> one

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
light years ahead of the plastic one

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.640 
light years ahead of the plastic one
that<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:37.219> the<00:05:37.460> rain<00:05:38.180> came<00:05:38.419> with<00:05:38.689> so<00:05:39.199> I<00:05:39.500> think

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
that that the rain came with so I think

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.800 
that that the rain came with so I think
scooch<00:05:40.009> is<00:05:40.159> ready<00:05:40.340> for<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:40.550> trails<00:05:40.849> and<00:05:41.060> that

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
scooch is ready for the trails and that

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.270 
scooch is ready for the trails and that
hopefully<00:05:41.930> you<00:05:42.289> enjoyed<00:05:42.500> this<00:05:42.650> video<00:05:42.830> so
