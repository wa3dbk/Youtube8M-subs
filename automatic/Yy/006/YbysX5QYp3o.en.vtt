00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.180
 turn of the greed armor that is the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:35.860
 armor of the weak savage as ya 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.469
 I commented on the Havana video is worth 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.960
 this version of demonstrate hunter 4 the 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.450
 weak joe savage as he has his own 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.780
 armor that is to be here 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.590
 this armor is weird 7 and has a 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.730
 basic defense per piece of 64 what 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.640
 makes a total of 320 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.940
 and well let's have a look at the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.039
 outside area 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.360
 now for the back one we've seen before 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.360
 the area in front 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.380
 and well, this is the new armor 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.170
 of the weak wild 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.399
 and you saw the outside, let's go inside 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.060
 and let's start with the defenses 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:28.810
 elementals that are -5 to fire -5 water 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.899
 -15 to thunder -5 to ice and -5 to dragon 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.840
 this armor has a total of 3 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.509
 slots and the active skills that 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.650
 has by the order of appearance are 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:47.270
 attack + 2 the second is to consume more 1 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:53.510
 the third is sharp edged like a blade 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.510
 and the fourth is the negative that is hungry 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.930
 now let's move to the table to see 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.390
 how the points are distributed 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.480
 and here for so many appearances 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.830
 skills are attack plus 2 that affects 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.350
 attack 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.210
 the next one is sharpened the edge as 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.980
 blade that affects the speed of 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:20.480
 loss of sharpening of the armh when attacking 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.670
 the third is to consume more 1 that affects 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.030
 at the speed of meat consumption and 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.129
 other objects and the negative that is 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.010
 hunger that affects the speed of 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.230
 Maximum resistance spending too 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.569
 we have three points in greed that is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.940
 a new skill and that makes the 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.480
 number of reward elements 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.460
 by mission and capture increase a lot and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.550
 to finish then we have the torso plus 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.310
 and good now is the time to go piece 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.260
 per piece to see how they have 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.600
 distributed the points the slots and 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.240
 the rest 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.920
 as always we start with the helmet that 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.460
 as you have seen it does not have any 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.940
 slot and also as always we 're going 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.740
 placing on the top well how 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.740
 all these points are distributed 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.560
 well let's move on to the breast chest 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.220
 It also has no groove 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.810
 and well you already know in the upper part 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.319
 everything explained so you can look at it 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.319
 calmly 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.740
 It is now time to move on to 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.420
 gloves the gloves do not have either 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.520
 no groove 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.849
 and good while I'm on the gloves you 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.610
 I'm going to explain that the armor is 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.709
 armor of the wild vision people 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.760
 he looks for her a lot precisely for this 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:56.150
 new greed skill is worth it because 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.220
 well it increases a lot this you are 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.220
 rewards and people look for it a lot 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.630
 because 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.720
 well we go to the belt and the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.060
 belt what gives us is the ability 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.459
 of this torso plus 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.160
 and you know what torso plus does 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.269
 is to duplicate the skill points in 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.269
 the torso team 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.180
 and we're done with the pants and 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.129
 pants is the piece that gives us the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.580
 three slots that has in total this 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.580
 armor 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.449
 and well you know we put everything in 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.669
 the top of the screen 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.749
 so you can see how they are doing 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.749
 distributed the points 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.960
 because as I said this armor 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.730
 weak wild is very sought after 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.950
 precisely because of this ability to 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.390
 greed that there are only three points that 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.060
 you need to get to ten to be able to 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.430
 activate it but if you get it then 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.620
 it would be good luck and 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.680
 expert capture all together in one 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.630
 good skill hunters I hope that you 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.940
 have liked this video that you have 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.090

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.090
 editions
