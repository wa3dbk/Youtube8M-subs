really<00:01:30.869> seem<00:01:31.049> irrelevant<00:01:31.229> right<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:31.650> because

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
really seem irrelevant right now because

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.469 
really seem irrelevant right now because
you<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.759> gonna<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> win<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
you have you're gonna have to win it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
you have you're gonna have to win it
seems<00:01:33.750> yet<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.610> think

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
seems yet to get your there do you think

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.460 
seems yet to get your there do you think
that<00:01:35.970> happens<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.509> if<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.689> does<00:01:36.869> who<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.350> do

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
that happens and if it does who can do

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.050 
that happens and if it does who can do
it<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.159> Newman<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.579> Greg<00:01:38.729> Biffle

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it but as for I Newman and Greg Biffle

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.760 
it but as for I Newman and Greg Biffle
point<00:01:39.299> still<00:01:39.540> matter<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.110> yeah<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> mean

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
point still matter so yeah but I mean

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
point still matter so yeah but I mean
absolutely<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.490> still<00:01:41.700> could<00:01:41.850> happen<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.360> I'm

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
absolutely it still could happen and I'm

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.700 
absolutely it still could happen and I'm
going<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> go<00:01:42.810> back<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> said<00:01:43.380> last

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
going to go back to what I said last

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.859 
going to go back to what I said last
week<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.100> two<00:01:44.250> guys<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.759> really<00:01:44.790> thought<00:01:45.270> might

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
week the two guys I really thought might

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.240 
week the two guys I really thought might
have<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> speed<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> atlanta<00:01:47.159> i<00:01:47.220> think

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
have the speed to do it atlanta i think

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.310 
have the speed to do it atlanta i think
we'll<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> speed<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.420> weekend<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
we'll have the speed this weekend to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.560 
we'll have the speed this weekend to
possibly<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.070> number<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.490> Kyle<00:01:51.060> Larson

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
possibly do it number one Kyle Larson

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.969 
possibly do it number one Kyle Larson

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
big issue with that race team and to me

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.730 
big issue with that race team and to me

surprisingly<00:02:01.469> well<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:02.280> weekend<00:02:02.850> long<00:02:02.880> very

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
surprisingly well all weekend long very

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.540 
surprisingly well all weekend long very
good<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:03.990> type<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.380> race<00:02:04.710> track<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.310> they

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
good at this type of race track can they

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.670 
good at this type of race track can they
converted<00:02:05.970> on<00:02:06.120> race<00:02:06.420> day<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.350> other<00:02:07.500> guy

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
converted on race day and the other guy

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.859 
converted on race day and the other guy
and<00:02:07.890> probably<00:02:08.190> number<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:09.060> my<00:02:09.090> opinion<00:02:09.570> is

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and probably number one in my opinion is

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.230 
and probably number one in my opinion is
Clint<00:02:10.410> Bowyer<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.580> by<00:02:11.940> far<00:02:12.180> our

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
Clint Bowyer I think this is by far our

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.970 
Clint Bowyer I think this is by far our
best<00:02:12.330> race<00:02:12.750> track<00:02:12.960> he's<00:02:13.140> always<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.740> good<00:02:13.950> at

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
best race track he's always so good at

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.890 
best race track he's always so good at
Richmond<00:02:14.400> they've<00:02:14.910> always<00:02:15.210> had<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.630> speed

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
Richmond they've always had the speed

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.990 
Richmond they've always had the speed
here<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.680> go<00:02:16.860> back<00:02:17.070> again<00:02:17.310> look<00:02:17.700> at<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.910> New

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
here you go back again look at the New

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.280 
here you go back again look at the New
Hampshire<00:02:18.390> results<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:18.960> those<00:02:19.110> two

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
Hampshire results and those two

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.530 
Hampshire results and those two
racetracks<00:02:19.800> really<00:02:20.130> do<00:02:20.250> translate<00:02:20.850> put<00:02:21.390> boy

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
racetracks really do translate put boy

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.120 
racetracks really do translate put boy
you're<00:02:21.720> very<00:02:21.960> strong<00:02:22.260> at<00:02:22.500> New<00:02:22.590> Hampshire<00:02:22.950> I

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
you're very strong at New Hampshire I

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.950 
you're very strong at New Hampshire I
think<00:02:23.580> will<00:02:23.640> be<00:02:23.790> very<00:02:23.820> strong<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.480> weekend

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
think will be very strong this weekend

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.020 
think will be very strong this weekend
but<00:02:25.170> obviously<00:02:25.890> for<00:02:26.130> those<00:02:26.430> guys<00:02:26.700> they<00:02:26.970> do

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
but obviously for those guys they do

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.390 
but obviously for those guys they do
have<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.660> win<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.560> be<00:02:28.710> able<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.980> get<00:02:29.130> into<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
have to win to be able to get into the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.980 
have to win to be able to get into the
chase<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.030> think<00:02:30.240> it's<00:02:30.330> possible<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.810> think

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
chase and I think it's possible I think

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.840 
chase and I think it's possible I think
those<00:02:31.200> two<00:02:31.230> guys<00:02:31.560> are<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.190> only<00:02:32.220> ones<00:02:32.490> though

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
those two guys are the only ones though

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.310 
those two guys are the only ones though
Allen<00:02:33.180> who<00:02:33.300> could<00:02:33.480> possibly<00:02:33.600> win<00:02:34.170> this

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
Allen who could possibly win this

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.530 
Allen who could possibly win this
weekend<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.010> find<00:02:35.610> their<00:02:35.820> way<00:02:35.970> into<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
weekend and find their way into the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.420 
weekend and find their way into the
chase<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.470> i<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:37.860> feasible<00:02:38.160> that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
chase but i think it is feasible that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.830 
chase but i think it is feasible that
those<00:02:38.640> two<00:02:38.790> guys<00:02:39.000> could<00:02:39.240> get<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.480> done<00:02:39.600> if

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
those two guys could get it done if

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.120 
those two guys could get it done if
Boyer<00:02:40.110> doesn't<00:02:40.320> get<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> win<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:40.740> vickers<00:02:41.100> and

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
Boyer doesn't get a win or vickers and

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.130 
Boyer doesn't get a win or vickers and
we're<00:02:41.400> talking<00:02:41.520> aquatic<00:02:42.450> are<00:02:42.630> not<00:02:42.810> getting<00:02:43.080> in

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
we're talking aquatic are not getting in

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.570 
we're talking aquatic are not getting in
the<00:02:43.230> chase<00:02:43.410> that's<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> big<00:02:43.860> day<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.550> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
the chase that's a big day and that is a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.190 
the chase that's a big day and that is a
big<00:02:44.820> deal<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.300> think<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.690> tough<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:46.080> that

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
big deal and I think it's tough for that

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.720 
big deal and I think it's tough for that
race<00:02:46.410> team<00:02:46.620> especially<00:02:46.860> when<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.400> look<00:02:47.580> at

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
race team especially when you look at

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.880 
race team especially when you look at
the<00:02:47.820> future<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.360> go<00:02:48.540> hey<00:02:49.110> we're<00:02:49.350> looking

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the future and you go hey we're looking

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.710 
the future and you go hey we're looking
