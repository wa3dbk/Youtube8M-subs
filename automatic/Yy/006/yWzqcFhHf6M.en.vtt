24<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.780> walking<00:00:13.290> ATT<00:00:14.009> II<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:16.310> I'm

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
24 and it is the walking ATT II and I'm

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.750 
24 and it is the walking ATT II and I'm
assuming<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.940> wind-up<00:00:18.359> toy<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:19.250> well<00:00:20.250> let

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
assuming it's a wind-up toy and well let

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.120 
assuming it's a wind-up toy and well let
me<00:00:20.880> open<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.150> up<00:00:21.240> before<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> review<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.230> just

Wars<00:00:24.930> walking<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.800> TTE<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.349> if

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
Wars walking a TTE so here we go and if

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.410 
Wars walking a TTE so here we go and if
you<00:00:32.099> wanted<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> code<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:32.910> anyone<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
you wanted the code if anyone of you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.880 
you wanted the code if anyone of you
wanted<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.780> code<00:00:33.930> where<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> first<00:00:34.559> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
wanted the code where was the first to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.580 
wanted the code where was the first to
watch<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.520> guess<00:00:35.670> video<00:00:35.969> um<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.440> the

watch this I guess video um can have the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.580 
watch this I guess video um can have the
code<00:00:37.770> right<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:39.210> uh<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.840> M<00:00:40.140> code<00:00:40.440> to

code right here it is uh the M code to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.080 
code right here it is uh the M code to
get<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> virtual<00:00:41.040> light<00:00:41.340> sample<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:41.850> your<00:00:41.969> M

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
get a virtual light sample for your M

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.209 
get a virtual light sample for your M
pal<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.750> 4<00:00:43.739> 9<00:00:44.129> w<00:00:44.579> -<00:00:44.820> x<00:00:45.210> w<00:00:45.600> XX<00:00:46.079> -<00:00:46.620> f<00:00:47.370> k<00:00:48.200> h9<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.710> there

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you go whoever can see this code you're

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.810 
you go whoever can see this code you're
welcome<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> hope<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> use<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
welcome and I hope you get to use it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
welcome and I hope you get to use it
well<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.329> there's<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> basic<00:00:55.170> instructions

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
well so there's the basic instructions

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979 
well so there's the basic instructions
like<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.280> mentioned<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.850> most<00:00:57.180> pretty<00:00:57.870> much

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
like I mentioned it is most pretty much

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.650 
like I mentioned it is most pretty much
a<00:00:58.020> wind-up<00:00:58.410> toy<00:00:58.579> there's<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:01:00.030> winder

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
a wind-up toy there's a little winder

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
a wind-up toy there's a little winder
here<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.050> guess<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.039> call<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
here I guess that's what you call it I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.929 
here I guess that's what you call it I
just<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> wine<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:06.170> counterclockwise

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.390 

and<00:01:11.939> let's<00:01:12.900> face<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.409> turret<00:01:13.920> right<00:01:14.130> there

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and let's face the turret right there

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.390 
and let's face the turret right there
and<00:01:14.610> there's<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.540> black<00:01:15.750> button<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.259> there

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
and there's a black button right there

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
and there's a black button right there
which<00:01:17.400> I'm<00:01:17.520> assuming<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:18.060> allow<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.900> ATT<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
which I'm assuming will allow the ATT to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.590 
which I'm assuming will allow the ATT to
walk<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.150> press<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.330> black

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
walk so you just have to press the black

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.310 
walk so you just have to press the black
button<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> corner<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.140 

he's<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.470> walking<00:01:28.939> unless<00:01:29.939> I'm<00:01:30.060> doing

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
he's not walking unless I'm doing

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.710 
he's not walking unless I'm doing
something<00:01:30.390> wrong<00:01:30.659> oh<00:01:30.869> well<00:01:31.500> um<00:01:32.479> there<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:33.689> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
something wrong oh well um there we go I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.200 
something wrong oh well um there we go I
think<00:01:33.930> that's<00:01:34.079> that's<00:01:34.350> about<00:01:34.560> right

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
think that's that's about right

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.130 
think that's that's about right
nevermind<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.329> counter<00:01:36.630> clockwise<00:01:36.840> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
nevermind on counter clockwise you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.990 
nevermind on counter clockwise you
should<00:01:37.320> win<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.770> yes<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.670> should<00:01:38.820> win

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
should win it up yes you should win

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.219 
should win it up yes you should win
enough<00:01:39.210> counterclockwise<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:40.170> clockwise

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
enough counterclockwise not clockwise

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.620 
enough counterclockwise not clockwise
but<00:01:41.189> counter<00:01:41.700> clockwise<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:44.090> there<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
but counter clockwise so there we go and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.359 
but counter clockwise so there we go and
okay<00:01:49.100> something<00:01:50.270> something<00:01:51.270> odd<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:52.369> okay

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
okay something something odd here okay

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.700 
okay something something odd here okay
now<00:01:53.579> I'm<00:01:53.759> counting<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.149> clock<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.750> winding<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
now I'm counting a clock I'm winding it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.050 
now I'm counting a clock I'm winding it
up<00:01:55.799> clockwise<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:58.159> I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.670> should<00:01:59.850> do

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
up clockwise and I think this should do

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.420 
up clockwise and I think this should do
it<00:02:01.250> there<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:03.290> ATT's<00:02:04.290> ready<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:05.040> action

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
it there we go ATT's ready for action

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.330 
it there we go ATT's ready for action
well<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.450> action<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.320> walking<00:02:07.979> towards

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
well now in action is walking towards

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.190 
well now in action is walking towards
its<00:02:08.489> target<00:02:08.690> carrying<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> bunch<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.050> little

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
its target carrying a bunch of little

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.719 
its target carrying a bunch of little
clones

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
you can't see them cuz they're inside

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:21.460 
you can't see them cuz they're inside
awesome<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:17.390> pretty<00:02:17.750> cool<00:02:20.290> that's<00:02:21.290> pretty
