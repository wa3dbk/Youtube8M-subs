clutch and the front brake line over the
next<00:00:30.270> hour<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.750> we're<00:00:30.930> going<00:00:31.020> to<00:00:31.080> disassemble

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
next hour so we're going to disassemble

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.100 
next hour so we're going to disassemble
this<00:00:31.710> v-star<00:00:31.949> 650<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.940> install<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> clutch

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
this v-star 650 and install the clutch

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.889 
this v-star 650 and install the clutch
lever<00:00:34.309> brake<00:00:35.309> line<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.390> new<00:00:36.539> throttle

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
lever brake line and the new throttle

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.690 
lever brake line and the new throttle
cables<00:00:37.260> come<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.100> take<00:00:38.220> a<00:00:38.250> look<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.610> how

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
cables come on and take a look at how

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.490 
cables come on and take a look at how
simple<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.180> process<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
simple this process really is so the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.630 
simple this process really is so the
first<00:00:40.739> thing<00:00:40.890> we're<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.310> here<00:00:41.550> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
first thing we're going to do here is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.580 
first thing we're going to do here is
remove<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.120> seat<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.960> tanks<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.470> have

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
remove the seat and the tanks we have

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.340 
remove the seat and the tanks we have
access<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.220> everything<00:00:44.520> need<00:00:44.880> access<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.350> okc

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
access to everything need access to okc

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
access to everything need access to okc
removed<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.070> tank<00:00:47.309> removal<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.850> each

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
removed so tank removal on each

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.680 
removed so tank removal on each
motorcycle<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.020> slightly<00:00:49.200> different<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
motorcycle is slightly different so the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.389 
motorcycle is slightly different so the
actual<00:00:52.050> disassembly<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.890> isn't

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
actual disassembly of this isn't

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.520 
actual disassembly of this isn't
necessarily<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:54.030> keen<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
necessarily that keen but the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.380 
necessarily that keen but the
installation<00:00:55.950> of<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> lines<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> cables<00:00:56.969> is

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
installation of the lines and cables is

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.720 
installation of the lines and cables is
almost<00:00:57.690> identical<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.440> all<00:00:58.469> motorcycles<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
almost identical for all motorcycles the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.790 
almost identical for all motorcycles the
gas<00:00:59.910> tank<00:01:00.300> off<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.020> see<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.770> have

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
gas tank off as you can see here we have

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
gas tank off as you can see here we have
access<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> throttle<00:01:03.120> cables<00:01:03.450> all<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
access to the throttle cables all the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.539 
access to the throttle cables all the
way<00:01:03.989> down<00:01:04.259> to<00:01:04.890> where<00:01:05.009> they<00:01:05.100> connect<00:01:05.399> to<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
way down to where they connect to the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.100 
way down to where they connect to the
carburetor<00:01:05.880> now<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.659> gonna<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.049> I'm

the brake system on a motorcycle by

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.559 
the brake system on a motorcycle by
filling<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.229> reservoir<00:03:52.379> here<00:03:52.829> with<00:03:52.919> fluid

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
filling the reservoir here with fluid

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.299 
filling the reservoir here with fluid
creating<00:03:54.569> some<00:03:55.109> pressure<00:03:55.379> holding<00:03:55.949> it<00:03:56.129> and

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:56.309 
creating some pressure holding it and

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.219 
creating some pressure holding it and
then<00:03:56.549> releasing<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.269> valve<00:03:57.449> to<00:03:57.869> release<00:03:58.109> the

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
then releasing the valve to release the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.049 
then releasing the valve to release the
pressure<00:03:58.409> and<00:03:58.619> that<00:03:58.799> then<00:03:59.040> leads<00:03:59.339> the<00:03:59.579> line<00:03:59.790> in

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:00.059 
pressure and that then leads the line in

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:01.909 
pressure and that then leads the line in
the<00:04:00.659> community<00:04:01.049> for<00:04:01.229> over<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.439> last<00:04:01.589> couple
