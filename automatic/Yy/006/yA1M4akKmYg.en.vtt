00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 yes, I would already say how we are 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.089
 also remembering Pablo Picasso says 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.589
 something very true when they tell me that I am 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.170
 too old to do one thing 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.850
 I try to do it right away and that concerns the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.640
 exercise 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.810
 and it is dew and good following following 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.660
 with the theme, we're not going to wait for you 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.960
 first with the exercise 6000 of week 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.430
 almost then we already see the last milestone and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.930
 now always enjoy well the end of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.410
 week and let's see what it suggests is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.310
 so much that we do 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.310
 Y 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.129
 I'm a fan of fruits like 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.629
 delicious sweet juicy raspberries and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.809
 today during all this training 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.940
 I will be thinking of them with fear and they are 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.619
 of good luck until the coach 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.619
 It will make us very good exercises 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.250
 already once warming and in the mind the 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.530
 reward that you will give yourself today to be 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.899
 Friday we go with all the attitude of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.479
 conclude this week by exercising 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.400
 in sky ying a hundred times you can 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.380
 do it in reality also what 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.770
 you will achieve today 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.020
 we will use pure times so use all your 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.479
 strength and energy well channeled to 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.920
 get to the end let's do that 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.430
 position like this we're going to do rowing 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.550
 for back 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.800
 the clear dumbbell as high as you 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.800
 can and hence the post 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.890
 for letting her the dumbbell wings the most 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.750
 up you can 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 I do not know if you only move the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.020
 background 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.840
 from each hand we will make three series 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.840
 of 15 repetitions 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.920
 encouragement of only one milestone and lytic being 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.860
 positive that good thoughts and 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.900
 efforts bring good results 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.120
 do not think that I do not make sacrifices 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.040
 but when I think about the benefits that 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.800
 you will get in my body and in the attitude is 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.640
 when I most encourage you how you feel 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.490
 ready for what comes next let's not lose 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.220
 energy and hot attitude to what 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.100
 that follows the hands up can lower 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.640
 the dumbbells at the height of my forehead 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.020
 flexing the elbows 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.020
 it comes out 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.430
 when going up very important the same will not be 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:31.980
 the elbow code completely low 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.410
 space rise slowly ok to the quirinal 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.220
 Texas 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.960
 elder brother 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.960
 the room I close my elbows a little 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.849
 you already know that active breaks are 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.830
 good if you feel tired like that 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.989
 give yourself a little rest to 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.280
 then continue and not get tired in 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.590
 excess how many have you gotten one more and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.750
 running we continue with this think about 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.260
 Friday and looking forward to the end 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.420
 of week and alfonso as it is already Friday 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.770
 and we finish the week you can not put it 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.000
 like that more lightly because 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.000
 Friday ratio 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.750
 let's go down this 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.380
 the grip can only place them with 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.550
 Pegaditos has cut to the front 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.720
 under the lug 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.880
 between your elbow 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.790
 there should not be much difference if 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.520
 we go up we 're going to break the contraction and 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.069
 It will give us the same result already 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.920
 we almost finished this one if it's the last 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.200
 milestone of the week and the weekend what 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.989
 we have complete to rest or 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.260
 repeat your favorite exercise the one that 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.020
 have you liked all these days not 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.630
 it's a lie that from what you see you see the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.940
 others so convince you how beautiful 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.140
 what are you and even better after 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.540
 perform your exercise 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.890
 do not forget to conclude with the obligated 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.440
 stretching 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.810
 I know I insist a lot but it is that it is 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.750
 very important that your body stretch 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:28.200
 as rest and conclusion of the day for 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.690
 that at the end of the week and working 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.240
 it is not borrowed but it will be because it is the 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.650
 last day of the week that already 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.650
 it is still 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.120
 and now yes or fantasize the day is done 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.610
