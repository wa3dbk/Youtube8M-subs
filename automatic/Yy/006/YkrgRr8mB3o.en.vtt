 share six percent of it all 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.350
 strongly resembles 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.029
 unconditional expropriation which 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.070
 reigned in the early years of Soviet rule 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 Russia now plays by such rules

 ownership of the Schengen zone on 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.859
 the European Union we warned about this a lot 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.670
 since we have no gloating 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.619
 because if really this 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 confiscation will occur then whatever 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.920
 owners of Russian citizens is all but

 no bank works in cyprus 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.890
 at least until Thursday was not so 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.450
 and well Cypriots themselves go to 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.250
 protests one of them already 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.409
 ended the attack on the embassy 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.460
 countries that play one in the European Union 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.409
 from leading roles 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.420
 details of what is happening now 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.490
 not only on the island but in all of Europe 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.680
 Vladimir shteglovo cut as you want 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.420
 Cyprus authorities allowed to withhold tax 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.460
 from bank deposits in their own way 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.680
 discretion they are dictated earlier 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.869
 EU conditions this should be somewhat 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.569
 reassure the owner of modest bills but 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:48.970
 have not acted yet

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.840
 paradise is no longer so cloudless 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.659
 the economy is on the verge of collapse and who can 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.390
 help of course the European Union to 10 billion 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.830
 but if Cyprus will find and six still here 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.649
 here the main question is how to do it 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.869
 such a loan alone does not overpower Cyprus 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.270
 pushing cts money from their 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.769
 savers and any damages will warn you 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.170
 if the government urged 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.019
 population to save the economy would give home 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.000
 them their salary for the month, even for two 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.989

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.720

 which is only 8 in savings 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.930
 banks of cyprus and they ask me 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.519
 why take their money because we are 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.500
 children 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.930
 the rules dictate the imf and the european union and yet 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.280
 yesterday they were tough 10 percent for 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.680
 deposits over 100 thousand 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.109
 7 for those that are smaller but euro group 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.680
 already indicated this game in which the rules 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.650
 are changing 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.570
 too often and everything in 2008 is weird 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.000
 eurozone agreed to guarantee 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.489
 deposits up to 100 thousand that is what happen 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.010
 money owners will certainly return and here 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.470
 suddenly decided to expropriate issued about 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.239
 fans they don't keep promises five more 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.920
 days ago they assured that they would not 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.730
 cut the deposits and now they say 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.069
 cut off and then returned yes as sure 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.500

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.370
 another country who guarantees that through 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.739
 six months, they do not confiscate me another 10 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.230
 percent of what happens causes an effect 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.790
 deja vu nationalization she was already in 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.750
 Soviet history when citizens 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.610
 took land 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.310
 movements but where are such unpopular 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.590
 measures in europe with its about the inviolability right 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.510
 on private property, however, about what 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.550
 principles when speaking in the game for fein and 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.620
