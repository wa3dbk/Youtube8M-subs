00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.280
 hello classmates I'm going to show you a 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.800
 program similar to the famous sing star 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.670
 game that sweeps the meetings of 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.980
 friends as you will know though this program 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.860
 has a slight difference is 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.500
 totally free and you can wear the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.130
 songs that you want you do not have to 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.550
 put the whole CD if you do not want like that 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.150
 is 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.340
 it's very easy to download the songs if 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.410
 someone does not clarify that he asks me 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.410
 they are on the same game website 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.680
 www.un.org as we see has multiple 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.050
 options to adjust the game between 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.410
 they the option to adjust the microphone 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.719
 being able to use any microphone 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.480
 even those of the sing star to play 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.989
 there are two options the first and more 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.760
 quick it would be on the first tab 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.820
 sing where once chosen the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.219
 difficulty we have all the songs 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.200
 that we have downloaded and placed in the 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.860
 folder of the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.010
 in this case I have 400 but you can 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.290
 power all we want we can 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.140
 find songs for the kids of 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.570
 the house like those of disney or cantajuego 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.020
 and also a variety of songs 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.920
 old and current in addition to this 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.280
 option we can also play by groups 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.380
 entering the second tab groups 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.140
 here we simply have to choose the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.479
 parameters can create up to three 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.300
 groups of up to four people already 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.820
 then put the number of rounds and 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.450
 the category of each of these that 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.010
 want 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.300
 finally it is to select the song 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.300
 and sing
