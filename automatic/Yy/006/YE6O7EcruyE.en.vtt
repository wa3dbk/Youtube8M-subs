otherwise it just like kills my head you
know<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.420> don't<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> good<00:02:00.630> way<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
know I don't know a good way of

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
know I don't know a good way of
describing<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.939> guess<00:02:02.939> I'm<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.149> kind<00:02:03.329> of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
describing it but I guess I'm a kind of

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.449 
describing it but I guess I'm a kind of
workaholic<00:02:03.930> kind<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.259> person<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:04.619> whatever<00:02:05.509> I

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
workaholic kind of person but whatever I

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.070 
workaholic kind of person but whatever I
guess<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.819> figured<00:02:09.539> though<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
guess I I figured though I do like a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.119 
guess I I figured though I do like a
10-minute<00:02:10.319> contry<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:10.950> leave<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
10-minute contry and then leave it

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.230 
10-minute contry and then leave it
rendering<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> while<00:02:11.879> more

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
rendering a while more

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.520 
rendering a while more
so<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:13.370> doing<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> dune<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.420> little<00:02:15.960> bit<00:02:16.230> of

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
so you know doing a dune a little bit of

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.860 
so you know doing a dune a little bit of

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
ump45 looking down the corridors even

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.030 
ump45 looking down the corridors even
get<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> couple<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.410> killers<00:02:22.590> nothing<00:02:22.920> get

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
bored move on I find it quite often most

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.970 
bored move on I find it quite often most
of<00:02:27.540> my<00:02:27.660> deaths<00:02:27.900> are<00:02:28.200> caused<00:02:28.410> by<00:02:28.650> me<00:02:28.830> getting

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
bored I found that because it often is

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.170 
bored I found that because it often is
like<00:02:31.890> when<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.070> sprint<00:02:32.430> around<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> corner<00:02:32.880> like

I think I've got a couple this game kind

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.180 
I think I've got a couple this game kind
of<00:02:47.640> pointless<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.210> who<00:02:48.750> cares

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
of pointless but who cares

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.760 
of pointless but who cares

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
use it's extremely reliable actually

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.260 
use it's extremely reliable actually
because<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.470> high<00:02:55.620> power<00:02:55.890> because<00:02:56.820> because

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
game for no apparent reason so the great

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.870 
game for no apparent reason so the great
thing<00:03:35.370> about<00:03:35.430> Kimbo<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:36.000> once<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.610> don't

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
thing about Kimbo is once you you don't

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.120 
thing about Kimbo is once you you don't
need<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.510> fire<00:03:39.720> both<00:03:39.930> that's<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.010> mistake

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
need to fire both that's a mistake

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.760 
need to fire both that's a mistake
people<00:03:41.490> make<00:03:41.640> quite<00:03:42.060> often<00:03:42.440> but<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.530> really

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
people make quite often but it really

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.440 
people make quite often but it really
really<00:03:44.100> pisses<00:03:44.430> me<00:03:44.550> off<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.850> see<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.030> kill<00:03:45.270> cam

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
really pisses me off to see a kill cam

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.730 
really pisses me off to see a kill cam
of<00:03:45.570> someone<00:03:45.870> killing<00:03:46.140> me<00:03:46.260> when<00:03:46.410> they<00:03:46.530> fire

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
of someone killing me when they fire

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.890 
of someone killing me when they fire
both<00:03:47.010> not<00:03:47.910> because<00:03:48.120> they<00:03:48.240> killed<00:03:48.510> me<00:03:48.660> but

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
both not because they killed me but

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.940 
both not because they killed me but
because<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.380> was<00:03:49.470> just<00:03:49.620> completely

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
because it was just completely

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.650 
because it was just completely
unnecessary<00:03:50.580> one<00:03:50.970> would<00:03:51.210> have<00:03:51.300> done<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:53.660> but

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
unnecessary one would have done it but

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.540 
unnecessary one would have done it but
if<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.840> only<00:03:54.990> fire<00:03:55.200> one<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.490> actually

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
if you only fire one you can actually

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.610 
if you only fire one you can actually
