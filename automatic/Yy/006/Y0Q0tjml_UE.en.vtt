own<00:01:13.140> way<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> genuine<00:01:15.210> process<00:01:15.750> of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
own way it's just the genuine process of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
own way it's just the genuine process of
disillusionment<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.250> becomes

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
disillusionment because it becomes

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
disillusionment because it becomes
clearer<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.030> clearer<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> me<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.780> thought

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
clearer and clearer to me I I thought

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.630 
clearer and clearer to me I I thought
when<00:01:19.470> he<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.650> running<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.920> president<00:01:20.490> that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
all of the kind of purple post

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.789 
all of the kind of purple post
ideological<00:01:24.299> stuff<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.780> some<00:01:25.020> ways<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.560> just

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
ideological stuff in some ways was just

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.670 
ideological stuff in some ways was just
a<00:01:25.950> good<00:01:26.280> frame<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.689> clearly<00:01:27.990> he<00:01:28.290> really

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
a good frame but clearly he really

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.560 
a good frame but clearly he really
thought<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.369> he<00:01:29.490> got<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.119> he<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.450> going

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
thought when he got in that he was going

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.999 
thought when he got in that he was going
to<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.780> able<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.020> work<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> different<00:01:31.920> way

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to be able to work in a different way

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.249 
to be able to work in a different way
with<00:01:32.220> Republicans<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.329> bring<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> country

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
together and that is just so

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.410 
together and that is just so
relentlessly<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.950> case<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.939> thrown

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
relentlessly not the case and so thrown

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.209 
stana stagnation in that profile which
is<00:01:59.310> great<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:01.110> opposite<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.860> taking

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
is great but it's the opposite of taking

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.130 
is great but it's the opposite of taking
along<00:02:02.369> view<00:02:02.579> that's<00:02:02.790> clearly<00:02:03.180> an<00:02:03.450> area<00:02:03.840> where

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
along view that's clearly an area where

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.609 
along view that's clearly an area where
he<00:02:04.380> had<00:02:04.500> very<00:02:04.710> little<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.189> say<00:02:05.430> about<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
he had very little to say about it and

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
he had very little to say about it and
the<00:02:07.619> country's<00:02:08.220> moved<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.060> he's<00:02:09.239> responding

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the country's moved and he's responding

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.589 
the country's moved and he's responding
to<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.560> good<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:11.879> not<00:02:11.970> it's

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
to it which is good but it's not it's

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.850 
to it which is good but it's not it's
like<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.959> said<00:02:13.200> when<00:02:13.440> we're<00:02:13.560> talking

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
like you said when we're talking

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980 
like you said when we're talking
affairs<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.340> day<00:02:14.550> late<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.940> dollar<00:02:14.970> short<00:02:15.300> so

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
affairs a day late and a dollar short so

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.780 
affairs a day late and a dollar short so
you<00:02:16.050> can't<00:02:16.320> simultaneously<00:02:16.590> say<00:02:17.370> we're<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
you can't simultaneously say we're the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.090 
you can't simultaneously say we're the
ones<00:02:17.940> always<00:02:18.210> with<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> long<00:02:18.720> view<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.890> then

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
ones always with the long view and then

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.450 
ones always with the long view and then
jump<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.790> after<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> fact<00:02:21.720> look<00:02:22.460> you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
jump on that after the fact look you

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.170 
jump on that after the fact look you
know<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.650> reality<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:26.970> um<00:02:27.600> I

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
know the the reality is is that um I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.750 
know the the reality is is that um I
think<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.510> there<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.100> late<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
think that there is this is late in the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.120 
think that there is this is late in the
show<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.000> start<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:34.110> brightness<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.950> this

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
show to start this brightness of this

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.020 
show to start this brightness of this
conversation<00:02:35.520> frankly<00:02:36.330> um<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:38.280> let<00:02:38.790> let's

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
conversation frankly um so let let's

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.510 
conversation frankly um so let let's
maybe<00:02:39.270> get<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.020> tomorrow<00:02:40.230> uh<00:02:40.830> because<00:02:41.370> I

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
maybe get to it to tomorrow uh because I

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.930 
maybe get to it to tomorrow uh because I
think<00:02:41.640> look<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:43.520> when<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.640> think<00:02:44.850> about

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
think look the when you think about

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.010 
think look the when you think about
President<00:02:45.570> Obama's<00:02:45.990> legacy<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.840> don't

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.530 
years thousand years and 50 50 years 200
years<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.940> mean<00:02:57.750> uh<00:02:58.340> not<00:02:59.340> 25<00:02:59.850> years<00:03:00.180> certainly

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
years I mean uh not 25 years certainly

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.229 
years I mean uh not 25 years certainly
right<00:03:00.930> maybe<00:03:01.200> 50<00:03:01.650> years<00:03:01.890> maybe<00:03:02.160> 70<00:03:03.000> years

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
right maybe 50 years maybe 70 years

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.890 
right maybe 50 years maybe 70 years
maybe<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.600> hundred<00:03:03.780> years<00:03:04.230> um<00:03:05.450> much<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.720> is

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
maybe a hundred years um much of that is

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.530 
maybe a hundred years um much of that is
going<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.170> be<00:03:07.260> tied<00:03:07.500> up<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.340> context<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.239> in

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
going to be tied up in the context in in

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.410 
going to be tied up in the context in in
the<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.020> notion<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:11.670> he's

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
the in the notion that he's

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.590 
the in the notion that he's
african-american<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:14.480> um<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:17.660> creates<00:03:18.660> I

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
african-american and um that creates I

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.630 
african-american and um that creates I
think<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:22.049> reality<00:03:22.470> uh<00:03:24.320> certain<00:03:25.640> pressures

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
think in reality uh certain pressures

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.340 
think in reality uh certain pressures
upon<00:03:26.970> him<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:28.440> terms<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.610> his<00:03:29.820> legacy<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:31.110> are

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
upon him in terms of his legacy that are

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.800 
upon him in terms of his legacy that are
real<00:03:32.030> there<00:03:33.030> are<00:03:33.150> different<00:03:33.330> implications

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
real there are different implications

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.110 
real there are different implications
for<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:34.500> guy<00:03:34.709> because<00:03:35.610> he's<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.910> first

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
for this guy because he's the first

for this guy because he's the first
african-american<00:03:36.570> president<00:03:37.400> whatever<00:03:38.400> we

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
african-american president whatever we

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.170 
african-american president whatever we
want<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.940> think<00:03:39.060> about<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.269> on<00:03:39.690> top<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.470> it

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
want to think about that on top of it

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.860 
want to think about that on top of it
Joe<00:03:42.180> I'm<00:03:42.360> just<00:03:42.570> talking<00:03:42.870> about<00:03:42.959> as<00:03:44.180> as<00:03:45.180> just

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
Joe I'm just talking about as as just

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.890 
Joe I'm just talking about as as just
observers<00:03:46.910> okay<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.420> guessing<00:03:48.780> what

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
observers okay of just guessing what

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.680 
observers okay of just guessing what
potential<00:03:49.590> future<00:03:50.160> historians<00:03:50.519> will<00:03:50.940> feel

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
potential future historians will feel

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.240 
potential future historians will feel
I'm<00:03:51.900> night<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.380> don't<00:03:52.709> think<00:03:52.799> that's<00:03:53.130> a

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
I'm night I don't think that's a

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.350 
I'm night I don't think that's a
controversial<00:03:53.790> statement<00:03:54.390> at<00:03:54.510> all<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:56.360> imagine

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
controversial statement at all I imagine

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.220 
controversial statement at all I imagine
from<00:03:58.080> his<00:03:58.410> perspective<00:04:01.130> as<00:04:02.630> an<00:04:03.630> individual

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
from his perspective as an individual

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.440 
from his perspective as an individual
and<00:04:04.700> also<00:04:05.700> as<00:04:06.769> an<00:04:07.769> individual<00:04:08.610> who<00:04:09.030> has<00:04:09.209> led

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
and also as an individual who has led

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.569 
and also as an individual who has led
his<00:04:09.690> life<00:04:09.930> uh<00:04:10.579> as<00:04:12.049> you<00:04:13.049> know<00:04:13.579> experiencing

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
his life uh as you know experiencing

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.520 
his life uh as you know experiencing
what<00:04:14.910> an<00:04:15.060> african-american<00:04:15.510> experiences<00:04:16.440> in

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
what an african-american experiences in

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.640 
what an african-american experiences in
this<00:04:16.650> country<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.930> he<00:04:18.930> feels<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.350> even

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
this country that he feels that even

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.970 
this country that he feels that even
more<00:04:19.859> acutely<00:04:20.750> and

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.660 

I<00:04:27.920> think<00:04:28.920> that<00:04:29.010> in<00:04:29.880> some<00:04:29.940> ways<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:32.550> know

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
I think that in some ways you know

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.100 
I think that in some ways you know
constraints<00:04:33.300> him<00:04:33.390> I<00:04:33.480> mean<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> lot

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
constraints him I mean this is a lot

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.940 
constraints him I mean this is a lot
what<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.620> think<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:34.920> was<00:04:35.070> uh<00:04:35.750> uh<00:04:36.750> who<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.650> that

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
what I think it was uh uh who is that

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.890 
what I think it was uh uh who is that
Professor<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.520> wrote<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.120> book<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.600> we<00:04:39.690> had

Professor I wrote that book that we had
on<00:04:39.930> from<00:04:40.410> Harvard<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:40.860> can't<00:04:41.130> remember<00:04:41.310> his

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
on from Harvard I can't remember his

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.000 
on from Harvard I can't remember his
name<00:04:41.550> now<00:04:41.840> Randall<00:04:42.840> Kennedy<00:04:43.200> Randall<00:04:43.590> Kennedy

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
name now Randall Kennedy Randall Kennedy

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.770 
name now Randall Kennedy Randall Kennedy
I<00:04:44.160> think<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.520> was<00:04:44.640> his<00:04:44.790> argument<00:04:45.300> as<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.480> what

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
I think that was his argument as to what

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.150 
I think that was his argument as to what
constrained<00:04:46.200> him<00:04:46.380> from<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.710> governing

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
constrained him from a governing

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.810 
constrained him from a governing
standpoint<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.990> think<00:04:49.230> it<00:04:49.290> also<00:04:49.410> i<00:04:50.340> think

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
standpoint and I think it also i think

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.060 
standpoint and I think it also i think
it<00:04:51.150> constrains<00:04:51.480> him<00:04:51.780> from<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.560> legacy

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
it constrains him from a legacy

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.480 
it constrains him from a legacy
standpoint<00:04:55.100> I'm<00:04:56.100> not<00:04:56.220> justifying<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:57.090> uh<00:04:58.490> I

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
standpoint I'm not justifying it uh I

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.110 
standpoint I'm not justifying it uh I
think<00:05:00.120> that's<00:05:00.330> what's<00:05:00.570> operating<00:05:01.200> here<00:05:02.120> you

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
think that's what's operating here you

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:14.330 
think that's what's operating here you
know<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:06.590> he<00:05:08.690> felt<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:10.940> mandate<00:05:11.940> on<00:05:12.890> him<00:05:13.890> not

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
know that he felt a mandate on him not

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.520 
know that he felt a mandate on him not
necessarily<00:05:14.670> even<00:05:14.910> by<00:05:15.090> those<00:05:15.960> who<00:05:16.170> voted<00:05:16.380> for

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
necessarily even by those who voted for

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.850 
necessarily even by those who voted for
but<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.860> mandate<00:05:17.430> to<00:05:17.840> maintain<00:05:18.840> that<00:05:19.260> as<00:05:19.470> much

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
but a mandate to maintain that as much

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.300 
but a mandate to maintain that as much
as<00:05:19.890> possible<00:05:20.190> even<00:05:21.470> if<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.770> Republicans

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
as possible even if the Republicans

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.770 
as possible even if the Republicans
aren't<00:05:23.460> going<00:05:23.700> along<00:05:23.970> with<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.210> because<00:05:24.450> when

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
aren't going along with it because when

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.390 
aren't going along with it because when
you're<00:05:24.900> talking<00:05:25.350> 50<00:05:25.590> years<00:05:26.070> or<00:05:26.310> a<00:05:26.340> hundred

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
so I think 75 years we're gonna be so

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.110 
so I think 75 years we're gonna be so
far<00:06:42.440> beyond<00:06:43.070> this<00:06:43.370> in<00:06:43.550> terms<00:06:43.700> of<00:06:43.850> health<00:06:44.000> care

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
far beyond this in terms of health care

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.540 
far beyond this in terms of health care
that<00:06:44.900> will<00:06:45.320> know<00:06:45.590> that<00:06:45.770> this<00:06:45.980> is<00:06:46.190> the<00:06:46.340> turning

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
that will know that this is the turning

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.090 
that will know that this is the turning
point<00:06:47.000> when<00:06:47.630> you<00:06:47.870> got<00:06:48.110> the<00:06:48.350> first<00:06:48.680> guy<00:06:49.040> you

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
point when you got the first guy you

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.070 
point when you got the first guy you
could<00:06:49.490> not<00:06:49.670> hear<00:06:49.910> some<00:06:50.210> version<00:06:50.690> what
