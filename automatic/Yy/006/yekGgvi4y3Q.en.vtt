games and I pretty much love now one

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.510 
games and I pretty much love now one
thing<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.829> talk<00:01:29.130> about<00:01:29.280> in

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
thing that I do have to talk about in

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
thing that I do have to talk about in
this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.119> fact<00:01:30.329> about<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> crossbow<00:01:31.079> we

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
this is the fact about the crossbow we

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.429 
this is the fact about the crossbow we
haven't<00:01:31.860> seen<00:01:32.009> crossbows<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.700> Skyrim<00:01:33.380> now<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
haven't seen crossbows in Skyrim now the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.080 
haven't seen crossbows in Skyrim now the
idea<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.950> they're<00:01:35.250> bringing<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.640> back<00:01:35.790> in

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
idea is that they're bringing it back in

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.109 
idea is that they're bringing it back in
and<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> looks<00:01:37.320> pretty<00:01:37.619> awesome<00:01:37.970> we<00:01:38.970> also

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and that it looks pretty awesome we also

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.999 
and that it looks pretty awesome we also
see<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.720> an<00:01:39.840> aerial<00:01:40.320> view<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
see here kind of an aerial view of the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.480 
see here kind of an aerial view of the
flag<00:01:41.520> being<00:01:41.759> taken<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:43.110> also<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
flag being taken and we also so here the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
flag being taken and we also so here the
default<00:01:44.729> attack<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> destruction<00:01:45.930> staff

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
default attack for a destruction staff

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.200 
default attack for a destruction staff
we<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.460> isn't<00:01:47.729> an<00:01:47.970> ability

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
we do know that this isn't an ability

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.539 
we do know that this isn't an ability
because<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> staff<00:01:50.130> works

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
because of the way that the staff works

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.060 
because of the way that the staff works
kind<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.540> makes<00:01:51.750> sense<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.649> also<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
