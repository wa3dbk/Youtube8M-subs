Sheamus won the match by count-out so

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.650 
Sheamus won the match by count-out so
there<00:02:15.900> were<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.800> know<00:02:16.920> one<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:17.910> pretty

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
there were you know one in one so pretty

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.180 
there were you know one in one so pretty
much<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.900> draw<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.380> think<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.680> you'd<00:02:19.860> ended

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
much a draw and I think if you'd ended

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.980 
much a draw and I think if you'd ended
at<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.550> they<00:02:20.850> both<00:02:21.030> had<00:02:21.300> something<00:02:21.780> else<00:02:21.840> to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
at that they both had something else to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.520 
at that they both had something else to
do<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:24.330> know<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.450> think<00:02:24.600> Mark<00:02:24.959> Henry<00:02:25.350> being

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
do and you know I think Mark Henry being

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.559 
do and you know I think Mark Henry being
involved<00:02:25.890> with<00:02:26.250> Sheamus<00:02:26.850> he<00:02:27.209> could<00:02:27.360> take

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
involved with Sheamus he could take

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.090 
involved with Sheamus he could take
Sheamus<00:02:27.870> out<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.350> title<00:02:28.620> picture<00:02:28.740> so

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
Sheamus out of the title picture so

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.820 
Sheamus out of the title picture so
James<00:02:29.790> could<00:02:29.910> have<00:02:30.030> something<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.570> do<00:02:30.930> once

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
James could have something to do once

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.040 
James could have something to do once
let's<00:02:32.400> say<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.880> Big<00:02:33.090> Show<00:02:33.360> retains<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
let's say you know Big Show retains the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.240

they want big shots of champion they

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.380 
they want big shots of champion they
could<00:02:37.500> occupy<00:02:37.800> Sheamus<00:02:38.459> where<00:02:38.730> Mark<00:02:38.970> Henry

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
could occupy Sheamus where Mark Henry

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.570 
could occupy Sheamus where Mark Henry
and<00:02:39.420> Sarah<00:02:40.020> program<00:02:40.560> between<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:41.010> two<00:02:41.280> or

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
and Sarah program between the two or

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.460 
and Sarah program between the two or
even<00:02:42.360> better<00:02:42.959> Mark<00:02:43.770> Henry<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.580> Big<00:02:44.760> Show

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
even better Mark Henry and the Big Show

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.380 
even better Mark Henry and the Big Show
Big<00:02:46.470> Show<00:02:46.500> won<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> shape<00:02:47.550> chip<00:02:47.850> off<00:02:48.030> Mark

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
Big Show won the shape chip off Mark

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.640 
Big Show won the shape chip off Mark
Henry<00:02:48.810> at<00:02:48.989> CLC<00:02:49.680> last<00:02:50.520> year<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:52.200> wasn't<00:02:52.590> a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
Henry at CLC last year and it wasn't a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.490 
Henry at CLC last year and it wasn't a
Chairs<00:02:53.100> match<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.269> think<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.140> would<00:02:55.380> be

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
Chairs match so I think that would be

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.350 
Chairs match so I think that would be
the<00:02:55.620> perfect<00:02:55.800> return<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.790> know<00:02:56.910> why<00:02:57.150> not

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
the perfect return you know why not

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.229 
the perfect return you know why not
return<00:02:58.290> beat<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.190> guy<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.489> beats<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.970> well

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
return beat the guy that beats you well

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.690 
return beat the guy that beats you well
you<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.870> maybe<00:03:01.380> cos<00:03:01.709> him<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.980> match<00:03:02.130> up<00:03:02.459> or

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
you know maybe cos him to match up or

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.130 
you know maybe cos him to match up or
something<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.360> or<00:03:03.660> after<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.989> match

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
something like that or after the match

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.110 
something like that or after the match
no<00:03:04.530> after<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.950> match<00:03:05.100> since<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.910> know<00:03:06.000> if<00:03:06.060> he

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
no after the match since you know if he

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.640 
no after the match since you know if he
doesn't<00:03:06.450> get<00:03:06.660> involved<00:03:07.110> with<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> big<00:03:07.410> show

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
doesn't get involved with the big show

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.560 
doesn't get involved with the big show
then<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.400> means<00:03:08.610> Mark<00:03:08.940> Henry's<00:03:09.239> probably

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
then that means Mark Henry's probably

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.930 
then that means Mark Henry's probably
gonna<00:03:09.660> return<00:03:09.959> as<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> face<00:03:10.500> what<00:03:11.400> he<00:03:11.489> could<00:03:11.670> do

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
gonna return as a face what he could do

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.870 
gonna return as a face what he could do
is<00:03:12.180> after<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.260> match<00:03:13.380> shop<00:03:13.800> hit<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.670> world
