through my research on the internet it
has<00:00:36.480> been<00:00:36.870> determined<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.590> there<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.980> over

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
has been determined that there are over

has been determined that there are over
a<00:00:38.489> million<00:00:39.649> viruses<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.059> anti-malware<00:00:42.059> out

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
a million viruses and anti-malware out

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.709 
a million viruses and anti-malware out
there<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.250> Windows<00:00:44.250> based<00:00:44.520> systems<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.300> mean<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
there on Windows based systems I mean I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.200 
there on Windows based systems I mean I
you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.329> my<00:00:49.050> web<00:00:49.260> browser<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
you can see here in my web browser that

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.850 
you can see here in my web browser that
there<00:00:51.210> are<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> number<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.960> my<00:00:52.379> open<00:00:52.680> these<00:00:52.800> up

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
there are a number of my open these up

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.279 
there are a number of my open these up
in<00:00:53.190> different<00:00:53.340> pages<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.079> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
in different pages so that just that you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.770 
in different pages so that just that you
can<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.710> scope<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.760> how<00:00:57.030> many<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.570> these

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
can get a scope of how many of these

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.510 
can get a scope of how many of these
there<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:59.100> are<00:00:59.280> they're<00:01:00.500> listed

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
there really are they're listed

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.490 
there really are they're listed
numerically<00:01:02.600> alphabetically<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.260> mean

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
numerically alphabetically and I mean

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.109 
numerically alphabetically and I mean
there<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.510> many<00:01:08.330> viruses<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:11.119> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
there are just so many viruses and that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.580 
there are just so many viruses and that
was<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> main<00:01:12.840> reasons<00:01:13.290> why<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
was one of the main reasons why I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.910 
was one of the main reasons why I
switched<00:01:14.250> over<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.049> linux<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.770> got

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
switched over to linux was because I got

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.370 
switched over to linux was because I got
tired<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.369> my<00:01:17.549> machines<00:01:18.030> getting<00:01:18.930> infected

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
tired of my machines getting infected

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
tired of my machines getting infected
you<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.490> doesn't<00:01:20.820> matter<00:01:21.119> how<00:01:21.360> good<00:01:21.420> your

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you know it doesn't matter how good your

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.740 
you know it doesn't matter how good your
antivirus<00:01:22.200> system<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.610> Windows<00:01:24.420> they

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
antivirus system is on Windows they

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
antivirus system is on Windows they
still<00:01:25.170> manage<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.979> through<00:01:26.009> either

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
still manage to get through either

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.190

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
through java or other ways it's just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.880 
through java or other ways it's just
absolutely<00:01:31.799> malicious<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.970> way<00:01:33.150> these<00:01:34.020> virus

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
absolutely malicious the way these virus

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.289 
absolutely malicious the way these virus
makers<00:01:35.720> are<00:01:39.350> infiltrating<00:01:40.350> our<00:01:40.500> systems

another<00:01:42.320> interesting<00:01:43.320> thing<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.130> found

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
another interesting thing that I found

another interesting thing that I found
was<00:01:45.030> when<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.329> looked<00:01:45.689> at<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> number<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
was when I looked at the number of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.770 
was when I looked at the number of
viruses<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:47.430> linux<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.770> only<00:01:50.189> gone

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
viruses for linux it is only gone

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.100 
viruses for linux it is only gone

list of worms of here so not very many

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.479 
list of worms of here so not very many
viruses<00:02:13.900> but<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:14.560> doesn't<00:02:15.040> mean<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
viruses but that doesn't mean that

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.790 
viruses but that doesn't mean that

you're one hundred percent safe by using
Linux<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.550> still<00:02:18.880> want<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.300> use<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.930> antivirus

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
Linux you still want to use a antivirus
