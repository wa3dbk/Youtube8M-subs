00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.069
 now I'll show you what I 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.000
 use 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.410
 I do what I get for example that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.510
 we'll make the head of the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.840
 The doll is going to be 75 now. 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:25.320
 I get a 75 ball actually use 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.779
 two I cut it exactly in the middle and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.579
 Then I have a piece of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.760
 Barbecue and even glue well here 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.530
 center of it I'll show you how I 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.140
 It 's very simple. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.750
 I only use two balls because one 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.620
 I cut is exactly half 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.230
 the other I cut a little above the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.379
 half a half centimeter or so 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.120
 I do not know if you give so you can see through here 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.480
 centimeter above is half the ball 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.420
 What I'm going to do I 'm going to pick up now I 'm going 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.170
 catch the quota for having a little piece of heaven 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:11.729
 very big right? 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.670
 leto'll go hot glue you will 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:22.890
 see why I hear here put 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:25.590
 right in the middle of it right in the middle goes 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.420
 stay like that, I'll show you both now 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.890
 why are we going to use 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.579
 well that part that the port exactly 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.509
 half is the part that is the 'harbor here ' 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.100
 little face skin on the doll why 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:47.700
 I use this here to get a cut 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.119
 straight and very well done because they will not 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.539
 pick up the scissors in the hand that code and go 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.329
 come with the scissors lying down and there you go 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:02.219
 able to follow exactly the cut 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.670
 always opening scissors and 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.869
 closing without reaching the end of it 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:16.390
 sliding the scissors came until 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:18.140
 Open, come some more until you are 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.230
 to finish 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.250
 You'll see, you see, it's to stay. 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.620
 exactly the size here of styrofoam 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.370
 You'll notice that it suits you. 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.750
 Do not worry, do not stay there. 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.250
 too early to stay a little too 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.909
 this part that does not have problem because 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:42.829
 she will be underneath 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:46.879
 now the part of the hair that I use this 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.879
 ball that I cut a little more 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.489
 half a centimeter more than the 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:58.599
 same way that the law places here in the 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:01.640
 center that is so and I will cut 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:07.989
 referring to just the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.989
 her ball we're going to do here 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.819
 because at the time we ride to 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:22.920
 head, we're going to overlap the two 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:26.700
 parts gave the skin part will get one 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.769
 from the bottom of the court that will be 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.620
 the color of hair 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.049
 in my case what I'm doing with the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.090
 red we the first doll that 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.670
 We are going to learn, it's going to be your daughter. 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.440
 then if you stay a picote neighbors and 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.540
 only half of it will not go 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.750
 have so much trouble because the fringe of 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.359
 hair will sing but finally the question 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.659
 here was to show you how i do 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.519
 to cut these two parts 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.189
 so the ideal is that you how is that 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:03.480
 I will have national is the on the ball 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:06.209
 Mold styrofoam you spend a little 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.700
 half of the ball to be able to when 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.829
 use this part here she fit 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.680
 perfectly in here and you too 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.579
 used as a reference to cut well 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.979
 rating 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:21.660
 So I mark those balls usually I 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:24.419
 I put the number is 65 write and 75 e 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.199
 this one like 75 a little bit more and 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:31.010
 with 75 more to identify because 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.870
 Very bad memory, I can forget. 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.680
 if there is any other doll with the ball 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.630
 of the approximate size 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.690
 so here are our two 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.690
 parts of the head of the doll that we go 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.300
 do it now let's paste the first thing 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.490
 skin part necklace 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.990
 you will see that due to having used 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.870
 that half of the ball will stay 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.690
 exactly following the line 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.979
 partition that gives Styrofoam to 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.419
 paste it and see the director in styrofoam has 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.360
 to be the hot glue 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.639
 the glue will corrode your 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.570
 people will not take the pistol you can 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.240
 give rise here with a finger on the edge 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.900
 to pass a glue a little glue she does not die 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.759
 here when you press 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.080
 or in my case is that she is a 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.800
 A little lift I can 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.490
 simply put here and come passing 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:36.050
 What I do I come with a finger and hug 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:40.370
 here is the ball for the glue to snow 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.930
 better and that I was really wrong 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.620
 follow the shape of the ball and are 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:54.500
 It is as fair as possible to 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:56.110
 13 past little here to help 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.910
 necklace 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.030
 So you come with a finger like that and like 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:05.360
 I've been pulling it still 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.120
 has no money comes because then you also 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.500
 helps spread the hot glue a bit 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.690
 be careful with the finger that when people 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.330
 here the hot glue comes to the edge 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:18.550
 and sometimes it leaves a little bit of those that 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:24.490
 basic pitfalls inside of us then 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.490
 Coladinho our little doll face
