new about this it's the new lending leg

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.400 
new about this it's the new lending leg
so<00:00:30.310> maybe<00:00:30.490> you<00:00:30.580> can<00:00:30.759> see<00:00:30.970> it<00:00:31.090> here<00:00:31.360> it<00:00:32.230> will

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
so maybe you can see it here it will

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.310 
so maybe you can see it here it will
protect<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.890> motors<00:00:33.160> on<00:00:33.370> getting<00:00:33.610> damaged

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
protect the motors on getting damaged

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.080 
protect the motors on getting damaged
most<00:00:35.320> interesting<00:00:35.890> is<00:00:36.040> this<00:00:36.370> thing<00:00:36.640> can<00:00:36.820> flip

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
most interesting is this thing can flip

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.910 
most interesting is this thing can flip
so<00:00:37.420> that's<00:00:37.600> why<00:00:37.720> we<00:00:37.750> here<00:00:38.110> you<00:00:38.230> can<00:00:38.410> see<00:00:38.590> a<00:00:38.620> flip

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
so that's why we here you can see a flip

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.460 
so that's why we here you can see a flip
later<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.370> it's<00:00:40.030> a<00:00:40.180> 2.4<00:00:41.080> gigahertz

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
later on it's a 2.4 gigahertz

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.549 
later on it's a 2.4 gigahertz
transmitter<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.970> receiver<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:44.050> has<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.260> lot<00:00:44.530> of

transmitter and receiver it has a lot of

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.430 
transmitter and receiver it has a lot of
new<00:00:44.739> features<00:00:44.949> besides<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.820> 2.4<00:00:46.449> you<00:00:47.199> can

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
new features besides the 2.4 you can

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.860 
new features besides the 2.4 you can
select<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.220> flight<00:00:48.519> mode<00:00:48.790> directly<00:00:49.540> from<00:00:49.690> the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
select the flight mode directly from the

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.229 
select the flight mode directly from the
transmitter<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.710> what<00:00:51.160> this<00:00:51.309> also<00:00:51.550> has<00:00:51.910> it
