car for about a year now we purchased a

car for about a year now we purchased a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
one of roughly 2100 built we purchased

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.160 
one of roughly 2100 built we purchased
it<00:00:38.140> in<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.320> UK<00:00:38.650> it<00:00:38.890> was<00:00:39.040> set<00:00:39.339> up<00:00:39.370> as<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:40.210> very

exactly<00:00:46.720> what's<00:00:46.989> been<00:00:47.140> done<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.530> car<00:00:47.710> but

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
exactly what's been done to the car but

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.259 
exactly what's been done to the car but
suffice<00:00:49.030> it<00:00:49.089> to<00:00:49.269> say<00:00:49.390> it<00:00:49.839> still<00:00:50.229> maintains<00:00:50.650> a

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
suffice it to say it still maintains a

suffice it to say it still maintains a

four-wheel<00:00:55.750> disc<00:00:55.900> brakes<00:00:56.339> but<00:00:57.339> as<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.549> has

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
four-wheel disc brakes but as it has

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.009 
four-wheel disc brakes but as it has
been<00:00:57.909> which<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.239> actually<00:00:58.570> quite<00:00:58.750> rare

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
been which is actually quite rare

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.240 
been which is actually quite rare
because<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.350> lot<00:00:59.470> of<00:00:59.500> people<00:00:59.650> blew<00:00:59.949> up<00:01:00.100> their

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
because a lot of people blew up their

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.530 
because a lot of people blew up their
twin<00:01:00.460> cam<00:01:00.670> motors<00:01:00.939> when<00:01:01.059> they<00:01:01.150> raced<00:01:01.360> them

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
twin cam motors when they raced them

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.270 
twin cam motors when they raced them
definitely<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.379> fact<00:01:02.589> that<00:01:02.650> this<00:01:02.860> car<00:01:03.070> has

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
definitely so the fact that this car has

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.770 
definitely so the fact that this car has
a<00:01:03.309> twin<00:01:03.640> cam<00:01:03.670> motor<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.210> actually<00:01:04.330> pretty<00:01:04.689> rare

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
a twin cam motor is actually pretty rare

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.990 
a twin cam motor is actually pretty rare
the<00:01:04.960> twin<00:01:05.110> cam<00:01:05.140> I<00:01:05.320> have<00:01:06.000> unfortunately

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
the twin cam I have unfortunately

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.340 
the twin cam I have unfortunately
doesn't<00:01:07.119> have<00:01:07.360> its<00:01:07.509> twin<00:01:07.689> cam<00:01:07.869> motor<00:01:08.049> because

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
doesn't have its twin cam motor because

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.350 
doesn't have its twin cam motor because
in<00:01:08.470> period<00:01:08.799> it<00:01:08.890> was<00:01:08.950> blown<00:01:09.189> up<00:01:09.220> so<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.180> fact

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
in period it was blown up so the fact

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.490 
in period it was blown up so the fact
that<00:01:10.420> it's<00:01:10.600> got<00:01:10.720> this<00:01:10.930> engine<00:01:11.200> it's<00:01:11.320> pretty

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
that it's got this engine it's pretty

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.440 
that it's got this engine it's pretty
special<00:01:11.890> for<00:01:12.009> this<00:01:12.130> car<00:01:12.310> yeah<00:01:12.909> I<00:01:13.090> mean<00:01:13.299> it's

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
special for this car yeah I mean it's

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.569 
special for this car yeah I mean it's
the<00:01:14.259> cars<00:01:14.470> an<00:01:14.560> exciting<00:01:14.950> car<00:01:15.130> it's<00:01:15.280> not<00:01:15.340> just

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
the cars an exciting car it's not just

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.920 
the cars an exciting car it's not just
an<00:01:15.640> exciting<00:01:15.850> credit<00:01:16.270> drive<00:01:16.479> but<00:01:16.689> it's<00:01:16.810> an

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
an exciting credit drive but it's an

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.060 
an exciting credit drive but it's an
exciting<00:01:17.170> car<00:01:17.470> from<00:01:17.619> an<00:01:17.710> engineering

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
exciting car from an engineering

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.970 
exciting car from an engineering
perspective<00:01:18.280> because<00:01:19.530> Time<00:01:20.530> magazine

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
perspective because Time magazine

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.840 
perspective because Time magazine
actually<00:01:21.310> rated<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:22.170> mga<00:01:23.170> twin<00:01:23.680> cam<00:01:23.860> as<00:01:24.070> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
actually rated the mga twin cam as the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.980 
actually rated the mga twin cam as the
worst<00:01:25.240> car<00:01:25.659> of<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.409> 20th<00:01:26.770> century<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:28.780> only

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
worst car of the 20th century they only

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.590 
worst car of the 20th century they only
made<00:01:29.140> 20<00:01:29.320> 100<00:01:29.890> because<00:01:30.790> within<00:01:31.120> a<00:01:31.270> couple<00:01:31.540> of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
made 20 100 because within a couple of

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.210 
made 20 100 because within a couple of
years<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.990> think<00:01:32.170> probably<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.620> majority<00:01:32.770> of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
years I think probably the majority of

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.940 
years I think probably the majority of
those<00:01:33.340> cars<00:01:33.640> had<00:01:33.850> blown<00:01:34.060> their<00:01:34.270> motors<00:01:34.950> they

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
those cars had blown their motors they

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.240 
those cars had blown their motors they
were<00:01:37.200> they<00:01:38.200> didn't<00:01:38.409> quite<00:01:38.560> finish<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.979> design

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
were they didn't quite finish the design

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.649 
were they didn't quite finish the design
process<00:01:39.490> which<00:01:39.760> was<00:01:39.909> too<00:01:40.030> bad<00:01:40.210> because<00:01:40.450> it

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
process which was too bad because it

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.160 
process which was too bad because it
actually<00:01:40.930> started<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.290> 1955<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.360> ex1<00:01:43.810> 82

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
actually started in 1955 in the ex1 82

actually started in 1955 in the ex1 82
prototype<00:01:44.650> cars<00:01:44.890> they<00:01:45.070> started<00:01:45.520> they<00:01:45.729> knew

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
prototype cars they started they knew

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.250 
prototype cars they started they knew
they<00:01:46.000> wanted<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.299> go<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.540> twin<00:01:46.750> cam<00:01:46.780> engine

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
they wanted to go to a twin cam engine

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.830 
they wanted to go to a twin cam engine
and<00:01:47.440> for<00:01:48.430> whatever<00:01:48.580> reason<00:01:49.030> they<00:01:49.150> struggled

and for whatever reason they struggled

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.390 
and for whatever reason they struggled
they<00:01:49.960> tried<00:01:50.170> various<00:01:50.530> different<00:01:50.830> motors<00:01:51.159> and

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
they tried various different motors and

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.930 
they tried various different motors and
and<00:01:51.670> nothing<00:01:52.680> nothing<00:01:53.680> quite<00:01:53.920> stuck<00:01:54.310> what<00:01:54.820> we

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
and nothing nothing quite stuck what we

take a closer look at the car you'll see

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.690 
take a closer look at the car you'll see
what<00:02:10.330> they<00:02:10.840> were<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.290> close<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:12.250> accomplishing

what they were so close to accomplishing

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.119 
what they were so close to accomplishing
in<00:02:12.909> period<00:02:13.239> which<00:02:14.140> would<00:02:14.319> have<00:02:14.409> been<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.830> think

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
in period which would have been I think

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.880 
in period which would have been I think
a<00:02:15.189> veritable<00:02:15.489> dragon<00:02:16.060> slayer<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:17.379> track<00:02:17.650> I

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
a veritable dragon slayer on the track I

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.450 
a veritable dragon slayer on the track I
mean<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.430> car<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.849> nuts<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:21.269> little<00:02:22.269> scary

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
mean the car is nuts I little scary

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.120 
mean the car is nuts I little scary
it's<00:02:25.460> far<00:02:25.940> faster<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.450> think<00:02:26.540> than<00:02:26.900> any<00:02:27.130> mga

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
it's far faster I think than any mga

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.020 
it's far faster I think than any mga
I've<00:02:28.340> ever<00:02:28.520> driven

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
I've ever driven

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.910 
I've ever driven
including<00:02:29.510> microscope<00:02:30.050> which<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.380> absolutely

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
including microscope which is absolutely

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.300 
including microscope which is absolutely
of<00:02:31.640> course<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.120> quickest<00:02:32.420> mga<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.950> know<00:02:34.010> he

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
of course the quickest mga you know he

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.580 
of course the quickest mga you know he
can<00:02:34.459> think<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.819> all<00:02:34.940> he<00:02:34.970> wants<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:39.200> may<00:02:39.380> have

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
can think that all he wants we may have

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.750 
can think that all he wants we may have
the<00:02:39.740> car<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.310> track<00:02:40.490> at<00:02:41.000> Fall<00:02:41.390> Festival<00:02:41.720> so

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
the car on the track at Fall Festival so

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.340 
the car on the track at Fall Festival so
stay<00:02:43.760> tuned<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.180> think<00:02:44.390> for<00:02:44.630> for<00:02:45.020> that

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
stay tuned I think for for that

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.840 
stay tuned I think for for that
performance<00:02:45.680> angle<00:02:46.220> we'll<00:02:46.430> find<00:02:46.640> out<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
performance angle we'll find out the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.650 
performance angle we'll find out the
answer<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.180> question<00:02:47.510> then<00:02:49.510> again<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.540> don't

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
answer that question then again I don't

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.330 
answer that question then again I don't
want<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.870> get<00:02:51.020> too<00:02:51.170> too<00:02:51.500> into<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.830> mechanicals

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
want to get too too into the mechanicals

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.210 
want to get too too into the mechanicals
of<00:02:52.459> it<00:02:52.610> but<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.959> car<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.230> doing<00:02:54.319> close<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.800> 200

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220

our race cars you could not drive on the
road<00:03:38.240> I<00:03:38.810> mean<00:03:39.260> even<00:03:39.910> even<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.030> is<00:03:41.210> borderline

road I mean even even this is borderline
but<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.290> mean<00:03:42.530> it's

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.710 

that's<00:03:45.980> as<00:03:46.130> wild<00:03:46.550> and<00:03:46.700> crazy'<00:03:46.910> minor<00:03:47.420> drug

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
that's as wild and crazy' minor drug

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.500 
that's as wild and crazy' minor drug
targeting<00:03:48.490> even<00:03:49.490> in<00:03:49.580> period<00:03:49.970> as<00:03:50.090> race<00:03:50.270> cars

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
targeting even in period as race cars

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.600 
targeting even in period as race cars
the<00:03:50.660> twin<00:03:50.900> cams<00:03:51.140> were<00:03:51.440> an<00:03:51.770> advantage<00:03:52.310> over<00:03:52.460> the

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
the twin cams were an advantage over the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.860 
the twin cams were an advantage over the
pushrod<00:03:53.060> cars<00:03:53.390> because<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.020> twin

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
pushrod cars because the twin

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.839 
pushrod cars because the twin
whereas<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.560> person<00:03:56.680> pushrods<00:03:57.250> have<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:57.700> many

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
whereas the person pushrods have so many

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.850 
whereas the person pushrods have so many
mechanical<00:03:58.450> pieces<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.989> move<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.470> twink<00:03:59.709> am

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
sitting at the top of the engine allow

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.850 
sitting at the top of the engine allow
faster<00:04:03.250> revving<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.849> higher<00:04:04.060> revving<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:05.380> you

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
faster revving and higher revving so you

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.900 
faster revving and higher revving so you
know<00:04:05.950> when<00:04:06.069> you're<00:04:06.160> on<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> racetrack<00:04:06.520> the

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:34.770 

it's<00:04:27.610> well<00:04:27.819> setup<00:04:28.150> from<00:04:28.479> what<00:04:28.599> it<00:04:28.719> does
