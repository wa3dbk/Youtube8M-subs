00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.830
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.140
 grate the cheese easy and fast 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.140
 using the magic bullet 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.210
 this is the ranch cheese is dry cheese 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.340
 I always light this cheese to make 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.320
 the toasts the flutes or any 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.360
 food that carries grated cheese 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.559
 I prefer to grate the cheese than buy it 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.510
 grated 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.670
 now like I just bought the magic 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.470
 google and it is and it says that it serves to 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.350
 so we'll try to see if it's 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.989
 true let's cut a piece and this 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.980
 we are going to put it 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.980

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.789
 i 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.289
 but I always beam them with the grater 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.570
 but now that I have the corn bullet 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.300
 when I'm going to make this quick and easy 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.739
 it is magically the only thing that we are going to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.480
 to do is that we are going to put the pieces 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.030

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.820

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.820
 very well let's say for the very late 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.890
 serious what happened to me at the beginning that if 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.740
 I put my arms really big I got very 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.720
 full and did not want to grate but be 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.180
 then we put small pieces and not what 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.920
 I am going to put very full what we are going to 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.580
 do is we're going to put the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.580

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.210
 Y 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.650
 one 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.340
 two 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.340
 but 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.229
 and that's how easy and fast we have the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.939
 grated cheese there I just loved it 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.430

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.280
 delighted with this gadget now no longer 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.159
 battled the ball fast and easy and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.100
 that now I have enough grated cheese 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.549
 and so quickly look after this I think 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.520
 these if they are as about 350 grams 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:14.300
 cheese more or less and I did it in five 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.160
 seconds five or six seconds maximum and 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.440
 this is the easy and quick way as 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.390
 grate the cheese I hope that I have 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.739
