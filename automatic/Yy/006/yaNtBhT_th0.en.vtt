okay<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.610> how<00:00:02.760> he<00:00:02.820> did<00:00:03.060> it

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:03.830 
okay this is how he did it

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.240 
okay this is how he did it
when<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.950> thermostat<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.819> quad<00:00:06.299> ah<00:00:07.250> now

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
when the thermostat in the quad ah now

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.430 
when the thermostat in the quad ah now
that<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:08.550> all<00:00:08.700> done<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.360> can<00:00:10.019> just<00:00:10.050> show<00:00:10.380> you

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
that it's all done I can just show you

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.160 
that it's all done I can just show you
what<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.679> did<00:00:11.360> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.660> thermostat

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
what I did this is the thermostat

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.359 
what I did this is the thermostat
housing<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.740> here<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:15.770> you<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:17.039> drill<00:00:17.250> in

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
housing in here and you just drill in

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.269 
housing in here and you just drill in
top<00:00:17.580> straight<00:00:18.000> into<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:19.410> side<00:00:19.680> section<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
top straight into the side section and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950 
top straight into the side section and
it<00:00:20.340> actually<00:00:20.670> looks<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.119> they're<00:00:21.510> supposed

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
it actually looks like they're supposed

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.200 
it actually looks like they're supposed
to<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> unit<00:00:22.740> sticking<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.490> there<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:23.970> it's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
to be a unit sticking in there so it's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.150 
to be a unit sticking in there so it's
actually<00:00:24.359> pretty<00:00:24.630> easy

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
actually pretty easy

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.820 
actually pretty easy
I<00:00:26.189> had<00:00:26.699> dissembled<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.410> order<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
I had dissembled all of this in order to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.450 
I had dissembled all of this in order to
do<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> bench<00:00:29.550> make<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.500> easier<00:00:31.500> trust<00:00:32.279> me

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
do it on a bench make it easier trust me

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.920 
do it on a bench make it easier trust me
it'll<00:00:32.640> probably<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:33.120> easier<00:00:35.660> now<00:00:36.660> this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
it'll probably be easier now this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.900 
it'll probably be easier now this
particular<00:00:37.230> unit<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> power<00:00:38.160> fist<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.760> has<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
particular unit is a power fist it has a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.930 
particular unit is a power fist it has a
whole<00:00:39.270> bunch<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.719> wires<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.700> off<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
whole bunch of wires to it off the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.080 
whole bunch of wires to it off the
center<00:00:42.239> unit<00:00:42.420> itself<00:00:43.160> it's<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> ground<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
center unit itself it's got a ground and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.650 
center unit itself it's got a ground and
I<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.719> ground<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.610> this<00:00:47.610> bolt<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.239> on

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I just ground to this bolt here on on

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.220 
I just ground to this bolt here on on
the<00:00:48.840> shifting<00:00:49.260> unit<00:00:50.719> there<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.750> already

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the shifting unit there is already

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.189 
the shifting unit there is already
another<00:00:52.579> another<00:00:53.579> ground<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:55.079> begin

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
another another ground there to begin

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.430 
another another ground there to begin
with<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.770> made<00:00:56.160> things<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.610> little<00:00:56.850> easy

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
with so that made things a little easy

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.539 
with so that made things a little easy
the<00:00:58.440> power<00:00:59.780> are<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.989> connects<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.620 

the<00:01:05.549> gauge<00:01:05.760> itself<00:01:06.290> which<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.470> melted<00:01:08.630> you'll

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the gauge itself which I melted you'll

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.770 
the gauge itself which I melted you'll
see<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> second<00:01:11.119> no<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> other

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
see in a second no that's for the other

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.550 
see in a second no that's for the other
wires<00:01:13.729> yes<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.939> used<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.270> lot<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.570> wire<00:01:18.560> there's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
wires yes I used a lot of wire there's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.450 
wires yes I used a lot of wire there's
an<00:01:20.009> backlight<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.090> an<00:01:21.540> accessory<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.619> just

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
an backlight and an accessory on I just

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.679 
an backlight and an accessory on I just
tied<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.729> into<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:25.229> headlight<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.490> on

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
tied it into the headlight that is on

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.300 
tied it into the headlight that is on
with<00:01:27.689> high<00:01:27.960> beams<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.439> low<00:01:28.500> beams<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.189> when

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
with high beams and low beams so when

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
with high beams and low beams so when
you<00:01:29.400> turn<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.759> lights<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.780> back<00:01:30.960> light

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you turn on your lights the back light

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.140 
you turn on your lights the back light
comes<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.850> it's<00:01:32.850> actually<00:01:33.000> pretty<00:01:33.329> cool<00:01:35.150> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
comes on it's actually pretty cool the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.350 
comes on it's actually pretty cool the
power<00:01:36.390> itself<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:38.310> ground<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.180> tied

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
power itself and the ground I just tied

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.109 
power itself and the ground I just tied
into<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.780> accessories<00:01:40.460> power<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.759> ground

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
into the accessories power and ground

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.940 
into the accessories power and ground
there's<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> accessory<00:01:43.049> plug<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
there's the accessory plug in there I

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.200 
there's the accessory plug in there I
just<00:01:44.909> come<00:01:45.090> around<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.549> tied<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:47.729> wires<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
just come around and tied my wires to it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
just come around and tied my wires to it
I<00:01:48.360> use<00:01:48.540> bullet<00:01:48.930> clips<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.320> everything<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.799> try

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
I use bullet clips for everything to try

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.230 
I use bullet clips for everything to try
and<00:01:50.009> keep<00:01:50.220> everything<00:01:50.520> fairly<00:01:51.030> clean<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:54.000> I'd

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and keep everything fairly clean and I'd

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.679 
and keep everything fairly clean and I'd
do<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.390> again<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.899> way<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.320> had<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
do it again that way if I had to and

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.620 
do it again that way if I had to and
then<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> other<00:01:57.930> wire<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.409> that

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
then the other wire to that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.980 
then the other wire to that
thermostat<00:02:00.500> itself

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
thermostat itself

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.149 
thermostat itself
as<00:02:02.470> for<00:02:02.920> where<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.280> mounted<00:02:03.909> it<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:05.040> mounted<00:02:06.040> it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
as for where I mounted it I mounted it

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.540 
as for where I mounted it I mounted it
right<00:02:06.399> into<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.820> pocket<00:02:07.270> area<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:09.369> mesh

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
right into the pocket area the mesh

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.390 
right into the pocket area the mesh
pocket<00:02:10.030> actually<00:02:10.209> comes<00:02:10.599> up<00:02:10.810> just<00:02:11.099> below<00:02:12.099> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
pocket actually comes up just below the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.510 
pocket actually comes up just below the
gauge<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.290> works<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:14.590> pretty<00:02:14.830> good<00:02:14.890> that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
gauge so it works so pretty good that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.280 
gauge so it works so pretty good that
way<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.270> put<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.720> piece<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:16.989> foam

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
way I just put a piece of foam

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.229 
way I just put a piece of foam
underneath<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.730> keep<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.090> little

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
underneath that just to keep it a little

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.330 
underneath that just to keep it a little
more<00:02:19.390> secure<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:20.860> not<00:02:20.980> going<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.250> move

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
more secure so it's not going to move

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.850 
more secure so it's not going to move
around<00:02:21.519> or<00:02:21.880> anything<00:02:22.680> eventually<00:02:23.680> what<00:02:23.830> I

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
around or anything eventually what I

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.479 
around or anything eventually what I
planning<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.489> do<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:25.980> machining<00:02:26.980> up<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.280> little

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
planning to do is machining up a little

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.900 
planning to do is machining up a little
aluminum<00:02:28.080> cap<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.380> fit<00:02:29.560> right<00:02:30.040> over<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:30.459> unit

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
aluminum cap to fit right over this unit

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.289 
aluminum cap to fit right over this unit
so<00:02:31.209> when<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.930> wheels<00:02:32.640> spin<00:02:33.640> up<00:02:33.790> rocks<00:02:34.060> and

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
so when the wheels spin up rocks and

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.320 
so when the wheels spin up rocks and
such<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:36.340> not<00:02:36.489> going<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.700> damage<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.209> unit

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
such it's not going to damage the unit

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.259 
such it's not going to damage the unit
itself<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.610> that's<00:02:39.610> going<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:39.880> be<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.060> couple

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
itself but that's going to be a couple

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.170 
itself but that's going to be a couple
weeks<00:02:40.540> down<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.900> road<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.819> yeah<00:02:42.819> that's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
weeks down the road and yeah that's

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.850 
weeks down the road and yeah that's
pretty<00:02:43.660> much<00:02:44.140> all<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.680> did<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.870> when<00:02:47.769> you
