dreamt it up in that in the period
between<00:00:09.660> them<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.769> already<00:00:10.980> think<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.370> is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
between them and I already think this is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.860 
between them and I already think this is
going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.610> be<00:00:11.700> one<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> our<00:00:12.120> best<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.719> most

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
going to be one of our best and most

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.720 
going to be one of our best and most

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
very true we did start with the vehicle

very true we did start with the vehicle
go<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.469> went<00:00:55.620> through<00:00:55.829> many<00:00:56.160> iterations

go and we went through many iterations
of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> design<00:00:57.680> because<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.859> only<00:00:58.890> does<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
of the design because not only does that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.450 
of the design because not only does that
look<00:00:59.550> good<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.390> has<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> work<00:01:01.460> naturally

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
look good it has to work naturally

that<00:01:09.000> film<00:01:09.360> would<00:01:10.350> work<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.580> bolted

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that film would work so we bolted

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.780 
that film would work so we bolted
together<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.270> prototype<00:01:13.220> put<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> back<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
together a prototype put on the back and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.249 
together a prototype put on the back and
pick<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.299> dro

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
pick up some dro

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.480 
pick up some dro
Courtney<00:01:17.259> live<00:01:17.409> like<00:01:17.680> that<00:01:19.229> story<00:01:20.229> right<00:01:20.950> okay

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
Courtney live like that story right okay

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.789 
Courtney live like that story right okay
so<00:01:21.850> they've<00:01:22.570> both<00:01:22.899> been<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.170> other<00:01:23.350> prototype

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
so they've both been the other prototype

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.990 
so they've both been the other prototype
and<00:01:23.979> put<00:01:24.159> them<00:01:24.250> truck<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.610> then<00:01:24.700> they<00:01:24.820> made

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
and put them truck and then they made

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
and put them truck and then they made
you<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.479> write<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.810> like<00:01:25.840> first<00:01:28.110> Pacific

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
anyway once that ended happily we move

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.940 
anyway once that ended happily we move
on<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.210> next<00:01:37.270> step<00:01:37.659> is<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:38.079> utilize<00:01:38.590> our

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
on to the next step is to utilize our

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.730 
on to the next step is to utilize our
powerful<00:01:39.280> previous<00:01:39.789> tools<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.780> much<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.590> we
