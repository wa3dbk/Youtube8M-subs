but<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> battery<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.860> old<00:01:20.190> so<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.610> doesn't

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
but the battery is old so it doesn't

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.490 
but the battery is old so it doesn't
hold<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:21.060> charge<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.600> long<00:01:21.810> time<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.409> I've

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
hold a charge for a long time so I've

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
hold a charge for a long time so I've
got<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> kind<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> constantly<00:01:23.940> watch<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
got a kind of constantly watch and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.030 
got a kind of constantly watch and
unfortunately<00:01:25.260> I<00:01:25.290> missed<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.799> bit<00:01:25.920> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
unfortunately I missed a little bit of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.740 
unfortunately I missed a little bit of
footage<00:01:26.930> just<00:01:27.930> wasn't<00:01:28.440> recording<00:01:28.980> but<00:01:29.340> I

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
footage just wasn't recording but I

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.060 
footage just wasn't recording but I
think<00:01:30.750> I've<00:01:30.900> been<00:01:30.990> able<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.230> explain<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> show

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
think I've been able to explain it show

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.020 
think I've been able to explain it show
it<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:34.080> should<00:01:34.440> be<00:01:34.710> clear<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.430> let's<00:01:35.880> take

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
it and it should be clear so let's take

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.060 
it and it should be clear so let's take
a<00:01:36.060> look<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.330> that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070

so<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.230> can<00:02:30.290> see<00:02:30.500> right<00:02:30.650> here<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.790> ball

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
so you can see right here that the ball

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.550 
so you can see right here that the ball
bearing<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.299> sitting<00:02:32.569> down<00:02:32.720> into<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:33.200> little

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
bearing is sitting down into that little

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.220 
bearing is sitting down into that little
hole<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.480> I'll<00:02:35.480> push<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.780> down<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:35.989> little<00:02:36.110> bit

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
hole and I'll push it down a little bit

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.190 
hole and I'll push it down a little bit
more<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:37.130> perfect<00:02:37.670> okay<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.630> lost

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
more but is just perfect okay so I lost

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.930 
more but is just perfect okay so I lost
the<00:02:39.410> footage<00:02:39.530> my<00:02:39.829> camera<00:02:40.190> battery<00:02:40.700> ran<00:02:40.910> out

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the footage my camera battery ran out

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.970 
the footage my camera battery ran out
but<00:02:41.329> tried<00:02:42.019> to<00:02:42.110> get<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.260> close<00:02:42.500> up<00:02:42.680> here<00:02:42.709> and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
but tried to get a close up here and

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.309 
but tried to get a close up here and
show<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.370> little<00:02:43.640> bit<00:02:43.760> what<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:43.940> did<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:45.170> can

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
show you a little bit what I did you can

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.380 
show you a little bit what I did you can
see<00:02:45.440> those<00:02:45.620> four<00:02:45.950> little<00:02:46.220> holes<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.120> used<00:02:47.299> a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
see those four little holes I used a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.970 
see those four little holes I used a
very<00:02:47.569> sharp<00:02:48.880> punch<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.440> punch<00:02:51.440> little<00:02:51.799> hole

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
very sharp punch and punch little hole

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.270 
very sharp punch and punch little hole
so<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.400> squeezes<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.329> titanium<00:02:54.230> over<00:02:54.859> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
so it squeezes the titanium over the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.039 
so it squeezes the titanium over the
ball<00:02:55.489> bearing<00:02:55.910> much<00:02:56.120> like<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.600> would<00:02:56.750> set<00:02:57.019> a

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
ball bearing much like you would set a

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.479 
ball bearing much like you would set a
stone<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.709> ring<00:02:57.889> and<00:02:59.620> what<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.799> does<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.280> it

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
stone in a ring and what that does is it

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.960 
stone in a ring and what that does is it
just<00:03:01.519> lifts<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.389> titanium<00:03:03.109> over<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:04.670> ball

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
just lifts the titanium over the ball

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.319 
just lifts the titanium over the ball
and<00:03:05.329> holds<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:05.930> there<00:03:06.109> very<00:03:06.319> securely<00:03:07.329> so

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
and holds it in there very securely so

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.879 
and holds it in there very securely so
the<00:03:08.450> next<00:03:08.630> step<00:03:08.810> then<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:09.109> I<00:03:09.139> just<00:03:09.350> assemble

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
the next step then is I just assemble

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.789 
the next step then is I just assemble
the<00:03:09.950> knife<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.900> d-10<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.380> pressing

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
the knife and the d-10 is pressing

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.860 
the knife and the d-10 is pressing
against<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.250> blade<00:03:13.519> right<00:03:13.880> now<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.359> so<00:03:14.780> I'm

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
against the blade right now and so I'm

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.750 
against the blade right now and so I'm
going<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.079> open<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.590> close<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.829> blade<00:03:16.220> open

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
going to open and close the blade open

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.550 
going to open and close the blade open
and<00:03:16.880> close<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.239> blade<00:03:17.389> several<00:03:17.870> times<00:03:18.139> make

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
and close the blade several times make

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.920 
and close the blade several times make
sure<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.040> closes<00:03:19.250> completely<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.269> what

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
sure that it closes completely and what

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.780 
sure that it closes completely and what
this<00:03:21.079> is<00:03:21.230> going<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.470> do<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.160> d-10<00:03:22.579> is

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
this is going to do is the d-10 is

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.940 
this is going to do is the d-10 is
actually<00:03:23.269> going<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.510> scratch<00:03:23.930> into<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.590> steel

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
actually going to scratch into the steel

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.530 
actually going to scratch into the steel
because<00:03:25.519> it's<00:03:26.180> not<00:03:26.420> heat<00:03:26.720> treated<00:03:27.109> yet<00:03:27.489> and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
because it's not heat treated yet and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.490 
because it's not heat treated yet and
that's<00:03:29.540> going<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.750> give<00:03:29.930> me<00:03:30.079> a<00:03:30.109> little<00:03:30.319> bit<00:03:30.440> of

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
that's going to give me a little bit of

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.610 
that's going to give me a little bit of
a<00:03:30.560> track<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:31.220> show<00:03:31.250> how<00:03:31.940> about<00:03:32.239> how<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.019> detent

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
a track to show how about how the detent

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.460 
a track to show how about how the detent
runs<00:03:34.250> along<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.730> blade<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:35.239> then<00:03:36.139> I<00:03:36.260> can

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
runs along the blade and then I can

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.190 
runs along the blade and then I can
drill<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.769> hole<00:03:37.099> a<00:03:37.430> detent<00:03:38.180> hole<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.079> blade

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
drill a hole a detent hole in the blade

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.000 
drill a hole a detent hole in the blade
to<00:03:39.500> hold<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.859> closed<00:03:41.470> when<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.500> liner<00:03:42.889> is

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
to hold it closed when the liner is

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.319 
to hold it closed when the liner is
closed<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:44.290> one<00:03:45.290> more<00:03:45.440> quick<00:03:45.620> thing<00:03:45.650> -<00:03:46.329> I'm

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
closed so one more quick thing - I'm

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.469 
closed so one more quick thing - I'm
going<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.630> scrape<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.019> little<00:03:48.949> bit<00:03:49.190> out<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.180> the

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:50.479 
going to scrape a little bit out of the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.330 
going to scrape a little bit out of the
g10<00:03:50.930> right<00:03:51.259> here

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
g10 right here

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.130 
g10 right here
and<00:03:52.430> that's<00:03:52.730> gonna<00:03:52.970> make<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:53.690> the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
and that's gonna make it so that the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.470 
and that's gonna make it so that the
liner-lock<00:03:54.560> will<00:03:55.099> recess<00:03:55.700> in<00:03:55.940> there<00:03:56.239> a<00:03:56.269> little

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
liner-lock will recess in there a little

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.460 
liner-lock will recess in there a little
bit<00:03:57.910> so<00:03:58.910> here's<00:03:59.540> what<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.810> blade<00:03:59.989> looks<00:04:00.230> like

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
bit so here's what the blade looks like

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.290 
bit so here's what the blade looks like
and<00:04:00.739> you<00:04:00.830> can<00:04:00.950> see<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.340> track<00:04:01.640> going<00:04:02.060> along

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
and you can see the track going along

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.140 
and you can see the track going along
there<00:04:02.599> and<00:04:03.040> I'm<00:04:04.040> gonna<00:04:04.340> come<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.849> where<00:04:05.000> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
there and I'm gonna come to where the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.530 
there and I'm gonna come to where the
track<00:04:05.390> ends<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.319> then<00:04:06.650> just<00:04:07.010> go<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.700> couple

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
track ends and then just go a couple

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.020 
track ends and then just go a couple
thousands<00:04:09.530> maybe<00:04:09.709> one<00:04:10.040> thousandth<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.879> an

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
thousands maybe one thousandth of an

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.729 
thousands maybe one thousandth of an
inch<00:04:11.150> two<00:04:11.480> thousand<00:04:11.870> seven<00:04:12.110> inch<00:04:12.260> above<00:04:12.530> it

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
inch two thousand seven inch above it

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.069 
inch two thousand seven inch above it
and<00:04:12.910> then<00:04:13.910> drill<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.299> hole<00:04:14.569> like<00:04:14.840> that

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
and then drill a hole like that

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.909 
and then drill a hole like that
so<00:04:18.079> this<00:04:18.229> is<00:04:18.410> where<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.680> need<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:18.949> be<00:04:19.010> careful

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
so this is where you need to be careful

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.670 
so this is where you need to be careful
if<00:04:21.919> you<00:04:22.280> can<00:04:22.639> see<00:04:22.970> hopefully<00:04:23.479> it<00:04:23.810> it<00:04:24.260> can<00:04:24.470> pick

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
if you can see hopefully it it can pick

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.270 
if you can see hopefully it it can pick
it<00:04:24.830> up<00:04:24.950> if<00:04:25.700> I<00:04:25.790> can<00:04:25.850> get<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.090> angle<00:04:26.210> right

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
it up if I can get the angle right

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.520 
it up if I can get the angle right
that's<00:04:28.280> not<00:04:28.430> too<00:04:29.180> bad<00:04:29.360> but<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:30.610> can<00:04:31.610> see<00:04:31.910> the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
that's not too bad but you can see the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.280 
that's not too bad but you can see the
track<00:04:33.530> here<00:04:34.010> that<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.030> detent<00:04:35.450> ball<00:04:35.540> made<00:04:35.990> and

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
track here that the detent ball made and

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.890 
track here that the detent ball made and
then<00:04:37.160> um<00:04:38.350> what<00:04:39.350> I'm<00:04:39.500> doing<00:04:39.950> what<00:04:40.700> I<00:04:40.760> did<00:04:40.880> is<00:04:41.270> I

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
then um what I'm doing what I did is I

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.219 
then um what I'm doing what I did is I
just<00:04:42.110> went<00:04:42.710> beyond<00:04:43.300> where<00:04:44.300> this<00:04:44.479> ended<00:04:44.990> and

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
just went beyond where this ended and

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.330 
just went beyond where this ended and
drilled<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.889> 1/16<00:04:46.610> inch<00:04:46.820> hole<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.950> trouble

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
drilled a 1/16 inch hole and the trouble

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.920 
drilled a 1/16 inch hole and the trouble
with<00:04:49.460> these<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:50.030> it<00:04:50.270> can<00:04:50.479> be<00:04:50.570> so<00:04:50.780> frustrating

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
with these and it can be so frustrating

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.080 
with these and it can be so frustrating
I<00:04:51.380> made<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.560> lot<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.770> mistakes<00:04:51.919> I'm<00:04:52.729> making

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
I made a lot of mistakes I'm making

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.270 
I made a lot of mistakes I'm making
these<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.660> end<00:04:53.900> up<00:04:54.440> making<00:04:54.470> another<00:04:54.979> blade

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
these and end up making another blade

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.460 
these and end up making another blade
but<00:04:55.669> you<00:04:55.910> can<00:04:56.090> if<00:04:56.330> you<00:04:56.479> if<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.930> drill<00:04:57.229> the

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
but you can if you if you drill the

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.779 
but you can if you if you drill the
detent<00:04:58.070> hole<00:04:58.720> too<00:04:59.720> far<00:05:00.020> down<00:05:00.979> this<00:05:01.820> way<00:05:02.680> um<00:05:03.789> the

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
detent hole too far down this way um the

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.690 
detent hole too far down this way um the
knife<00:05:04.970> can<00:05:05.180> close<00:05:05.600> and<00:05:06.110> then<00:05:06.979> when<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.550> hits

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
knife can close and then when it hits

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.270 
knife can close and then when it hits
the<00:05:07.970> detent<00:05:08.450> you<00:05:09.169> can<00:05:09.320> actually<00:05:09.500> push<00:05:09.919> it<00:05:10.099> down

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
the detent you can actually push it down

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.040 
the detent you can actually push it down
a<00:05:10.310> little<00:05:10.610> bit<00:05:10.849> and<00:05:11.060> stuff<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:11.539> it's<00:05:12.020> just

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
a little bit and stuff and it's just

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.900 
a little bit and stuff and it's just
it's<00:05:12.470> just<00:05:12.740> not<00:05:12.889> right<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.400> doesn't<00:05:13.550> it

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
it's just not right it doesn't it

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.480 
it's just not right it doesn't it
doesn't<00:05:14.150> hold<00:05:14.330> right<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:16.039> that<00:05:16.070> you

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
doesn't hold right and so that that you

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.290 
doesn't hold right and so that that you
have<00:05:16.610> to<00:05:16.760> finesse<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.360> a<00:05:17.419> little<00:05:17.690> bit<00:05:17.870> and

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
have to finesse that a little bit and

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.420 
have to finesse that a little bit and
you<00:05:20.300> know<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.830> still<00:05:21.830> make<00:05:22.039> lots<00:05:22.250> of<00:05:22.340> mistakes

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
you know I still make lots of mistakes

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.240 
you know I still make lots of mistakes
and<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.240> thankfully<00:05:23.870> this<00:05:24.080> turned<00:05:24.590> out<00:05:24.830> great

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
and and thankfully this turned out great

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.370 
and and thankfully this turned out great
I<00:05:25.639> put<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.000> knife<00:05:26.120> together<00:05:26.510> click<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.200> click

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
I put the knife together click it click

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.400 
I put the knife together click it click
right<00:05:27.680> down<00:05:27.710> in<00:05:28.010> there<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.450> again<00:05:29.450> i<00:05:29.479> relieved

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
right down in there and again i relieved

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.730 
right down in there and again i relieved
a<00:05:30.650> little<00:05:30.830> bit<00:05:31.099> of<00:05:31.220> the<00:05:31.340> g10<00:05:32.410> so<00:05:33.410> if<00:05:33.500> you<00:05:33.620> could

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
a little bit of the g10 so if you could

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.560 
a little bit of the g10 so if you could
imagine<00:05:33.830> you<00:05:34.639> know<00:05:34.729> this<00:05:34.880> is<00:05:35.030> what<00:05:35.180> your<00:05:35.330> lock

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
imagine you know this is what your lock

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.960 
imagine you know this is what your lock
looks<00:05:35.930> like<00:05:36.200> and<00:05:36.440> you<00:05:37.310> know<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.520> detent<00:05:37.880> ball

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
looks like and you know the detent ball

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.210 
looks like and you know the detent ball
is<00:05:38.240> sticking<00:05:38.570> out<00:05:38.690> just<00:05:38.750> a<00:05:39.110> little<00:05:39.139> bit<00:05:39.380> so

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
is sticking out just a little bit so

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.070 
is sticking out just a little bit so
when<00:05:40.400> it's<00:05:40.550> closed<00:05:40.880> it<00:05:41.060> would<00:05:41.120> be<00:05:41.270> super<00:05:41.780> tight

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
when it's closed it would be super tight

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.990 
when it's closed it would be super tight
you<00:05:42.470> know<00:05:42.590> pressing<00:05:43.190> up<00:05:43.280> against<00:05:43.669> it<00:05:43.789> so<00:05:43.970> I

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
you know pressing up against it so I

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.570 
you know pressing up against it so I
just<00:05:44.500> used<00:05:45.500> a<00:05:45.710> sharp<00:05:46.669> blade<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.419> just<00:05:48.229> scrape

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
just used a sharp blade and just scrape

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.540 
just used a sharp blade and just scrape
the<00:05:49.580> g10<00:05:50.180> to<00:05:50.690> relieve<00:05:51.050> this<00:05:51.349> so<00:05:51.650> that<00:05:51.830> when<00:05:52.460> the

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
the g10 to relieve this so that when the

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.629 
the g10 to relieve this so that when the
liner<00:05:52.760> closes<00:05:53.479> it<00:05:53.660> it<00:05:54.229> can<00:05:54.440> actually<00:05:54.830> press<00:05:55.280> a

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
liner closes it it can actually press a

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.860 
liner closes it it can actually press a
little<00:05:56.120> further<00:05:56.360> back<00:05:57.610> so<00:05:58.610> the<00:05:58.760> detent<00:05:59.479> is<00:05:59.630> in

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
little further back so the detent is in

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.420 
little further back so the detent is in
the<00:06:00.560> hole<00:06:00.860> but<00:06:01.610> then<00:06:01.849> when<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.419> um<00:06:03.310> you<00:06:04.310> know

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
the hole but then when you um you know

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.159 
the hole but then when you um you know
have<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.510> whole<00:06:05.690> thing

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
have the whole thing

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.929 
have the whole thing
looking<00:06:06.349> up<00:06:06.499> and<00:06:07.039> engaging<00:06:07.639> and<00:06:07.879> disengaging

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:07.939 
looking up and engaging and disengaging

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.230 
looking up and engaging and disengaging
the<00:06:08.629> liner<00:06:08.840> that<00:06:09.020> it<00:06:09.259> can<00:06:09.439> go<00:06:09.620> past<00:06:10.120> you<00:06:11.120> know

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
the liner that it can go past you know

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.689 
the liner that it can go past you know
where<00:06:11.629> it<00:06:11.749> needs<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:12.080> be<00:06:12.199> and<00:06:12.889> that<00:06:13.159> you<00:06:13.580> know

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
where it needs to be and that you know

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.089 
where it needs to be and that you know
also<00:06:13.969> helps<00:06:14.419> a<00:06:14.509> lot<00:06:14.740> there's<00:06:15.740> a<00:06:15.830> lot<00:06:15.979> of

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
also helps a lot there's a lot of

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.379 
also helps a lot there's a lot of
factors<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.520> depends<00:06:16.849> on<00:06:16.909> how<00:06:17.060> thick<00:06:17.270> your

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
factors that depends on how thick your

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.110 
factors that depends on how thick your
washers<00:06:17.900> are<00:06:18.139> and<00:06:18.590> several<00:06:19.460> several<00:06:19.969> things

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
washers are and several several things

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.820 
washers are and several several things
like<00:06:20.330> that<00:06:20.539> but<00:06:21.199> this<00:06:21.919> lock<00:06:22.219> up<00:06:22.460> is<00:06:22.639> great<00:06:23.240> and

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
like that but this lock up is great and

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.379 
like that but this lock up is great and
I'm<00:06:24.830> so<00:06:25.009> thankful<00:06:25.159> for<00:06:25.370> that<00:06:25.520> so<00:06:25.849> anyway

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
I'm so thankful for that so anyway

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.480 
I'm so thankful for that so anyway
that's<00:06:26.689> how<00:06:26.870> you<00:06:26.990> do<00:06:27.169> that<00:06:27.409> all<00:06:28.129> that's<00:06:28.340> left

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
that's how you do that all that's left

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.879 
that's how you do that all that's left
really<00:06:28.909> now<00:06:29.150> is<00:06:29.629> for<00:06:30.020> me<00:06:30.139> to<00:06:30.259> heat<00:06:30.560> treat<00:06:30.740> the

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
really now is for me to heat treat the

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.659 
really now is for me to heat treat the
blade<00:06:31.249> to<00:06:31.840> assemble<00:06:32.840> it<00:06:32.990> and<00:06:33.400> it'll<00:06:34.400> be<00:06:34.490> ready
