00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.910 

in<00:00:00.719> today's<00:00:01.020> video<00:00:01.170> we're<00:00:01.650> going<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.860> be

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
in today's video we're going to be

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.230 
in today's video we're going to be
talking<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.399> brain<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.030> next

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
talking about the brain and the next

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.650 
talking about the brain and the next
video<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.689> nervous<00:00:04.049> system<00:00:04.380> so<00:00:04.620> stay<00:00:04.799> tuned

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
video the nervous system so stay tuned

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.299 
video the nervous system so stay tuned
okay<00:00:06.660> so<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.319> whole<00:00:07.440> brain<00:00:07.680> topic<00:00:08.069> it's

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
okay so for the whole brain topic it's

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.490 
okay so for the whole brain topic it's
actually<00:00:08.639> quite<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> very<00:00:09.330> very<00:00:09.809> small<00:00:10.080> topic

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
actually quite a very very small topic

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.850 
actually quite a very very small topic
there's<00:00:11.070> only<00:00:11.160> two<00:00:11.460> parts<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.599> two<00:00:13.410> sections

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
there's only two parts to two sections

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.379 
there's only two parts to two sections
you<00:00:13.950> could<00:00:14.099> say<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.639> specification<00:00:15.360> to

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
you could say that the specification to

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.050 
you could say that the specification to
mind<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.780> know<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.470> first<00:00:16.740> being<00:00:17.070> described

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
mind you know the first being described

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.910 
mind you know the first being described
with<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> aid<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.630> diagrams<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.680> gross

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
with the aid of diagrams the gross

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.580 
with the aid of diagrams the gross
structure<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> human<00:00:21.270> brain<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.840> outline

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
structure of the human brain and outline

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.029 
structure of the human brain and outline
the<00:00:22.740> functions<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> cerebrum<00:00:24.269> cerebellum

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
the functions of the cerebrum cerebellum

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.150 
the functions of the cerebrum cerebellum
medulla<00:00:26.039> oblongata<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.060> hypothalamus

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
medulla oblongata and the hypothalamus

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
medulla oblongata and the hypothalamus
so<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.670> tell<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:30.090> obviously<00:00:30.300> no

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
so as you can tell I'm obviously no

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.179 
so as you can tell I'm obviously no
artist<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.260> all<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.740> would<00:00:31.859> definitely

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
artist at all so I would definitely

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.729 
artist at all so I would definitely
recommend<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:33.270> know<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.750> Google<00:00:34.200> or

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
recommend you know going on Google or

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.440 
recommend you know going on Google or
looking<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.340> some<00:00:35.550> more<00:00:35.700> detailed<00:00:36.059> pictures

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
looking up some more detailed pictures

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.060 
looking up some more detailed pictures
but<00:00:36.660> I'm<00:00:36.780> basically<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.469> say<00:00:37.649> showing<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
but I'm basically like I say showing you

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.310 
but I'm basically like I say showing you
the<00:00:38.430> gross<00:00:38.700> structure<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> brain<00:00:39.809> where

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the gross structure of the brain where

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.720 
the gross structure of the brain where
it<00:00:40.350> wants<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> specification

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it wants to know in the specification

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.880 
it wants to know in the specification
but<00:00:42.360> yeah<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> really<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.200> no<00:00:43.320> artist<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
but yeah I really have no artist so

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.310 
but yeah I really have no artist so
don't<00:00:44.190> take<00:00:44.399> my<00:00:44.610> word<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> 100%

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
don't take my word as this is the 100%

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.220 
don't take my word as this is the 100%
and<00:00:46.710> accurate<00:00:47.039> brain<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.140> look

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and accurate brain so I'm going to look

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.779 
and accurate brain so I'm going to look
about<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> main<00:00:49.680> regions<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> brain<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
about the main regions of the brain and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.660 
about the main regions of the brain and
their<00:00:51.120> functions<00:00:51.510> suppose<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.430> we've

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
their functions suppose so here we've

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.900 
their functions suppose so here we've
got<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.090> cerebrum<00:00:55.070> this<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.219> by<00:00:56.370> far<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
got the cerebrum this is by far the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.720 
got the cerebrum this is by far the
largest<00:00:57.239> part<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> human<00:00:58.170> brain<00:00:58.730> it's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
largest part of the human brain it's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.970 
largest part of the human brain it's
divided<00:01:00.239> into<00:01:00.480> two<00:01:00.660> hemispheres<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:01.710> are

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
divided into two hemispheres which are

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.260 
divided into two hemispheres which are
linked<00:01:02.280> by<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.520> area<00:01:02.879> I'm<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
linked by this area I'm going to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.640 
linked by this area I'm going to
slightly<00:01:03.510> draw<00:01:03.750> lines<00:01:03.960> through<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> shaded

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
slightly draw lines through the shaded

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350 
slightly draw lines through the shaded
area<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.010> very<00:01:05.040> thin<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.060> called<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
area it's very thin it's called the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.020 
area it's very thin it's called the
corpus<00:01:06.780> callosum<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:08.700> isn't<00:01:08.850> actually

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
corpus callosum and that isn't actually

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.179 
corpus callosum and that isn't actually
in<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> specification<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.860> seen<00:01:11.070> in

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
in the specification but I have seen in

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.920 
in the specification but I have seen in
the<00:01:11.250> past<00:01:11.369> paper<00:01:11.670> state<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> part<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the past paper state the part of the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.929 
the past paper state the part of the
brain<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.320> connects<00:01:13.680> two<00:01:13.830> hemispheres<00:01:14.369> so

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
brain that connects two hemispheres so

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.480 
brain that connects two hemispheres so
there<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.369> essentially<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
there we have it so essentially the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.460 
there we have it so essentially the
function<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> cerebrum<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.780> all<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
function of the cerebrum is all the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.499 
function of the cerebrum is all the
control<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.400> whole<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.580> processes<00:01:21.360> such

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
control of the whole the processes such

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.640 
control of the whole the processes such
as<00:01:21.540> memory<00:01:22.189> language<00:01:23.360> function<00:01:24.650> deciding

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
as memory language function deciding

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590 
as memory language function deciding
what<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.040> decision-making<00:01:26.759> maths<00:01:27.360> or

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
what to do decision-making maths or

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
what to do decision-making maths or
things<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
things of that that's why it is the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.969 
things of that that's why it is the
largest<00:01:30.030> part<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.689> us<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.439> humans<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
largest part we us as humans as a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.399 
largest part we us as humans as a
species<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.150> such<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> large<00:01:33.750> cerebrum

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
species we have such a large cerebrum

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.830 
species we have such a large cerebrum
that's<00:01:34.979> always<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.430> complex<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.479> suppose

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that's always so complex and I suppose

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.880 
that's always so complex and I suppose
that's<00:01:37.049> why<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> most<00:01:37.560> dominant

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that's why the way the most dominant

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.160 
that's why the way the most dominant
species<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.030> planet<00:01:39.060> today<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.049> can

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
species on the planet today is we can

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.450 
species on the planet today is we can
think<00:01:40.409> things<00:01:40.650> through<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.100> work<00:01:41.310> together

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
think things through and work together

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.249 
think things through and work together
to<00:01:41.880> solve<00:01:42.689> tasks<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> next<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> back<00:01:46.020> at

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to solve tasks so next at the back at

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.440 
to solve tasks so next at the back at
the<00:01:46.350> bottom<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.310> cerebellum<00:01:47.909> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the bottom we have the cerebellum this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.210 
the bottom we have the cerebellum this
is<00:01:48.630> essentially<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.290> basically<00:01:49.799> controls

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
is essentially this basically controls

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.660 
is essentially this basically controls
all<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.060> coordination<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.899> movement<00:01:52.380> posture

the<00:01:53.670> fine<00:01:53.880> motor<00:01:54.119> skills<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.720> picking<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the fine motor skills are picking the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
the fine motor skills are picking the
table<00:01:55.590> fingers<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.060> picking

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
table fingers like like little picking

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.569 
table fingers like like little picking
patterns<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.079> things<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.860> really<00:01:59.310> fine

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
patterns and things the really fine

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.120 
patterns and things the really fine
motor<00:01:59.880> muscle<00:02:00.329> movements<00:02:00.829> driving<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.009> like

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
motor muscle movements driving it's like

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.340 
motor muscle movements driving it's like
it's<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.369> an<00:02:02.490> unconscious<00:02:03.149> operation<00:02:03.750> after

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
it's like an unconscious operation after

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.469 
it's like an unconscious operation after
experience<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.250> get<00:02:05.399> used<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.420> able

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
experience you get used to just be able

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.850 
experience you get used to just be able
to<00:02:06.659> move<00:02:06.810> your<00:02:06.960> foot<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.320> move<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.799> steering

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
to move your foot and move the steering

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.589 
to move your foot and move the steering
move<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.550> hands<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.119> muscles<00:02:09.479> without

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
move your hands and your muscles without

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.979 
move your hands and your muscles without
even<00:02:09.989> even<00:02:10.470> thinking<00:02:10.739> about<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.660> okay<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.720> next

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
even even thinking about it okay so next

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.550 
even even thinking about it okay so next
so<00:02:13.230> this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.080 
so this
this'll<00:02:13.800> black<00:02:14.069> this<00:02:14.459> black<00:02:14.700> thing<00:02:14.730> I've

located<00:03:08.640> here<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.830> we<00:03:10.830> do<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> quick<00:03:11.190> question

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
located here so we do a quick question

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.400 
located here so we do a quick question
just<00:03:11.640> test<00:03:12.239> your<00:03:12.299> knowledge<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.840> maybe<00:03:13.110> mine

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
just test your knowledge and maybe mine

just test your knowledge and maybe mine
because<00:03:14.160> right<00:03:14.549> now<00:03:14.700> we've<00:03:14.819> got<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.000> human

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
because right now we've got a human

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.289 
because right now we've got a human
versus<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> cow<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.380> who<00:03:16.950> has<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.220> larger<00:03:17.910> or

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
versus a cow so who has the larger or

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.870 
versus a cow so who has the larger or
the<00:03:18.390> more<00:03:18.570> complex<00:03:19.040> cerebellum<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.459> we<00:03:20.730> give

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
the more complex cerebellum and we give

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.460 
the more complex cerebellum and we give
you<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> couple<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.600> seconds<00:03:22.079> like<00:03:22.290> right

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
you like a couple of seconds like right

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.460 
you like a couple of seconds like right
now<00:03:22.650> pause<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:24.019> alright<00:03:25.019> if<00:03:25.109> you<00:03:25.170> didn't<00:03:25.350> pause

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
now pause it alright if you didn't pause

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.870 
now pause it alright if you didn't pause
it<00:03:25.650> that's<00:03:25.799> your<00:03:25.920> problem<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.400> human<00:03:26.730> would

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
it that's your problem the human would

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.610 
it that's your problem the human would
have<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.239> largest<00:03:27.510> cerebellum<00:03:28.079> because<00:03:28.530> when

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
have the largest cerebellum because when

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.990 
have the largest cerebellum because when
you<00:03:28.709> think<00:03:28.829> about<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.280> care<00:03:29.519> which<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.850> got

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
you think about it the care which is got

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.729 
you think about it the care which is got
these<00:03:30.090> legs<00:03:30.390> in<00:03:30.540> these<00:03:30.660> hooves<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.380> just<00:03:31.590> sit

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
these legs in these hooves that just sit

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.140 
these legs in these hooves that just sit
there<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.100> grass<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.790> doesn't<00:03:33.000> really

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
there on the grass so it doesn't really

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.300 
there on the grass so it doesn't really
have<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.600> much<00:03:34.019> fine<00:03:34.319> motor<00:03:34.650> movement<00:03:35.190> now

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
have that much fine motor movement now

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.470 
have that much fine motor movement now
don't<00:03:35.519> get<00:03:35.579> me<00:03:35.670> wrong<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:36.000> definitely<00:03:36.329> has

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
don't get me wrong it definitely has

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.229 
don't get me wrong it definitely has
some<00:03:36.690> all<00:03:36.900> or<00:03:37.319> all<00:03:37.829> mammals<00:03:38.250> would<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
some all or all mammals would but the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.849 
some all or all mammals would but the
humans<00:03:39.569> were<00:03:39.720> there<00:03:39.870> definitely<00:03:40.109> before<00:03:40.680> have

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
humans were there definitely before have

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.800 
humans were there definitely before have
the<00:03:40.980> most<00:03:41.100> complex<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.700> mean<00:03:41.880> we<00:03:42.329> need<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.540> peel

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
the most complex I mean we need to peel

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.990 
the most complex I mean we need to peel
through<00:03:43.109> and<00:03:43.440> things<00:03:43.680> at<00:03:43.799> least<00:03:43.950> use<00:03:44.280> use<00:03:44.880> our

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
through and things at least use use our

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.879 
through and things at least use use our
fingers<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.540> use<00:03:45.690> actual<00:03:46.170> movement<00:03:46.769> and

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
fingers and use actual movement and

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.759 
fingers and use actual movement and
thought<00:03:47.100> in<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.639> enable<00:03:48.239> us<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.329> do<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.690> so

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
thought in it to enable us to do this so

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.930 
thought in it to enable us to do this so
definitely<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.889> humans<00:03:50.190> did<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.730> get<00:03:50.880> that

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
definitely the humans did you get that

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.559 
definitely the humans did you get that
right<00:03:51.150> well<00:03:51.930> done<00:03:52.940> right<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.239> next<00:03:54.299> part

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
right well done right so the next part

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.180 
right well done right so the next part
the<00:03:54.720> specification<00:03:55.470> on<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.709> brain<00:03:55.950> is

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
the specification on the brain is

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.280 
the specification on the brain is
describe<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.150> role<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.690> brain<00:03:57.959> and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
describe the role of the brain and

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.680 
describe the role of the brain and
nervous<00:03:58.500> system<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:59.220> coordinated<00:04:00.090> muscular

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
nervous system in coordinated muscular

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.330 
nervous system in coordinated muscular
movement<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.380> how<00:04:01.530> do<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.799> brain<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.280> the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
movement so how do the brain and the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.300 
movement so how do the brain and the
muscles<00:04:02.700> move<00:04:03.000> together<00:04:03.889> so<00:04:04.889> really<00:04:05.190> what

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
muscles move together so really what

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.580 
muscles move together so really what
happens<00:04:05.609> is<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.150> decision<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.989> voluntarily

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
happens is the decision to voluntarily

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.520 
happens is the decision to voluntarily
move<00:04:07.980> for<00:04:08.940> example<00:04:09.359> I'm<00:04:09.630> going<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:10.319> move<00:04:10.470> my

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
move for example I'm going to move my

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.710 
move for example I'm going to move my
hand<00:04:10.859> right<00:04:11.100> now<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.790> decision<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.299> move<00:04:12.450> was

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
hand right now that decision to move was

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.349 
hand right now that decision to move was
made<00:04:12.959> in<00:04:13.200> my<00:04:13.319> cerebellum<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.489> neurons<00:04:14.880> from

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
made in my cerebellum so neurons from

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.870 
made in my cerebellum so neurons from
that<00:04:15.600> cerebellum<00:04:16.169> would<00:04:16.650> carry<00:04:16.919> impulses<00:04:17.579> to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
that cerebellum would carry impulses to

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.390 
that cerebellum would carry impulses to
motor<00:04:18.090> areas<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.109> muscles<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:20.250> muscles

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
motor areas to the muscles the muscles

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.850 
motor areas to the muscles the muscles
up<00:04:20.880> further<00:04:21.180> up<00:04:21.359> my<00:04:21.450> arm<00:04:21.659> allow<00:04:22.289> me<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.560> move<00:04:22.680> my

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
up further up my arm allow me to move my

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.860 
up further up my arm allow me to move my
arm<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.729> then<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.970> muscles<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.510> matching<00:04:24.810> my

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
arm and then the muscles in matching my

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.629 
arm and then the muscles in matching my
hands<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.260> within

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
hands and within

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.059 
hands and within
to<00:04:26.150> allow<00:04:26.360> me<00:04:26.539> to<00:04:26.810> create<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:27.560> structures<00:04:27.949> on

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 
to allow me to create the structures on

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.890 
to allow me to create the structures on
creating<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:29.060> shapes<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.449> my<00:04:29.539> hands<00:04:29.810> and

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
creating and the shapes of my hands and

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.469 
creating and the shapes of my hands and
fingers<00:04:30.020> right<00:04:30.349> now<00:04:30.969> so<00:04:31.969> obviously<00:04:32.300> then<00:04:32.449> the

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
fingers right now so obviously then the

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.119 
fingers right now so obviously then the
motor<00:04:32.750> areas<00:04:33.229> then<00:04:33.409> transport<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.039> to

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:34.129 
motor areas then transport that to

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.339 
motor areas then transport that to
effectors<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.270> energies<00:04:35.629> use<00:04:35.870> is<00:04:36.139> an

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
effectors so the energies use is an

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.559 
effectors so the energies use is an
effect<00:04:36.650> as<00:04:37.009> an<00:04:37.099> output<00:04:37.430> mechanism<00:04:37.939> to<00:04:38.270> enable

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
effect as an output mechanism to enable

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.110 
effect as an output mechanism to enable
me<00:04:38.659> to<00:04:38.689> do<00:04:38.900> this
