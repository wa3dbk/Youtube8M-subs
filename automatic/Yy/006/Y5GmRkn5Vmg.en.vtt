00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.480
 we knew that I was 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.699
 a tough match to take away this 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.020
 ready is a team that has not lost in 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.800
 league champions and league 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.480
 since 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.539
 for two years almost two years 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.449
 now so that shows the difficulty 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.829
 for a team to go down there 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.820
 then it was necessary that all 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:38.000
 ingredients are brought together to perform 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.399
 a feat there unfortunately we 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.719
 was already in trouble with 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.539
 players a little bit in trouble 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.250
 physically and and then we do not have 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:51.649
 managed to make our best match 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.089
 so obviously that made the thing 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.659
 a little bit a little bit complicated even 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.010
 if the week was rather interesting 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.559
 because we worked really well 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.390
 to prepare for that match but but 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.519
 here at veszprém was stronger than 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.840
 we on all areas also they 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.820
 have worked their side since we saw 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.610
 that they have us in attack 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.390
 obviously proposed a game really 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.030
 really hard for us 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.880
 to stop them but 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.710
 but here I think that on this match there 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.530
 the first tmr as name deserve 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 amply their their qualification I 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.080
 think it is true that even if 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.930
 attack it was 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.850
 difficult overall for all the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.520
 world since even though but who has succeeded 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.430
 to put a lot of goals 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.800
 there we still have a little bit 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.060
 caught on this area but after I 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.100
 believe that it is especially in defense we have 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.100
 really had been in trouble where we got 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.390
 taken a lot of a lot of a lot of 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.950
 goals we had a team in front of us 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.740
 or they had a lot of efficiency 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.330
 also at the shoot so so that's 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.820
 clear that all have all and it is these 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.770
 things that all these details that have us 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.360
 that we missed in the end it's 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.040
 really way too much to hope 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.720
 the better we have players who have come 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.070
 to join us and who reported 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.250
 really the heavier ones and more value to 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.250
 7h this group there so much more for 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.500
 what the disappointment she and she is 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.050
 present and the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.800
 went she is difficult to a little bit 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.610
 to digest but but here I think 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.740
 that 1 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.950
 it must make us even stronger 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.510
 for precisely to try to look 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.890
 a little bit what we have to play 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.780
 on this end of season is also 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.560
 we know the work we have to do 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.510
 again to hope to go further in 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.270
 the next European adventure 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.730
 the cricket match and ben it's clear 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:58.010
 that I think it's a good thing 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.530
 it happens quickly after the few 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.580
 days only to match 2 of veszprém 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.430
 so we do not have much time to 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.940
 cogitate it returns immediately in 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.590
 in the work for to prepare this 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.590
 match has to try to deliver 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.630
 a real fight and find the path of 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.870
 victory 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.910
 before attacking also prepare him the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.110
 Coupe de France match is a 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.300
 cup final of France so it's 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.390
 clear that everyone will have a huge 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.910
 motivation to try to report this 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.160
 title we have the chance to be there 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.769
 today in the final 7 foot de france 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.660
 we have we know that it was hard 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.800
 to get the qualifiers for this 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.200
 final there so 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.260
 1 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.560
 I believe the nantes team she is 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.370
 also will be very motivated she will 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.140
 prepare in any case as a must for 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.430
 try to pose a problem africa on 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.310
 lucky to be able to play 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.590
 house so we'll try to help ourselves 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.440
 of all of these positive things 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.260
 to be able to fight a big fight 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.569
 try to bring back this cup of France 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.489
 paris nantes for a few years 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.190
 show a lot of quality anyway 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.900
 in what she does on the ground 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:18.889
 but also it's a club that does not have 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.750
 stopped evolving so she shows 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.669
 today that she is able to 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.510
 talk about beating anyone in this 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.010
 race at the championship of France 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.040
 The adventure of a Coupe de France is 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.040
 always 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.600
 a very special adventure because 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.480
 that there are only matches included with 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.740
 matches with a lot of stake 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.860
 now we were lucky to be able to 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.870
 qualify for the final so we're going 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.990
 try to take full advantage of this moment 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.990
 the
