00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
theory behind that is that you ever hear

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.310 
theory behind that is that you ever hear
you<00:04:08.820> get<00:04:08.940> no<00:04:09.090> soft<00:04:09.420> tissue<00:04:09.660> pressure<00:04:10.050> if<00:04:10.290> you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
you get no soft tissue pressure if you

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.090 
you get no soft tissue pressure if you
LaSalle<00:04:10.860> ends<00:04:11.250> right<00:04:11.400> in<00:04:11.610> there<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.750> true

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
LaSalle ends right in there that is true

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.150 
LaSalle ends right in there that is true
where<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.280> causes<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:14.850> problem<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.690> that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
where that causes a problem is that

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.220 
where that causes a problem is that
saddle<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.340> nose<00:04:17.549> LaSalle<00:04:18.030> helps<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.109> to

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
saddle the nose LaSalle helps you to

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.380 
saddle the nose LaSalle helps you to
balance<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.890> bike<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.400> steer<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.730> bike<00:04:21.090> and

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
balance the bike to steer the bike and

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.930 
balance the bike to steer the bike and
also<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.620> helps<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.460> don't<00:04:23.640> slide

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
also it helps so that you don't slide

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.520 
also it helps so that you don't slide
off<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.120> front<00:04:24.450> of<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.690> seat<00:04:24.960> while<00:04:25.230> riding

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
off the front of the seat while riding

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.170 
off the front of the seat while riding
down<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.800> road<00:04:25.940> so<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> noseless<00:04:27.480> saddle<00:04:28.430> is<00:04:29.430> my

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
down the road so a noseless saddle is my

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.720 
down the road so a noseless saddle is my
opinion<00:04:30.450> is<00:04:30.720> very<00:04:31.170> dangerous<00:04:31.440> outside<00:04:31.830> and

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
opinion is very dangerous outside and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.720 
opinion is very dangerous outside and
when<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:32.880> go<00:04:32.970> indoors<00:04:33.510> or<00:04:33.720> indoor<00:04:33.990> cycling

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
when you go indoors or indoor cycling

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.880 
when you go indoors or indoor cycling
the<00:04:35.730> no<00:04:35.910> saddle<00:04:36.450> may<00:04:36.690> have<00:04:36.990> its<00:04:37.170> merits<00:04:37.590> there

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
the no saddle may have its merits there

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:44.850 
the no saddle may have its merits there
and<00:04:39.380> that's<00:04:40.380> it
