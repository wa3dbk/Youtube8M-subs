00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.830
 mubarak get rid of such a slogan 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.050
 chanted protesters in the square 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.990
 tahrir he united the whole of egyptian 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.049
 people during the revolution in january 2011 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.699
 people demanded the overthrow of the president 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.830
 who led the country 30 years a year later 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.140
 Hosni Mubarak appeared before the court and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.039
 the people of Egypt hoped that justice 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.750
 will triumph 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.519
 people called to sentence 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.529
 ex-president to death 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.660
 but now after a series of death 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.070
 collisions on the streets in just two seconds 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 a little year led to two 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 a coup in the square 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 tahrir 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.910
 there is not a soul the military rule the country 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.300
 second transition time 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.829
 and the former leader is out of jail the country is not 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.690
 will be safe because 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 the release of mubarak can aggravate 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.969
 situation people are afraid that he may 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.190
 return to power the protesters took to 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.379
 streets in 2011 demanding resignation 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.030
 mubarak also bread freedom and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.190
 social justice however two 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.289
 years later the situation only got worse in 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.809
 the result of daily collisions 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.580
 throughout the country hundreds of people died 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.270
 in decline the economy has shrunk the flow 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.430
 of tourists 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.770
 increased the level of violence on religious 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
 soil for many liberation mubarak 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 may be the last straw 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.330
 the fact that mubarak was released means that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.549
 the revolution of January 25 did not happen and 30 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.470
 June, too, the right won in the course 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.320
 revolutions at the cost of killing people now 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.210
 lost by an 85 year old court 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.280
 Mubarak was released from this 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.590
 koretsky prison however he is under 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 house arrest he will have to reapply 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.750
 court hearing about him 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.759
 involvement in the killing of protesters with 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.650
 2011 some Egyptians judicial 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.020
 the decision disappointed they state that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.320
 important evidence in this case was 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.060
 destroyed many disappointed with how 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.619
 passed the trial they hoped that 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.720
 the government will try 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.820
 and he will remain behind bars of course we 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.490
 outraged we didn't want him 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.950
 let out 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.210
 Egyptians are planning a new protest 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.220
 and say that the release of the former 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.079
 President's further confirmation 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.670
 that the government supported by the army 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.399
 trying to turn the clock back 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.319
 I have a feeling that we are not at all 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.120
 moved forward and release 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.280
 Mubarak is a clear example of what 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.440
 represents this revolution 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.540
 we have not managed to change anything in the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.090
 authorities and this is why this event 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.650
 perfectly reflects our inability 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.900
 something to change so we need 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.880
 continue to act but in light of it 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.350
 I think the release will be ours 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.330
 still a lot of work before the re-trial 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.459
 hearings hosni mubarak will be located 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.900
 in a military hospital probably when he 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.180
 stand trial again 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.920
 it will cause even more protests 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.680
 but this is now completely undesirable for 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.670
 countries split by conflict gave three 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.670
