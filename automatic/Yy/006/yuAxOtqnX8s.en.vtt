00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.949
 winner of the red dot award 2014 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.329
 of course the headphones are good in this 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.829
 wrapped up 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.690
 very soft cushions and also the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.160
 Headband is requested by most brands 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.149
 forget because then you have a blast 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.920
 things on you 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.800
 crackling and in this case is normal 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:50.489
 nice and soft and will be underneath 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 there's nothing orgy sitting instructions 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 good for the sidewalk and who was looking 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.609
 I the power cord connection is bald 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.559
 telephone is cordless but connecting cord 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.049
 address wired 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.150
 warranty terms and manual then 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.020
 you will sit at the e30 then the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.820
 Next open the e40 cabin white 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 even 40 in are also in black I is 30 and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 also in white or telephone you see that 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.830
 the Gryce what that means big 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.000
 I'll just explain 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.740
 here again that nice soft upholstery 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.210
 it feels super soft that wears 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.110
 undoubtedly really looking forward to it 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.220
 again yes the speaker cable so that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.570
 heavier 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.180
 so on longer than nothing may in the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.759
 two seven usb cable 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.170
 warranty conditions and manual for 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.799
 140 go look at the biggest brother and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.799
 150 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.659
 wilson clinton boy 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.740
 wide headband lined all around 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.270
 not just a course and the top 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.860
 Mr. completely lined all around 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.899
 she brings the orderable of course 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.250
 which of course also a very large drive 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.200
 session can see even greater than the other 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.689
 two so where am I going now even better 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.209
 sound and here too we find one 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.670
 manual a usb cable and 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.800
 audio cable for listening 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.750
 when we all three wireless is the cable 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.750
 neat with this kind of jamie for a delivers 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.269
 the specs the differences 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.950
 well they look at the e30 42nd 50 then 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.110
 we saw that we all have one 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.660
 change speaker cable from headphones 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.790
 connect cable to be able to sound 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.819
 and I would get them wirelessly 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.170
 its less true is the e40 and d50 that are 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.690
 wireless so I use bluetooth technology 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.790
 to listen to music wirelessly 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.860
 no 30 don't give that technique with the e30 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.930
 do not necessarily wire your music 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.790
 listening is not a disaster but it is just 40 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.560
 150 image free and you can other 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.849
 walk around the room without being tied up 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.250
 you retreat to where you were 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.470
 the other difference is in the headband 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.970
 which is at the 150 luxurious by 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.170
 those comfortable days is a pre you 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.100
 so that it stays in place better 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.600
 to sit 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.220
 they can all be 3 in multiple ways 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.959
 be adjusted 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.760
 I was of course like that 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.430
 set your head of them of course 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.160
 make it longer but you can also do it 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.709
 rotate so that's really good just pass 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.900
 stay stuck on your head 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.370
 well thought about when we look 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.319
 to the sound quality 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.940
 then it is very simple just goes on 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.840
 an e30 has a 13 mm turn gives 40 40 mm 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.420
 drivers and 950 just 50mm across and how 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.920
 the bigger the female the better the frequency 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.170
 characteristic 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.739
 and the deeper the pass , the better 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.849
 sound just literally becomes 150 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.459
 is the best e40 is better and the JBL 130 is 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.040
 so good good better and best 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.239
 after these two there is wireless in so 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.400
 the battery installed you just leave them 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.620
 easy on with usb this is a whopping one 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.379
 16 hours to use when the battery 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.560
 is completely full and they even hold 18 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.150
 hour from the e30 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.069
 yes not as long as you because it was 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.220
 not wireless that is just is 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.569
 the current along the cord 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.340
 if we are going to look at the bluetooth 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.739
 possibilities and you can also use it 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.569
 the wireless version with your phone you 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.480
 it can therefore also be used as a headset 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.760
 use and the sit microphone function 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.010
 built in to both 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.570
 overall top headphones if you have a good one 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.880
 sound we love better than those earplugs 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.130
 Then you go for the 130 better sound 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.610
 in 40 even better sound 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.610
 250
