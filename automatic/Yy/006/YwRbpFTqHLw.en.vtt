00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 soft- boiled eggs boiled or boiled 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.559
 easy for everyone lay the eggs in one 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.270
 saucepan gently to prevent it 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:23.119
 then there are fractures or micro- cracks 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.119
 add 600 milliliters of cold water 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.849
 put on the stove over medium heat e 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 wait until the water goes to 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 boiling 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.420
 when the water boils off but turns off 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.660
 only when the water boils like this 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.640
 not at the first bubbles 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.309
 Once the fire is out 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
 you will have to wait a few minutes leaving 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.170
 eggs in hot water 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.469
 exactly three minutes to get them 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 five minutes to get them 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.530
 barzotti and 10 minutes to see them firm 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.280
 now let's see exactly what the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.490
 result depending on the various minutes is the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.500
 result we get after three minutes 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.290
 takes into account the result could 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.150
 slightly change according to the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.450
 human dimension 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.100
 however this is a soft-boiled egg if 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.200
 you want a little more solid 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.420
 you could also wait three minutes e 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.030
 half or two and a half minutes if it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.009
 you prefer more liquid this and after 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.009
 exactly three minutes 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.140
 this is how it looks after the egg 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.060
 five minutes of waiting, that is, one remains 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.549
 little bit liquid but also a little more 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.369
 cooked and therefore is the barzotto egg then 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.700
 after five minutes place will be in this 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.700
 way 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.960
 this is the result after seven 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.000
 minutes 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.280
 man is not yet hard but it is enough 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.540
 once again, a part remains inside 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.390
 a little bit soft but it's on the way to 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.150
 become a hard-boiled egg then seven 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.400
 minutes after boiling remaining if 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.250
 kept in hot water 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.660
 this is exactly the result 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.200
 we get this instead the result 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.170
 after ten minutes of waiting in the water 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.330
 warm, that is, perfect boiled eggs 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.680
 many to make soft-boiled egg 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.989
 place in boiling water for 4 minutes e 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.739
 they keep it with boiling water for 4 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.220
 minutes 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.019
 in this way instead holding the egg in 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.720
 boiling water only for a second and then 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.560
 pushing the fire and leaving it in 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.040
 wait for three minutes not just savings 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.220
 one minute but also four savings 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.580
 minutes of gas that is not cheap 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.850
 in more than 100 degrees place loses some 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.450
 ownership while baking as I have you 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.790
 indicated the place will be in the water at 100 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.459
 degrees only for a few seconds and all the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.220
 rest at a temperature below 100 gr 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.160
 to proceed in this way from another 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.650
 advantage to put the egg in a 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.260
 small pot where there is still no water ed 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.709
 it is very likely that there are not 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.110
 fractures while it is very likely to create 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.299
 fractures when you put a new one 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.010
 in water that is already boiling I would not support it 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.900
 with your hands and then there will be the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.640
 chance to drop it maybe 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.019
 for a centimeter 2 in the pot of 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.640
 boiling water and this can generate 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:48.579
 of microfractures summarizing 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.850
 proceed according to the thousand way 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.790
 lighters saves you time to do 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.880
 save money and give you more 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.460
 guarantee of the result 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.960
 thank goodness for me 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:09.600
 the lecce I ask you put a nice inch in 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.730
 up and follow me on google plus the page of 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 google more than a thousand lighters already has 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:20.270
 had 14,000 aspect approvals also 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:24.470
 your like link in description
