00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.380
 having received superior knowledge 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.220
 they had to have been broadcast the town 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.790
 sharing 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.630
 in a way that they can not digest 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.519
 the retired 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.680
 however, over time you can vote 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.579
 instead of sharing knowledge 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:15.900
 they saved it for 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.189
 for them alone 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.249
 but I acted paved see 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.579
 and when the bear would have to start others 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.639
 they did not share everything they knew that in the knowledge part 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.569
 maybe because they thought they were not worthy 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.419
 or because they did not want to take away the job 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.419
 the matter is that the knowledge went very well 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.490
 at a time of delivery and puerperium 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.359
 Egypt 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:40.160
 the flu really stopped 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.560
 this agreement celebrated pasok negative cures 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.410
 and what he is looking for is that humanity does not know no return 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.270
 so 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.940
 when the project failed because of a collective love south in the crime 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.590
 christine work on how an individual 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.010
 and programming their genetics is how the fate will fall on the person of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.890
 Spider 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 There will be no easy way to get into telepathic communication 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.310
 elective positions 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.530
 he was also such a smart man 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.670
 with such a broad criterion that he accepted 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.680
 at that time when there were no temples also in gods 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.420
 the idea of ​​a single god 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.500
 the concept as something very common very advanced 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.120
 the idea of ​​programming the state agency 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.820
 and you can see clearly through sacred history because the continuous 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.740
 interventions 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.540
 genetic 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.560
 his intervention is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.940
 and manipulation these ere will have could not have children in fracc 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.960
 however with the help of the river 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.020
 he was 20 years old

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.899
 however with the help 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.070
 got this one still jacko

 Acosta home with leader his cousin 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 and then with Rachel who really loved toyota outer wall 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.730
 with the help of what high 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.760
 with help to these beings from other worlds came to conceive Joseph the one of the 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.980

 and that of joaquin miranda 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.880
 they could not have children 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.810
 however with the intervention of the fmi the octagenary creating the conditions of 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.199
 soon so that in due time get to Jesus 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.669
 that he was not an extraterrestrial 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.369
 simon terrestrial ec 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:19.519
 what different 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.769
 in the new testament is the story of Jesus 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.599
 what would happen if a person 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.550
 the human being 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.110
 the earth that through multiple incarnations on this planet 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.239
 reached a high level of Murcia 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.809
 half to land 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:35.599
 however for the love of humanity 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.179
 he agreed to return 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.929
 symantec 30 and determined 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.419
 Jesus was prepared 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.050
 so that during the three years of public life 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.110
 in this process a cosmic symbiosis a procedure 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:51.189
 by which pointer of the category of God's gods a gel in a 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.219
 resplendent 1 parents creators micael by miguel 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.779
 will merge with him 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.889
 I did during those three years 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.629
 accompany him in the realization is great news and what was that 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:04.829
 great mission 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.609
 precisely in defense of humanity 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.609
 in fact, love despite the fact that 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:14.089
 without knowing everything and transforming it 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.319
 even beat death 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.979
 understanding love as respect understanding tolerance and forgiveness 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.969
 it's in humans 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.999
 there will come a day when an apocalypse 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.880
 in which humanity will access knowledge 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.309
 for a long time he was with jul 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:34.509
 the day that lomaña gt knowledge the security forces that were submitted 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.209
 to humanity by milan 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.339
 to chaos two thousand years that would start from December 22, 2012 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.389
 start and the millennial rancher 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.709
 mii 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.199
 at the end since millennia 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.469
 I would believe that humanity puts itself on the side of force and light in a 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.609
 Last great battle the battle of Armageddon 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.249
 and what would happen, I say 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:58.659
 kylie lomeña sector that we have been victim of a cosmic conspiracy in that 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.730
 extraterrestrial land tape 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.669
 Bast the creator and sure that our older brothers 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.319
 both threw romanity what would happen if on this occasion at this time in 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.579
 since humanity 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.059
 contos take care of an act of supreme love 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.219
 let's say father forgive them because they were wrong 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:19.269
 they tried to prevent the evolution of man on earth and by 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:19.850
 contrary 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.620
 they made it have greater value greater meaning 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.469
 the pressure on coal was such 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:25.659
 that is, the 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.099
 that in the end the diamond street was excellent 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.059
 brush and in that moment a cosmic relationship of the earth well the cosmos 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.969
 what is expected to happen in the coming years 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.559
 it is expected that humanity like that was a knowledge that was hidden 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:44.619
 who comes to light much information like this has been hidden from him by 

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:46.040
 governments religions 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.620
 and is that 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.280
 Jalil of the covers of the light is to awaken pleasure so violent that much 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.009
 people will not be able to resist 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.060
 following with its moment the next years 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.650
 is going to accept a lot of information 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.699
 in the thing that morning discover it 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.310
 make that we are in a paradoxical alternative time we are in 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:04.059
 real time 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.729
 and that we are approaching a reconnection 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.339
 still a colonization of the times 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:13.319
 in the next few months next year we are going to see an acceleration that everything 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.319
 the physical potential in dreams and consciously 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.080
 also in the next months next years 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.560
 week of exchanges great transformations on planet earth 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.419
 at the ecological level in the climate 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.669
 major natural catastrophes because I 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.840
 because it is the earth that is still approaching a great part of the planetary 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.990
 a great transformation 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.950
 the Mayans 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.639
 wisely knew how to anticipate all this 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.639
 I consider and that from the year 2013 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.690
 symbolically it was going to be like a month of gestation 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.430
 he had a great party in italy 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.020
 they said labor that is expected to happen 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.800
 from here to December 22, 2012 josep rock fabrics of time 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.219
 humanity is the inability to really fulfill this 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:04.219
 the great responsibility of the great mission that has been assigned to him 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.639
 we will be able to really that in its moment of a cosmic forgiveness 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.439
 if before we are not able to legal wind 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.809
 and to forgive what we accept ourselves as we are and 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:18.110
 they accepted that family to others as they are 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.800
 today the death of the two are trying to go 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.050
 incentivized 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.589
 and my racial thing 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:28.039
 ethnic hatred religious type fighting 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.419
 then we are in the best moment unilaterally 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.610
 as for what we demonstrate a true level of spirituality 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.909
 seeking unity in diversity 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.520
 everything that unites us and is not 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.919
 remember we are human beings in this place 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.969
 that is planet earth a planet that is predestined 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:48.569
 bush of others 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.879
 in this case 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.669
 we are not the center the creation 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.409
 they sense that a cosmic expectation 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:57.940
 so many state investments that would not be coming 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.889
 in time immemorial 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.810
 for the moment most extraordinary story mack moment the great 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.029
 definition 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:08.369
 and that moment the great awakening 

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:10.360
 we manage to travel all 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.150
 a really we will not really achieve 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.930
 the objective 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.770
 and you need a lot of people so that the world changed its style but people spoke 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.270
 of 144 thousand sun dancers 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.430
 they have to stay and throw during the terrible dark night 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.249
 humanity 

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:26.169
 for the birth 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:30.789
 the apocalypse does not leave 144 thousand people who wash their clothes or that 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:32.409
 Awareness awakened 

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:35.899
 as we say, it does not take many people for the world to change 

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:38.899
 to tell you is that all those people who are changing 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.580
 as the best of itself and stay constant 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.719
 committed to your change process 

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:46.659
 let's remember 

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:48.569
 we live in a universe without limits 

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:51.229
 the only limit is that no 

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:52.550
 nothing I've heard 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.159
 time and reflection among all
