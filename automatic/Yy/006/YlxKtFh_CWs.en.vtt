suffocating<00:01:51.780> out<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.710> simple<00:01:53.009> terms<00:01:53.280> what's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
suffocating out with simple terms what's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.080 
suffocating out with simple terms what's
Apple's<00:01:54.799> basic<00:01:55.799> argument<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.939> saying

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
Apple's basic argument they just saying

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.359 
Apple's basic argument they just saying
look<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.960> design<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> here's<00:01:59.130> their

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
look here is design a and here's their

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.700 
look here is design a and here's their
design<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.630> see<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> difference<00:02:01.409> that's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
design you can see the difference that's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.870 
design you can see the difference that's
exactly<00:02:02.219> how<00:02:02.399> they're<00:02:02.520> doing<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.850> they're

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
exactly how they're doing it they're

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
exactly how they're doing it they're
basically<00:02:03.299> taking<00:02:03.719> Samsung's<00:02:04.500> devices

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
basically taking Samsung's devices

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
basically taking Samsung's devices
before<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.549> iPhone<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> iPad<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.659> showing

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
before the iPhone the iPad and showing

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.749 
before the iPhone the iPad and showing
afterwards<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.009> trying<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> paint<00:02:08.670> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
afterwards and just trying to paint this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.430 
afterwards and just trying to paint this
picture<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.360> without<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.840> iPhone<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.200> iPad

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
picture that without the iPhone the iPad

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.120 
picture that without the iPhone the iPad
these<00:02:11.250> could<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.520> never<00:02:11.760> had

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
these could have never had

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.030 
these could have never had
it<00:02:12.250> okay<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.330> as<00:02:13.780> far<00:02:13.960> as<00:02:14.170> for<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.470> boys<00:02:15.010> and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
the beginning of the trial is really

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.620 
the beginning of the trial is really
exciting<00:02:30.670> because<00:02:30.700> Apple<00:02:31.240> brought<00:02:31.420> up<00:02:31.510> these

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
exciting because Apple brought up these

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.270 
exciting because Apple brought up these
really<00:02:31.960> kind<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.260> super<00:02:32.590> strong<00:02:32.830> witnesses

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
really kind of super strong witnesses

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.190 
really kind of super strong witnesses
they<00:02:33.430> brought<00:02:33.640> out<00:02:33.670> people<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.750> charge<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.080> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
they brought out people in charge of the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.260 
they brought out people in charge of the
creation<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.920> iphone<00:02:36.550> they<00:02:36.940> brought<00:02:37.150> in

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
creation the iphone they brought in

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.210 
creation the iphone they brought in
markers<00:02:37.630> they<00:02:37.840> brought<00:02:38.020> in<00:02:38.140> designers<00:02:38.650> it's

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
markers they brought in designers it's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.680

really<00:02:39.520> kind<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.790> shifting<00:02:40.120> more<00:02:40.270> towards<00:02:40.600> a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
really kind of shifting more towards a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.970 
really kind of shifting more towards a
patent<00:02:41.050> trial<00:02:41.230> now<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.470> where<00:02:41.710> we're<00:02:41.860> getting

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
patent trial now to where we're getting

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.950 
patent trial now to where we're getting
and<00:02:42.190> sort<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.580> really<00:02:42.790> depths<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.540> the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
and sort of the really depths of the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.590 
and sort of the really depths of the
argument<00:02:44.640> for<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.120> jury<00:02:46.330> they've

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
argument for the the jury they've

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.720 
argument for the the jury they've
actually<00:02:46.810> they<00:02:47.530> were<00:02:47.680> almost<00:02:47.830> worn<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.370> get

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
actually they were almost worn to get

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.190 
actually they were almost worn to get
some<00:02:48.880> caffeine<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.480> other<00:02:49.630> day<00:02:49.780> because<00:02:49.960> they

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
some caffeine the other day because they

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.540 
some caffeine the other day because they
were<00:02:50.260> kind<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.560> falling<00:02:50.830> asleep<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.280> mean<00:02:51.430> it's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
were kind of falling asleep I mean it's

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.070 
were kind of falling asleep I mean it's
getting<00:02:51.760> really<00:02:51.970> complicated<00:02:52.270> this<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.020> the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
getting really complicated this is the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.900 
getting really complicated this is the
stage<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.710> trial<00:02:53.980> where<00:02:54.220> your<00:02:54.340> eyes<00:02:54.520> roll

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
stage of the trial where your eyes roll

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.970 
stage of the trial where your eyes roll
in<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.180> back<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.510> your<00:02:55.630> head<00:02:55.780> exactly<00:02:56.470> with

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
in the back of your head exactly with

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.260 
in the back of your head exactly with
another<00:02:57.220> couple<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.610> weeks<00:02:57.760> left<00:02:58.060> in<00:02:58.240> the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
another couple of weeks left in the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.870 
another couple of weeks left in the
trial<00:02:58.570> what<00:02:59.320> should<00:02:59.500> we<00:02:59.530> look<00:02:59.740> forward<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.190> we

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
trial what should we look forward to we

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.370 
trial what should we look forward to we
really<00:03:01.150> can<00:03:01.270> expect<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:01.750> Samsung<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.230> going

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
really can expect that Samsung is going

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.830 
really can expect that Samsung is going
to<00:03:02.440> attack<00:03:02.650> back<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:04.000> far<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.360> trials<00:03:04.660> really

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
to attack back so far the trials really

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.420 
to attack back so far the trials really
been<00:03:04.960> Apple<00:03:05.320> attacking<00:03:05.860> them<00:03:05.980> with<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.160> bunch

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430
