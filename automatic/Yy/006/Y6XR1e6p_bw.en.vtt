00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
choose from a number of different maps

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.009 
choose from a number of different maps
and<00:00:26.609> there's<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> lot<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.119> different<00:00:27.480> maps<00:00:27.689> and

of two different people to use here but

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
of two different people to use here but
once<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.730> start<00:00:35.820> getting<00:00:36.210> into<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> game<00:00:36.960> you

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
once you start getting into the game you

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.250 
once you start getting into the game you
realize<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.590> there's<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.100> too<00:00:38.370> much<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
realize that there's not too much to it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.910 
realize that there's not too much to it
all<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.640> speed<00:00:42.210> control

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
all you have is your speed control

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.610 
all you have is your speed control
forward<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.129> reverse<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.850> some<00:00:45.780> breaks<00:00:46.110> here

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
forward and reverse and some breaks here

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.279 
forward and reverse and some breaks here
and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.760> shoot<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.570> weapons<00:00:49.110> at

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and then you can shoot some weapons at

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.220 
and then you can shoot some weapons at
your<00:00:49.440> enemies<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:51.390> basically<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.780> race

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
your enemies and you basically just race

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.400 
your enemies and you basically just race
against<00:00:52.890> them<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:54.420> throw<00:00:54.960> those<00:00:55.170> weapons

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
against them and you throw those weapons

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.599 
against them and you throw those weapons
and<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:57.539> try<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.230> make<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> really

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and you try to make do with the really

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
and you try to make do with the really
terrible<00:00:59.850> control<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:01.050> way<00:01:01.289> too

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
terrible control so that are way too

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.880 
terrible control so that are way too
chaotic<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:03.719> framerate<00:01:04.049> also<00:01:04.559> feels

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
chaotic and the framerate also feels

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.550 
chaotic and the framerate also feels
pretty<00:01:05.189> slow<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.930> it<00:01:06.930> doesn't<00:01:07.260> feel<00:01:07.500> like

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
pretty slow and it doesn't feel like

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.740 
pretty slow and it doesn't feel like
it's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> perfectly<00:01:08.430> fluid<00:01:09.000> 30<00:01:09.270> frames<00:01:09.659> per

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
it's a perfectly fluid 30 frames per

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's a perfectly fluid 30 frames per
second<00:01:10.350> which<00:01:10.500> sort<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.460> ruins<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
second which sort of ruins the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.590 
second which sort of ruins the
experience<00:01:12.890> as<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.880> feels

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
experience as you can see it just feels

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.710 
experience as you can see it just feels
like<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:16.049> too<00:01:16.110> much<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.720> on

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
like way too much is going on and on

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.950 
like way too much is going on and on
some<00:01:19.140> maps<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:20.280> way<00:01:21.060> too<00:01:21.119> tough<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> tell

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
some maps it's way too tough to tell

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
some maps it's way too tough to tell
where<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.439> you're<00:01:22.770> even<00:01:23.130> supposed<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> be

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
where you you're even supposed to be

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.170 
where you you're even supposed to be
going<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.770> you<00:01:25.770> try<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.640> map<00:01:26.939> at

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
going if you try to look at the map at

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.050 
going if you try to look at the map at
the<00:01:27.299> top<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:27.780> corner<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:29.579> can't<00:01:29.880> really

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the top right corner you can't really

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.789 
the top right corner you can't really
tell<00:01:30.360> where<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.500> which

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
tell where you are at all or which

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.060 
tell where you are at all or which
character<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.320> once<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.619> spun

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
character you are and once you get spun

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.330 
character you are and once you get spun
around<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:36.360> course<00:01:36.930> becomes<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.770> confusing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
around the course becomes very confusing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.230 
around the course becomes very confusing
and<00:01:38.520> you're<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.850> sure<00:01:39.119> which<00:01:39.360> path<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.720> take

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
and you're not sure which path to take

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.639 
and you're not sure which path to take
another<00:01:42.240> problem<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> game<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.320> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
another problem with the game is that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.880 
another problem with the game is that
there's<00:01:43.920> no<00:01:43.979> scoring<00:01:44.759> system<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
there's no scoring system at all so you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
there's no scoring system at all so you
don't<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.369> rewarded<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:47.970> collecting<00:01:48.930> any<00:01:49.079> of

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
don't get rewarded for collecting any of

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.080 
don't get rewarded for collecting any of
these<00:01:49.290> items<00:01:49.530> or<00:01:49.890> anything<00:01:50.250> other<00:01:50.549> than<00:01:50.820> being

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
these items or anything other than being

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.679 
these items or anything other than being
able<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> throw<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.200> your<00:01:52.350> enemies<00:01:53.689> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
able to throw them at your enemies the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.780 
able to throw them at your enemies the
only<00:01:54.869> thing<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.229> compete<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.159> first

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
only thing you compete for is first

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.690 
only thing you compete for is first
place<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.450> without<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.469> decent<00:01:59.310> scoring

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
place and without a decent scoring

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.840 
place and without a decent scoring
system<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.380> game<00:02:01.710> doesn't<00:02:01.740> become<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
system if the game doesn't become that

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.109 
system if the game doesn't become that
exciting<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.920> worst<00:02:05.159> thing<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
exciting and the worst thing is that

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.940 
exciting and the worst thing is that
when<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.659> back<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.170> look<00:02:07.259> at<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.469> levels

there's no way to tell which level that
you<00:02:10.229> actually<00:02:10.500> got<00:02:10.709> first<00:02:11.129> place<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.640> they're

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
related here so it's not really exciting

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
there are the leaderboards which will

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.440 
there are the leaderboards which will
tell<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.230> how<00:02:22.379> many<00:02:22.440> games<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.860> won<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.370> lost

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
tell you how many games you won and lost

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.460

but<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.810> doesn't<00:02:25.080> really<00:02:25.200> mean<00:02:25.410> anything

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470

and<00:02:27.780> try<00:02:27.989> level<00:02:28.379> again<00:02:28.709> because<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.459> didn't

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
and try level again because you didn't

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.850 
and try level again because you didn't

there<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:35.910> second<00:02:36.660> mode<00:02:36.870> gather<00:02:37.400> but<00:02:38.400> it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
there is a second mode gather but it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.650 
there is a second mode gather but it
feels<00:02:39.360> quite<00:02:39.959> useless<00:02:40.940> all<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.299> is<00:02:42.330> you

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
feels quite useless all you do is you

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.630 
feels quite useless all you do is you
just<00:02:42.959> try<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.410> collect<00:02:43.739> these<00:02:43.980> little<00:02:44.370> arrow

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
just try to collect these little arrow

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.259 
just try to collect these little arrow
heads<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.780> map<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.230> then<00:02:47.150> depending<00:02:48.150> on

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
heads on the map and then depending on

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.550 
heads on the map and then depending on
how<00:02:48.420> many<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.720> collect<00:02:49.110> they<00:02:49.380> just

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
how many you collect they just

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.259 
how many you collect they just
multiplied<00:02:49.980> by<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> thousand<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.120> they

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
multiplied by a thousand and then they

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.180 
multiplied by a thousand and then they
give<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.569> some<00:02:51.780> random<00:02:52.230> point<00:02:52.500> score<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
give you some random point score and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.490 
give you some random point score and
that<00:02:53.880> randomly<00:02:54.360> goes<00:02:54.630> into<00:02:55.079> your<00:02:55.110> leader

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
that randomly goes into your leader

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.460 
that randomly goes into your leader
boards<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.450> sort<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.959> see<00:02:58.260> those

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
boards so that you can sort of see those

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.800 
boards so that you can sort of see those
and<00:02:58.769> compete<00:02:59.190> with<00:02:59.670> your<00:02:59.819> friends<00:02:59.849> for<00:03:00.660> that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
and compete with your friends for that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.930 
and compete with your friends for that
score<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:02.040> otherwise<00:03:02.250> your<00:03:02.519> score<00:03:02.790> isn't

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
score but otherwise your score isn't

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.960 
score but otherwise your score isn't
very<00:03:03.209> visible<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.640> unless<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.790> actually

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
very visible and unless you actually

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.150 
very visible and unless you actually

system<00:03:08.370> feels<00:03:08.849> once<00:03:09.239> again<00:03:09.510> quite<00:03:10.019> useless

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
system feels once again quite useless

some<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.390> maps<00:03:12.569> are<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:12.989> really

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
some of the maps are just really

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.270 
some of the maps are just really
terribly<00:03:14.069> designed<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.390> one<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.280> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
terribly designed like this one and the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.020 
terribly designed like this one and the
controls<00:03:17.760> just<00:03:18.420> never<00:03:18.750> feel<00:03:19.049> right<00:03:20.030> another

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
controls just never feel right another

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.569 
controls just never feel right another
problem<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.569> there's<00:03:21.840> no<00:03:22.380> real<00:03:22.650> ebrake<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.459> the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
problem is there's no real ebrake in the

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.569 
problem is there's no real ebrake in the
game<00:03:23.790> there's<00:03:24.540> just<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.560> break<00:03:25.950> which<00:03:26.340> is

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
game there's just this break which is

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.509 
game there's just this break which is
all<00:03:26.910> four<00:03:27.510> tires<00:03:27.810> breaking<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.680> then<00:03:29.280> there's

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
all four tires breaking and then there's

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.360 
all four tires breaking and then there's
reverse<00:03:29.760> which<00:03:30.420> oddly<00:03:30.840> if<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.620> hit<00:03:32.010> reverse

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
reverse which oddly if you hit reverse

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.180 
reverse which oddly if you hit reverse
in<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.940> turn<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.959> just<00:03:34.200> like<00:03:34.349> instantly<00:03:34.889> backs

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
in a turn it just like instantly backs

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.220 
in a turn it just like instantly backs
up<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.489> car<00:03:35.880> very<00:03:36.810> unrealistically<00:03:39.230> so

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
up the car very unrealistically so

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.500 
up the car very unrealistically so
overall<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.069> controls<00:03:41.639> are<00:03:41.849> really<00:03:42.090> terrible

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510

the<00:03:43.200> visuals<00:03:43.650> aren't<00:03:44.099> that<00:03:44.250> good<00:03:44.519> because<00:03:45.000> it

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
the visuals aren't that good because it

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.509 
the visuals aren't that good because it
just<00:03:45.810> doesn't<00:03:46.230> feel<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.859> really<00:03:47.250> is

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
just doesn't feel like it really is
