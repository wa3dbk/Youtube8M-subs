think<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.470> top<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.130> head<00:01:56.340> at<00:01:56.610> least

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
think of on top of my head at least

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.160 
think of on top of my head at least
Search<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.090> Destroy<00:01:57.119> game<00:01:57.600> modes<00:01:57.840> anyway

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
Search and Destroy game modes anyway

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.920 
Search and Destroy game modes anyway
it's<00:01:58.560> pretty<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.790> like<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.119> big

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
it's pretty much is this is like the big

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.870 
it's pretty much is this is like the big
boy<00:02:01.200> keeper<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.710> seen<00:02:01.890> those<00:02:02.100> games<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.610> have

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
boy keeper is seen those games that have

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.030 
boy keeper is seen those games that have
no<00:02:03.060> response<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.750> always<00:02:04.140> been<00:02:04.320> known<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.829> be

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
no response have always been known to be

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.320 
no response have always been known to be
those<00:02:05.670> type<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.350> intense<00:02:07.350> type<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.160> games<00:02:08.399> when

those type of intense type of games when

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.050 
those type of intense type of games when
you<00:02:09.599> only<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.709> life<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.370> around<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
alive so these things can get pretty

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.270 
alive so these things can get pretty
damn<00:02:17.160> intent<00:02:17.610> now<00:02:18.600> as<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.290> said<00:02:19.560> earlier<00:02:19.709> there

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
damn intent now as I said earlier there

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.460 
damn intent now as I said earlier there
are<00:02:20.310> 10<00:02:20.819> rounds<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.630> game<00:02:22.170> all<00:02:22.440> right

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
are 10 rounds in this game all right

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.940 
are 10 rounds in this game all right
here<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.130> pretty<00:02:24.090> much<00:02:24.180> our<00:02:24.480> self<00:02:24.990> is<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.709> set

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
here and pretty much our self is we set

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.880 
here and pretty much our self is we set
your<00:02:26.130> attackers<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.319> attack<00:02:28.650> pretty

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
your attackers and you you attack pretty

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.590 
your attackers and you you attack pretty
much<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> first<00:02:29.340> five<00:02:29.610> rounds<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.180> after<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
much the first five rounds and after the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.720 
much the first five rounds and after the
first<00:02:30.840> five<00:02:30.959> rounds<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.860> will<00:02:32.040> switch<00:02:32.340> up<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
first five rounds you will switch up and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.350 
first five rounds you will switch up and
become<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.060> defenders<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.880> pretty<00:02:36.240> much

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
become the defenders so it's pretty much

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.170 
become the defenders so it's pretty much
becomes<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.080> race<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.560> which<00:02:37.860> team<00:02:38.160> can<00:02:38.400> get<00:02:38.880> 10

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
becomes a race to which team can get 10

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.440 
becomes a race to which team can get 10
points<00:02:39.480> first<00:02:40.020> now<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.489> earn<00:02:41.760> points<00:02:42.330> in

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
points first now you can earn points in

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.220 
points first now you can earn points in
two<00:02:42.810> different<00:02:43.050> ways<00:02:43.290> by<00:02:44.190> Lemony<00:02:44.790> that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
two different ways by Lemony that

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.420 
two different ways by Lemony that
eliminating<00:02:46.230> i<00:02:46.320> should<00:02:46.500> say<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.800> enemy<00:02:47.190> team

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
eliminating i should say the enemy team

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.610 
eliminating i should say the enemy team
which<00:02:47.880> only<00:02:48.150> gives<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.690> one<00:02:49.020> point<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
which only gives you one point at the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.580 
which only gives you one point at the
end<00:02:49.680> around<00:02:49.950> or<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.420> capture<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.810> flag<00:02:52.170> which

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
end around or you capture the flag which

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.710 
end around or you capture the flag which
gives<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.070> two<00:02:53.459> points<00:02:53.970> at<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.180> end<00:02:54.269> around

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
gives you two points at the end around

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.170 
gives you two points at the end around
so<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.500> like<00:02:55.890> how<00:02:56.070> they<00:02:56.250> did<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.670> score<00:02:56.970> because

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
so I like how they did the score because

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.690 
so I like how they did the score because
it<00:02:57.540> gives<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.260> gives<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.590> more<00:02:58.800> motive<00:02:59.220> to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
it gives you it gives you more motive to

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.310 
it gives you it gives you more motive to
even<00:03:00.060> want<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.420> try<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.630> capture<00:03:00.900> their<00:03:01.110> fly

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
even want to try to capture their fly

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.290 
even want to try to capture their fly
because<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.370> problem<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:02.880> these<00:03:03.030> no

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
because the problem with these no

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.050 
because the problem with these no
respawn<00:03:03.930> game<00:03:04.260> modes<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.980> people<00:03:05.400> that's

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
respawn game modes is that people that's

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.729 
respawn game modes is that people that's
in<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.300> plan<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.720> objective<00:03:07.260> you're<00:03:07.410> like<00:03:07.560> hey

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
you know what why should I put in all

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.390 
you know what why should I put in all
the<00:03:09.780> extra<00:03:10.080> work<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.290> put<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.830> objective<00:03:11.250> when

the extra work to put the objective when

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.460 
the extra work to put the objective when
I<00:03:11.459> can<00:03:11.730> simply<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.180> kill<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.810> enemy<00:03:13.230> team

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
I can simply just kill the enemy team

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.280 
I can simply just kill the enemy team
and<00:03:13.739> make<00:03:14.160> my<00:03:14.310> job<00:03:14.340> easier<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.209> hell<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.989> still

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
win this way but now you can they have

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.210 
win this way but now you can they have
more<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.780> Santa<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.380> even<00:03:19.709> want<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.980> go<00:03:20.130> out

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
more of a Santa to even want to go out

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.630 
more of a Santa to even want to go out
there<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.610> catch<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.150> flag<00:03:22.190> because<00:03:23.190> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
there and catch it a flag because it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.690 
there and catch it a flag because it
pretty<00:03:24.090> much<00:03:24.360> comes<00:03:24.660> down<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.260> which<00:03:25.799> team<00:03:26.310> has

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
pretty much comes down to which team has

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.610 
pretty much comes down to which team has
the<00:03:26.760> highest<00:03:27.450> mountain<00:03:27.750> points<00:03:28.049> now<00:03:28.410> I've

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the highest mountain points now I've

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.020 
the highest mountain points now I've
been<00:03:28.769> hearing<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.519> pretty<00:03:29.790> much

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
been hearing that it's pretty much

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.319 
been hearing that it's pretty much
10-point<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.170> for<00:03:31.500> example<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.090> just

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
10-point so for example and this is just

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.430 
10-point so for example and this is just
from<00:03:34.019> what<00:03:34.140> I'm<00:03:34.290> understanding<00:03:35.090> if<00:03:36.290> you're<00:03:37.290> in

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
from what I'm understanding if you're in

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.880 
from what I'm understanding if you're in
an<00:03:37.500> attacking<00:03:37.890> side<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.600> have<00:03:39.870> also<00:03:40.829> you

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
an attacking side and you have also you

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.890

up getting I believe like 11 to 12
points<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.850> believe<00:04:00.120> because<00:04:00.470> we<00:04:01.470> were<00:04:01.590> winning

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
points I believe because we were winning

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.979

arounds<00:04:02.400> differently<00:04:02.850> sometimes<00:04:03.570> we<00:04:03.930> were

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
arounds differently sometimes we were

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.240 
arounds differently sometimes we were
kept<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.440> flex<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.799> sometimes<00:04:05.100> we

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
kept in the flex and sometimes we

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.610 
kept in the flex and sometimes we
eliminate<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.760> enemy<00:04:06.000> team<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.900> know<00:04:07.170> you

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620
