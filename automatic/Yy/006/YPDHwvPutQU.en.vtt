00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
totally against increasing the screen

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.249 
totally against increasing the screen
size<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.340> iphone<00:01:38.729> 5<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:40.020> was

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
size on the iphone 5 now this was

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.600 
size on the iphone 5 now this was
because<00:01:40.439> currently<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> iphone<00:01:42.030> 4<00:01:42.590> there's

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
because currently the iphone 4 there's

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
because currently the iphone 4 there's
currently<00:01:44.610> two<00:01:44.880> different<00:01:45.299> resolutions<00:01:45.930> so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
currently two different resolutions so

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.319 
currently two different resolutions so
iphone<00:01:47.220> 4s<00:01:47.579> obviously<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> high

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
iphone 4s obviously it's a high

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.359 
iphone 4s obviously it's a high
resolution<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> still<00:01:50.220> have

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
resolution and you know you still have

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
resolution and you know you still have
like<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> 3g<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.659> whatever<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.740> there

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
like the 3g out whatever going on there

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
like the 3g out whatever going on there
and<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.399> lower<00:01:53.549> resolution<00:01:54.119> phones<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.750> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and the lower resolution phones so that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.709 
and the lower resolution phones so that
pretty<00:01:55.680> much<00:01:55.829> means<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.450> app

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
pretty much means that the app

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.420 
pretty much means that the app
developers<00:01:58.500> really<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.100> an<00:01:59.189> easy

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
developers really have an easy

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.560 
developers really have an easy
conversion<00:01:59.850> between<00:02:00.149> when<00:02:00.450> they're

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
conversion between when they're

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.149 
conversion between when they're
developing<00:02:00.899> apps<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.799> develop<00:02:01.950> you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
developing apps so we can develop you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.649 
developing apps so we can develop you
know<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.090> an<00:02:03.210> easy<00:02:03.329> conversion

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
know just it's an easy conversion

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.420 
know just it's an easy conversion
between<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.200> lower<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.740> upper<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.310> then

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
between the lower and the upper and then

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.310 
between the lower and the upper and then
the<00:02:05.520> ipad<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.210> whole<00:02:06.360> nother<00:02:06.390> no<00:02:07.079> ball

they're making apps for that so they'd

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.380 
they're making apps for that so they'd
like<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.560> stay<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> same<00:02:11.370> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> field

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
claimed fragmenting the iOS and stuff

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.839 
claimed fragmenting the iOS and stuff
like<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.329> with<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.569> apps<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.519> just<00:02:27.519> making

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
like that with the apps and just making

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.220 
like that with the apps and just making
a<00:02:27.939> lot<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.090> promise<00:02:28.510> Arab<00:02:28.629> developers<00:02:29.079> and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
a lot of promise Arab developers and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.459 
a lot of promise Arab developers and
that's<00:02:29.620> really<00:02:30.069> not<00:02:30.189> what<00:02:30.250> Apple<00:02:30.639> wants<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:31.000> do

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
that's really not what Apple wants to do

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.770 
that's really not what Apple wants to do
so<00:02:32.469> what<00:02:32.590> I'll<00:02:32.680> expect<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.129> know<00:02:33.250> kind<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.549> a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
so what I'll expect you know kind of a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.149 
so what I'll expect you know kind of a
44<00:02:34.780> inch<00:02:34.810> screen<00:02:35.139> size<00:02:35.349> with<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.680> phone<00:02:35.889> and

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
44 inch screen size with this phone and

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.729 
44 inch screen size with this phone and
what<00:02:37.150> definitely<00:02:37.689> gonna<00:02:37.780> see<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> form<00:02:38.349> factor

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
what definitely gonna see a form factor

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.119 
what definitely gonna see a form factor
change<00:02:39.010> because<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.000> saw<00:02:40.180> from<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.389> 3gs<00:02:41.129> 24

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
change because you saw from the 3gs 24

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.679 
change because you saw from the 3gs 24
completely<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.120> know<00:02:43.150> not<00:02:43.450> completely

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
completely you know not completely

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:44.970 
completely you know not completely
different<00:02:44.139> but<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.260> form<00:02:44.500> factor<00:02:44.769> change

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
different but a form factor change

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.129 
different but a form factor change
indeed<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.970> for<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.299> 4s<00:02:46.599> was<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> same

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
indeed and the for the 4s was the same

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.500 
indeed and the for the 4s was the same
so<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.799> would<00:02:48.040> expect<00:02:48.129> to<00:02:48.340> see<00:02:48.579> a<00:02:48.819> form<00:02:49.180> factor

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
so I would expect to see a form factor

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.330 
so I would expect to see a form factor
change<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.049> phone<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.439> don't<00:02:50.950> really<00:02:51.069> know

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
change in this phone I don't really know

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.530 
change in this phone I don't really know
if<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.549> gonna<00:02:51.639> be<00:02:51.760> more<00:02:51.939> kind<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.120> Android

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.729 
know they're looking at a couple
different<00:03:04.359> processors<00:03:05.139> that<00:03:05.260> are<00:03:05.500> going<00:03:05.680> to

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
different processors that are going to

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.860 
different processors that are going to
want<00:03:05.859> to<00:03:05.889> put<00:03:06.099> on<00:03:06.189> this<00:03:06.340> we<00:03:07.239> have<00:03:07.389> maybe<00:03:07.599> like<00:03:07.840> a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
want to put on this we have maybe like a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.379 
want to put on this we have maybe like a
quad-core<00:03:08.230> processor<00:03:09.069> once<00:03:09.519> again<00:03:09.669> I<00:03:09.819> could

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
quad-core processor once again I could

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.420 
quad-core processor once again I could
definitely<00:03:10.930> see<00:03:11.290> Apple<00:03:11.919> putting<00:03:12.129> a<00:03:12.189> quad-core

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
definitely see Apple putting a quad-core

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.640 
definitely see Apple putting a quad-core
in<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:12.849> thing<00:03:13.030> my<00:03:13.750> talk<00:03:14.230> about<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.469> samsung

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
in this thing my talk about the samsung

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.890 
in this thing my talk about the samsung
galaxy<00:03:14.859> s3<00:03:15.250> everybody's<00:03:16.150> racing<00:03:16.659> for<00:03:16.810> that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
galaxy s3 everybody's racing for that

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.439 
galaxy s3 everybody's racing for that
quad<00:03:17.139> core<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.680> i<00:03:18.159> think<00:03:18.370> apple<00:03:18.549> will<00:03:18.879> not<00:03:19.269> be

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:19.449 
quad core and i think apple will not be

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.119 
quad core and i think apple will not be
too<00:03:19.569> far<00:03:19.599> behind<00:03:19.780> now<00:03:20.139> to<00:03:20.379> talk<00:03:20.560> about<00:03:20.620> what

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
too far behind now to talk about what

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.969 
too far behind now to talk about what
exact<00:03:21.609> um<00:03:21.849> chip<00:03:22.750> they<00:03:22.930> would<00:03:23.079> be<00:03:23.229> using<00:03:23.620> i'm

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979 
exact um chip they would be using i'm

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.259 
exact um chip they would be using i'm
not<00:03:24.099> really<00:03:24.280> sure<00:03:24.370> because<00:03:24.669> there's<00:03:25.000> no

not really sure because there's no

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.430 
not really sure because there's no
couple<00:03:25.329> different<00:03:25.810> factors<00:03:26.079> are<00:03:26.199> going<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.379> be

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
couple different factors are going to be

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.020 
couple different factors are going to be
including<00:03:26.829> in<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.040> but<00:03:27.549> let's<00:03:27.790> move<00:03:27.879> on<00:03:28.000> to

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
cameras now I want to go ahead and start

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.679 
cameras now I want to go ahead and start
updating<00:04:03.430> all<00:04:03.729> the<00:04:03.819> cameras<00:04:04.269> on<00:04:04.419> this<00:04:04.540> iphone

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689

and now if they start updating and

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.240 
and now if they start updating and
putting<00:04:07.419> so<00:04:07.569> much<00:04:07.659> technology<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:08.379> there<00:04:08.530> it's

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
putting so much technology in there it's

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.039 
putting so much technology in there it's
going<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.459> disrupt<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.939> form<00:04:10.180> factor<00:04:10.359> so

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
going to disrupt the form factor so

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.119 
going to disrupt the form factor so
they're<00:04:11.290> gonna<00:04:11.379> have<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.650> find<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:11.949> way<00:04:11.979> to

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
they're gonna have to find a way to

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.619 
they're gonna have to find a way to
still<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:12.519> know<00:04:12.609> make<00:04:12.759> a<00:04:12.790> great<00:04:13.030> camera<00:04:13.299> and

not disrupt that kind of flat look yes
there's<00:04:16.479> some<00:04:16.599> phones<00:04:16.810> out<00:04:16.959> there<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.289> have

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
there's some phones out there that have

there's some phones out there that have
you<00:04:17.470> know<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.590> little<00:04:17.889> hump<00:04:18.159> to<00:04:18.609> get<00:04:18.729> over<00:04:18.880> when

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
you know a little hump to get over when

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
that right weight capacity so it's gonna

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.070 
that right weight capacity so it's gonna
have<00:04:31.979> literally<00:04:32.979> no<00:04:33.400> touch<00:04:33.639> buttons<00:04:34.000> Noah<00:04:34.629> you

just gonna be like almost like the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.330 
just gonna be like almost like the
android<00:04:37.900> phones<00:04:38.229> where<00:04:38.349> it's<00:04:38.439> just<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:39.310> know

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
android phones where it's just you know

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.339 
android phones where it's just you know
just<00:04:39.460> touch<00:04:39.909> capacitive<00:04:40.300> exactly<00:04:41.110> what<00:04:41.229> it<00:04:41.319> is

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
just touch capacitive exactly what it is

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.589 
just touch capacitive exactly what it is
so<00:04:41.949> you<00:04:42.460> know<00:04:42.550> it's<00:04:42.699> no<00:04:42.819> physical<00:04:43.210> buttons<00:04:43.479> on

what<00:06:00.069> can<00:06:00.190> that<00:06:00.250> burn<00:06:00.520> up<00:06:00.639> well<00:06:01.029> let<00:06:01.150> me<00:06:01.240> know

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
what can that burn up well let me know

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.610 
what can that burn up well let me know
couple<00:06:01.839> different<00:06:02.080> things<00:06:02.110> that<00:06:02.319> can<00:06:02.409> extend

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
couple different things that can extend

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.290 
couple different things that can extend
the<00:06:02.800> battery<00:06:02.979> life<00:06:03.219> increase<00:06:03.969> the<00:06:04.120> storage

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
the battery life increase the storage

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.420 
the battery life increase the storage
capacity<00:06:04.870> obviously<00:06:05.409> and<00:06:05.589> give<00:06:06.099> faster

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
capacity obviously and give faster

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.980 
capacity obviously and give faster
access<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.849> music<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.210> video<00:06:07.270> also<00:06:07.569> you<00:06:07.719> can

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
have a thinner phone with this flash

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.990 
have a thinner phone with this flash
storage<00:06:10.180> and<00:06:10.449> up<00:06:10.960> perhaps<00:06:11.259> with<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.159> addition

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
storage and up perhaps with the addition

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.510 
storage and up perhaps with the addition
perhaps<00:06:13.719> with<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:13.900> acquisition<00:06:14.139> of<00:06:14.889> this

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
perhaps with the acquisition of this

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.309 
perhaps with the acquisition of this
company<00:06:16.029> Apple<00:06:16.270> will<00:06:16.599> be<00:06:16.719> able<00:06:16.839> to<00:06:16.900> provide<00:06:17.020> it

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
company Apple will be able to provide it

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.959 
company Apple will be able to provide it
at<00:06:17.440> a<00:06:17.469> more<00:06:17.710> reasonable<00:06:17.889> price<00:06:18.339> to<00:06:18.490> consumers

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
at a more reasonable price to consumers

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.990 
at a more reasonable price to consumers
so<00:06:19.870> that<00:06:19.900> people<00:06:20.469> can<00:06:20.650> afford<00:06:20.949> this<00:06:21.550> so

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
so that people can afford this so

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.219 
so that people can afford this so
something<00:06:22.240> really<00:06:22.449> cool<00:06:22.599> is<00:06:22.750> that<00:06:22.779> it<00:06:23.080> can

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
something really cool is that it can

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.499 
something really cool is that it can
integrate<00:06:23.440> with<00:06:23.740> arm<00:06:23.919> system<00:06:24.190> on<00:06:24.550> chip<00:06:24.610> design

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
integrate with arm system on chip design

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.899 
integrate with arm system on chip design
so<00:06:26.020> it's<00:06:26.169> just<00:06:26.259> you<00:06:26.409> know<00:06:26.440> one<00:06:26.949> chip<00:06:27.250> with<00:06:27.669> this

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
so it's just you know one chip with this

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.879 
so it's just you know one chip with this
flash<00:06:28.150> storage<00:06:28.509> on<00:06:28.750> its<00:06:28.990> it's<00:06:29.229> really<00:06:29.710> makes

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
flash storage on its it's really makes

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.010 
flash storage on its it's really makes
sense<00:06:30.159> in<00:06:30.370> all<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.270> bigger<00:06:31.479> picture<00:06:31.690> makes

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
sense in all the bigger picture makes

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.300 
sense in all the bigger picture makes
sense<00:06:32.199> at<00:06:32.349> Apple<00:06:32.589> could<00:06:32.800> do<00:06:32.949> something<00:06:33.190> like

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
sense at Apple could do something like

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.740 
sense at Apple could do something like
this<00:06:33.520> so<00:06:33.880> I<00:06:33.909> really<00:06:34.209> think<00:06:34.330> this<00:06:34.509> is<00:06:34.539> going<00:06:34.690> to

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
this so I really think this is going to

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.329 
this so I really think this is going to
happen<00:06:34.899> it's<00:06:35.709> really<00:06:35.919> all<00:06:36.039> I<00:06:36.069> had<00:06:36.219> to<00:06:36.250> say

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:36.339 
happen it's really all I had to say

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:37.360 
happen it's really all I had to say
about<00:06:36.459> the<00:06:36.669> phone<00:06:36.880> there

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
there's not too many spiked cider at all

there's not too many spiked cider at all
