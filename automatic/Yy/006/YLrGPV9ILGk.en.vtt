00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.460
 Sunday I'm 19 so 20 are books 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.110
 tuber to know that this is not mine 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.960
 first channel I already have another where 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.199
 I speak of books in English because the book 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.539
 to be that it is the community of key people 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.710
 books that talk about it on youtube is a lot 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.029
 wide 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.470
 much more than Italian so I have 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.949
 decided that i like english decided 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.970
 to do a channel in English because 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.949
 trick or not that is short because there is one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.790
 have been people who can follow you though 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.950
 looking around for youtube 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.920
 youtube now because there are not many 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.010
 booked Italian hubers currently active 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.350
 however there are not enough 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.360
 so I thought I'd give some of one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.120
 push this community and maybe hope 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.800
 that somebody else wants to join me and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.000
 others also book to back that maybe up 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.390
 morning but who has not yet found 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.100
 because you know how he won because 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.710
 however there are then the field what 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.059
 I think both me many there are many 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.470
 but then that must interest them visa 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.659
 what has arrived on this channel is that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.460
 I love the books I have the room full of 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.990
 I always love books but today makes us 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.280
 collect them for two years more or less and it is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.850
 nothing I have this great passion 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.799
 I look everywhere on the internet for reading 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.710
 I collect them as I have already said and me 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.570
 like to discover new titles and then 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.520
 in short, there is life in books 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.240
 it's a thousand times better than the real one or 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.799
 in conclusion 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.079
 just think of all my kids that 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.549
 fall in love with the fashion shows that we have 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.200
 and in real life books not 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.790
 therefore there are no such things 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.790
 productive individual for the new channel 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.140
