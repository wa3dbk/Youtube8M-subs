00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.880 
out of the cage more than say an hour
and<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.959> better<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.260> have<00:02:44.379> them<00:02:44.500> sitting<00:02:44.709> on

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
and it's better to have them sitting on

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.890 
and it's better to have them sitting on
you<00:02:45.069> rather<00:02:45.370> than<00:02:45.580> sitting<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> couch<00:02:46.629> or

you rather than sitting on a couch or
something<00:02:47.080> because<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.530> knew<00:02:47.680> they'd<00:02:47.890> get<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
something because I knew they'd get the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.860 
something because I knew they'd get the

heat from you so it's a little bit

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.770 
heat from you so it's a little bit
better<00:02:50.020> for<00:02:50.319> them<00:02:50.440> but<00:02:51.430> yeah<00:02:52.239> overall<00:02:52.510> they're
