one<00:01:58.410> two<00:01:59.410> little<00:01:59.680> tabs<00:01:59.830> that<00:02:00.010> secure<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
one two little tabs that secure the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.300 
one two little tabs that secure the
front<00:02:00.670> face<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.150> speaker<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:02.310> pry

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
front face of the speaker and just pry

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.310 
front face of the speaker and just pry
that<00:02:03.670> up<00:02:04.950> pry<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.220> out<00:02:06.990> speaker<00:02:07.990> pulls<00:02:08.200> right

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
that up pry that out speaker pulls right

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.900 
that up pry that out speaker pulls right
out<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.619> our<00:02:08.740> housing<00:02:09.070> is<00:02:09.190> clean<00:02:09.429> now<00:02:09.640> ready

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
out so our housing is clean now ready

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.240 
out so our housing is clean now ready
for<00:02:10.000> our<00:02:10.090> new<00:02:10.270> driver<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.650> drop<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.040> there

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
for our new driver to the drop in there

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.160 
for our new driver to the drop in there
so<00:02:13.240> we<00:02:13.360> want<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.570> look<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.840> make<00:02:13.930> sure<00:02:13.959> these

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
so we want to look and make sure these

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.270 
so we want to look and make sure these
tabs<00:02:14.500> are<00:02:14.800> pushed<00:02:15.280> back<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:16.890> don't<00:02:17.890> break<00:02:18.130> them

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
tabs are pushed back in don't break them

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.500 
tabs are pushed back in don't break them
just<00:02:18.430> push<00:02:18.580> them<00:02:18.670> into<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:18.970> plane<00:02:19.239> with<00:02:19.420> her

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
just push them into a plane with her

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.300 
just push them into a plane with her
because<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.650> going<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.800> help<00:02:20.890> snap<00:02:21.160> in

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
because this is going to help snap in

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.940 
because this is going to help snap in
our<00:02:21.400> new<00:02:21.520> mid-range<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.410> we're<00:02:23.680> going<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.860> take

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
our new mid-range so we're going to take

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.180 
our new mid-range so we're going to take
our<00:02:24.070> BSW<00:02:24.430> mid-range<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:26.020> can<00:02:26.170> see<00:02:26.410> here

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
our BSW mid-range and you can see here

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.760 
our BSW mid-range and you can see here
there's<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.060> little<00:02:28.270> key<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.780> little<00:02:29.470> indention

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
there's a little key a little indention

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.220 
there's a little key a little indention
in<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> metal<00:02:30.340> ring<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.420> tweeter<00:02:31.660> around

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
in the metal ring on the tweeter around

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.780 
in the metal ring on the tweeter around
the<00:02:32.290> mid-range<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.280> key<00:02:33.489> with

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the mid-range it's going to key with

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.290 
the mid-range it's going to key with
this<00:02:34.030> groove<00:02:34.989> in<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.320> factory<00:02:35.650> speaker<00:02:36.300> it's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
this groove in the factory speaker it's

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.710 
this groove in the factory speaker it's
going<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.510> snap<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:37.959> there<00:02:38.080> like<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.720> we're

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
going to snap in there like so we're

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.050 
going to snap in there like so we're
pretty<00:02:40.870> anal<00:02:41.230> about<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:42.790> would<00:02:42.970> be

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
pretty anal about this this would be

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.520 
pretty anal about this this would be
fine<00:02:43.300> if<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.630> wanted<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.959> just<00:02:44.140> snap<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.440> in

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
fine if you wanted to just snap it in

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.380 
fine if you wanted to just snap it in
there<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.709> let<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:44.830> go<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.280> usually<00:02:45.910> put<00:02:46.090> little

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
there and let it go I usually put little

we're going to put our plug-and-play
connector<00:03:10.510> on<00:03:10.600> there<00:03:10.780> which<00:03:10.959> yours<00:03:11.350> will

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
connector on there which yours will

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.009

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
now we'll move over to the tweeter and

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.140 
now we'll move over to the tweeter and
go<00:03:16.690> over<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.989> tweeter<00:03:17.380> install<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:18.880> it's<00:03:19.030> the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
go over the tweeter install so it's the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.180 
go over the tweeter install so it's the
same<00:03:19.360> way<00:03:19.570> set<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.350> mid-range<00:03:20.620> driver<00:03:20.920> down

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
same way set the mid-range driver down

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.610 
same way set the mid-range driver down
carefully<00:03:21.600> tweeter<00:03:22.600> it's<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.140> little<00:03:23.350> bit<00:03:23.470> more

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
carefully tweeter it's a little bit more

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.690 
carefully tweeter it's a little bit more
difficult<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.100> work<00:03:24.220> with<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.489> tweeter

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
difficult to work with the tweeter

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.009 
difficult to work with the tweeter
because<00:03:24.910> there's<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:25.330> much<00:03:25.480> room<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.720> hold

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
because there's not so much room to hold

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.229 
because there's not so much room to hold
it<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.320> can<00:03:26.860> see<00:03:26.980> BMW<00:03:27.489> glues<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.060> there

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
it you can see BMW glues it in there

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.199 
it you can see BMW glues it in there
just<00:03:28.540> blobs<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.170> brown<00:03:29.470> glue<00:03:29.799> down<00:03:30.010> there<00:03:30.310> so

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
just blobs of brown glue down there so

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.610 
just blobs of brown glue down there so
what<00:03:31.390> we've<00:03:31.510> got<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.750> do<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.019> kind<00:03:32.200> of<00:03:32.290> pry<00:03:32.440> that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
what we've got to do is kind of pry that

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.069 
what we've got to do is kind of pry that
out<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.160> similar<00:03:33.519> fashion<00:03:33.900> we're<00:03:34.900> going<00:03:35.019> to

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
out in a similar fashion we're going to

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.289 
out in a similar fashion we're going to
take<00:03:35.200> our<00:03:35.320> straight<00:03:35.560> pick<00:03:36.060> pry<00:03:37.060> out<00:03:37.269> the

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
take our straight pick pry out the
