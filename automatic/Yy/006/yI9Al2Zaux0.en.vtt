product so instead of using meat we're
going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.620> use<00:02:57.770> some<00:02:58.010> high-protein<00:02:58.670> walnuts

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
going to use some high-protein walnuts

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:14.010 
going to use some high-protein walnuts
and<00:03:02.470> throw<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.590> some<00:03:03.850> carrots<00:03:06.670> some<00:03:08.260> celery

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:26.790 

green<00:03:15.020> onion<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.840> then<00:03:18.050> some<00:03:18.500> fresh<00:03:19.220> cilantro

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.020 

we're<00:03:27.800> going<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.010> pulse<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.610> I'm<00:03:28.850> actually

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
we're going to pulse this I'm actually

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.520 
we're going to pulse this I'm actually
not<00:03:29.390> going<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.660> process<00:03:29.930> I'm<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:30.350> going<00:03:30.470> to

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
not going to process I'm just going to

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.110 
not going to process I'm just going to
pulse<00:03:30.740> it<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:31.010> break<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.340> down<00:03:31.490> until<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:31.970> gets

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
pulse it to break it down until it gets

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:42.340 
pulse it to break it down until it gets
to<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:32.330> consistency<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.320> like<00:03:41.350> always

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
to a consistency that I like always

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.130 
to a consistency that I like always
check<00:03:42.830> I<00:03:43.160> see<00:03:44.000> this<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.270> very<00:03:44.480> chunky<00:03:44.810> right

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
check I see this is very chunky right

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.070 
check I see this is very chunky right
now<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:46.090> want<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.150> get<00:03:47.300> it<00:03:47.390> down<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.600> sort<00:03:48.020> of

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
now I want to get it down to sort of

00:03:48.080 --> 00:04:05.590 
now I want to get it down to sort of
like<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.230> minced<00:03:48.620> meat<00:04:02.680> there<00:04:03.680> we<00:04:04.010> go<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:05.570> is

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
like a minced meat there we go that is

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.630 
like a minced meat there we go that is
perfect<00:04:06.200> everything<00:04:06.590> is<00:04:06.739> mixed<00:04:06.920> together

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
perfect everything is mixed together

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.180 
perfect everything is mixed together
I<00:04:07.840> like<00:04:08.840> uniformity<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.739> way<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:09.950> know<00:04:10.160> that

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
I like uniformity that way you know that

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.270 
I like uniformity that way you know that
the<00:04:10.310> flavors<00:04:10.790> are<00:04:10.880> distributed<00:04:11.420> evenly<00:04:12.280> okay

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
the flavors are distributed evenly okay

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.729 
the flavors are distributed evenly okay
so<00:04:14.270> that<00:04:14.450> is<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.810> meat<00:04:15.050> of<00:04:15.200> our<00:04:15.320> Thai<00:04:15.560> lettuce

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
so that is the meat of our Thai lettuce

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.460 
so that is the meat of our Thai lettuce
wraps<00:04:16.269> we<00:04:17.269> have<00:04:17.419> some<00:04:17.600> butter<00:04:17.840> lettuce<00:04:18.079> here

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
wraps we have some butter lettuce here

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.930 
wraps we have some butter lettuce here
let's<00:04:18.799> take<00:04:19.160> perfect<00:04:19.640> little<00:04:20.359> cups<00:04:21.730> lay<00:04:22.730> them

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
let's take perfect little cups lay them

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.560 
let's take perfect little cups lay them
out<00:04:24.040> you<00:04:25.040> can<00:04:25.070> use<00:04:25.250> romaine<00:04:25.820> lettuce<00:04:26.030> as<00:04:26.360> well

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
out you can use romaine lettuce as well

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.140 
out you can use romaine lettuce as well
I<00:04:26.600> just<00:04:27.020> particularly<00:04:27.500> like<00:04:27.680> this<00:04:28.150> lettuce

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
I just particularly like this lettuce

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.530 
I just particularly like this lettuce
because<00:04:29.540> you<00:04:29.630> can<00:04:29.780> fold<00:04:30.020> over<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:30.470> hold<00:04:31.540> the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
because you can fold over and hold the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:40.900 
because you can fold over and hold the
cups<00:04:32.810> when<00:04:33.080> they're<00:04:33.229> done<00:04:34.330> there<00:04:35.330> we<00:04:35.419> go<00:04:39.910> let's

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
cups when they're done there we go let's

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:53.020 
cups when they're done there we go let's
spoon<00:04:41.570> in<00:04:41.780> some<00:04:42.050> of<00:04:42.140> our<00:04:42.229> meat

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.120 

I've<00:04:54.020> never<00:04:54.200> really<00:04:54.380> thought<00:04:54.470> this<00:04:54.890> through

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
I've never really thought this through

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.920 
I've never really thought this through
but<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.400> think<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:56.120> probably<00:04:56.480> will<00:04:56.720> make

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
but I think that it probably will make

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.670 
but I think that it probably will make
about<00:04:57.170> eight<00:04:58.720> six<00:04:59.720> to<00:04:59.930> eight<00:05:00.140> lettuce<00:05:00.500> leaves

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
about eight six to eight lettuce leaves

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.200 
about eight six to eight lettuce leaves
really<00:05:00.830> depends<00:05:01.340> on<00:05:01.430> how<00:05:01.640> much<00:05:01.790> meat<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.090> put

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
really depends on how much meat you put

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:14.200 
really depends on how much meat you put
on<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.660> I<00:05:02.840> should<00:05:03.770> say<00:05:03.920> nut<00:05:04.190> meat<00:05:08.950> go

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.499 

that's<00:05:14.990> pretty<00:05:15.229> Hardy<00:05:15.590> there<00:05:17.020> spread<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.050> out

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
that's pretty Hardy there spread it out

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.999
