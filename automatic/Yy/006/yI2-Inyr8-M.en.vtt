00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
the bantu knots came out really like a

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.110 
the bantu knots came out really like a
lot<00:06:44.470> better<00:06:44.889> with<00:06:45.190> three<00:06:45.400> strand<00:06:45.789> twists

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
lot better with three strand twists

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.670 
lot better with three strand twists
instead<00:06:46.389> of<00:06:46.509> two<00:06:46.660> strand<00:06:46.990> twists<00:06:47.380> like<00:06:47.440> there

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
instead of two strand twists like there

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.140 
instead of two strand twists like there
was<00:06:47.770> more<00:06:47.949> definition<00:06:48.610> and<00:06:48.729> I<00:06:48.789> felt<00:06:49.030> like<00:06:49.090> my

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
was more definition and I felt like my

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.110 
was more definition and I felt like my
hair<00:06:49.389> was<00:06:49.509> a<00:06:49.539> little<00:06:49.599> more<00:06:49.870> stretched<00:06:50.229> too<00:06:51.120> so

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120
