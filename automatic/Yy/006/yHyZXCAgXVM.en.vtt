well<00:01:27.290> it<00:01:27.350> depends<00:01:27.680> on<00:01:27.890> if<00:01:28.040> we<00:01:28.220> have<00:01:28.370> troubles

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
well it depends on if we have troubles

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.430 
well it depends on if we have troubles
but<00:01:29.060> I<00:01:29.300> use<00:01:29.510> it<00:01:29.540> on<00:01:29.840> one<00:01:30.500> song<00:01:30.890> but<00:01:31.220> it's<00:01:31.729> in

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.180 

this<00:04:28.330> one<00:04:30.090> yeah<00:04:31.230> this<00:04:32.230> one<00:04:32.560> yeah

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
this one yeah this one yeah

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.970 
this one yeah this one yeah
is<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.300> Jackson<00:04:35.520> Jackson<00:04:36.520> guitar<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.980> the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
is it a Jackson Jackson guitar and the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.820 
is it a Jackson Jackson guitar and the
reason<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.400> have<00:04:39.550> this<00:04:39.850> it's<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.870> sustainer<00:04:41.440> I

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
reason I have this it's a sustainer I

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.540 
reason I have this it's a sustainer I
use<00:04:42.790> on<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.450> song<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.170> I<00:04:44.200> needed<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.710> sustainer

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
use on a song so I needed a sustainer

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.150 
use on a song so I needed a sustainer
but<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.420> guess<00:04:46.750> sustainers<00:04:47.350> are<00:04:47.500> very<00:04:47.680> hard<00:04:47.950> to

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
but I guess sustainers are very hard to

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.790 
but I guess sustainers are very hard to
you<00:04:49.060> know<00:04:49.120> you<00:04:49.210> got<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.510> dig<00:04:49.930> them<00:04:50.110> all<00:04:50.230> out<00:04:50.500> and

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
you know you got to dig them all out and

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.090 
you know you got to dig them all out and
it's<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:51.070> lot<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:52.200> you<00:04:53.200> know<00:04:53.230> electronics<00:04:54.010> you

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
it's a lot of you know electronics you

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.100 
it's a lot of you know electronics you
have<00:04:54.160> to<00:04:54.340> go<00:04:54.460> through<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.790> lot<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.150> carving<00:04:55.720> and

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
have to go through a lot of carving and

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.270 
have to go through a lot of carving and
stuff<00:04:56.290> like<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.830> didn't<00:04:57.010> want<00:04:57.130> to<00:04:57.220> do
