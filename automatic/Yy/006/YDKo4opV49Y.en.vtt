00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.410 
forgot the best part you know what I
want<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.340> we're<00:00:47.730> gonna<00:00:47.789> blind

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
want to do with this we're gonna blind

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.979 
want to do with this we're gonna blind
bake<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.230> blind<00:00:50.219> bake<00:00:50.700> means<00:00:51.030> before<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.600> put

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
bake this blind bake means before I put

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.350 
bake this blind bake means before I put
those<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> partially<00:00:54.059> cook

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
those on I'm going to partially cook

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.510 
those on I'm going to partially cook
this<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.410> reason<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.280> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this and the reason I want to do that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.510 
this and the reason I want to do that
it's<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.840> put<00:00:58.079> those<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:58.739> they

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it's because if I put those on now they

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
it's because if I put those on now they
would<00:00:59.699> burn<00:00:59.969> before<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> pizza<00:01:01.230> crust<00:01:01.469> was

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
would burn before the pizza crust was

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.709 
would burn before the pizza crust was
cooked<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.820> not<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> good<00:01:03.300> idea

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
cooked so if that is not a good idea

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.090 
cooked so if that is not a good idea
so<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:05.100> goes<00:01:05.750> I've<00:01:06.750> got<00:01:07.260> my<00:01:07.740> stone

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
so in this goes I've got my stone

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
so in this goes I've got my stone
preheated<00:01:08.939> i<00:01:10.760> reduced<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> temperature<00:01:12.119> from

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
preheated i reduced the temperature from

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.030 
preheated i reduced the temperature from
500<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> 450<00:01:14.580> there's<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:15.090> stone<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:16.710> one

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.800 
500 to 450 there's my stone and with one
yank<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:18.350> leave<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> oven<00:01:20.810> thinking

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
yank I leave that in the oven thinking

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.109 
yank I leave that in the oven thinking
all<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.560> time<00:01:22.590> about<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> put

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
all the time about what I'm going to put

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.469 
all the time about what I'm going to put
on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> top<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.850> only<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> take

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
on the top so this is only going to take

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
on the top so this is only going to take
maybe<00:01:27.780> 10<00:01:28.229> minutes<00:01:28.590> at<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> most<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.159> don't

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
maybe 10 minutes at the most you don't

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
maybe 10 minutes at the most you don't
want<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.820> fully<00:01:30.150> fully<00:01:30.570> baked<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.829> you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
want it to be fully fully baked so you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.179 
want it to be fully fully baked so you
get<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.490> peel<00:01:33.270> underneath<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.799> parchment

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
get your peel underneath that parchment

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.719 
get your peel underneath that parchment
paper<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.770> why<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.520> called

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
paper and this is why now it's called

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
paper and this is why now it's called
blind<00:01:39.119> bake<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.590> still

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
blind bake because you see it's still

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.280 
blind bake because you see it's still
not<00:01:41.310> fully<00:01:41.700> cooked<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.329> partially<00:01:42.990> cooked

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
not fully cooked it's partially cooked

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.160 
not fully cooked it's partially cooked
now<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.549> put<00:01:44.729> those<00:01:44.880> tomatoes<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.899> top

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
now I can put those tomatoes on the top

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.230 
now I can put those tomatoes on the top
so<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.810> sun-dried<00:01:48.810> tomatoes<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.240> these

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
