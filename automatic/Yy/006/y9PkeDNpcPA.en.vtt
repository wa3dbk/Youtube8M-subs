00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
is probably going to be more valuable

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
my shelves where they can do the most

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.670 
my shelves where they can do the most
good<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:13.970> here<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.240> t30<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:15.970> I<00:05:16.970> fire<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:18.590> I

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
good and here this t30 and I fire and I

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.970 
good and here this t30 and I fire and I
thought<00:05:18.860> I<00:05:18.920> killed<00:05:19.250> him<00:05:20.650> but<00:05:21.650> it<00:05:21.740> was<00:05:21.830> actually

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
thought I killed him but it was actually

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.940 
thought I killed him but it was actually
r<00:05:22.250> is<00:05:22.550> for<00:05:22.760> we<00:05:22.940> got<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.150> killing<00:05:23.390> blow<00:05:23.800> now<00:05:24.800> on

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
r is for we got the killing blow now on

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.409 
r is for we got the killing blow now on
can't<00:05:25.220> win<00:05:25.310> away<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:26.500> there<00:05:27.500> we<00:05:27.560> go<00:05:27.680> game<00:05:27.980> over

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.850 

didn't<00:05:32.419> do<00:05:32.540> as<00:05:32.660> well<00:05:32.690> as<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:33.020> thought<00:05:33.230> I<00:05:33.290> had<00:05:33.650> I

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
didn't do as well as I thought I had I

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.470 
didn't do as well as I thought I had I
was<00:05:34.250> certain<00:05:34.580> I'd<00:05:34.640> hit<00:05:34.790> more<00:05:34.970> targets<00:05:35.390> than

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
was certain I'd hit more targets than

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.450 
was certain I'd hit more targets than
that<00:05:35.950> but<00:05:36.950> there<00:05:37.040> were<00:05:37.100> a<00:05:37.130> couple<00:05:37.160> occasions

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
that but there were a couple occasions

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.370 
that but there were a couple occasions
where<00:05:37.880> as<00:05:38.000> my<00:05:38.090> shell<00:05:38.300> was<00:05:38.419> in<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.600> end<00:05:38.750> you

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
where as my shell was in the end you

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.590 
where as my shell was in the end you
know<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.590> other<00:05:39.710> tank<00:05:39.890> died<00:05:40.390> not<00:05:41.390> what<00:05:41.540> you

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
know the other tank died not what you

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.260 
know the other tank died not what you
could<00:05:41.720> do<00:05:41.840> about<00:05:41.870> that<00:05:42.080> but<00:05:43.000> there's<00:05:44.000> the<00:05:44.120> gun

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
could do about that but there's the gun

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.480 
could do about that but there's the gun
on<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.480> e<00:05:44.510> 50<00:05:44.690> again<00:05:45.020> 14<00:05:45.410> shots<00:05:45.620> fired<00:05:45.950> 13<00:05:46.400> hit

the target a couple of them didn't

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.540 
the target a couple of them didn't
penetrate<00:05:48.620> that's<00:05:48.950> really<00:05:49.370> unlucky

dodgy<00:05:51.770> angles<00:05:52.750> nothing<00:05:53.750> you<00:05:53.810> can<00:05:53.930> do<00:05:54.020> about

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
dodgy angles nothing you can do about

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.700 
dodgy angles nothing you can do about
that<00:05:54.850> but<00:05:55.850> more<00:05:56.060> impressively<00:05:56.750> we<00:05:57.200> took<00:05:57.350> seven

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
that but more impressively we took seven

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.520 
that but more impressively we took seven
hits<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.010> didn't<00:05:58.280> die<00:05:59.140> got<00:06:00.140> a<00:06:00.169> number<00:06:00.440> of

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
hits and didn't die got a number of

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.219 
hits and didn't die got a number of
bounces<00:06:00.710> they're<00:06:01.130> used<00:06:01.490> cover<00:06:02.140> however<00:06:03.140> that

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
bounces they're used cover however that

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.070 
bounces they're used cover however that
was<00:06:03.470> what<00:06:03.620> saved<00:06:03.830> my<00:06:04.070> ass<00:06:04.870> most<00:06:05.870> of<00:06:05.990> those

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
was what saved my ass most of those

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.020 
was what saved my ass most of those
shots<00:06:06.290> that<00:06:06.620> did<00:06:06.919> hit<00:06:07.130> me<00:06:07.280> a<00:06:07.430> lot<00:06:07.790> of<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:07.940> money

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
shots that did hit me a lot of the money

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.880 
shots that did hit me a lot of the money
took<00:06:08.270> my<00:06:08.360> tracks<00:06:08.630> out<00:06:08.810> or<00:06:09.080> they<00:06:09.530> bounced<00:06:09.890> off

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
took my tracks out or they bounced off

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.510 
took my tracks out or they bounced off
my<00:06:10.010> upper<00:06:10.340> glacis<00:06:10.570> just<00:06:11.570> due<00:06:11.750> to<00:06:11.780> angling<00:06:12.520> and

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
my upper glacis just due to angling and

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.010 
my upper glacis just due to angling and
it<00:06:13.669> is<00:06:13.790> quite<00:06:14.000> a<00:06:14.060> tough<00:06:14.330> little<00:06:14.479> machine<00:06:14.870> the<00:06:14.990> e

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
it is quite a tough little machine the e

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.020 
it is quite a tough little machine the e
50<00:06:15.290> but<00:06:15.890> it's<00:06:16.040> you<00:06:16.310> know<00:06:16.430> it's<00:06:16.460> far<00:06:16.790> from

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
50 but it's you know it's far from

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.409 
50 but it's you know it's far from
invulnerable<00:06:18.400> it's<00:06:19.400> well<00:06:19.940> armored<00:06:20.270> for<00:06:20.390> a

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
invulnerable it's well armored for a

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.060 
invulnerable it's well armored for a
medium<00:06:20.690> tank<00:06:20.900> but<00:06:21.140> it<00:06:21.260> certainly<00:06:21.620> not<00:06:21.890> up<00:06:22.010> to

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
medium tank but it certainly not up to

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.560 
medium tank but it certainly not up to
heavy<00:06:22.220> tanks<00:06:22.460> standards<00:06:22.820> and<00:06:22.970> you<00:06:23.150> do<00:06:23.270> have<00:06:23.419> to

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
heavy tanks standards and you do have to

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.960 
heavy tanks standards and you do have to
angle<00:06:23.720> it<00:06:23.990> and<00:06:24.710> if<00:06:24.800> you<00:06:24.919> do<00:06:25.070> angling<00:06:25.460> you<00:06:25.729> will

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
angle it and if you do angling you will

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.320 
angle it and if you do angling you will
find<00:06:26.240> it<00:06:26.390> becomes<00:06:26.630> a<00:06:26.720> lot<00:06:26.870> more<00:06:26.930> survivable

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
find it becomes a lot more survivable

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.630 
find it becomes a lot more survivable
the<00:06:29.330> gun<00:06:29.479> however<00:06:29.840> is<00:06:30.550> spectacularly<00:06:31.550> good

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
the gun however is spectacularly good

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.140 
the gun however is spectacularly good
but<00:06:32.540> you'd<00:06:32.660> expect<00:06:32.990> that<00:06:33.110> it's<00:06:33.290> a<00:06:33.350> German<00:06:33.710> tank

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
but you'd expect that it's a German tank

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.190 
but you'd expect that it's a German tank
and<00:06:35.150> that's<00:06:35.330> pretty<00:06:35.479> much<00:06:35.600> the<00:06:35.690> hallmark<00:06:36.110> of

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
and that's pretty much the hallmark of

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.840 
and that's pretty much the hallmark of
all<00:06:36.320> the<00:06:36.410> German<00:06:36.710> tanks<00:06:36.950> other<00:06:37.430> than<00:06:37.580> that<00:06:37.640> you

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
all the German tanks other than that you

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.200 
all the German tanks other than that you
100<00:06:38.330> and<00:06:39.370> this<00:06:40.370> is<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.550> kind<00:06:40.729> of<00:06:40.760> result<00:06:41.090> you

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
100 and this is the kind of result you

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.420 
100 and this is the kind of result you
can<00:06:41.240> generally<00:06:41.600> expect<00:06:41.990> to<00:06:42.080> get<00:06:42.280> that<00:06:43.280> we<00:06:43.370> get

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
can generally expect to get that we get

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.820 
can generally expect to get that we get
the<00:06:43.580> battle<00:06:43.820> metals<00:06:44.090> no<00:06:44.690> not<00:06:44.930> this<00:06:45.050> time<00:06:45.110> never
