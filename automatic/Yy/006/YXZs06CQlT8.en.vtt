 final of nba opponent san antonio to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.720
 yvelinois who was trained in versailles 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 and who tried his luck 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.960
 overseas a few years ago 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.329
 I want to talk about jonathan 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.370
 hello to you thank you for us 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.530
 welcome in this stadium the stadium without 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 worries to versailles as I said you 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.790
 have tried his luck in the United States ago 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.739
 three years explain me a little bit 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.289
 choice actually to have to be gone there 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.809
 low actually it sure wanted to leave because 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.329
 the ball the basketball and the studies his 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.730
 relay actually when I barge it in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.399
 a school by a club so not necessarily 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730
 the classes the grade level to follow 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.730
 so 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.289
 it's still basketball is the states 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.480
 united so always wanted to go there 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.549
 it's the dream for any basketball player who 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.070
 respect himself for playing a day maybe 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.630
 in nba good for now you rn6 and the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.650
 university format yes good it's not ok 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.850
 that you had better player of all 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.409
 way that you were trained I said it to 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.210
 versailles you did your range 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.130
 to hear it the chesnay-versailles you in 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 keep a good memory of the Berlin club 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.140
 yes a very good memory I go there 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.600
 more a game but after second year 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.040
 grows until cadets and it was 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.900
 really good memories were made there 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.189
 works a lot of things 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.990
 we do not necessarily go to the united states 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.329
 but who are really and socially for a 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.310
 basketball player we will come after 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.530
 it's on this difference between the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.670
 European and American system but I 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.070
 wanted to know a little bit first 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 course how did you get in addition 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.720
 atlantic between the chesnay and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.399
 versailles and the united states that has 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.790
 he passed 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.799
 I made a camp at dijon I was 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.570
 recruited to go to play besançon who 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.710
 did not know that pro b advances in 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.909
 news 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.390
 I went 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.859
 then in the cadet force on plan 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.979
 de France I trained with the 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:11.039
 professionals india after need 53 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.110
 so I have a prey hope and the year 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.420
 next I was lucky to leave 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.400
 in a school I will have videos of 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.319
 months that this loan this climb she 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.700
 is pretty impressive 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.610
 you have progressed since your departure 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.299
 of versailles you are almost 22 years old 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.049
 today 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.620
 you have a few years in full how 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.480
 you found the American system the ba 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.829
 I still have a child I work 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.150
 a lot that is to say that I 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.069
 I trained a lot sell by myself 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.340
 and bass and mostly based his work 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.470
 so I like it and the style 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.959
 game is faster more athletic 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.540
 and that's my type of game in this match 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.190
 it sticks you talked about the importance 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.900
 basketball schools 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.359
 what are you doing next to basketball 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.690

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.680
 every day evening workouts 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.430
 university championship we're talking 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.380
 often in europe it's the best 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.920
 World University Championship in 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.540
 United States 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.069
 it seems to have a weapon 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.980
 it's amazing in this country does 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.690
 really that I ordinary bump ago 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.280
 matches in front of thousands of 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.380
 people 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.760
 cm was the prey in France is 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.700
 to say that there is the madness market in 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.290
 mass alas all the united states becomes 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.970
 blur for a month they watch that 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.250
 basketball for a month it's really 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.500
 something that there is not a man to 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.560
 side of his American championships killed 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.239
 also selected you have already been 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.790
 selected in the national team but not 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.739
 in France since you play for the coast 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.819
 ivory 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.930
 how did these selections go? 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.030
 what is your best memory 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.880
 maybe my best memory is 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.950
 true that last year we played 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.389
 against the France team in France at 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.730
 toulouse 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:01.250
 I played fraud 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.349
 it's so beautiful memory there was in 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.010
 face tony parker who did not play but 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.390
 he was there with boris diaw ronny turiaf 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.769
 colo frankly it was a beautiful 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.379
 memory 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.510
 this year you were nominated in a 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.769
 rather special contest 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.250
 United States is the contest of the most 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.380
 beautiful dunk 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.299
 what did you do in this 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.709
 contest what is your result I finished 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.720
 in the course of the years I lost in 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.560
 semi final against the winner who 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.840
 was at syracuse 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.240
 people voted for me it was 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.320
 really nice especially in France and I 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.590
 had a lot of support it was really 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.770
 cool 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.970
 is this championship you think 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.740
 that it can be a stepping stone for the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.210
 following your career 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.530
 it can help yes for sure I'm in 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.750
 second division it's not the first 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.729
 but of course it can help 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.340
 there are players who played with me 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.449
 who now plays professionals so 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.699
 for sure it can be something 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.260
 interesting for the future your future 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.930
 that he envisions as in nba 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.150
 is it still playable or more 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.229
 a return to europe eg otto 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.300
 rahn I think it would be good I 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.090
 do not think the nba's habit for me 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.580
 it's a dream I do not think I think 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.990
 rather to play then in europe or 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.880
 elsewhere in the world 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.490
 in a professional championship 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.979
 how did you experience this final between 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.889
 san antonio and and miami a final 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.490
 very intense match 7 in the final we can 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.560
 not dream better 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.479
 both teams played until the 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.130
 last minute it was for a 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.419
 basketball player all basketball player frankly 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.610

 models I imagine yes well my player 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.900
