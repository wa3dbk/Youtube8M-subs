hi I have a power winch class 36 and it

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.200 
hi I have a power winch class 36 and it
just<00:00:07.020> stopped<00:00:07.319> working<00:00:07.730> so<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.790> took<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> a

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
just stopped working so I took it to a

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.910 
just stopped working so I took it to a
rebuilding<00:00:09.719> shop<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.230> they<00:00:10.559> wanted<00:00:10.860> to

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.690 
charge me all kinds of crazy money and I
figured<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.929> know<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.740> was<00:00:13.950> almost<00:00:14.340> paid

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
figured you know what it was almost paid

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.560

to<00:00:14.849> buy<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> new<00:00:15.240> one

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
to buy a new one

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.920

so I took it apart and I found this

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080 
so I took it apart and I found this
motor<00:00:19.199> was<00:00:19.980> frozen<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.580> place

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090

hooked<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> power<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.529> was<00:00:22.650> dead<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.310> I

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
hooked it to the power it was dead so I

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.609 
hooked it to the power it was dead so I
got<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> little<00:00:23.699> jump<00:00:24.000> box<00:00:24.210> he's<00:00:24.390> dead<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.590> that

that<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.219> wouldn't<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.240> seen<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.450> if<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.750> didn't

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that I wouldn't have seen it if I didn't

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
that I wouldn't have seen it if I didn't
make<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.259> video<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.860> almost<00:02:05.040> left<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.549> out<00:02:05.700> see

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
make this video I almost left it out see

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.320 
make this video I almost left it out see
that<00:02:06.719> spring<00:02:06.990> goes<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.530> shaft<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that spring goes on that shaft and it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.559 
that spring goes on that shaft and it
kind<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.690> holds<00:02:09.959> likea<00:02:10.730> up<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.090> guess<00:02:12.270> it's<00:02:12.480> like

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
kind of holds likea up I guess it's like

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.890 
kind of holds likea up I guess it's like
a<00:02:12.629> release<00:02:13.050> care<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.440> some

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
a release care of some

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.640 
a release care of some
and<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.680> whole<00:02:15.129> thing<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.840> drops<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.410> place

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and the whole thing just drops in place

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.430 
and the whole thing just drops in place
and<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:20.260> gear<00:02:20.560> goes<00:02:20.769> on<00:02:20.980> top<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.540> it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
and then this gear goes on top and it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.869 
and then this gear goes on top and it
actually<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.950> can't<00:02:24.160> put<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.400> gear<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:24.700> top

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
actually I can't put that gear on top

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.390 
actually I can't put that gear on top
yet<00:02:25.120> until<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> put<00:02:26.140> these<00:02:26.319> bolts<00:02:27.099> in<00:02:27.400> place<00:02:28.080> but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
yet until I put these bolts in place but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.070 
yet until I put these bolts in place but
either<00:02:30.400> way<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.879> was<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.060> very<00:02:31.390> easy<00:02:31.660> thing<00:02:32.049> to

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
either way it was a very easy thing to

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.699 
either way it was a very easy thing to
do<00:02:32.379> and<00:02:32.640> I'm<00:02:33.640> happy<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:35.230> could<00:02:35.410> put<00:02:35.590> this

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
do and I'm happy so you could put this

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.960 
do and I'm happy so you could put this
back<00:02:35.980> together<00:02:36.190> yourself

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
back together yourself

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.180 
back together yourself
push<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.660> two<00:02:37.840> wires<00:02:38.080> out<00:02:38.379> of<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.560> grommet<00:02:39.069> in

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
push the two wires out of the grommet in

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.589 
push the two wires out of the grommet in
the<00:02:39.220> bottom<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.730> could<00:02:39.879> replace<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.390> motor

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
the bottom you could replace the motor

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.559 
the bottom you could replace the motor
it's<00:02:40.810> not<00:02:41.049> all<00:02:41.500> these<00:02:41.950> complicated<00:02:42.700> gears<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
it's not all these complicated gears and

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.150 
it's not all these complicated gears and
you're<00:02:43.780> not<00:02:43.930> going<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.379> figure<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.799> out<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.069> was

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
you're not going to figure it out it was

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
you're not going to figure it out it was
very<00:02:45.549> easy<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:46.810> do<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.620> outside<00:02:48.040> goes<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.489> -

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
very easy to do the outside goes on -

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
very easy to do the outside goes on -
like<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:51.190> these<00:02:51.370> allen<00:02:51.790> keys<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.360> that

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
like that with these allen keys and that

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.550 
like that with these allen keys and that
was<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.650> was<00:02:53.769> done<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.360> just<00:02:56.200> wanted<00:02:56.440> to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
was it it was done so I just wanted to

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.080 
was it it was done so I just wanted to
make<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.860> quick<00:02:57.099> video<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:57.549> anyone<00:02:57.819> has<00:02:57.940> to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
make that quick video if anyone has to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.030 
make that quick video if anyone has to
fix<00:02:58.299> one<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.629> these<00:02:58.750> 51<00:02:59.379> dollars<00:02:59.769> for<00:02:59.950> the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
fix one of these 51 dollars for the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.309 
fix one of these 51 dollars for the
replacement<00:03:00.370> motor<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.780> comes<00:03:01.989> with<00:03:02.200> the

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
replacement motor and it comes with the

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.410 
replacement motor and it comes with the
gear<00:03:02.640> hopefully<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.819> was<00:03:03.940> helpful<00:03:03.970> if

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
gear hopefully that was helpful if

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.979 
gear hopefully that was helpful if
someone<00:03:04.829> wants<00:03:05.829> to<00:03:05.860> try<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.190> out<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:07.690> just

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
someone wants to try it out this just

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.559 
someone wants to try it out this just
sits<00:03:08.230> on<00:03:08.410> top<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.549> pushes<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.360> just

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
sits on top and it pushes and it just

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.199 
sits on top and it pushes and it just
slaps<00:03:10.900> right<00:03:11.170> on<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.590> see<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.489> gear<00:03:12.670> turns<00:03:12.970> it

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
slaps right on and see the gear turns it

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.150 
slaps right on and see the gear turns it
and<00:03:13.390> all<00:03:13.540> those<00:03:13.720> gears<00:03:13.930> inside<00:03:14.349> turns<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.890> lot

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
and all those gears inside turns a lot

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.580 
and all those gears inside turns a lot
slower<00:03:15.489> because<00:03:15.819> it's<00:03:16.000> gear<00:03:16.239> reduction<00:03:16.780> and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
slower because it's gear reduction and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.590 
slower because it's gear reduction and
that's<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.980> hope<00:03:18.670> that<00:03:18.880> helped<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.209> guys<00:03:19.299> out

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
that's it hope that helped you guys out

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.879 
that's it hope that helped you guys out
if<00:03:19.780> you're<00:03:19.900> thinking<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.290> trying<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.530> rebuild

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
if you're thinking of trying to rebuild

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.800 
if you're thinking of trying to rebuild
it<00:03:21.069> give<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.850> shot<00:03:22.060> it's<00:03:22.389> not<00:03:22.540> all<00:03:22.660> that

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
it give it a shot it's not all that

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.049 
it give it a shot it's not all that
complicated
