having to raise the rates he went on by

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.480 
having to raise the rates he went on by

saying the euro is not doing so well and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.880 
saying the euro is not doing so well and
what<00:02:00.630> would<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> member<00:02:01.170> came<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.500> close<00:02:01.740> it

was 67 cents get more girls down with

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.949 
was 67 cents get more girls down with
your<00:02:06.450> dollar<00:02:06.860> because<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:09.060> euro<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.600> not

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
your dollar because the euro is not

doing so well and I guess that says the
US<00:02:13.830> dollar<00:02:14.190> price<00:02:14.550> action<00:02:15.209> versus<00:02:15.540> other

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
currencies are going to keep its same

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.030 
currencies are going to keep its same
direction<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.050> markets<00:02:22.050> never<00:02:22.440> change

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
direction and that markets never change

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.420 
direction and that markets never change
that<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.970> going<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> case<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.709> mean

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
that this is going to be the case I mean

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.310 
that this is going to be the case I mean
this<00:02:26.550> would<00:02:26.700> be<00:02:26.790> going<00:02:27.060> against<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.630> history

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
this would be going against the history

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.380 
this would be going against the history

of the other elliott wave theory because

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.449 
of the other elliott wave theory because
history<00:02:30.720> tells<00:02:31.080> us<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.290> markets<00:02:31.770> go<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:32.100> and

they go down they go up they go down and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
they go down they go up they go down and

then the elliott wave theory can give

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.250 
then the elliott wave theory can give
