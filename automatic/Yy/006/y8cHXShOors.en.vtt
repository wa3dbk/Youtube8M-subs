00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
I was trying to do in last five or six

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.719 
I was trying to do in last five or six
years<00:01:49.970> these<00:01:50.970> are<00:01:51.420> extremely<00:01:52.020> difficult

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
years these are extremely difficult

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.080 
years these are extremely difficult
tournaments<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> win<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.270> often<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:55.440> come

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
tournaments to win and often they come

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.420 
tournaments to win and often they come
you<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.210> n<00:01:57.360> D<00:01:57.509> Wells<00:01:57.540> Miami<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.680> right

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
you know n D Wells Miami you know right

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.450 
you know n D Wells Miami you know right
after<00:01:59.610> one<00:01:59.970> another<00:02:00.290> obviously<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
after one another obviously here the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.510 
after one another obviously here the
same<00:02:02.700> thing<00:02:03.000> Rome<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.780> Madrid<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:05.040> well<00:02:05.310> he

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
same thing Rome and Madrid as well he

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
same thing Rome and Madrid as well he
come<00:02:05.759> one<00:02:06.360> after<00:02:06.570> another<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.290> think<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.710> very

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
come one after another I think it's very

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.650 
come one after another I think it's very
difficult<00:02:08.070> that's<00:02:08.820> why<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.390> he<00:02:09.479> were

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
difficult that's why I think if he were

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.900 
difficult that's why I think if he were
to<00:02:09.959> achieve<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.530> i<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.070> tremendous

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
to achieve it i think it's a tremendous

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.060 
to achieve it i think it's a tremendous
effort<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.780> guess<00:02:13.170> winning<00:02:13.470> Cincinnati<00:02:13.920> for

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
effort I guess winning Cincinnati for

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.160 
effort I guess winning Cincinnati for
him<00:02:14.220> would<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:15.000> great<00:02:15.540> achievement<00:02:15.630> because

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
him would be a great achievement because

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.380 
him would be a great achievement because
I<00:02:16.560> don't<00:02:17.310> think<00:02:17.459> anybody<00:02:17.610> has<00:02:17.850> done<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.060> before

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
I don't think anybody has done it before

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.030 
I don't think anybody has done it before
so<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.810> always<00:02:18.959> nice<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.260> be<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.590> first<00:02:19.860> guy

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
so it's always nice to be the first guy

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.730

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
very difficult up there a long side of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.990 
very difficult up there a long side of

winning four majors it's it's a very
important<00:02:32.390> achievement<00:02:32.720> maybe<00:02:32.900> one<00:02:33.110> that's

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
important achievement maybe one that's

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
does tend to be a lot of focus on

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.320 
does tend to be a lot of focus on
completing<00:02:36.920> career<00:02:37.520> slam<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.120> one<00:02:38.300> I

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
completing career slam but this one I

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.940 
completing career slam but this one I
think<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.750> just<00:02:38.810> as<00:02:39.140> important<00:02:39.590> it's

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
think is just as important it's

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.740 
think is just as important it's
extremely<00:02:40.280> difficult<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.030> that's<00:02:41.330> why<00:02:41.480> very

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
extremely difficult and that's why very

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.250 
extremely difficult and that's why very
few<00:02:41.840> people<00:02:42.290> have<00:02:42.380> managed<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.980> do<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:44.260> but

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
few people have managed to do it but

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.810 
few people have managed to do it but
yeah<00:02:45.410> I'm<00:02:45.650> sure<00:02:45.800> nobody<00:02:46.220> will<00:02:46.340> give<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.670> good

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820
