00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hello everyone who watches this video in this 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.440
 video i want to tell you how i land 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.719
 dried fruits in general I myself live in the south 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.980
 Kazakhstan in the city of Taraz 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.590
 and we have a lot of apples and pears 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.020
 Well, so that they do not disappear, we from these 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.580
 apples and pears 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:29.029
 make dried fruits for making 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.279
 good dried fruit i take 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.700
 good varieties of apples and pears 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 but there is one thing that 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.870
 really good dried fruits 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.059
 turned out and apples and pears should be 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.629
 a little bit not ripe such they should 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.690
 be strong vigorous after i 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.129
 picked good fruit 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.020
 Well, apples and pears, I naturally wash them 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.670
 from dust and dirt and then let the water drain from 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.670
 these fruits and cut here on such 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.670
 quarters 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.619
 after and cut them on here 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.080
 such quarters and i will delete 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.979
 remove them seed cameras well or 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 easier to say 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.110
 remove the bones and these hard ones 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:25.259
 partitions after I cleaned them 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.470
 from these family cameras from these bones 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.470
 the partitions i cut them into slices and 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.770
 immersed in such salted water 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.369
 Why do I immerse it in salted 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.240
 water is done in order for apples 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.470
 or pears 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.409
 not blackened not oxidized and so that they 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.820
 always had their own natural color and 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.240
 so when they are dry 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.829
 were so beautiful and golden but 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.649
 golden color to make us water 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.340
 so that the apples are not blackened and not 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.990
 oxidized 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.140
 I take a total of 10 liters of water but 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.900
 pure ordinary water and add one 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.450
 one-third cup salt here such 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.489
 common glass one third salt 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.900
 I breed them to water and then immerse these 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:28.890
 slices after i match you in this 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.540
 salted water and these slices I them 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.900
 Naturally, but I have such a mesh 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.569
 I'm all these slices that are soaked 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.670
 in this in this salted water 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.370
 laid out on such a mesh to water 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.829
 completely with glass 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.400
 after the water from them I drain them 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:53.030
 laid out on rags such I have 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.920
 big spills and give outside and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.689
 she has a little bit of these lobules 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.900
 dry out 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:03.780
 what salt is the place 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.730
 for example, salt, of course, everyone has that 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.079
 you can still use salt instead 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.689
 make this water what fruit 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.269
 my blackies can be used a little 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:19.620
 vinegar can also use lemon 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:24.030
 juice or citric acid in general after 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.669
 how we laid out on a tray 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.870
 we give all this naturally a little bit 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.870
 all this dry up 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.000
 common fruit laid out were on a tray 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:42.370
 and it's been about half a day 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.530
 here you are as you see these future dried fruits 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.160
 not blackened at all 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:52.330
 white and remained and usually 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.970
 But just need usually when dried fruits 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.130
 harvests attacks Mashka if their 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.580
 Of course not to soak in saline 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.870
 Well, as you can see, half a day has passed 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.520
 no mash on this fruit does not attack 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.120
 from time to time naturally have to go 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.520
 To stir up the future of dried fruit 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.380
 as you can see they are not blackened not 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.799
 oxidized 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.440
 They have such a beautiful nice color in 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.150
 general video continues let's wait for more 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.950
 a few days and see what happens 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.890
 further generally dry land and fruit well the future 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.100
 dried fruits in the shade try to make them 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:40.180
 like a draft in a general video 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.540
 continues look on passed three 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.350
 of the day 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.370
 my dried fruits from apples have already dried in 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.530
 completely they are already ready as you see y 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:55.260

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.669
 beautiful mouthwatering and very elastic 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.100
 completely as you see what a good 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.340
 result and now they are ready 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.450
 guarding 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.340
 In general, I myself live in an apartment and sushi 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.500
 go out 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.250

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.420
 plastic capacity well let's collect and 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:37.220
 I will tell you how I do it 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:42.360
 there is also a small nuance in general i 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:47.120
 I fold it like this with the packaging and add 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:51.120
 a little bit like this 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.610
 tangerine zest dried fruits well 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.530
 literally a little bit she already dried it 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.470
 tangerine peel or peel from 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.890
 tangerines and add a little why am I 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.000
 doing this doing this in order to 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.390
 protect my dried fruits from 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.990
 fruit molly 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.480
 so that the sea does not attack and does not eat these 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.360
 fruit well, you know yourself if she 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.480
 will attack it will ruin the dried fruits and not so 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.450
 they will be nice to use 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:25.310
 here so a little bit add again poured 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:28.610
 on top and added a little bit again 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.710
 tangerine peel well, in principle, possible and 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:37.770
 orange peel use but it 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:41.070
 it all depends on you here so we are all 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:48.440

 I cover these dried fruits and they 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.740
 I keep it until winter in winter 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.640

 conditions can also be harvested 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:41.250
 the same way pears can also 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.710
 you can dry her eggplants this way 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.139
