backpack pouch inside it it will make it

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.130 
backpack pouch inside it it will make it
just<00:03:16.959> bigger<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.820> bigger<00:03:18.820> oh<00:03:19.240> I<00:03:19.690> can't<00:03:19.959> hold

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
just bigger and bigger oh I can't hold

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.410 
just bigger and bigger oh I can't hold
anymore<00:03:20.530> cuz<00:03:20.950> now<00:03:21.130> it's<00:03:21.280> as<00:03:21.430> big<00:03:21.580> as<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:22.180> upper

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
anymore cuz now it's as big as the upper

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.170 
anymore cuz now it's as big as the upper
part<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.780> inventory<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.709> what's<00:03:23.830> this

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
part of the inventory and what's this

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.300 
part of the inventory and what's this
and<00:03:25.260> then<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:26.410> can<00:03:26.500> do<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.130> then<00:03:27.220> you

stand<00:05:18.180> on<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.570> edge<00:05:18.890> next<00:05:19.890> and<00:05:20.669> now<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:20.910> fall<00:05:21.479> oh

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
stand on the edge next and now I fall oh

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.150 
stand on the edge next and now I fall oh
god<00:05:23.460> that's<00:05:23.760> stupid<00:05:24.300> okay<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:25.289> why<00:05:25.740> show<00:05:26.070> you

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
god that's stupid okay so why show you

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.750 
god that's stupid okay so why show you
how<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.340> quantum<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:28.620> content<00:05:29.160> on<00:05:29.220> backpack

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
how the quantum the content on backpack

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.490 
how the quantum the content on backpack
works<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.870> I<00:05:30.900> throw<00:05:31.560> it<00:05:31.740> in<00:05:31.890> I<00:05:33.260> don't<00:05:34.260> shift

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
works so I throw it in I don't shift

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.920 
works so I throw it in I don't shift
click<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:34.950> but<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.610> just<00:05:35.850> throw<00:05:36.090> it<00:05:36.210> in<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:36.570> you

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
click it but I just throw it in and you

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.340 
click it but I just throw it in and you
get<00:05:37.020> a<00:05:37.080> quantum<00:05:37.680> backpack<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:39.030> then<00:05:40.020> as<00:05:40.260> long

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
get a quantum backpack and then as long

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.260 
get a quantum backpack and then as long
as<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.860> is<00:05:41.100> not<00:05:41.310> broken<00:05:41.520> and<00:05:41.850> has<00:05:42.060> that

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
as that is not broken and has that

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.290 
as that is not broken and has that
backpack<00:05:42.630> in<00:05:43.050> it<00:05:43.169> you<00:05:43.710> can<00:05:43.740> take<00:05:44.039> any<00:05:44.300> quantum

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
backpack in it you can take any quantum

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.320 
backpack in it you can take any quantum
backpack<00:05:45.840> any<00:05:46.470> quantum<00:05:47.280> backpack<00:05:47.700> I<00:05:47.850> think<00:05:48.090> um

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
backpack any quantum backpack I think um

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:58.180 
backpack any quantum backpack I think um
so<00:05:49.169> just<00:05:49.200> throw<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:49.950> away<00:05:51.440> um<00:05:55.070> and<00:05:56.070> oh<00:05:56.580> no

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
so just throw that away um and oh no

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.670 
so just throw that away um and oh no
yeah<00:05:59.190> that<00:05:59.520> doesn't<00:05:59.760> work<00:06:00.060> but<00:06:00.330> so<00:06:01.080> yeah<00:06:01.500> that

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
yeah that doesn't work but so yeah that

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.379 
yeah that doesn't work but so yeah that
makes<00:06:01.860> a<00:06:01.979> lot<00:06:02.010> of<00:06:02.160> sense<00:06:02.280> so<00:06:02.729> you<00:06:03.060> can<00:06:03.210> have

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
makes a lot of sense so you can have

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.870 
makes a lot of sense so you can have
backups<00:06:04.139> of<00:06:04.289> your<00:06:04.350> backpack<00:06:04.979> so<00:06:05.639> you<00:06:05.729> can<00:06:05.850> just

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
backups of your backpack so you can just

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.909
