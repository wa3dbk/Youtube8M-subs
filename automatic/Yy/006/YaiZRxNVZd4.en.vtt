00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.029
 if I'm interested then from 2010 on cable Digital home then from 2010 on 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.240
 me of course I can receive PHEV about it myself 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.979
 watch HDTV about it 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.509
 that is not a problem in the digital cable network that is the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.389
 Cable network operator 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.839
 against payment MP tebbe also film packages sports package or provide 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.169
 also Adi TV 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.909
 So I can then look local providers Internet or the 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.949
 phoning questions what bike tours additional packages present cinema park 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.289
 Intersport Packages 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.660
 Grannies I can use that for the monthly almost no topic but what 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.000
 is with HDTV he sees the future we have the faithful televisions of 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 TechniSat the hall tv series we also have cable receiver which is suitable 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.700
 But, the woman is the meter also does not lead the hobbit she is 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:43.560
 suitable for it 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.680
 where you have to say very clearly at the moment of the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.220
 Cable operators tend to feed a few hdtv stations simply because it 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.290
 There are no full programs at the moment where many had the wife 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.550
 is sent over it 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.240
 in Digital Natives Halliche fires on niche broadcast are data that is starting 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.260
 In 2010 it is the digitization Wiederschein then captured that is 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.060
 We can also look forward to it as well as talking to you beforehand 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.110
 digital cable network 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.750
 Salvation TV to receive 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.190
 If this happens only the question to receive that needs either one 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.570
 suitable TV sets or even a suitable receiver who with fish 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.500
 Four models are available from TechniSat. Elevators explain pretty well what I do 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.150
 am received as modern can katv direction and HDTV there was 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.100
 Everything depends on the small appliances if it were true with us ours 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.620
 both 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.580
 in terms of order entry-level models of the Digital 3 this is senior physician Dr the gt 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.930
 mf4 k 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.530
 the DJK three of the top has a built-in Colak system 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.890
 With and this Komax encryption is used by many cable operators 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.500
 that means I can if I subscribe to such a Beatty as package 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.470
 insert my smart card laterally into the court and the receiver the Good 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.180
 her the encrypted signals that I can then just what you synonymous with 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.110
 Watch TV 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.170
 These two models are from the series already four had them before Reichelt 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.120
 they can not receive HDTV in the procedure tell me starter models 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.660
 are 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.210
 but Dominic Brünen the ETH the 18 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.030
 and in the group h the city 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.459
 and they are just HDTV suitable 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.620
 On the betrayed her «I have a great picture and sound digital 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.460
 qualities 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.469
 to this also recording options 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.089
 Of course there are exceptions 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.660
 our two models possibility 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.890
 in the lively DigiCorder HD k2 we either have a 160 gigabyte 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.149
 or a 5 with her bed hard drive 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.479
 Built-in device on which the signs could be taken from this one 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.529
 can retrieve with 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.490
 That's a wonderful opportunity 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.360
 around now another question about the encryption Pithiviers closures 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.210
 we just talked about percent sim cards 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.550
 To be more different at each modules is most important in each case the best 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.079
 expandable 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.589
 the sticking point one thing is that since the locks are not uniform 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.739
 if that means any team at which cable operator I'm using 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.979
 another encryption 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.549
 there are a lot of closures and possibility we can not all in 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.359
 a device 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.620
 complete installation but I hope that there is a standard input quasi in the 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.309
 Judicial device must continue «This is exactly the story that 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:02.840
 ezb-session wear come here so-called 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.560
 Camus or could be fast Textes module that goes in under him 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.490
 more in the front of a smart card is set and that it exactly 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.239
 I can plug it into my receiver and use what does that mean? 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.519
 Example at ours 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.349
 up here with them I have against them because I also have this industry here 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.249
 is just as amazing that a counter is still accurate 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.599
 then comes that Mutu the new fees the module what teacher 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.099
 then have this card from the provider then the topic then I can him 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.219
 so to speak expand for all possible packages for all sorts 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.219
 Encryption right if a last question I have never had such a receiver 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:37.519
 have 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.899
 Visit with the general connection 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.949
 At that time I was thinking very far today and should have been there for 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.749
 all eventualities prepared 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.079
 That means first of all for those around the neurologists devices 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.020
 We still have a classic at home 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.960
 this one gave it that means that the digital signal is converted analogously 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.290
 that just the old TV can understand it so synonymous really 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.490
 to do interesting 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.910
 Zuloaga the kVen were all connected and the new 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.720
 Models then also the direction Haliti VGN which have a structure they need 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.629
 Klein Klatten that Sarah is the so-called hdmi-interface 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.659
 Among all new televisions so the LCD TVs give this life 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.139
 in order to be able to be connected via HDMI that does not find so then 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.660
 Conversion of digital and analog of the station gives the digital signal directly 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.139
 continue in the TV debate an optimal picture and sound quality 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.930
 yes, there are many others on the edge shooting opportunities now 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.930
 Grande are front sparkling with sparkling wine they were talking about 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.100
 that, for example, here with the animals hard drives and digiCorder me 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.540
 I am able to pass on the recordings to all computers PC so meets the 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.889
 Church Seibert said I just find her class connection variety is dar 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.330
 Receiving pay-tv program of possible HDTV is natural 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.280
 also feasible 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.249
 the providers 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.579
 who retrofit specific pieces PT is already used today like 

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:53.210
 then come even stronger from 2010 "and thus is also in the digital 

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:57.159
 Cable network yes programs trained question everything yes available
