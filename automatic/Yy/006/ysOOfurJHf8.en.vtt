you people's IP addresses and see

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.480 
you people's IP addresses and see
whether<00:01:05.519> they're<00:01:05.880> offline<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.900> online<00:01:07.310> but<00:01:08.310> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
doing this is a demonstration so what

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.539 
doing this is a demonstration so what
you<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> hit<00:01:12.000> paint<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.869> put<00:01:13.080> ping

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
you do is you hit paint you put ping

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:30.920 
you do is you hit paint you put ping
space<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.210> put<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> IP<00:01:15.750> address<00:01:29.119> 10<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
space and you put the IP address 10 and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.350 
space and you put the IP address 10 and
then<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.200> hit<00:01:32.360> enter<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:35.250> says<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.210> with

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
then you hit enter and it says that with

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.899 
then you hit enter and it says that with
30<00:01:36.540> bits<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.079> data<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:38.490> course<00:01:38.729> it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
30 bits of data and of course it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.700 
30 bits of data and of course it's
offline<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:39.900> offline<00:01:40.320> action<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
offline so if it's offline action to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.899 
offline so if it's offline action to
save<00:01:40.920> request<00:01:41.280> timed<00:01:41.520> out<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.579> will<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
save request timed out and it will do it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.800 
save request timed out and it will do it
three<00:01:45.240> times<00:01:49.070> like<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.280> or<00:01:50.899> four<00:01:51.899> times

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
three times like that or four times

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.370 
three times like that or four times
yeah<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.950> says<00:01:56.659> ping<00:01:57.659> statistics

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
yeah see then it says ping statistics

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.450 
yeah see then it says ping statistics

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and lost hundred percent loss normal

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.289 
and lost hundred percent loss normal
yeah<00:02:04.829> that's<00:02:05.040> because<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.000> happens

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
yeah that's because that's what happens

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:21.610 
yeah that's because that's what happens
if<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.659> fine<00:02:07.489> but<00:02:08.489> if<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:14.690> wait<00:02:15.690> I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.740 

forgot<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.890> do<00:02:23.040> that

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
forgot to do that

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:37.630
