00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
so here we go defensively and the game

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.289 
so here we go defensively and the game
was<00:01:50.369> definitely<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.299> laggy<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.850> like

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
was definitely a laggy and that is like

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
was definitely a laggy and that is like
the<00:01:54.329> worst<00:01:54.899> way<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.380> play<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> game<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.250> know

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the worst way to play a game you know

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.889 
the worst way to play a game you know
sometimes<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:56.909> trying<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.240> set<00:01:57.390> some<00:01:57.540> defense

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
sometimes I'm trying to set some defense

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.289 
sometimes I'm trying to set some defense
up<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.619> tough<00:01:58.920> right<00:01:59.040> there<00:01:59.460> he<00:01:59.700> does<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> good

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
up it's tough right there he does a good

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.670 
up it's tough right there he does a good
wheel<00:02:00.540> were<00:02:00.719> out<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> ends<00:02:01.590> up

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
wheel were out right there the ends up

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.550 
wheel were out right there the ends up
just<00:02:02.060> destroying<00:02:03.060> Patrick<00:02:03.509> Peterson<00:02:03.899> it's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
just destroying Patrick Peterson it's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440 
just destroying Patrick Peterson it's
really<00:02:05.009> difficult<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.549> guard<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.820> route<00:02:06.180> if

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
really difficult to guard that route if

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.999 
really difficult to guard that route if
you<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> receiver<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.649> good<00:02:07.829> route

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you have a receiver with good route

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.880 
you have a receiver with good route
running<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.369> speed<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.209> know<00:02:09.649> basically<00:02:10.649> no

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
running in speed you know basically no

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.170 
running in speed you know basically no
quarterback<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.430> gonna<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.700> able<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.970> stay

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
quarterback is gonna be able to stay

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.250 
quarterback is gonna be able to stay
with<00:02:12.209> them<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.660> got<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> good<00:02:13.020> fast

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
with them if you got a good fast

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.940 
with them if you got a good fast
receiver

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
receiver

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.500 
receiver
and<00:02:14.160> his<00:02:14.489> couch<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.910> think<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.150> kind<00:02:15.450> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and his couch I think that's kind of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.530 
and his couch I think that's kind of
just<00:02:15.690> trash<00:02:15.930> them<00:02:16.260> right<00:02:17.129> here<00:02:17.269> not<00:02:18.269> really

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
just trash them right here not really

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.759 
just trash them right here not really
sure<00:02:18.660> what<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> reed<00:02:19.080> was<00:02:19.230> kind<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.620> just

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
sure what the reed was kind of just

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.430 
sure what the reed was kind of just
lobbed<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.220> up<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.540> will<00:02:21.660> definitely<00:02:22.230> take

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
lobbed it up and we will definitely take

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.110 
lobbed it up and we will definitely take
that<00:02:22.470> stop<00:02:22.920> at<00:02:23.099> Marchon<00:02:23.459> lunch<00:02:23.610> breaks<00:02:23.910> two

kind of risky something I shouldn't have

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.839 
kind of risky something I shouldn't have
done<00:02:29.879> since<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.930> was<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:31.950> kind<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.340> you

and when you're facing it's all about
timing<00:02:37.260> if<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.739> cannot<00:02:38.160> uh<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:39.510> know<00:02:39.630> click

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
timing if you cannot uh you know click

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.589 
timing if you cannot uh you know click
on<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.410> do<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.560> necessary<00:02:41.180> things<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.450> need

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
on and do the necessary things you need

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.990 
on and do the necessary things you need
to<00:02:42.630> do<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.500> get<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.769> animation<00:02:44.280> then<00:02:44.489> it's<00:02:44.700> all

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
to do to get the animation then it's all

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.460 
to do to get the animation then it's all
bad<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.390> it's<00:02:45.870> probably<00:02:46.110> gonna<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.319> an

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
bad and it's probably gonna be an

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.650 
bad and it's probably gonna be an
interception<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.360> probably<00:02:48.360> shouldn't<00:02:48.630> have

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
interception so probably shouldn't have

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.759 
interception so probably shouldn't have
done<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.049> thankfully<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.500> worked<00:02:49.560> out

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
done that but thankfully it worked out

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.229 
done that but thankfully it worked out
for<00:02:50.010> us<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.190> as<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.430> goes<00:02:50.549> over<00:02:50.790> towards<00:02:51.209> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
for us so as it goes over towards the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.170 
for us so as it goes over towards the
right<00:02:51.360> side<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:52.260> Deion<00:02:52.950> Sanders<00:02:53.190> snags<00:02:53.880> it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
right side and Deion Sanders snags it

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.880 
right side and Deion Sanders snags it
now<00:02:54.390> since<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:54.989> were<00:02:55.110> able<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.410> get<00:02:55.530> Patrick
