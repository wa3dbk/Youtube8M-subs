00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
light would come straight down through

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.620 
light would come straight down through
the<00:01:07.310> center<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.790> telescope<00:01:08.060> can<00:01:08.510> be

the center of the telescope can be

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.279 
the center of the telescope can be
registered<00:01:09.170> in<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.320> eyepiece<00:01:10.479> now<00:01:11.479> supposing

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
registered in the eyepiece now supposing

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.319 
registered in the eyepiece now supposing
you<00:01:12.500> started<00:01:12.979> moving<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.520> telescope<00:01:14.060> but

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
you started moving the telescope but

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.969 
you started moving the telescope but
let's<00:01:14.570> say<00:01:14.840> five<00:01:15.680> miles<00:01:16.039> an<00:01:16.280> hour<00:01:16.399> and

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
let's say five miles an hour and

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.679 
let's say five miles an hour and
therefore<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.340> order<00:01:19.579> for<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:19.939> light<00:01:20.359> to<00:01:20.570> be

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
therefore in order for that light to be

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.300 
therefore in order for that light to be
still<00:01:20.960> registered<00:01:21.590> in<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.829> center<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.189> the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
still registered in the center of the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.609 
still registered in the center of the
telescope<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:23.630> would<00:01:23.780> have<00:01:23.929> to<00:01:23.990> tilt<00:01:24.409> your

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
telescope you would have to tilt your

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.580 
telescope you would have to tilt your
telescope<00:01:25.310> in<00:01:25.880> order<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.390> allow<00:01:26.719> for<00:01:27.380> your

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
telescope in order to allow for your

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.370 
telescope in order to allow for your
movement<00:01:28.130> as<00:01:28.280> these<00:01:28.939> Starla<00:01:29.719> is<00:01:29.899> traveling

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
movement as these Starla is traveling

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.469 
movement as these Starla is traveling
down<00:01:32.049> through<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.409> telescope<00:01:34.179> let's<00:01:35.179> say

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
down through the telescope let's say

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.169 
down through the telescope let's say
that<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:36.170> five<00:01:36.499> miles<00:01:36.829> an<00:01:37.070> hour<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:37.729> have<00:01:37.999> to

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
that a five miles an hour you have to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.959 
that a five miles an hour you have to
tip<00:01:38.450> your<00:01:38.659> telescope<00:01:39.229> forward<00:01:39.859> about<00:01:40.460> from<00:01:40.850> a

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
tip your telescope forward about from a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.800 
tip your telescope forward about from a
degrees<00:01:42.670> now<00:01:43.670> let's<00:01:43.969> consider<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
degrees now let's consider the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.510 
degrees now let's consider the
possibility<00:01:45.469> that<00:01:45.499> it's<00:01:45.950> not<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.310> telescope

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
possibility that it's not the telescope

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.450 
possibility that it's not the telescope
that's<00:01:47.149> doing<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.479> moving<00:01:47.749> on<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.229> earth<00:01:48.460> but

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
that's doing the moving on the earth but

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.330 
that's doing the moving on the earth but
it<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:49.969> start<00:01:50.600> coming<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.170> at<00:01:51.679> an<00:01:51.950> able

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
it is the start coming in at an able

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.069 
it is the start coming in at an able
because<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.759> is<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.060> Starlight<00:01:53.689> that<00:01:53.960> is

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
because it is the Starlight that is

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.349 
because it is the Starlight that is
moving<00:01:54.530> with<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.039> ether<00:01:55.520> as<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.819> ether<00:01:56.149> goes

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
moving with the ether as the ether goes

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.810 
moving with the ether as the ether goes
past<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.020> telescope

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
past the telescope

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.330 
past the telescope
again<00:01:59.630> you<00:02:00.050> would<00:02:00.200> have<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.620> if<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.100> was<00:02:01.250> the

again you would have to if it was the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.710 
again you would have to if it was the
same<00:02:01.550> speed<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.090> would<00:02:02.180> have<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.479> tick<00:02:02.690> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
same speed you would have to tick the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.240 
same speed you would have to tick the
telescope<00:02:03.380> by<00:02:03.890> about<00:02:04.159> 5<00:02:04.550> degrees<00:02:05.830> in<00:02:06.830> order<00:02:07.100> to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
telescope by about 5 degrees in order to

just simply film the telescope with

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.660 
just simply film the telescope with
water<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:38.270> slows<00:02:38.720> down<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.670> Starlight

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
water that slows down the Starlight

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.160 
water that slows down the Starlight
through<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.120> telescope<00:02:41.620> very<00:02:42.620> much<00:02:42.860> more<00:02:44.170> now

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
through the telescope very much more now

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.660 
through the telescope very much more now
if<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.970> earth<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.320> moving<00:02:48.739> you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
if it is the earth that is moving you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.420 
if it is the earth that is moving you
would<00:02:49.850> then<00:02:49.880> have<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.650> tip<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.950> telescope

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
would then have to tip the telescope

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.479 
would then have to tip the telescope
from<00:02:52.700> let's<00:02:53.269> say<00:02:53.540> five<00:02:54.290> degrees<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:55.070> increase

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
from let's say five degrees and increase

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.699 
from let's say five degrees and increase
it<00:02:55.670> more<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:56.030> 10<00:02:56.300> degrees<00:02:56.480> because<00:02:57.350> it's<00:02:57.530> now

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
it more to 10 degrees because it's now

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.770 
it more to 10 degrees because it's now
traveling<00:02:58.340> slower<00:02:58.670> as<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.120> moves<00:02:59.330> down<00:02:59.750> the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
traveling slower as it moves down the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.750 
traveling slower as it moves down the
telescope<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.160> would<00:03:01.280> have<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.580> check

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
telescope and you would have to check

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.470 
telescope and you would have to check
the<00:03:01.910> telescope<00:03:02.390> under<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> further<00:03:04.209> not<00:03:05.209> if

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
the telescope under the further not if

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.660 
the telescope under the further not if
the<00:03:05.720> Starlight<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.350> already<00:03:06.709> coming<00:03:06.980> in<00:03:07.280> at<00:03:07.400> 5

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
the Starlight is already coming in at 5

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.380 
the Starlight is already coming in at 5
degrees<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.350> simply<00:03:09.799> slowed<00:03:10.130> down<00:03:10.459> you

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
degrees and it is simply slowed down you

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.539 
degrees and it is simply slowed down you
don't<00:03:11.600> have<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.110> tip<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.830> telescope<00:03:13.340> any

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
don't have to tip the telescope any

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.170 
don't have to tip the telescope any
further<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.950> therefore<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.459> can<00:03:16.670> find<00:03:16.940> out

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
further and therefore you can find out

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.170 
further and therefore you can find out
whether<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.950> telescope<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.549> moving<00:03:19.970> or

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
whether you the telescope is moving or

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
whether you the telescope is moving or
the<00:03:20.299> star<00:03:20.570> light<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:22.030> airy<00:03:23.030> filled<00:03:23.959> the

the star light and airy filled the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.280 
the star light and airy filled the
telescope<00:03:24.769> with<00:03:25.459> water<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.239> compared<00:03:27.079> with

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
telescope with water and compared with

telescope with water and compared with
previous<00:03:27.500> measurements<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.459> same<00:03:28.790> star

previous measurements of the same star

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.800 
previous measurements of the same star
and<00:03:29.739> he<00:03:30.739> did<00:03:30.980> not<00:03:31.190> have<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:32.239> tip<00:03:32.480> that

and he did not have to tip that

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.680 
and he did not have to tip that
telescope<00:03:33.560> any<00:03:33.920> further<00:03:34.340> than<00:03:35.269> in<00:03:35.480> the

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
telescope was without water and that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.600 
telescope was without water and that
showed<00:03:41.329> very<00:03:41.690> clearly<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:43.130> was<00:03:43.250> not<00:03:43.459> the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
showed very clearly that it was not the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.759 
showed very clearly that it was not the
telescope<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:44.390> was<00:03:44.570> moving<00:03:44.959> but<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
telescope that was moving but the

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.030 
telescope that was moving but the
Starlight<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.480> ether<00:03:47.900> was<00:03:48.440> moving

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
Starlight and the ether was moving

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.840 
Starlight and the ether was moving
relative<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:50.120> stationary<00:03:50.709> telescope<00:03:51.850> now

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
relative to a stationary telescope now

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.340 
relative to a stationary telescope now
because<00:03:53.239> he<00:03:53.360> didn't<00:03:53.660> get<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.840> results<00:03:54.290> that

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
because he didn't get the results that

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.400 
because he didn't get the results that
was<00:03:54.590> expected<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:56.000> was<00:03:56.150> called<00:03:56.390> air<00:03:57.019> is

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
was expected it was called air is

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.819 
was expected it was called air is
failure<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:59.150> the<00:04:00.110> interesting<00:04:00.260> thing<00:04:00.799> is

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
failure and the interesting thing is

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.600 
failure and the interesting thing is
that<00:04:00.950> if<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.370> read<00:04:01.640> his<00:04:01.940> report

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
that if you read his report

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.090 
that if you read his report
he's<00:04:03.610> very<00:04:03.760> short<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.540> there's<00:04:05.470> not<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.710> single

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
he's very short and there's not a single

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.470 
he's very short and there's not a single
mention<00:04:06.850> of<00:04:07.210> the<00:04:07.990> significance<00:04:08.770> of<00:04:09.010> that

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
mention of the significance of that

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.840 
mention of the significance of that
experiment<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:11.650> is<00:04:11.740> really<00:04:12.310> talking<00:04:12.640> about

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
experiment it is really talking about

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.220 
experiment it is really talking about
the<00:04:13.630> various<00:04:15.420> accuracies<00:04:16.420> of<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:17.109> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
year experiment that he made nothing

about<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.680> amazing<00:04:21.519> conclusion<00:04:22.450> that<00:04:23.350> comes

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
about the amazing conclusion that comes

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.750 
about the amazing conclusion that comes
