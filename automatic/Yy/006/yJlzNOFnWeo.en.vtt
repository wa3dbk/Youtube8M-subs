00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
think you try to realize that at that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
think you try to realize that at that
point<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.480> game<00:00:33.630> was<00:00:33.840> done<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.230> same<00:00:34.649> times

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
point the game was done the same times

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
point the game was done the same times
our<00:00:35.280> molecules<00:00:35.969> they're<00:00:36.180> ago<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.680> unites<00:00:37.680> us

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
our molecules they're ago that unites us

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.209 
our molecules they're ago that unites us
in<00:00:38.940> exceptional<00:00:39.629> singing<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.230> very<00:00:40.980> valid

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
in exceptional singing that's very valid

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
in exceptional singing that's very valid
not<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> tournament<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.690> last

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
not just in the tournament but the last

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.819 
not just in the tournament but the last
two<00:00:43.200> years<00:00:43.379> district<00:00:44.070> level<00:00:44.579> team<00:00:44.730> back<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
two years district level team back so

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.260 
two years district level team back so
that's<00:00:46.829> basically<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.489> said<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.030> think

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
that's basically what I said in I think

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.310 
that's basically what I said in I think
is<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.989> really<00:00:49.260> incredible<00:00:50.250> class<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
is a the really incredible class and

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
is a the really incredible class and
very<00:00:52.320> intense<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.890> field<00:00:53.190> which<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.789> think

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
very intense on the field which I think

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.729 
very intense on the field which I think
helped<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.360> help<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> clear<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.199> razors<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
helped to help to clear the razors and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.650 
helped to help to clear the razors and
even<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> final<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.910> male<00:00:57.059> Mulligan<00:00:57.629> :

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
even in the final the male Mulligan :

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.959 
even in the final the male Mulligan :

all that we aim to try to be more strike
and<00:01:00.000> pull<00:01:00.390> those<00:01:00.600> your<00:01:00.809> consumers<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.829> just

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
and pull those your consumers in I just

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.979 
and pull those your consumers in I just
goes<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.969> show<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.149> even<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:03.719> has<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
incredible because we play the game as

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
incredible because we play the game as
you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.290> point<00:01:49.619> where<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.100> the

you can see to the point where at the
end<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.430> their<00:01:50.579> bearing<00:01:50.880> innings<00:01:51.119> when<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
