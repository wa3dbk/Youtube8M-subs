00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hey what's going on for hours video for you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.849
 and this is about this ball top4 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.320
 from the company trio poetry or trio 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.269
 no idea what pronounces and me one 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.830
 few reasons why we do not buy it 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:21.270
 should be so there you can have fun 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.980
 I would like to say that on 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.570
 this ball head here already everything 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.910
 wrong on the contrary I have because 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.779
 now since August 2012 so two and a half 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.449
 years 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.430
 and he went through everything or through 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.649
 pay what I have done so far 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.680
 it is very cold conditions in the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.780
 biggest in the biggest heat in the summer 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.770
 Nevertheless, over time there reveal themselves 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.730
 just a two three little things the 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.750
 I did not know it now and then 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.120
 before you maybe this thing here 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.379
 buys and wants to be disappointed in the time 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.129
 I definitely share my experience with 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.289
 share you 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.100
 Let's start with the first one 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.149
 thing that bothers me and it would be number 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.220
 one the construction of the exchange plate 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.560
 and if he does that here now 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.229
 Look, I have a possibility here 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 clamp my exchange plate quasi 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.950
 I always have to share this 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.570
 turning up then puts my mine 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.460
 Exchange plates can now be a camera 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.689
 is always the same then she sits down 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.930
 Here's a screw it back to work 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.060
 theirs and then I am ready to go 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.979
 however, if you compare that with 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.570
 ball heads any manfrotto and so 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.280
 continue 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.340
 It's a bit of a fiddle 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.250
 because you have to every time this part 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.720
 screw up but there screw in 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.159
 and others just go there 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.979
 one has the change just under at the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.710
 Camera was something to click here 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.509
 purely says ready locked and bomb 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.509
 sure, it should always be a little bit 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.210
 Do you know what I mean or number 2 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.590
 Bring us right there, too 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.090
 If I have the camera on top of it 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.270
 I screwed it up now 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270
 short 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.510
 so then I have the thing that almost now 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.360
 So this screw you with the me the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.880
 fixing quasi release and the camera 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.640
 thus from the tripod or from the 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.540
 ball head round I can do relatively 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.430
 close to this bode plate of mine 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.050
 camera, I 'll just say something 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.280
 I'm so bad now 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.530
 However, if you do it now 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.810
 assumes that you have gloves on it 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.920
 and start here 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.060
 fumbling 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.820
 because you just have little 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.050
 attack area except here so with the 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.790
 to turn your finger when you do that 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.640
 really stuck and believe I have 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.460
 did that and then sat there and got it 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.540
 This fucking camera is not from this 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.790
 ball head get because the next this 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.260
 screw here completely is not round 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.110
 like other manufacturers where they are 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.760
 So far, that was a bit more 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.790
 attack area has for his hand or 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.230
 on the contrary, the reason for his fingers 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.330
 and the grain or this this one 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.150
 rubber coating on it the look 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.250
 not really much 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.280
 that just does not offer much grip so 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.780
 on the contrary the vocally slippery says 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.180
 because you 're pretty much English 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.280
 slippery and if you then wet hands 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.959
 or gloves on then has 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.930
 is that a really fucking combination 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:48.680
 and then you sit there and get them 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:50.650
 cocoa bean then true story where the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.170
 third star the deals with this 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.150
 Setting ring here is for that 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.730
 responsible that if the ball head 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.190
 you can fix it on the tripod 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.590
 the camera with ball head around one 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.989
 certain grade just always trainers 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.060
 the turn once comes to it so yes 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.410
 not bad, however, and the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.190
 I've read aloud now 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.620
 many of them are eating like this 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.290
 Mechanism here at some point and you 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.640
 can not turn anything here 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.140
 that may not sound like that 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.140
 Bad okay then I can do it 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.230
 but it really gets shit 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.240
 Only when 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.610
 you consider that , for example, against 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.830
 put the tripod and the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.000
 camera have the camera position and you 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.770
 the camera might want 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.570
 a little bit backwards or in the ins 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.330
 change portrait format so then you have to 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.490
 this plate up here 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.340
 if we turn that behind or what 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.790
 so on the side turns so yes time 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.680
 this notch here relied on that 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.120
 to realize so when the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.210
 However, ball head is still 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.420
 moved and we'll tell her here 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.710
 put this camera on your camera 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.080
 She wants to lose weight now 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.870
 tipped back then it hits here 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.200
 this limit and actually wanted in 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.640
 this in this trough here still around 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.150
 to have even more freedom 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.560
 Now a bullet head is always turning 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.460
 now i have to start the complete one 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.860
 turn tripod and readjust 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.920
 something to be realigned right in 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.320
 rough terrain really shit and 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.630
 there you try that and I have that 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.850
 problem solved by me now 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.640
 just that part with the hot air 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.360
 I did not just warm've 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.370
 it really fire on it 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.170
 and now the part then has 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.750
 a lot of heat and a lot of pressure 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.420
 solved again I have it right now 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.460
 lubricated but if you turn it now 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.800
 I know that Mr. di net something there 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.450
 It is very close 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.690
 many people like that you can on Amazon 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.370
 read if the ball head otherwise 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.100
 Also very good is the quality 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.700
 and so on this thing bothers me 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.460
 extremely and that's why I want this 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.220
 Kohlkopf also now never use it 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.310
 There are some cool products for the price 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.500
 from 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.240
 well-known manufacturers look at you there 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.080
 have you fallen on top if now ? 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.180
 since i might not be the 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.250
 ideal solution if you can live with it 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.970
 I have your thing in any case 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.100
 decided 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.650
 I just want it in front of the consoles 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.960
 masters i wish i could with you 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.960
 start and chelsea
