frosting I am adding my sculpt igloo
what<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.660> would<00:03:43.930> recommend<00:03:44.080> is<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.950> cut<00:03:45.400> and

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
what I would recommend is to cut and

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.570 
what I would recommend is to cut and
texture<00:03:46.510> your<00:03:47.410> cake<00:03:47.650> before<00:03:48.100> adding<00:03:48.459> the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
texture your cake before adding the

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.070 
texture your cake before adding the
sculpting<00:03:49.060> loop<00:03:49.209> because<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.630> does<00:03:49.810> get<00:03:50.050> a

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
sculpting loop because it does get a

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.540 
sculpting loop because it does get a
little<00:03:50.260> bit<00:03:50.650> messy<00:03:50.830> and<00:03:52.769> Here<00:03:53.769> I<00:03:53.950> am<00:03:53.980> cutting
