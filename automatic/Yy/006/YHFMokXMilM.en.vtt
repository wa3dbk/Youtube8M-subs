00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.070 

started<00:01:24.280> out<00:01:24.400> with<00:01:24.520> four<00:01:24.880> eight-foot<00:01:25.690> two<00:01:25.900> by

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.280 
sixes
I<00:01:26.800> took<00:01:27.220> 24<00:01:27.880> inches<00:01:28.270> off<00:01:28.480> of<00:01:28.510> three<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.110> them

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
I took 24 inches off of three of them

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.220 
I took 24 inches off of three of them
and<00:01:29.530> took<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.640> remaining<00:01:30.970> four<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.630> fourth

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
and took the remaining four the fourth

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.820 
and took the remaining four the fourth
2i6<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.370> cut<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.150> up<00:01:34.210> into<00:01:34.420> 24<00:01:34.930> inch<00:01:35.080> sections

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
2i6 and cut it up into 24 inch sections

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.160 
2i6 and cut it up into 24 inch sections
everything<00:01:36.610> is<00:01:36.730> cut<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.150> rough<00:01:37.360> size<00:01:37.630> now<00:01:38.020> I'm

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
everything is cut to rough size now I'm

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.200 
everything is cut to rough size now I'm
going<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.410> rip<00:01:39.040> these<00:01:39.220> down<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.730> two<00:01:40.000> inch

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
going to rip these down to the two inch

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.420 
going to rip these down to the two inch
lengths<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.080> we<00:01:41.350> wrote<00:01:41.650> them<00:01:41.740> right<00:01:42.010> down<00:01:42.250> the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
lengths and we wrote them right down the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.160 
lengths and we wrote them right down the
middle<00:01:42.460> first<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.330> then<00:01:43.450> give<00:01:43.600> my<00:01:43.720> two<00:01:43.780> inches

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
middle first and then give my two inches

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.930 
middle first and then give my two inches
out<00:01:44.290> of<00:01:44.440> each<00:01:44.530> side<00:01:44.830> that<00:01:45.460> way<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:45.610> don't<00:01:45.820> have

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
out of each side that way I don't have

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.880 
out of each side that way I don't have
any<00:01:46.120> rounded<00:01:46.480> over<00:01:46.690> edges<00:01:46.990> factory<00:01:47.500> from<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
any rounded over edges factory from the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:02:32.420 
any rounded over edges factory from the
store

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.410 

now<00:02:33.430> moving<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.910> fence<00:02:34.120> down<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.570> two<00:02:34.750> inches

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
now moving the fence down to two inches

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.880 
now moving the fence down to two inches
now<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.450> could<00:02:37.810> rip<00:02:37.990> everything<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.530> its<00:02:38.680> final

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
now I could rip everything to its final

00:02:38.890 --> 00:03:08.680 
now I could rip everything to its final
width

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.290 

I'm<00:03:09.690> using<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.110> little<00:03:10.940> awkward<00:03:11.940> blade

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
I'm using this little awkward blade

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.540 
I'm using this little awkward blade
guide<00:03:12.950> our<00:03:13.950> blade<00:03:14.280> guard<00:03:14.730> rather<00:03:15.349> because<00:03:16.550> all

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
guide our blade guard rather because all

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.740 
guide our blade guard rather because all
of<00:03:17.610> these<00:03:18.030> pieces<00:03:19.640> that's<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.819> lot<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.120> times<00:03:21.360> to

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
of these pieces that's a lot of times to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.260 
of these pieces that's a lot of times to
reach<00:03:22.709> over<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.160> blade<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:23.849> figured<00:03:24.239> that

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
reach over the blade so I figured that

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.240 
reach over the blade so I figured that
would<00:03:24.630> protect<00:03:24.900> me<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.380> best<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.860> normally

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
would protect me the best I normally

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.160 
would protect me the best I normally
don't<00:03:26.340> use<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:26.700> thing<00:03:26.940> because<00:03:27.180> quite

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
don't use this thing because quite

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.890 
don't use this thing because quite
frankly<00:03:28.230> it's<00:03:28.709> kind<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:29.040> clumsy<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.900> awkward

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
frankly it's kind of clumsy and awkward

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.720 
frankly it's kind of clumsy and awkward
but<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:32.730> know<00:03:32.850> some<00:03:34.130> some<00:03:35.130> safety<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.550> better

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
but you know some some safety is better

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.430 
but you know some some safety is better
than<00:03:35.940> none<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.300> I<00:03:36.330> decided<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.989> use<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.319> this

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
than none so I decided to use it this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.190 
than none so I decided to use it this
time<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:38.459> anyway<00:03:38.730> I've<00:03:38.819> got<00:03:38.940> everything<00:03:39.330> cut

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
time but anyway I've got everything cut

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.229 
time but anyway I've got everything cut
to<00:03:40.410> rough<00:03:40.650> length<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.489> ripped<00:03:41.730> down<00:03:41.880> to

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
to rough length it is ripped down to

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.110 
to rough length it is ripped down to
final<00:03:42.660> width<00:03:42.870> final<00:03:43.620> thickness<00:03:44.069> now<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:44.880> need

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
final width final thickness now I need

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.430 
final width final thickness now I need
to<00:03:45.180> set<00:03:45.330> up<00:03:45.360> some<00:03:45.569> stop<00:03:45.780> blocks<00:03:46.019> on<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.260> miter

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
to set up some stop blocks on a miter

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.960 
to set up some stop blocks on a miter
saw<00:03:46.530> station<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:47.220> get<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.819> get

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
saw station to get this to get

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.490 
saw station to get this to get
everything<00:03:48.299> accurately<00:03:48.630> cut<00:03:49.140> out<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.440> the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
everything accurately cut out to the

from<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:57.020> angle<00:04:57.230> but<00:04:57.440> I've<00:04:58.220> lined<00:04:58.580> it<00:04:58.760> up

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
from this angle but I've lined it up

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.160 
from this angle but I've lined it up
with<00:04:59.180> my<00:04:59.870> zero<00:05:00.350> clearance<00:05:00.830> on<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.010> sled<00:05:01.310> and

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
with my zero clearance on the sled and

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.080 
with my zero clearance on the sled and
that's<00:05:03.170> where<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.500> needs<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.770> be<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.700> I've<00:05:04.820> came
