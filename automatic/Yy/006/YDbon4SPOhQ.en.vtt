00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello everyone knows the crusts 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.480
 I hope you are well 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.150
 that today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.990
 little tutorial to create kicks 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.719
 stopped for example in a corner is therefore 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.430
 it works like this in all modes 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.060
 multi but tim season face to face in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.400
 all modes 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.320
 it's really not complicated, it's good 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.449
 rather well known but I really do 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.680
 this video for this in case they do not 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.550
 are not aware 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.470
 so you go into technical game you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.960
 so here you are at reindeer training 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.910
 it's very simple you will see you 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980
 press select once you are there 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.320
 did you go to create kicks 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.899
 stopped here are you waiting up the blah 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.270
 blah then you go down to a corner 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.070
 so you can choose you often or 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.610
 either in a bench so you do for example 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.350
 at the top you go on to create new 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.020
 kick stopped we press on x 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.410
 so after you take you players 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.660
 so you change your players with the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.250
 right joystick so for example we have 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.439
 created a stopped kick like that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.570
 I have already created a code women will be 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.580
 to show you for example 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.909
 here you take your players you 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.670
 already put all on time and I'm going 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.740
 maybe put a little too close to him 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.390
 for more that fit in 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.270
 that's for example night I'm going 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.590
 leave there I'll take am there by 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.100
 example I'll put here by 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.720
 example 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.439
 and that one I'm going to put my everything 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.329
 in second post mode like this here 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.299
 I make it go into the goal with the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.420
 others I'm going I'll place the others 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.470
 also that but I will not place them 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.820
 in this vast would have happened because 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.530
 be aware that during a counter 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.450
 crazy attack during a counter attack 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.420
 forgive me, we must still keep 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.740
 a little bit of defense 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.570
 it's my opinion of fact being caught 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.250
 a goal 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.600
 So here again we then corrupts 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.430
 I will take the first 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.700
 so it's very simple you press a 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.710
 times will you 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.570
 take after with the left stick 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.460
 you choose the direction you want 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.830
 and call back right away on 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.989
 do not break like that so I support 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.750
 will be chosen direction and I rap us 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.280
 will you see the blue arrow and if 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.620
 you want to see again what it gives your 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.910
 race you press triangle here is 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.849
 he's racing you've got him 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.209
 asked him so I'll put it there 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.560
 up up and a second time on round him 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.950
 I will take it that I will put 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.910
 for example we take it to him 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.980
 that I'm going to put here for example 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.720
 so here after you remember on 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.450
 triangle to see what that gives it 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.130
 you and the whole race of your players 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.780
 to attest to it after what it gives 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.930
 you press past write them since 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.579
 x here you have tested what you have 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.690
 created you wait a little bit here 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.459
 as soon as you and you are days 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.200
 start to move there you do your 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.180
 center you see the place I had 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.519
 right now at once is really 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.220
 no defender on the other side for 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.829
 to stop I want to redo I have them 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.690
 tested like that would of course be a small 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.049
 big up there I'm doing my pass right here it is 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.410
 move all and hop the head and the goal 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.900
 beautiful goal I am not believe so 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.180
 here and so after disguised that you 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.310
 tap this square to save 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.799
 so he backup is held I the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.950
 save on that one up 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.440
 yes good bah without playing europe so 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.510
 I already named corner of Vouvoyer I 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.660
 had been holding the only corner three 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.380
 2 you press star after that's his 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.450
 safeguard 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.389
 you long-range game to the tribe 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.310
 right right arrow so after 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.200
 to make the other side you have on 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.519
 change zone 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.829
 you put yourself on the other side 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.410
 side for example 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.730
 so you can create 4 4 stone was 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.530
 down for each arrow 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.579
 so after that so here at home I 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.670
 will create a new kick 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.190
 stopped and we kill we'll change a little 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.690
 this time yeah instead you 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.549
 have really of course you have 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.950
 really infinite possibilities this 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.660
 shot and for really doing what you 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.709
 do you want to place them where you want 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.630
 as you see fit 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.360
 what for you do you feel is 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.210
 the best tactics on the part of 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.370
 own funds 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.110
 at the beginning I start to place 1 proof 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.690
 this want me I'm starting to place 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.070
 all my players I hope to touch here 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.270
 him I'm going to put there the game puts a little 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.070
 more fun here up him I'm going because you 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.810
 are a little bit here they are not 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.340
 too tight either in case his share in 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.070
 down or up the counter attack we do not 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.410
 never know must always be wary 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.630
 so here's back 4 I 'll take him by 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.340
 example knocked up I'm going to me 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.670
 position right now 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.570
 here it is after I'll take him so 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.500
 always round evora then on wheels him 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.860
 I will put it your way here 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:57.150
 him I'm going to put here and him I 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.770
 go to the first post so here 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.070
 like that after so as I told you 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.350
 you press x to attest to it 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.590
 wait a little hop here it must 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.580
 to be good here it goes ahead and there you 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.550
 make your head 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.030
 so I'm going to try it again so easily 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.080
 the ball 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.020
 so here I press x to test 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.150
 I wait a little bit and that's the 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.250
 choices that are gone I make my center 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.140
 and the head and the goal 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.760
 you see it's not complicated so 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.440
 after now I'm going to backup 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.110
 so is always the same you choose 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.400
 the arrow that you roll to support you 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.100
 there for example so I will resume 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:42.780
 on that one - replace it jarno but 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.760
 I press star he saves it and 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.590
 now it's done so after 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.440
 I told you you really have 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.060
 infinite possibilities 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.760
 you can really do what you 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.860
 want as you see fit 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.660
 and so I hope that this tutorial 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.330
 will have more beautiful angels as I have you 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.340

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.990
 are frorned good if I ever got 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.180
 to maybe even people who do not 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.290
 except maybe not how to do it or who 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.780
 wondered when they saw 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.480
 some people do this and in getting 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.090
 really saying how he does I know 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.100
