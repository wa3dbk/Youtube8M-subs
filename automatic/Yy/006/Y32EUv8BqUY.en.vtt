 hi to all this and nagasaki I hope that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.740
 you are fine 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.630
 for me it's going this video is going to be 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.430
 very short final because I'm doing it 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.160
 just to thank you all 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.160
 just getting me up to 11 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.870
 miles subscribers game it's going so fast 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.380
 compared to others youtuber it's true 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.710
 what to do on youtube via 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.820
 fine dofus and it's quite complicated 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.230
 because there are not so many 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.739
 people coming back is not like 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.960
 call of duty or where other games and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.350
 it's true that 10000 subscribers on a game 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.180
 like dofus and it's huge what makes me 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.149
 the pleasure is that you are 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.920
 super active on my channel finally I want 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.660
 to say that sometimes there are chains 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.519
 that they have 50 60 70 miles even times 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.369
 that's a hundred thousand subscribers but in the end the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.840
 videos are not watched so that wants 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.640
 to say a little bit that the videos 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.170
 were not really called people 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.119
 but here I admit that I'm going out a video 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.850
 three days after she's already this 4 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.100
 5000 subscribers ie that more than the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.500
 half of my subscribers are watching them 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.020
 it's huge and that's what makes me 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.780
 more pleasure 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.729
 thanks to you I went back to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.009
 rankings of the luis gamer channel 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.799
 I was placed 4th in the top 10 this future 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.560
 big youtuber and third in the top 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.670
 thanks because it's thanks to you and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.170
 I also thank the channel luis gamer 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.460
 business is doing this ranking because 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.590
 that it's really cool 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.270
 so here I leave you the excerpts 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.270
 thank you everyone and that him 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.940
 to the trianon other dofus players 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.860
 nagasaki which in my opinion will make that pass 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.150
 in the rankings very stealthily you 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.039
 he is already close to the 10 museum 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.380
 marmottan already the approaches I believe 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.489
 that I have 3g of stammering including the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:23.819
 perfect principle of course feel like 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:23.819
 it looks at me, I'm keeping a wild card 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.140
 he made a flash appearance in the 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.420
 ranking of less than 10,000 subscribers 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.890
 bessaih and nagasaki have already passed them 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.910
 for which he made a video in fact 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.890
 this comment is like me the week 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.880
 last so I was offered 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.880
