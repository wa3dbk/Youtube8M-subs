not attached

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.660 
not attached

and it's like it's all very very rubbery

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.580 
and it's like it's all very very rubbery

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
enough you wanted to you could probably

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.610

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
get it off you should really really

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.210 
get it off you should really really
tried<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.569> yeah<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.690> detail<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.650> very

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220

very<00:02:23.580> good<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.120> really<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.230> detail<00:02:26.000> it's

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
very good I really like to detail it's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.130 
very good I really like to detail it's
just<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:28.010> opposed<00:02:29.010> ability<00:02:29.519> it's<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.140> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
just the opposed ability it's just you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.559 
just the opposed ability it's just you
know<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.590> arms<00:02:31.890> feel<00:02:32.700> very<00:02:32.970> rubbery<00:02:33.239> I

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
know that the arms feel very rubbery I

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.259 
know that the arms feel very rubbery I
mean<00:02:33.750> they<00:02:33.870> will<00:02:33.989> move<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.550> hand<00:02:35.819> here<00:02:36.090> but

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
mean they will move in the hand here but

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.750 
mean they will move in the hand here but
I'm<00:02:36.360> not<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.720> chance<00:02:37.410> trying<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.800> break

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
I'm not going to chance trying to break

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.339 
I'm not going to chance trying to break
that<00:02:38.940> one<00:02:39.120> off<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.660> one<00:02:39.810> spins<00:02:40.110> all<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
that one off and this one spins all the

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.670 
that one off and this one spins all the
way<00:02:40.440> around<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:42.060> has<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.480> mid<00:02:42.690> bicep<00:02:43.230> spinning

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
way around it has the mid bicep spinning

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.770 
way around it has the mid bicep spinning
thing<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.190> on<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.549> mean<00:02:45.239> would<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.600> hurt

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
thing going on I mean would it have hurt

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.509 
thing going on I mean would it have hurt
to<00:02:45.840> put<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.140> little<00:02:46.290> elbow<00:02:46.500> articulation<00:02:46.799> in

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
to put a little elbow articulation in

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.150 
to put a little elbow articulation in
there<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.530> same<00:02:49.739> thing<00:02:50.010> with

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
there you know and the same thing with

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.289 
there you know and the same thing with
the<00:02:51.709> same<00:02:52.709> thing<00:02:52.769> with<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.519> does<00:02:53.850> spin<00:02:54.120> at

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
the same thing with the it does spin at

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.020 
the same thing with the it does spin at
the<00:02:54.330> hip<00:02:54.680> or<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.890> waist<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.280> mean<00:02:56.489> spins<00:02:56.849> all

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the hip or at the waist I mean spins all

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.250 
the hip or at the waist I mean spins all
the<00:02:57.120> way<00:02:57.209> around<00:02:58.880> but<00:02:59.880> it's<00:03:00.510> still<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.049> just

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
the way around but it's still it's just

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.710 
the way around but it's still it's just
not<00:03:01.410> enough<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.940> feet<00:03:03.120> here<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.540> has

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
not enough and that the feet here it has

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.350 
not enough and that the feet here it has
like<00:03:03.989> limited<00:03:04.410> movement<00:03:05.370> here<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.910> as<00:03:06.120> far

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
like limited movement here this as far

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.240 
like limited movement here this as far
as<00:03:06.480> they<00:03:06.630> go<00:03:06.660> right<00:03:06.959> there<00:03:07.430> there<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.730> there

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
as they go right there there and there

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.830 
as they go right there there and there
so<00:03:11.250> yeah<00:03:11.670> it's<00:03:11.880> extremely<00:03:12.390> disappointing

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
so yeah it's extremely disappointing

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.150 
so yeah it's extremely disappointing
then<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.049> try<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.260> stand<00:03:13.530> them<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.099> he

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
then you try to stand them up and he

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.650 
then you try to stand them up and he
just<00:03:14.310> wants<00:03:14.579> to<00:03:14.670> keep<00:03:14.820> falling<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.390> if<00:03:15.540> you

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
just wants to keep falling and if you

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.690 
just wants to keep falling and if you
try<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.900> pull<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.829> forward<00:03:17.190> pushing<00:03:17.430> down<00:03:17.670> on

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
try to pull it forward pushing down on

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.150 
try to pull it forward pushing down on
the<00:03:17.880> feet<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.180> try<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.620> work<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.769> forward

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
the feet to try to work it forward

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.090 
the feet to try to work it forward
eventually<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.120> just<00:03:21.299> falls<00:03:21.510> backwards<00:03:22.100> but

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
eventually it just falls backwards but

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.910 
eventually it just falls backwards but
other<00:03:23.250> than<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:24.030> does<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.709> is

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
other than that it does it it is

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.160 
other than that it does it it is
extremely<00:03:26.519> well<00:03:26.670> detailed<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.299> do<00:03:27.359> like<00:03:27.720> it

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
cool-looking well detailed looks

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.140 
cool-looking well detailed looks
somewhat<00:03:47.819> realistic<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.299> see<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:54.120> that
