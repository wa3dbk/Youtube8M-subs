00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
break down a little bit oil comes out of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.330 
break down a little bit oil comes out of
it<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.300> the<00:02:00.300> flavors<00:02:00.690> here<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:01.110> very<00:02:02.100> very

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
it and the flavors here are very very
intense<00:02:02.789> but<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.569> blends<00:02:03.990> together<00:02:04.229> very

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
intense but it all blends together very

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.340

well<00:02:04.800> at<00:02:05.069> the<00:02:05.159> end<00:02:05.190> of<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.899> now<00:02:06.990> that's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
well at the end of this so now that's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.400 
well at the end of this so now that's
going<00:02:07.679> just<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.979> little<00:02:08.009> bit<00:02:09.229> we're<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.350> to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
going just a little bit we're going to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.690 
going just a little bit we're going to
take<00:02:10.530> our<00:02:10.679> muscles<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:16.650> add<00:02:16.890> those<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.459> right

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
take our muscles just add those in right

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.110 
take our muscles just add those in right
on<00:02:17.730> top<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.150> all<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.480> good<00:02:19.310> flavor<00:02:23.030> okay<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
on top of all that good flavor okay and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.520 
on top of all that good flavor okay and
then<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.330> want<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.540> stir<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.959> up<00:02:25.080> just<00:02:25.350> a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
then you want to stir it up just a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:38.590 
then you want to stir it up just a
little<00:02:25.680> bit<00:02:25.799> here

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.760 

now<00:02:39.600> these<00:02:39.750> muscles<00:02:40.170> are<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.470> begin<00:02:40.620> to

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
now these muscles are going to begin to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.590 
now these muscles are going to begin to
open<00:02:41.040> pretty<00:02:41.550> quickly<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.150> as<00:02:42.210> soon<00:02:42.360> as<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
open pretty quickly and as soon as the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.230 
open pretty quickly and as soon as the
muscle<00:02:42.900> opens<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.950> means<00:02:44.160> it's<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.940> cooked

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
muscle opens that means it's it's cooked

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.300 
muscle opens that means it's it's cooked
so<00:02:45.810> we<00:02:45.930> want<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.200> do<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.470> step<00:02:47.010> pretty

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so we want to do that step pretty

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.310 
so we want to do that step pretty
quickly<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.390> get<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.600> white<00:02:48.750> wine<00:02:48.960> in<00:02:48.990> there

put<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:38.970> over<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.360> top<00:03:39.510> what<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.530> does<00:03:40.740> it

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
put that over the top what that does it

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.590 
put that over the top what that does it
helps<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.370> just<00:03:41.400> bring<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.030> sauce<00:03:42.270> together

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
little bit of cold butter just brings

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.460
