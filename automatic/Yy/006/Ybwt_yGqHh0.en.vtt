00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.150
 ideas I teach the ingredients that are going to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.490
 need let's start with a consommé 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.260
 of chicken that I have here I did it like that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 what proust I hope it does not go out buy in 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.890
 the stores we are going to use this tomato 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.199
 Onion and cilantro I used four tomatoes 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.470
 half an onion and a little cilantro 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.490
 let's use pepper chilitos jalapeño 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.310
 chopped 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.060
 and a little oregano what we're going to 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.370
 start 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.820
 a cup of water to start 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.910
 warm up from there I'll take my caldito 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.470
 chicken and as has already consume no 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.050
 I need to put it here 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.320
 and right there I'm going to throw all my 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.440
 vegetables and I'm going to cover it up 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.070
 help relieve all flavors 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.710
 and that our taquito is very rich 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.390
 our soup to put the tacos 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.960
 inside so we go to treatments 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.960
 chilitos 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:13.220
 well rich and oregano 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.700
 since it's all ready let's give it a 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.680
 small whipped and we'll cover it until 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.240
 start boiling and they have put 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.240
 soft vegetables 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.829
 ok the consummate is ready what I'm going 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.229
 to do what I 'm going to grind I 'm going to show you 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.079
 the vegetables so that the flavor comes out more 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.259
 Many people like to liquefy it the truth 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.780
 I like it that way I hope I can have it 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.140
 liquefy and leaves will also have the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.090
 flavor xavi mixed well and 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.569
