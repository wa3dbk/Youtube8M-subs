00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
alright now that I got the batteries all

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.439 
alright now that I got the batteries all
in<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.340> had<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> figure<00:00:02.850> out<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> way<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.270> get

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
in I had to figure out a way to get

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.390 
in I had to figure out a way to get
these<00:00:03.629> bus<00:00:03.870> bars<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.259> work<00:00:04.380> so<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.009> cut<00:00:05.250> some

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
these bus bars to work so I cut some

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.980 
these bus bars to work so I cut some
angled<00:00:05.759> pieces<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.150> wood<00:00:06.299> bouncing<00:00:06.899> them

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
angled pieces of wood bouncing them

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.839 
angled pieces of wood bouncing them
right<00:00:07.109> there<00:00:07.290> on<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.470> base<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.490> put<00:00:08.700> some

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
right there on the base and I put some

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.540 
right there on the base and I put some
post<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.269> top<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.290> now<00:00:10.500> I'm<00:00:11.099> gonna<00:00:11.250> bust

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
post on top of it and now I'm gonna bust

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.339 
post on top of it and now I'm gonna bust
my<00:00:11.759> system<00:00:12.150> right<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.540> from<00:00:12.750> one<00:00:12.929> jumper<00:00:13.259> to

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
my system right here from one jumper to

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.620 
my system right here from one jumper to
the<00:00:13.469> other<00:00:13.650> I'll<00:00:14.340> show<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.820> mean<00:00:15.120> I'm

the other I'll show you what I mean I'm

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.730 
the other I'll show you what I mean I'm
gonna<00:00:15.900> set<00:00:16.170> right<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.590> top<00:00:20.180> like<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.740> and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
gonna set right on top like that and

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.109 
gonna set right on top like that and
then<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.949> course<00:00:23.189> I'll<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.550> jumping<00:00:23.730> them<00:00:23.970> from

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
then of course I'll be jumping them from

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.359 
then of course I'll be jumping them from
there<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.840> there<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.980> get<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.220> most

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
there to there to get the most

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.640 
there to there to get the most
connection<00:00:26.849> possible<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:28.320> gonna<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
connection possible so I'm gonna do the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.200 
connection possible so I'm gonna do the
same<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> other<00:00:29.310> side<00:00:29.519> right<00:00:30.000> now<00:00:30.119> I'm

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
guys how difficult it really is to cut

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.830 
guys how difficult it really is to cut
this<00:00:34.320> half<00:00:34.559> inch<00:00:34.739> copper<00:00:35.010> man<00:00:35.969> oh<00:00:36.300> man<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
this half inch copper man oh man I

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.000 
this half inch copper man oh man I
didn't<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.590> was<00:00:37.680> getting<00:00:37.800> myself

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
didn't know what I was getting myself

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.650 
didn't know what I was getting myself
into<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.670> it'll<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.969> worth<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.390> end

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
into but it'll be worth it in the end

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
into but it'll be worth it in the end
so<00:00:40.200> let's<00:00:40.410> go<00:00:40.530> down<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> basement<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.219> start

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
so let's go down the basement and start

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.850 
so let's go down the basement and start
getting<00:00:41.610> some<00:00:41.760> holes<00:00:41.969> drilled<00:00:42.469> all<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
getting some holes drilled all right the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
getting some holes drilled all right the
copper<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.219> almost<00:00:44.399> ready<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.760> cut<00:00:44.969> but

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
copper is almost ready to be cut but

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.850 
copper is almost ready to be cut but
real<00:00:45.660> quick<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.960> thought<00:00:46.140> they<00:00:46.230> touch<00:00:46.410> Basin

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
real quick I thought they touch Basin

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
real quick I thought they touch Basin
tell<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.190> guys<00:00:47.340> why<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> chose<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.360> use<00:00:48.390> 1/2

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
tell you guys why I chose to use 1/2

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.150 
tell you guys why I chose to use 1/2
inch<00:00:48.930> copper<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.379> time<00:00:49.590> around<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.920> setup

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
inch copper this time around and setup

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.860 
inch copper this time around and setup
aluminum<00:00:50.550> well<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> grand<00:00:51.600> scheme<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
aluminum well on the grand scheme of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.600 
aluminum well on the grand scheme of
things<00:00:51.989> copper<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.680> way<00:00:52.920> more<00:00:53.129> conductive

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
things copper is way more conductive

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.189 
things copper is way more conductive
than<00:00:53.670> aluminum<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:54.809> pretty<00:00:55.020> much<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
than aluminum so that's pretty much the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
than aluminum so that's pretty much the
only<00:00:55.469> reason<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.670> first<00:00:56.789> time<00:00:57.030> around<00:00:57.239> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
only reason and the first time around I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.819 
only reason and the first time around I
did<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> well<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> didn't<00:00:58.320> want<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> spend<00:00:58.680> all

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
did it well I didn't want to spend all

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.049 
did it well I didn't want to spend all
that<00:00:58.890> much<00:00:59.129> money<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> knew<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> was<00:00:59.969> gonna

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that much money and I knew I was gonna

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
that much money and I knew I was gonna
upgrade<00:01:00.390> later<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.410> perfect<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:01.920> me

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
upgrade later so this is perfect for me

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
upgrade later so this is perfect for me
now<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> gonna<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> final

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
now because this is gonna be the final

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:14.600 
now because this is gonna be the final
