00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.689
 action there are people who spend their time 

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:07.810
 planning, planning, planning, but not 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:11.080
 dares to take any action in the 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.090
 1870s two men shared a 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.730
 same dream was the time of the 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.650
 telegraphy both had ideas of how 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.620
 transmitting the human voice through 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.930
 the wires the most interesting thing is that 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.900
 serious laughter was the first to put in 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:30.010
 practice his invention and curiously the 14 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.890
 February 1876 were presented each 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.649
 one for his part to register the patent 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.929
 from the phone he got up 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.809
 early and was the fifth person in the 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:43.929
 row to register a patent that day 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.120
 just a few hours later the lawyer 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.879
 de Gray came to apply for his patent 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.999
 a few hours that you know a 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.850
 true fortune gray the action is 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:58.060
 fundamental part of the success if not 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.790
 actions do not advance 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.220
 what is audacity a jump we do not know if 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.920
 we will fall from head to side but 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.700
 finally if you do not dare you 'll never 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.740
 to know 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.810
 it is preferable to face an enemy 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.540
 for giving you an example in a court of 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.970
 tennis that does not attend the game if you 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.920
 attends the game and loses I assure you that 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.050
 He already has more experience but if not 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.510
 he attends you do not put yourself to the test 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.030
 Audacity is a magical ingredient that 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:29.200
 allows to achieve great things in life 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.090
 when we talk about audacity is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.130
 fundamental to understand that in life 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.900
 requires a level of urgency to 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.570
 get involved with your desires with your 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.970
 dreams would you enter a house 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.190
 on fire and a fireman offered him ten 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.010
 dollars to rescue a kitten what 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.470
 I doubt true but what would happen if inside 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.020
 of that house was someone you love 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.350
 quite possibly your mother of your partner 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.080
 or a son you would very likely get in 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.170
 action immediately we call that 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.420
 have a level of urgency in life 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.250
 you have to learn to generate a level 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.540
 of urgency and take action to 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.110
 achieve what you dream 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.960
 remember that getting into the action is 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.210
 fundamental part of the achievements and the most 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.390
 important is to learn that if you do not 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.570
 actions now someone else will do it for 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.570
 you 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.569
 what is a strategy in fact the 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.670
 question is why we plan because I 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.200
 I'm sorry to plan because you start 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.569
 to plan because he plans tomorrow 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.260
 because he plans in six months or 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.930
 within a year 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.810
 look we plan because we want the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.819
 future is better so the present does not 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.890
 we are happy with him then we have 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.260
 what to plan what we want 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.569
 perform and for that we sit down to 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.549
 develop a strategy when 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.280
 we know where to finally arrive 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.489
 the roads the roads begin to 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.950
 identify the strategy is to know what 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.709
 moments in what times in what spaces 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.930
 I have to perform certain actions to 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.209
 make my dreams really come true 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.000
 become reality what happens when 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.620
 you have a wrong phone number you have 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.319
 a problem because you do not achieve the 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.200
 communication a single number in disorder 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.299
 change the result if you repeat the same 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.599
 formula you will continue to get the same 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.760
 results change of strategy seeks 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.230
 another way of doing things and not 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.330
 repeat the same recipe for failure 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.550
 a regular tennis player when playing with a 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.459
 tennis player of better level the player 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.190
 regular will rise to its level due to 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.569
 party demands curiously the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.880
 player of better level 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.470
 will lower your level of play due to 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.960
 few demands of the enemy 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.720
 look for challenges that commit to being 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.150
 better than you are to this day 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.750
 the bigger your biggest challenges 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.750
 your results will be 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.189
 two words that enclose a wisdom 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.260
 enormous because it unites them because and the 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.930
 asking is an art of asking is the 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.760
 way of wisdom asking us 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.859
 It leads to doubts but doubts 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.319
 lead to discovery there are people who 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.299
 think more about security no longer wants 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.519
 question nothing question anything but 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.310
 when you really start 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.989
 ask begin to fall the barriers 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.019
 of ignorance you start to investigate 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.389
 maybe the brightest mind that has 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.720
 given humanity was that of Leonardo da 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.699
 vinci a man who was a painter sculptor 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.340
 poet good artist that was up 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.470
 cook and always his whole life a 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.630
 man who questioned questioned the 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.270
 flight of a butterfly questioned the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.370
 beauty of a flower questioned so many 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.680
 things that led them to make the mind more 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.289
 creative of the record that we have of the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.169
 the brightest brains of mankind 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.060
 Socrates said I'd rather die than leave 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.070
 to ask and certainly that's why 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.440
 they killed for asking why they really 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.840
 he was investigating and he inherited a great 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.000
 philosophy 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.460
 can take us of course to the 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.370
 truth and the truth is really for 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.169
 those who are willing to 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.400
 discover it and still live how it is possible 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.919
 you can receive information images 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.800
 videos sound is already money through 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.010
 electronic media how is it possible that 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.590
 right now I 'm watching pictures in 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.720
 a screen the answer is very 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.720
 simple through energy e 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.180
 information when an individual wants 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.430
 moving the fingers of a hand uses the 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.070
 same principle of energy e 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.650
 information your brain sends the 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.990
 information at hand and the hand uses 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:44.240
 energy to move the fingers 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.240
 the essential matter of creation
