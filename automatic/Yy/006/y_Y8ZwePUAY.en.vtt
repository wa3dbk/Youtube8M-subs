the pulse wrap you got a baseball I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.709

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
think this has to do with when he threw

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
think this has to do with when he threw
that<00:00:45.870> first<00:00:46.200> pitch<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.039> awful<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that first pitch and it was awful I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.549 
that first pitch and it was awful I
think<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.570> some<00:00:48.930> funny<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.410> wanna
