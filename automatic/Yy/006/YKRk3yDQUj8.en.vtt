a bit tough I mean every single board

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.510 
a bit tough I mean every single board
has<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.030> go<00:01:42.240> through<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> process<00:01:42.600> of

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
has to go through a process of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520 
has to go through a process of
reexamination<00:01:44.520> education<00:01:45.509> keeping<00:01:45.960> up<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.200> up

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.750 
and it is a very you get the sense when
you<00:04:31.650> walk<00:04:31.800> in<00:04:31.950> through<00:04:32.070> even<00:04:32.370> though<00:04:32.460> you<00:04:32.550> know

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
you walk in through even though you know

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.670 
you walk in through even though you know
the<00:04:32.970> right<00:04:33.120> thing<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.870> door<00:04:34.080> closes<00:04:34.530> you're

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
the right thing the door closes you're

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.740 
the right thing the door closes you're
talking<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.160> each<00:04:35.280> other<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.730> you're<00:04:36.540> it's

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
talking to each other and you're it's

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.450 
talking to each other and you're it's
almost<00:04:37.050> like<00:04:37.260> breathing<00:04:37.560> in<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.860> bag<00:04:38.040> you<00:04:38.370> know

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
almost like breathing in a bag you know

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.130 
almost like breathing in a bag you know
at<00:04:38.640> first<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:39.180> feels<00:04:39.330> great<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.840> then<00:04:40.050> it

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
at first it feels great and then it

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.810 
at first it feels great and then it
makes<00:04:40.290> you<00:04:40.410> sick<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.640> can<00:04:41.730> be

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
makes you sick and so and it can be

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.060 
makes you sick and so and it can be
toxic<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.510> think<00:04:42.690> part<00:04:43.230> of<00:04:43.440> what<00:04:43.740> needs<00:04:43.920> to

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
toxic and I think part of what needs to

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.740 
toxic and I think part of what needs to
happen<00:04:44.100> is<00:04:44.430> we<00:04:44.520> need<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.730> open<00:04:44.790> the<00:04:45.120> doors<00:04:45.300> open

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
happen is we need to open the doors open

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.720 
happen is we need to open the doors open
our<00:04:45.840> minds<00:04:46.110> open<00:04:46.770> ourselves<00:04:46.890> to<00:04:47.190> new<00:04:47.430> ways<00:04:47.580> of

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
our minds open ourselves to new ways of

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.520 
our minds open ourselves to new ways of
thinking<00:04:47.790> and<00:04:48.150> being<00:04:48.750> self-critical<00:04:49.440> and

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
thinking and being self-critical and

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.800 
thinking and being self-critical and
also<00:04:50.310> being<00:04:50.490> more<00:04:50.790> open<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.240> honest<00:04:51.540> with<00:04:51.660> one

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
also being more open and honest with one

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.080 
also being more open and honest with one
another<00:04:51.840> around<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.410> room<00:04:52.560> will<00:04:53.010> you<00:04:53.220> do<00:04:54.000> you
