00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.710
 apart 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.630
 Of course we have a power supply that 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.180
 one together with the data cable 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.130

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.440
 the whole thing is about them and 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.020
 software which I mentioned in my blog 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.520
 very very detailed times have explained 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.729
 just look at the fox fonds de 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.030
 otherwise we still have the 3.5 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.430
 millimeter phone headset this is a 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.280

 or essays in others 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.450
 sizes and that was already more 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.700
 we do not need more in the box 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.500
 we do not what we need is that 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.630
 smartphone of the films more carefully 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.729
 look and then we will the battery 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.799
 insert and are done with the 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.950
 unboxing we drive on the left 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.259
 not to look at itself because here 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.000
 we have nothing silver these minutes 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.390
 frame that pulls around the housing 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.460
 up here dieter is going down here and 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.439
 so that the whole encloses and the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.840
 all in such a nicer touch there 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.310
 if you say so no matter on the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.380
 we have the right side up 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.150
 volume rocker I'll show you one 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.489
 a bit out there is messy 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.840
 pressure point has very good then just that 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.819
 a from spear unlock power button and 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.069

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.720
 these keys stand out stuck pieces 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.970
 and have a good pressure point the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.280
 camera button directly two pressure points 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.140
 once to focus once around 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.040
 trigger to make the photo 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.230
 Of course we also have a top 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.150
 here the frame offers the widest width 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.830
 looks a bit like that a bit 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.209
 according to chrome I would say 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.130
 we have a bad one up here 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.660
 a little yes because I'm not so small 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.569

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.660
 push cross the 3.5 mm 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.420
 jack connection to the headset must 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.170
 Of course, 3.5 millimeters in diameter 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.630
 to have 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.349
 come in and you can do any 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.959
 tuck in 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.489
 we have a micro-usb connection around that 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.180
 device to load or exchange data 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.230
 and the 1 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.049
 Secondary microphone on the bottom 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.940
 not but we have a backside us 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.510

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.459
 single led as lightning the nokia 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.760
 Lettering down the speaker and 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.940
 the exact description nokia 610 because 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.470

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.780
 see that we give him a micro-sim 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.209
 insert and we also see music 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.889
 have a memory card slot 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.200
 So do not expand the memory 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.690
 how big he is to us more 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.060
 first put the battery in with the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.069
 Contact down so that's here 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.950
 wrong lies in it and do the whole thing 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.470
 to the whole is very easy and 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.340
 very easily a very right on and 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.340
 push again 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.290
 Just push it over but it is 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.730
 still really firm so I have 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.010
 do not be afraid that somehow 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.739
 all of a sudden it does not slip away 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.400
 we come to the front to the important one 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.290
 side because we have the audi here and 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.690
 in luks lettering to approximation and 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.430
 light sensor to turn off the display 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.319
 when calling for example and 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.030
 also the maximum resp 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.400
 the brightness of the display at all 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.440
 regulate automatically 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.690
 below we have a microphone for 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.270
 call a back button a home 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.600
 Taste and a search search fits and 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.410
 the main one is the most important 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.440
 display 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:36.430
 we have a 3.7 inch lcd with one 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.180
 resolution of 800 x 480 pixel colors 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:44.650
 It can be exactly 65,000 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:48.610
 65,536 and we have stable gorilla 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.500
 glass with on board as much as big 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.039
 is that in total we have one 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.820
 housing height of 119 2 mm so close 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:02.500
 twelve centimeters 62 2 mm it is wide 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.270
 and 11.9 mm thick or thin 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.190
 really neat in size 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.680
 in the hand you can easily get anywhere 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.539
 turn on every button on top 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.800
 the connections you do not 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.440
 you absolutely need to come anyway 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.070
 and no problem here 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.419
 ranzukommen 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:24.310
 the device gives it in white looks like that 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.870
 in black there looks like magenta 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.650
 that looks or still is 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.300
 a little blue version that you open 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.810
 the device on the packaging but not 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.349
 able to see 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.150
 the device costs about 160 euro if 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:40.120
 you can have it you can do it too 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.550
 There are a few problems with it 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.620
 magenta visions have the heavier 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.169
 is and is usually a little more expensive 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.310
 as the other models 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.419
 I thought I would tell something else 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.130
 to the battery and how capacity is 1300 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.250
 milliammetric hours weight included 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:00.490
 battery 192 km and the internal memory 8 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.680
 gigabytes of it are about 56 's 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.889
 free and as I said he is not 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.039
 expandable and yes that's it 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.840
 that was my unboxing to nokia lumia 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.060
 600 animals I hope you liked it 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.150
