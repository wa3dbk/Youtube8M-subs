dark<00:00:22.980> elixir<00:00:23.189> i<00:00:23.430> believe<00:00:23.670> i<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:23.789> spent<00:00:24.029> like

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
dark elixir i believe i just spent like

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
the pretty tanky I think incentive than

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.379 
the pretty tanky I think incentive than
a<00:06:11.870> shiny<00:06:13.070> but<00:06:14.070> they<00:06:14.340> have<00:06:14.610> a<00:06:14.639> lot<00:06:14.910> of<00:06:14.940> housing

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
a shiny but they have a lot of housing

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:16.790 
a shiny but they have a lot of housing
space<00:06:15.600> for<00:06:15.900> them<00:06:16.020> so<00:06:16.229> they're<00:06:16.350> not<00:06:16.440> worth<00:06:16.650> it

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
space for them so they're not worth it

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
space for them so they're not worth it
so<00:06:16.919> I've<00:06:16.979> got<00:06:17.100> the<00:06:17.130> one<00:06:17.310> who<00:06:17.370> can<00:06:17.520> present
