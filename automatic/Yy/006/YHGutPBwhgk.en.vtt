00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
or champagne iphone 5s is a reality in

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.680 
or champagne iphone 5s is a reality in
my<00:00:33.430> opinion<00:00:33.670> i<00:00:33.910> think<00:00:33.940> it<00:00:34.150> does<00:00:34.180> look<00:00:34.480> pretty

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
my opinion i think it does look pretty

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.630 
my opinion i think it does look pretty
cool<00:00:35.050> it<00:00:35.320> is<00:00:35.620> still<00:00:35.800> going<00:00:35.949> to<00:00:36.010> be<00:00:36.100> available

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
cool it is still going to be available

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.940 
cool it is still going to be available
in<00:00:36.820> a<00:00:36.969> white<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.450> silver<00:00:37.780> but<00:00:38.500> one<00:00:38.710> thing<00:00:38.920> that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
in a white and silver but one thing that

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.190 
in a white and silver but one thing that
has<00:00:39.340> changed<00:00:39.370> is<00:00:40.000> that<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.300> black<00:00:40.570> model<00:00:40.989> has

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
has changed is that the black model has

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.340 
has changed is that the black model has
been<00:00:41.440> replaced<00:00:41.829> by<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.270> space<00:00:43.270> gray<00:00:43.840> like<00:00:44.200> they

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
been replaced by a space gray like they

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.530 
been replaced by a space gray like they
like<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.649> call<00:00:44.829> it<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:45.190> i<00:00:45.850> think<00:00:45.879> that<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.360> kind

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
like to call it and i think that is kind

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.569 
like to call it and i think that is kind
of<00:00:46.629> because<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.110> black<00:00:47.410> slim<00:00:47.829> model<00:00:48.160> did<00:00:48.340> have

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
of because the black slim model did have

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.029 
of because the black slim model did have
some<00:00:48.760> issues<00:00:48.879> with<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.390> chipping<00:00:50.020> i<00:00:50.289> also<00:00:50.739> saw

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
some issues with the chipping i also saw

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.799 
some issues with the chipping i also saw
some<00:00:51.070> people<00:00:51.399> have<00:00:51.760> their<00:00:52.000> black<00:00:52.329> kind<00:00:52.719> of

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
some people have their black kind of

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.810 
some people have their black kind of
fade<00:00:53.050> off<00:00:53.350> of<00:00:53.530> their<00:00:53.680> phone<00:00:53.950> but<00:00:54.550> I'm<00:00:54.670> actually

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
fade off of their phone but I'm actually

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.520 
fade off of their phone but I'm actually
pretty<00:00:55.120> curious<00:00:55.449> to<00:00:55.690> see<00:00:55.870> how<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.170> gray

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
actually looks it actually looks pretty

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.240 
actually looks it actually looks pretty
nice<00:00:58.390> any<00:00:58.690> photos<00:00:59.140> that<00:00:59.320> Apple<00:00:59.680> did<00:00:59.860> release

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
nice any photos that Apple did release

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.849 
nice any photos that Apple did release
it<00:01:01.030> will<00:01:01.149> still<00:01:01.390> be<00:01:01.420> coming<00:01:01.750> in<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:01.930> 16<00:01:02.350> 32<00:01:02.710> and

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
it will still be coming in a 16 32 and

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.639 
it will still be coming in a 16 32 and
64<00:01:03.520> gigabyte<00:01:03.940> configuration<00:01:04.720> starting<00:01:05.560> at

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
64 gigabyte configuration starting at

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.700 
64 gigabyte configuration starting at
199<00:01:06.250> on<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> tear<00:01:06.880> contract<00:01:07.570> same<00:01:08.229> price<00:01:08.470> and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
199 on a tear contract same price and

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.289 
199 on a tear contract same price and
everything<00:01:09.100> as<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.430> previous<00:01:09.790> model<00:01:10.000> the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
everything as the previous model the

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.120 
everything as the previous model the
overall<00:01:10.630> form<00:01:10.930> factor<00:01:11.350> does<00:01:11.590> look<00:01:11.799> the<00:01:11.920> same

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
overall form factor does look the same

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.130 
overall form factor does look the same
as<00:01:12.400> well<00:01:12.790> but<00:01:13.479> I'm<00:01:13.600> actually<00:01:13.720> really<00:01:14.020> excited

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
as well but I'm actually really excited

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.219 
as well but I'm actually really excited
about<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:14.979> internals<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.970> an<00:01:16.479> apple<00:01:16.840> a7

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
about the internals is an apple a7

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.190 
about the internals is an apple a7
processor<00:01:17.530> like<00:01:18.070> we<00:01:18.250> had<00:01:18.400> predicted<00:01:18.760> a<00:01:19.200> 64-bit

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
processor like we had predicted a 64-bit

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.050 
processor like we had predicted a 64-bit
which<00:01:20.409> is<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.650> first<00:01:20.920> seen<00:01:21.280> on<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.549> smartphone

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
which is the first seen on a smartphone

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.399 
which is the first seen on a smartphone
it's<00:01:22.479> going<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.720> be<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.840> very<00:01:23.110> powerful

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
it's going to be a very powerful

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.070 
it's going to be a very powerful
processor<00:01:24.340> I'm<00:01:24.700> very<00:01:24.970> excited<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.720> check<00:01:25.900> that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
processor I'm very excited to check that

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.810 
processor I'm very excited to check that
out<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:26.470> they<00:01:26.560> do<00:01:26.740> claim<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.220> it<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.430> five

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
out and they do claim that it is five

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.960 
out and they do claim that it is five
times<00:01:28.150> faster<00:01:28.810> than<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.020> iphone<00:01:29.590> 5<00:01:30.009> that's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
times faster than the iphone 5 that's

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.310 
times faster than the iphone 5 that's
going<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.180> bring<00:01:31.299> some<00:01:31.509> extra<00:01:31.659> power<00:01:32.049> whether

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
going to bring some extra power whether

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.840 
going to bring some extra power whether
you're<00:01:32.560> doing<00:01:32.799> gaming<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.460> your<00:01:33.579> everyday

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
you're doing gaming and your everyday

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.789 
you're doing gaming and your everyday
tasks<00:01:34.540> are<00:01:34.720> just<00:01:34.930> going<00:01:35.079> to<00:01:35.110> run<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:35.619> much

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
tasks are just going to run so much

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.480 
tasks are just going to run so much
better<00:01:36.100> from<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:36.820> processor<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:38.490> there's

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
better from that processor and there's

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.850 
better from that processor and there's
also<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.930> coprocessor<00:01:40.930> that<00:01:41.470> they<00:01:41.560> like<00:01:41.740> to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
also a coprocessor that they like to

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.120 
also a coprocessor that they like to
call<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.640> m7<00:01:43.420> motion<00:01:43.600> coprocessor<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
call the m7 motion coprocessor that

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.940

until<00:02:12.709> next<00:02:13.190> year<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.610> iphone<00:02:13.970> 6<00:02:14.330> but<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.560> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
until next year the iphone 6 but in the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.589 
until next year the iphone 6 but in the
camera<00:02:16.340> itself<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.970> was<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> little<00:02:17.510> bit

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
camera itself I was a little bit

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.180 
camera itself I was a little bit
surprised<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.260> does<00:02:18.440> stay<00:02:18.739> at<00:02:18.950> eight

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
surprised it does stay at eight

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.890 
surprised it does stay at eight
megapixels<00:02:19.909> I<00:02:20.060> did<00:02:20.269> think<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.540> they<00:02:20.750> would

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
megapixels I did think that they would

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.320 
megapixels I did think that they would
actually<00:02:21.110> improve<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.799> 10<00:02:22.159> a<00:02:22.400> 12<00:02:22.670> or<00:02:23.060> even

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
actually improve it to a 10 a 12 or even

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.809 
actually improve it to a 10 a 12 or even
a<00:02:23.390> 13<00:02:23.840> megapixel<00:02:24.019> camera<00:02:24.830> we<00:02:25.400> did<00:02:25.580> see<00:02:25.730> an

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
a 13 megapixel camera we did see an

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.240 
a 13 megapixel camera we did see an
increase<00:02:26.180> from<00:02:26.329> the<00:02:26.420> four<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.049> 4s<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:28.220> i

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
increase from the four to the 4s but i

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.770 
increase from the four to the 4s but i
guess<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.579> camera<00:02:28.879> on<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.120> iPhone<00:02:29.480> 5<00:02:29.750> is

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
guess the camera on the iPhone 5 is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.960 
guess the camera on the iPhone 5 is
already<00:02:30.170> very<00:02:30.409> good<00:02:30.799> but<00:02:31.069> they<00:02:31.190> did<00:02:31.400> do<00:02:31.640> quite

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
already very good but they did do quite

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.580 
already very good but they did do quite
a<00:02:32.000> few<00:02:32.120> things<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.659> make<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.200> little<00:02:33.349> bit

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
a few things to make it a little bit

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.490 
a few things to make it a little bit
better<00:02:33.769> it<00:02:34.760> does<00:02:34.970> have<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.569> continuous<00:02:36.230> burst

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
better it does have a continuous burst

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.009 
better it does have a continuous burst
true<00:02:36.980> tone<00:02:37.190> flash<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.940> dual<00:02:38.209> flash<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.720> think<00:02:38.930> it

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
true tone flash a dual flash to think it

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.559 
true tone flash a dual flash to think it
looks<00:02:39.200> like<00:02:39.440> auto<00:02:39.950> image<00:02:40.430> stabilization<00:02:40.940> so

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
looks like auto image stabilization so

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.150 
looks like auto image stabilization so
you<00:02:41.660> can<00:02:41.750> capture<00:02:41.989> your<00:02:42.319> quick<00:02:42.590> images<00:02:42.980> better

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
you can capture your quick images better

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.800 
you can capture your quick images better
it<00:02:43.400> will<00:02:43.489> automatically<00:02:44.030> stabilize<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.780> and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
it will automatically stabilize it and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.559 
it will automatically stabilize it and
get<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.260> nice<00:02:45.440> focused<00:02:45.980> crisp<00:02:46.340> image<00:02:46.760> slow

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
get a nice focused crisp image slow

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.289 
get a nice focused crisp image slow
motion<00:02:47.750> video<00:02:48.109> and<00:02:48.590> also<00:02:48.890> live<00:02:49.430> zoom<00:02:49.819> during

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
motion video and also live zoom during

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.000 
motion video and also live zoom during
video<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.230> could<00:02:51.379> still<00:02:51.590> pinch<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:51.980> zoom

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
video so you could still pinch to zoom

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.490 
video so you could still pinch to zoom
of<00:02:52.400> course<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:52.819> digital<00:02:53.180> zoom<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.049> guess

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
of course it's digital zoom but I guess

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.259 
of course it's digital zoom but I guess
when<00:02:54.709> it's<00:02:54.829> handy<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.340> use<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.000> and

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
when it's handy you can use that and

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.330 
when it's handy you can use that and
slow<00:02:57.019> motion<00:02:57.349> video<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.650> guess<00:02:57.890> some<00:02:58.099> people

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
slow motion video I guess some people

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.740 
slow motion video I guess some people
would<00:02:58.430> like<00:02:58.609> to<00:02:58.640> use<00:02:58.879> that<00:02:59.060> if<00:02:59.329> you're<00:02:59.480> doing<00:02:59.659> a

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
would like to use that if you're doing a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.839 
would like to use that if you're doing a
skateboarding<00:03:00.409> tricks<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:00.980> think<00:03:01.730> it's

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
skateboarding tricks I think it's

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:02.830 
skateboarding tricks I think it's
actually<00:03:02.000> pretty<00:03:02.239> cool<00:03:02.480> with<00:03:02.569> all<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
actually pretty cool with all the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.690 
actually pretty cool with all the
settings<00:03:03.170> they've<00:03:03.349> done<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.799> of<00:03:03.890> course<00:03:04.159> iOS

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
settings they've done and of course iOS

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.569 
settings they've done and of course iOS

the facetime HD camera is 1.9 megapixels
and<00:03:19.880> they<00:03:20.389> have<00:03:20.540> also<00:03:20.900> made<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:21.169> pixels

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
and they have also made the pixels

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.550 
and they have also made the pixels
itself<00:03:22.310> fifteen<00:03:22.940> percent<00:03:23.359> larger<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:24.169> is<00:03:24.319> now

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.270 
itself fifteen percent larger it is now
a<00:03:24.889> 1.5<00:03:25.849> microns<00:03:26.540> sensor<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:27.709> they'll<00:03:27.950> get<00:03:28.160> you

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
a 1.5 microns sensor so they'll get you

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.309 
a 1.5 microns sensor so they'll get you
a<00:03:28.310> little<00:03:28.639> bit<00:03:28.760> better<00:03:29.150> image<00:03:29.599> quality<00:03:29.870> like

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
a little bit better image quality like

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.650 
a little bit better image quality like
they<00:03:30.470> claim<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.069> it<00:03:31.400> has<00:03:31.549> an<00:03:31.730> aperture<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.269> F

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
they claim and it has an aperture of F

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.659 
they claim and it has an aperture of F
2.2<00:03:33.500> which<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:33.829> still<00:03:34.040> going<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.250> get<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.489> some

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
2.2 which is still going to get you some

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.879 
2.2 which is still going to get you some
great<00:03:34.879> depth<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.359> field<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:36.379> in<00:03:36.500> terms<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.769> the

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
great depth of field so in terms of the

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.409 
great depth of field so in terms of the
camera<00:03:37.280> we're<00:03:37.489> really<00:03:37.700> going<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:37.940> have<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.120> see

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
camera we're really going to have to see

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.210 
camera we're really going to have to see
there's<00:03:38.690> an<00:03:38.840> ink<00:03:39.049> improvement<00:03:39.799> of<00:03:39.980> course

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
there's an ink improvement of course

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.640 
there's an ink improvement of course
I'll<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.489> comparison<00:03:41.150> when<00:03:41.299> it<00:03:41.419> arrives<00:03:41.750> but

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
I'll do comparison when it arrives but

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.339 
I'll do comparison when it arrives but
in<00:03:43.220> terms<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.639> the<00:03:43.730> megapixels<00:03:44.389> itself<00:03:44.930> it

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
in terms of the megapixels itself it

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.680 
in terms of the megapixels itself it
hasn't<00:03:45.739> really<00:03:45.859> changed<00:03:45.980> yet<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:47.269> course<00:03:47.510> it

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
hasn't really changed yet of course it

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.050 
hasn't really changed yet of course it
will<00:03:47.780> ship<00:03:48.019> with<00:03:48.169> ios7<00:03:48.859> there's<00:03:49.280> also<00:03:49.459> LTE

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
will ship with ios7 there's also LTE

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.479 
will ship with ios7 there's also LTE
wireless<00:03:50.419> and<00:03:50.959> one<00:03:51.560> thing<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:51.889> wish<00:03:52.190> they<00:03:52.400> had

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
wireless and one thing I wish they had

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.009 
wireless and one thing I wish they had
done<00:03:52.699> but<00:03:52.970> they<00:03:53.060> actually<00:03:53.359> didn't<00:03:53.599> is<00:03:53.750> it

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
done but they actually didn't is it

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.460 
done but they actually didn't is it
doesn't<00:03:54.440> have<00:03:54.590> any<00:03:54.889> 802<00:03:55.760> 11<00:03:56.120> AC<00:03:56.660> support<00:03:57.349> which

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
doesn't have any 802 11 AC support which

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.740 
doesn't have any 802 11 AC support which
is<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.680> next<00:03:57.829> generation<00:03:57.980> wireless<00:03:58.669> which<00:03:59.629> I

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
is the next generation wireless which I

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.449 
is the next generation wireless which I
really<00:03:59.989> don't<00:04:00.199> understand<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.889> Apple<00:04:01.250> did

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
really don't understand is Apple did

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.140 
really don't understand is Apple did
release<00:04:01.819> a<00:04:02.949> airport<00:04:03.949> extreme<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.699> did<00:04:04.970> have

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
release a airport extreme that did have

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.509 
release a airport extreme that did have
AC<00:04:05.419> support<00:04:05.989> so<00:04:06.199> it<00:04:06.440> makes<00:04:06.949> it<00:04:07.040> kind<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.280> weird

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
AC support so it makes it kind of weird

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.089 
AC support so it makes it kind of weird
that<00:04:07.730> their<00:04:08.239> next<00:04:08.840> generation<00:04:09.290> smartphone

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
that their next generation smartphone

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.830 
that their next generation smartphone
the<00:04:10.280> flagship<00:04:10.730> phone<00:04:10.970> doesn't<00:04:11.480> have<00:04:11.510> support

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
the flagship phone doesn't have support

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.039 
the flagship phone doesn't have support
for<00:04:12.230> AC<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:13.160> faster<00:04:13.549> speeds<00:04:13.879> for<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.359> so

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
for AC and the faster speeds for that so

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.420 
for AC and the faster speeds for that so
I<00:04:15.079> think<00:04:15.530> that's<00:04:15.680> one<00:04:15.859> thing<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.220> was<00:04:16.400> a

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
I think that's one thing that I was a

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.699 
I think that's one thing that I was a
little<00:04:16.729> bit<00:04:16.820> disappointed<00:04:17.419> about<00:04:17.510> of<00:04:18.349> course

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
little bit disappointed about of course

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.080 
little bit disappointed about of course
there's<00:04:18.890> also<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.280> fingerprint<00:04:19.789> sensor

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
there's also the fingerprint sensor

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.490 
there's also the fingerprint sensor
there<00:04:20.269> was<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.390> lot<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.659> talk<00:04:21.019> about<00:04:21.200> that

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
there was a lot of talk about that

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.530 
there was a lot of talk about that
before<00:04:21.859> that<00:04:22.010> and

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
before that and

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.030 
before that and
I<00:04:22.600> actually<00:04:22.900> wasn't<00:04:23.320> really<00:04:23.770> understanding

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
I actually wasn't really understanding

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.160 
I actually wasn't really understanding
why<00:04:24.850> they<00:04:25.000> would<00:04:25.150> need<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.330> fingerprint<00:04:25.870> sensor

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
why they would need a fingerprint sensor

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.230 
why they would need a fingerprint sensor
in<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.350> phone<00:04:26.680> itself<00:04:27.190> however<00:04:28.090> the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
in the phone itself however the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.550 
in the phone itself however the
fingerprint<00:04:28.690> sensor<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.080> going<00:04:29.230> to<00:04:29.290> be<00:04:29.350> built

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
fingerprint sensor is going to be built

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.140 
fingerprint sensor is going to be built
into<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.920> home<00:04:30.100> button<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.490> can<00:04:30.640> also<00:04:30.820> see<00:04:31.120> a

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
into the home button you can also see a

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.320 
into the home button you can also see a
little<00:04:31.420> bit<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.980> ring<00:04:32.980> or<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.310> halo<00:04:33.790> built<00:04:34.060> into

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
little bit the ring or a halo built into

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.730 
little bit the ring or a halo built into
the<00:04:34.420> phone<00:04:34.600> as<00:04:34.810> well<00:04:34.990> around<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.380> home<00:04:35.530> button

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
the phone as well around the home button

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.620 
the phone as well around the home button
I<00:04:36.010> think<00:04:36.430> that<00:04:36.550> adds<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:36.910> little<00:04:37.090> bit<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.360> a

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
I think that adds a little bit of a

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.960 
I think that adds a little bit of a
design<00:04:38.110> accent<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:38.920> one<00:04:39.220> noticeable<00:04:39.610> change

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
design accent and one noticeable change

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.610 
design accent and one noticeable change
when<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.330> put<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:40.780> side-by-side<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.500> the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
when you put it side-by-side to the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.100 
when you put it side-by-side to the
iphone<00:04:42.010> 5<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:43.120> fingerprint<00:04:43.570> sensor<00:04:43.900> will<00:04:44.050> be

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
iphone 5 the fingerprint sensor will be

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.340 
iphone 5 the fingerprint sensor will be
used<00:04:44.350> for<00:04:44.620> stuff<00:04:44.920> like<00:04:45.130> unlocking<00:04:45.700> your<00:04:45.940> phone

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
used for stuff like unlocking your phone

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.110 
used for stuff like unlocking your phone
being<00:04:47.350> able<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.740> enter<00:04:48.730> your<00:04:48.850> password

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
being able to enter your password

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.910 
being able to enter your password
without<00:04:49.570> actually<00:04:50.020> having<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.290> type<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.800> in

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
without actually having to type it in

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.380 
without actually having to type it in
your<00:04:51.160> able<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.520> have<00:04:51.670> multiple<00:04:52.030> on<00:04:52.270> the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
your able to have multiple on the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.510 
your able to have multiple on the
account<00:04:52.690> so<00:04:53.410> this<00:04:53.590> is<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.800> first<00:04:54.040> time<00:04:54.280> we've

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
account so this is the first time we've

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.330 
account so this is the first time we've
really<00:04:54.760> seen<00:04:55.060> any<00:04:55.330> large<00:04:55.840> phone<00:04:56.260> company<00:04:56.710> kind

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
really seen any large phone company kind

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.250 
really seen any large phone company kind
of<00:04:57.430> push<00:04:57.640> out<00:04:57.850> this<00:04:58.210> kind<00:04:58.420> of<00:04:58.480> technology<00:04:58.810> so

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
of push out this kind of technology so

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.690 
of push out this kind of technology so
we're<00:04:59.440> really<00:04:59.650> going<00:04:59.800> to<00:04:59.890> have<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.070> see<00:05:00.370> which

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
we're really going to have to see which

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.580 
we're really going to have to see which
direction<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.450> goes<00:05:01.690> whether<00:05:02.020> people<00:05:02.320> will
