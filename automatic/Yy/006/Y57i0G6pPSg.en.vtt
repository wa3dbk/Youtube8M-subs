00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.360 

so<00:03:45.269> put<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.200> measuring<00:03:46.500> tape<00:03:46.530> next<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.280> the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
so put the measuring tape next to the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.660 
so put the measuring tape next to the
hair<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:48.060> falls<00:03:48.959> at<00:03:49.470> about<00:03:50.190> 13<00:03:51.380> at<00:03:52.380> about<00:03:52.829> 13<00:03:53.459> 14

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
hair it falls at about 13 at about 13 14

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.330 
hair it falls at about 13 at about 13 14
inches<00:03:54.269> which<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.690> perfect<00:03:55.319> because<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.310> a

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
inches which is perfect because it is a

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.120 
inches which is perfect because it is a
14<00:03:56.760> inch<00:03:56.790> hair<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.540> when<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.500> pull<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.860> hair

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
14 inch hair and when you pull this hair

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.759 
14 inch hair and when you pull this hair
it<00:03:59.370> actually<00:03:59.579> goes<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.000> 16<00:04:00.630> inches<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:01.650> i<00:04:01.680> think

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
it actually goes to 16 inches so i think

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.920 
it actually goes to 16 inches so i think
that's<00:04:02.010> pretty<00:04:02.190> cool<00:04:02.430> then<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.269> goes<00:04:03.390> actually

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
that's pretty cool then it goes actually

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.160 
that's pretty cool then it goes actually
a<00:04:03.959> little<00:04:04.140> bit<00:04:04.349> past<00:04:04.590> i'm<00:04:05.489> 16<00:04:05.910> inches<00:04:06.180> about<00:04:06.780> 16

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
a little bit past i'm 16 inches about 16

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.509 
a little bit past i'm 16 inches about 16
and<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.319> half<00:04:07.349> so<00:04:07.650> i<00:04:07.680> think<00:04:07.829> that's<00:04:08.099> really<00:04:08.190> cool

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
and a half so i think that's really cool

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.000 
and a half so i think that's really cool
that<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.569> kind<00:04:10.049> of<00:04:10.110> get<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.290> little<00:04:10.440> bit<00:04:10.680> longer

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
that you kind of get a little bit longer

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.220 
that you kind of get a little bit longer
than<00:04:11.310> what<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.549> actually<00:04:11.700> pay<00:04:12.030> for<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.569> then

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
than what you actually pay for and then

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.830 
than what you actually pay for and then
now<00:04:13.349> i'm<00:04:13.410> going<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.620> show<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.720> 16<00:04:15.720> inch

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
now i'm going to show you the 16 inch

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.090

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.040 
and I like this one a lot um 16 inches
is<00:04:20.250> true<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.609> length<00:04:20.760> as<00:04:20.970> well<00:04:22.970> if<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.810> curl

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
is true to length as well if the curl

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.159 
is true to length as well if the curl
stops<00:04:25.440> at<00:04:25.680> about<00:04:26.039> 16<00:04:26.700> almost<00:04:27.090> exactly<00:04:27.539> 15<00:04:27.960> and

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
stops at about 16 almost exactly 15 and

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.960 
stops at about 16 almost exactly 15 and
a<00:04:28.200> half<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.310> thing<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.580> like<00:04:29.729> about<00:04:29.760> this

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
a half and the thing I like about this

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.270 
a half and the thing I like about this
one<00:04:30.270> too<00:04:30.450> is<00:04:30.630> when<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.900> pull<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.800> pulls<00:04:32.070> all

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
one too is when you pull it it pulls all

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.540 
one too is when you pull it it pulls all
the<00:04:32.400> way<00:04:32.610> down<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.850> 20<00:04:33.360> inches<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.460> think

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
the way down to 20 inches so I think

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.490 
the way down to 20 inches so I think
that's<00:04:35.789> really<00:04:35.910> cool<00:04:38.960> so<00:04:39.960> yeah<00:04:40.110> this<00:04:40.289> hair<00:04:40.470> is

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
that's really cool so yeah this hair is

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.620 
that's really cool so yeah this hair is
pretty<00:04:40.860> long<00:04:41.130> for<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.639> the<00:04:41.729> only<00:04:41.940> 16<00:04:42.300> inches

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
pretty long for to the only 16 inches

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.990 
pretty long for to the only 16 inches
I'm<00:04:43.020> not<00:04:43.320> really<00:04:43.500> into<00:04:43.950> really<00:04:44.430> long<00:04:44.639> hair<00:04:44.970> I

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
I'm not really into really long hair I

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.270 
I'm not really into really long hair I
