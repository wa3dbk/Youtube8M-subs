00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.840
 steven the first question is my full 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.549
 seriously I do not have at the penalty 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.970
 Looked over describes what you did 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:12.280
 I have started from half left 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.040
 I just shot 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.170
 the thing in it simply shot declared 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.199
 did you think about what you did in advance? 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.640
 Actually, you're already doing the move 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.990
 So make warm when I have the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.210
 has already done the same job 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.519
 worked there I have the game synonymous 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.480
 and worked great then you were 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.760
 nervous before the final 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.710
 yes in any case has a bit 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.389
 a little bit jitters do you do that 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.010
 rhine, the game is almost decided 

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:39.100
 two minutes before the end of the same because of 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.460
 pilot but all went well tactic you 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.089
 you said almost decided you have 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.129
 before x times leads in the series in 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.559
 game one thinks of that 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.019
 celebration to the ascent as any 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.429
 did not even plead so much 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.619
 adrenaline and absolutely wants the game 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.149
 win and give everything for that one 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.519
 the game now over time brings that 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.619
 2 1-guidance what we had there 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.540
 and there you do not think about the celebration or 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.180
 so that the ship then you think 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.770
 maybe after that I believe that 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.300
 It was a good game from us and you know 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.050
 how to Go From Here 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.360
 no idea now makes no first 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.780
 thoughts first enjoy the moment and 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.580
 celebrated thanks to fabian before such a 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.050
 important game how are you going in there 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.300
 things concentration ran 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.730
 I find that difficult because I have one 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.650
 such a great success in mind and 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.970
 but still has to go to the next game 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.330
 concentrate 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.160
 do you have any specific trick ? 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.170
 is lazy I have mine so mine 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.510
 runs from the plays also on the games 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.420
 that you get up some time and time 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.310
 always a lot of drink form games and 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.850
 I only know the game itself 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.370
 next shot 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.780
 that is the most important of the rhythm 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.090
 was very intense now 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.040
 that was practically every two three days 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.080
 a game how much does it take to the forces 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.830
 he is very exhausting but good 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.600
 made summer preparation and a two 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.080
 days off before we start again 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.750
 for next week back with the magix 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.730
 has fun and david play that too 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.830
 whole rather that would be a horny 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.500
 rhythm get the game today 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.850
 TÃ¶lzer seem from my eyes as one 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.220
 bit too desperate to be 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.540
 do you get that as a story with me? 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.640
 as I said they could only me on the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.650
 next shot and yes the mouse over before 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.760
 I worked for a newspaper today 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.500
 I would say a bit unhappy 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.660
 because we just knew that again 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.860
 is play and then it has again 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.780
 That's why the third works 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.100
 the fourth my series but as I said 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.650
 the result counts , one is won 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.200
 have an up and round with him 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.360
 if the cards have reshuffled the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.890
 better goalkeeper the series with 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.950
 decided or decided 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.810
 I'll tell him because we know 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.760
 actually mostly only the feather of 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.530
 tell the foremost ones with that 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.640
 Outstanding situation you decide again 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.100
 You saw that again today 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.660
 a pc again you just had 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.700
 only he who makes the fewest errors of 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.200
 win the series and play it was that 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.890
 luckily this time will not be like 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.980
 last year 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.670
 that we play here in 75 minutes 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.370
 actually back home 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.810
 can drive it totally analyzed 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.880
 dry so factually after the game now 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.640
 he is still celebrating 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.010
 it's probably going to happen anyway 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.300
 but two beers drink if they too 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.820
 We are already looking forward to it on the lawn 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.170
 in the cabin martha i would say is 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.970
 Everyone is hungry and wants everyone's blood 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.880
 licked now it goes back to zero 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.770
 as we said we want to attack fully 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.770
 I'm really looking forward to thank
