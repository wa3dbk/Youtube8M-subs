Star Wars Kinect to be exact now this
game<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.530> an<00:00:28.770> odd<00:00:28.950> duck<00:00:29.220> because<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:29.820> seen<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
game is an odd duck because it's seen a

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.680 
game is an odd duck because it's seen a
lot<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.170> hate<00:00:31.350> and<00:00:31.700> now<00:00:32.700> some<00:00:32.970> of<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.210> might<00:00:33.660> be

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
lot of hate and now some of it might be

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.660 
lot of hate and now some of it might be
justified<00:00:34.260> some<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.800> might<00:00:34.949> not<00:00:35.129> let's

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
justified some of it might not let's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.350 
justified some of it might not let's
take<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.850> look<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.300> think<00:00:36.930> most<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.470> us<00:00:38.059> have<00:00:39.059> seen

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
take a look I think most of us have seen

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
take a look I think most of us have seen
some<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.780> previews<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.409> thing<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
some of the previews for this thing and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.380 
some of the previews for this thing and
I<00:00:41.220> think<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.519> lot<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> hate<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.059> we've

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I think a lot of the hate that we've

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.320 
I think a lot of the hate that we've
seen<00:00:42.720> is<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.409> of<00:00:43.820> actually<00:00:44.820> jealousy

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
seen is because of actually jealousy

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.729 
seen is because of actually jealousy
because<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.780> coming<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.080> connect<00:00:46.409> instead

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
because it's coming to connect instead

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
because it's coming to connect instead
of<00:00:46.830> say<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> PlayStation<00:00:47.729> Move<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.479> take

you in the direction to go you kind of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.950 
you in the direction to go you kind of
face<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.880> direction<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.270> want<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.480> go<00:01:56.540> and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
face the direction you want to go and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.990 
face the direction you want to go and
your<00:01:57.710> character<00:01:58.100> will<00:01:58.250> kind<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.520> go<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.820> way

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
your character will kind of go that way

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.940 
your character will kind of go that way
and<00:01:59.180> swing<00:01:59.510> that<00:01:59.660> we<00:01:59.840> swing<00:02:00.230> and<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.500> can<00:02:00.680> kind

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
and swing that we swing and you can kind

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.800 
and swing that we swing and you can kind
of<00:02:01.040> force<00:02:01.730> run<00:02:02.000> up<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.330> them<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.540> things<00:02:02.690> like

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
of force run up to them and things like

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.690 
of force run up to them and things like
that<00:02:02.870> so<00:02:03.080> it's<00:02:03.380> not<00:02:03.470> exactly<00:02:03.650> on<00:02:04.190> Rails<00:02:04.460> as

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
that so it's not exactly on Rails as

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.270 
that so it's not exactly on Rails as
