kind of natural okay recently I heard an
interesting<00:00:45.660> stat<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.280> car<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:48.360> one

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
interesting stat that the car in one

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.779 
interesting stat that the car in one
year<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.500> leave<00:00:49.649> less<00:00:49.950> carbon<00:00:50.399> emissions

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
year can we leave less carbon emissions

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.060 
year can we leave less carbon emissions
than<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.030> cow<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> same<00:00:51.809> year<00:00:51.920> how<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
than a cow in the same year how do you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.430 
than a cow in the same year how do you
get<00:00:53.399> such<00:00:53.699> little<00:00:54.000> missions<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> vehicle

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
get such little missions for the vehicle

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.770 
get such little missions for the vehicle
well<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.280> 84<00:00:56.760> miles<00:00:56.969> per<00:00:57.210> gallon<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.690> know

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
well it's 84 miles per gallon you know

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.720 
well it's 84 miles per gallon you know
when<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> burn<00:00:58.649> less<00:00:58.890> fuel<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.370> easier<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
when you burn less fuel it's easier to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.569 
when you burn less fuel it's easier to
produce<00:00:59.879> less<00:01:00.539> emissions<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.350> yeah<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:01.920> 20,000

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
produce less emissions so yeah at 20,000

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.390 
produce less emissions so yeah at 20,000
miles<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.600> produce<00:01:03.780> less<00:01:04.309> emissions<00:01:05.309> than

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
miles we we produce less emissions than

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.350 
miles we we produce less emissions than
a<00:01:05.519> cow<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.939> year<00:01:06.890> yeah<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.490> it'd<00:01:09.119> be

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
a cow for a year yeah and so it'd be

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.100 
a cow for a year yeah and so it'd be

and you know as compelling as it is on a
product<00:01:37.710> level<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.610> project<00:01:39.090> level

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
product level I think the project level

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.140 
product level I think the project level
is<00:01:39.600> more<00:01:40.140> exciting<00:01:40.619> after<00:01:41.520> five<00:01:41.820> years<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
is more exciting after five years of

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.300 
is more exciting after five years of
sales<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.079> reduce<00:01:43.200> total<00:01:43.649> u.s.<00:01:44.100> gas

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
sales we can reduce total u.s. gas

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.590 
sales we can reduce total u.s. gas
consumption<00:01:44.820> by<00:01:45.090> 0<00:01:45.119> point<00:01:45.390> three<00:01:45.570> five

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
consumption by 0 point three five

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080 
consumption by 0 point three five
percent<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.100> make<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> meaningful

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
percent so we can make a meaningful

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.999 
percent so we can make a meaningful
shift<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.689> our<00:01:48.780> carbon<00:01:49.170> footprint<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.890> our

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
shift in our carbon footprint and our

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.590 
shift in our carbon footprint and our
reliance<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.520> foreign<00:01:50.579> oil<00:01:50.880> all<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> same

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
reliance on foreign oil all at the same

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.880 
reliance on foreign oil all at the same
time<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.979> car<00:01:56.250> another<00:01:57.090> big<00:01:57.890> deal

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
time and so the car another big deal

to<00:03:48.359> do<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.630> sure<00:03:49.049> first<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.680> all<00:03:49.799> it's<00:03:50.160> not

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
to do that sure first of all it's not

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.640 
to do that sure first of all it's not
small<00:03:50.819> we<00:03:51.060> have<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.209> longer<00:03:51.599> wheelbase<00:03:52.290> to

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
small we have a longer wheelbase to

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.680 
small we have a longer wheelbase to
honda<00:03:52.980> accord<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.549> its<00:03:53.669> full<00:03:53.940> length<00:03:53.970> it's

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
honda accord so its full length it's

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.280 
honda accord so its full length it's
just<00:03:54.870> half<00:03:55.109> width<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.599> are<00:03:57.780> engineering

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
just half width and we are engineering

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.589 
just half width and we are engineering
it<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.859> those<00:03:59.069> standards<00:03:59.790> MIT's<00:04:00.239> has<00:04:00.419> not

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
it to those standards MIT's has not

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.839 
it to those standards MIT's has not
agreed<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.930> test<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.379> yet<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.310> don't<00:04:02.669> know

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
agreed to test this yet so I don't know

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.460 
agreed to test this yet so I don't know
that<00:04:03.000> will<00:04:03.150> officially<00:04:03.750> get<00:04:03.870> tested<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.319> those

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
that will officially get tested to those

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.349 
that will officially get tested to those
standards<00:04:04.680> but<00:04:05.370> we're<00:04:05.519> designing<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:06.180> them

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
standards but we're designing to them

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.360 
standards but we're designing to them
and<00:04:06.629> if<00:04:07.169> you<00:04:07.290> notice<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:07.739> got<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:07.889> very<00:04:08.069> long

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
and if you notice it's got a very long

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.300 
and if you notice it's got a very long
nose<00:04:08.699> so<00:04:09.090> we<00:04:09.209> have<00:04:09.329> a<00:04:09.359> lot<00:04:09.569> of<00:04:09.599> crush<00:04:09.989> zone<00:04:10.310> and

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
nose so we have a lot of crush zone and

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.610 
nose so we have a lot of crush zone and
that's<00:04:11.519> really<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.940> secret<00:04:12.120> right<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:13.470> go

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that's really the secret right you go

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.009 
that's really the secret right you go
from<00:04:13.829> 35<00:04:14.250> miles<00:04:14.519> an<00:04:14.639> hour<00:04:14.730> 20<00:04:15.209> every<00:04:15.540> day<00:04:15.720> it's

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
from 35 miles an hour 20 every day it's

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.659 
from 35 miles an hour 20 every day it's
just<00:04:16.440> how<00:04:16.709> long<00:04:16.919> does<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.099> take<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.489> do

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
just how long does it take you to do

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.020 
just how long does it take you to do
that<00:04:17.849> right<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:19.380> so<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:20.190> longer<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.820> have

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
that right and so the longer you have

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.490 
that right and so the longer you have
the<00:04:21.269> space<00:04:22.019> between<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.890> impact

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
the space between you and the impact

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.990 
the space between you and the impact
more<00:04:23.710> time<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.070> have<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.250> slow<00:04:24.490> that<00:04:24.640> impact

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
more time you have to slow that impact

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.110 
more time you have to slow that impact
down<00:04:26.010> weeks<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:29.830> car<00:04:30.250> with<00:04:30.640> it<00:04:30.820> being

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
down weeks and this car with it being

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.680 
down weeks and this car with it being
economical<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.730> being<00:04:33.730> a<00:04:33.850> lower<00:04:34.030> priced<00:04:34.390> car

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
economical and being a lower priced car

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.720 
economical and being a lower priced car
it<00:04:34.780> kind<00:04:34.990> of<00:04:35.050> reminds<00:04:35.380> me<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.860> original

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
it kind of reminds me of the original

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.960 
it kind of reminds me of the original
books<00:04:36.940> wagon<00:04:37.300> bugger<00:04:37.990> type<00:04:38.380> one<00:04:38.620> was<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:39.790> at

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
books wagon bugger type one was that at

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.270 
books wagon bugger type one was that at
all<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.120> model<00:04:40.600> for<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.960> car<00:04:41.820> in<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:42.970> way<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:44.280> this

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
all a model for the car in a way so this

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.100 
all a model for the car in a way so this
projects<00:04:45.940> been<00:04:46.000> all<00:04:46.270> about<00:04:46.420> the<00:04:46.810> value

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
projects been all about the value

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.320 
projects been all about the value
proposition<00:04:47.260> it<00:04:47.950> people<00:04:48.760> seem<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:48.970> like<00:04:49.150> the

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
proposition it people seem to like the

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.680 
proposition it people seem to like the
styling<00:04:49.570> we're<00:04:50.170> it's<00:04:50.380> accidentally<00:04:51.040> cool<00:04:51.690> but

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
styling we're it's accidentally cool but

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.380 
styling we're it's accidentally cool but
that<00:04:52.840> was<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:54.130> wasn't<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.580> thrust<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.090> just

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
that was that wasn't the thrust and just

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.790 
that was that wasn't the thrust and just
like<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:55.660> original<00:04:55.750> bug<00:04:56.140> if<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.470> had<00:04:56.590> never

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
like the original bug if you had never

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.100 
like the original bug if you had never
seen<00:04:57.220> one<00:04:57.460> that's<00:04:57.880> an<00:04:58.030> ugly<00:04:58.180> car<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.990> know

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
seen one that's an ugly car you know

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.240 
seen one that's an ugly car you know
people<00:04:59.380> have<00:04:59.440> had<00:04:59.620> an<00:04:59.740> emotional<00:04:59.950> experience

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
people have had an emotional experience

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.010 
people have had an emotional experience
with<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:00.910> product<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.419> then<00:05:01.480> decided<00:05:01.930> they

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
with the product and then decided they

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.480 
with the product and then decided they
liked<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.320> styling<00:05:02.770> but<00:05:03.130> that's<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.340> way<00:05:03.460> it

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
liked the styling but that's the way it

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.310 
liked the styling but that's the way it
happened<00:05:03.850> not<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.030> other<00:05:04.150> way<00:05:04.270> around<00:05:04.320> right

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
happened not the other way around right

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.500 
happened not the other way around right
if<00:05:05.800> you<00:05:05.950> have<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.220> right<00:05:06.370> value<00:05:06.790> proposition

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
if you have the right value proposition

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.780 
if you have the right value proposition
you<00:05:07.660> can<00:05:07.840> really<00:05:08.260> make<00:05:08.530> an<00:05:08.680> impact<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.250> and<00:05:09.669> so

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
you can really make an impact and and so

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.940 
you can really make an impact and and so
it's<00:05:09.940> all<00:05:10.090> about<00:05:10.120> 84<00:05:10.750> miles<00:05:10.900> per<00:05:11.140> gallon<00:05:11.350> safe

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
it's all about 84 miles per gallon safe

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.530 
it's all about 84 miles per gallon safe
six<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.550> eight<00:05:12.640> hundred<00:05:12.669> dollars<00:05:12.910> made<00:05:13.450> in
