one of their first important lessons how

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.310 
one of their first important lessons how
to<00:01:39.620> communicate<00:01:40.460> with<00:01:40.850> other<00:01:41.150> wolves<00:01:41.540> these

to communicate with other wolves these

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.660 
to communicate with other wolves these
guys<00:01:42.500> have<00:01:42.650> just<00:01:42.680> started<00:01:42.980> to<00:01:43.100> show<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.460> first

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
guys have just started to show the first

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.940 
guys have just started to show the first
signs<00:01:43.970> of<00:01:44.120> air<00:01:44.300> movement<00:01:44.600> twitching<00:01:45.320> which<00:01:45.800> is

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
signs of air movement twitching which is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.440 
signs of air movement twitching which is
indicate<00:01:46.370> them<00:01:46.490> they<00:01:46.610> can<00:01:46.760> actually<00:01:46.910> hear<00:01:47.240> us

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
indicate them they can actually hear us

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.720 
indicate them they can actually hear us
and<00:01:47.600> our<00:01:47.720> voices<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.860> this<00:01:49.010> is<00:01:49.130> an<00:01:49.250> ideal<00:01:49.640> time

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730

now<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.210> start<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.660> begin<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:51.020> teach<00:01:51.170> them

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
now to start to begin to teach them
