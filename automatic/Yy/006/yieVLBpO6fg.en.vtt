00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello to today's video I want you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.279
 show those gifts that gave us 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.519
 on the first 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.580
 business club or is it faberlic which 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.030
 held in Moscow from February 9 to February 12 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.640
 I was there as a winner 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
 Contest I'm already the second time from faberlic 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.900
 I win the competition the first competition I 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.859
 ranked first it was a competition 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.480
 videos and where I showed 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.289
 experiments with three products this with 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.050
 an oxygen balsam with 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.730
 bathtubs and for cleaning toilet bowls and one of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.280
 videos will take first place 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.870
 and this time I also applied and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 did not apply at all 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.960
 counted on how to win it was straight 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.670
 a matter of five minutes I saw the information in 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 news about the competition 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.309
 business faberlic to the internet and decided 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.210
 why not participate straight for 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.100
 10 minutes was a letter to sent 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.109
 and everything and even did not count at all 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.359
 expected and not like to win here and so 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.380
 just so it happened and when we 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.780
 I was at this club to us all the participants 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.799
 This club made gifts here by 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.540
 such a package is completely filled with them 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.520
 products faberlik novelties kobernik 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.470
 I will tell you about them in brief 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.630
 because I only used 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.570
 one time it's today that's completely 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.970
 today my makeup do help those 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.610
 products that were given to me by me 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.259
 I ’ll tell you a little about them now 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.020
 Of course I understand that the first time 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.430
 impossible to understand because some 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 Products need some time 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.070
 test watch experiment 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.700
 play with them and I understand that my 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.850
 opinion now given slowly 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 will be more than subjective and because 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.009
 I didn't even test them 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.090
 experimented and in different conditions 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.250
 and they did not try their new first 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.640
 I will share my impressions 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.970
 gave us donated circus highlighter from 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.060
 new ruby airstream bibi cream too 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:11.019
 from this line, then from dekorativka us 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:15.220
 donated liquid from the series 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:20.560
 skyline mother of pearl lipstick by the way 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.959
 which reminds gel lipstick powder 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.450
 the mascara was voluminous the same from the new 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.269
 ruler but it so happened that I arrived 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.480
 and no customer called and wanted this mascara 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.849
 and I did not order a new dala and 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.530
 my gift let's say so although I don’t 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.450
 was counting on some of the gifts and 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.079
 I decided to give my own best if something 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.620
 gave 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.959
 I used to think so and used to do that before 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.730
 if I do something somehow so on 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.480
 freebie got it would give some 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.850
 gifts with faberlik for some shares then 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.459
 I tried to sell them to me 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.239
 learn before the money sale 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.480
 but I thought I got it just 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.690
 so I didn't pay for it and 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.430
 need to be pampered not necessarily it 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.950
 distribute but certainly not in those cases 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.880
 when if we didn't allow 150 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.799
 then underwater then 150 bb creams then 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.540
 would make sense to sell them yet what do we 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.790
 gave it a new toilet water 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.549
 which will appear only the fifth 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.299
 catalog and still not even the fourth 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.819
 catalog 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:28.150
 Ethan Arinochka will about her, too, it seems 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.160
 I'll tell you a little bit so let's get down to 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.709
 perhaps I will begin with those products 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.349
 which I liked the most from 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.310
 of which I got straight like that 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.910
 impression ah which led me to 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.329
 delight 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.020
 this is a serum highlighter I want to point out 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.550
 that in the entire airstream collection 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.710
 used innovative technology but 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.480
 it is in principle always the case when we have 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.110
 there is some new leaving 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.560
 ruler per face then it laid like 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.800
 rule and innovative technology 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.530
 which 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.840
 prevail which appeared on this 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.990
 The moment the phenomenon of this product is always 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.700
 so it took where it was alpha lipoic 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.140
 acid used 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.989
 this and garderica for example houses stem 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.489
 hole cells were used and also in 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.549
 respect this one in the whole line 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.410
 airstream can say that like here 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.150
 wrote the manufacturer it combines in 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.040
 yourself a unique oxygen formula 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.040
 complex on you for which we have 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.230
 in the entire cosmetics makeup faberlik from 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.430
 patented faberlic lab 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.470
 microcapsules 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.120
 the tunnel stops strengthens 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.280
 skin functionality that was laid 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.260
 nature from birth and lost to 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.780
 time negatively affected 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.419
 environment and critters on it so 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.790
 called antioxidant cell protection and 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.840
 penetrating deep skin layers 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.300
 restore strengthens or protective 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.800
 function has a long 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.240
 antioxidant effects and how 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.979
 it is customary to use this 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.870
 Serum both written here before 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.050
 recommended need on 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.100
 pre-cleansed skin 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.360
 apply a thin layer 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.979
 and products can be used 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.870
 independently can be combined with 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.710
 other means of the line of oxygen 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.360
 the shine that I read here from me 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.870
 known and readable 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.710
 useful ingredients ingredients 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:23.919
 lecithin targaryen vitamin e oil 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.390
 macadamia maybe here I still have 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.030
 I do not doubt any useful 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.360
 caring components but how not 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.009
 beautician I can not and 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.900
 read give you written here 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.810
 Latin need to be translated in order 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.530
 to understand what u is in this 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.870
 serum 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.099
 my first impression enjoyed 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.280
 today only one time for her first 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.740
 I liked the very smell it for 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.280
 Some seem obsessive because 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.639
 that he is not so difficult 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.889
 perfume but rather so concentrated 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:01.520
 saturated but I really liked not 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.939
 something like the smell of anyone to us 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.310
 It was 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:08.180
 and not to premium if we look at 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:13.219
 clearance in the sun before the serum 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.409
 the pearl base is even black 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.050
 a little bit pinkish you will find 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:20.389
 such here are finely ground as 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.120
 pearl particles but not so much 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.560
 there are pretty little pieces 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.770
 there is a big one because when i 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.259
 put it on her face then I noticed that 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.349
 the skin is not only shining sparkles but also 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.229
 there are some bigger ones 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:37.580
 blotches to glitter visible on face 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:40.370
 who does not like it you can directly 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.099
 brush away something not so much 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.240
 there is a foundation after all is exactly 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:47.690
 pearl of this serum due to 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.060
 which is what creates the glow of the face afterwards 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:53.810
 this serum I applied bibi cream i 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:56.930
 I realized that this is serum highlighter 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.210
 she is not worthy to be on top of her 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.250
 something to put though when we were on 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.879
 this business club 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.569
 We or nakeda not on she advised 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.569
 to put
