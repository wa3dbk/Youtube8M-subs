00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.660
 action of mine and it will explain to me that I am going to 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.730
 try to explain it today all the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.700
 whole set is even though then 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.710
 at the end the video was put there we had 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.160
 we had put our cheese in the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.920
 on paper I'm going to turn around since 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.710
 what we did and here is the wet but 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:40.159
 do that every four days had to go 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.920
 because the days when every day 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:45.710
 daily for four days until it 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.210
 yellow turn has not yet changed from 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.769
 true color and it's because the first day 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.650
 then every four days whole 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.990
 we're going to pray it first whole 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.210
 and every day we are giving him the 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.160
 back to the face so that in the part of 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.140
 down wet that now part down the 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.860
 dish is put up and down the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.580
 dry will turn the four days yellow 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.450
 it will turn yellow well then once 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.460
 we have created it for four days 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.850
 whole we put a knife and we do it 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.700
 fourth more or less then it is a kitchen 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.710
 something bigger this is not a piece of 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.869
 melon that cut we take a knife what 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.330
 we will make room, we separate them and what 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.850
 let the rooms open and 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.900
 cut without covering the panistas boat of 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.119
 paper another three days for the reason 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.160
 to be prayed for this face and for this face 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.220
 it's talking four days together 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.650
 full whole then cut into quarters 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.760
 another three days so that on both 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.920
 faces of the rooms that we are going to cut 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.350
 we are then once we have it 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.030
 three days for him to do a 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:02.620
 hole here in this part the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.560
 quarters and once the flames had 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.580
 another three days now chanting cut 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.300
 in quarters we are going to do it in oil 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.790
 olive the container does not matter and you can 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.520
 Be of glass can be made of plastic 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.370
 can make mud does not matter the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.410
 vessel where the six calls them in 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.090
 oil and minimum clear we have to 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.500
 wait for the olive oil that covers it 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.710
 completely all this is done to 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.990
 room temperature and in no time 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.360
 we're going to be within referring the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.520
 refrigerator or refrigerator in 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.709
 no time even when what 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.940
 let's preserve at temperature 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.980
 ambient 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.360
 cover that covers all rooms of the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.060
 we cover it with oil and 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.000
 logically we will have to wait for others 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.430
 seven or eight days in a hurry the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.710
 process can last a month depends on what 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.350
 that you hurry a month thirty 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.210
 forty days because you have to let 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.330
 the cheese I then took something in oil 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.640
 it really depends the haste that you have this 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.780
 so it would be kept throughout the year 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.780
 without any problem 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.440
 that yes from that it takes already a pair 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.160
 of months approaching our tables 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.490
 begins to sting and begins to sting like 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.720
 we were with sabinillas 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.100
 so if we like the spicy it 's 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.590
 advisable that the moment you take 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.500
 the quarters of the cheese been in the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.380
 oil one week eight days out there 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.680
 start spending what I agree more 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.490
 rancid is getting and going 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.010
 something orange for some 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.560
 parts and starts to bite there are many 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.660
 biting things he loves but 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.570
 that it stings that stop it for the table 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.370
 then turn around today and we're going to 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.740
 leave until tomorrow we will be going back 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.490
 again to turn around and so on 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.350
 four whole days and then cut it already 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.230
 I'm going to put the whole process in 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.910
 the whole blog how it's done and then 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.410
 already when we finish letting circulate 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.410
 I'm going to show the video
