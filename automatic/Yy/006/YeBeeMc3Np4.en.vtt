00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.050
 tutorial for microsoft 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.810
 that's minecraft here his comrade on 10 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.460
 Ama is not going to teach you how to get dizzy 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.559
 two animals the xbox master so is 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.949
 As you hear, we are going to fight two animals 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.290
 First of all, we take up little maderita 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.489
 to make a room we use wool 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.260
 red to give a little white wool 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.500
 valerie always making an ax 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.310
 in case we shit our obvious bed 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.620
 because where they will be their stuff 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:00.100
 the setting so there is a bit of 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.100
 privacy we started being a 4 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.960
 and there is a little space for it to 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.960
 move 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.009
 good seems because we're going 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.330
 and beautiful 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.490
 remember that here we are going to have our 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.770
 animals and that if we want to have a 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.680
 good breeding then 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.410
 it will have to be done 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.570
 a good room as the animals say 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.800
 they do not take where they do not like 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.800
 the disappointment of dogs 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.820
 I put some ladybug 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.760
 It does not matter that 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.410
 I was a little distant from the room 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.800
 it's better that you do not want to escape the 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.800
 female 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.939
 Y 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.360
 and we are already finishing our ace and 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.390
 fourth should not be illuminated then 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.330
 obviously we would not need a bit of 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.300
 style the half-half bed has 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.230
 to be clear the bed to half and 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.230
 we put our door 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.599
 so that good red wool grana 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.730
 red to make some style of 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.120
 colour 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.760
 to give it a little style 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.920
 h 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.460
 to make you feel at home 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.540
 and with desire and animated 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.540
 ten days 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.950
 they have to put the heart because if not 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.180
 It does not work if you do not give them to understand that 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.180
 they have to give 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:23.140
 we have a little bit of 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:26.530
 as I'm going to stop the two sheep I have 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.010
 to put white wool because I want 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.819

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.819

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.980

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:45.609

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.659
 I continue with the animals to see 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.659
 How does this work 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.290

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.790

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.739

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.640
 from behind because if not then we are 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.840
