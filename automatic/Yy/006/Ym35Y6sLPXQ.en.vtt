 precursor in the matter the Iberian puts in 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.660
 implement a protection policy for 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.750
 the global environment active and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.830
 innovative ways of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.719
 ecological production 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 the use of recyclable materials 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 and measures to reduce the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.029
 energy consumption is at 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 foreground of concerns 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.820
 the business the use of fluids 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 refrigerants r 600 ha where air 290 without 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.070
 hfc fits in this perspective 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.070
 environmental 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.290
 intervention on a circuit 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.410
 refrigerating is a matter of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.000
 professional 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.370
 it is imperative to respect the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.680
 unwinding and procedure 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.379
 starting with the perforation of the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.530
 dehydrator and draining the circuit 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.340
 by this point if the compressor is in 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.010
 operating state 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.020
 the technician can make it work 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.020
 to accelerate the evacuation of the fluid 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.690
 the tube must be perfectly clean 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.910
 for this to clean it with the help of a 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.910
 Abrasive cloth by a rotary movement 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.670
 make sure the cup is clean and 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.670
 without burr 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.300
 the intervention on the circuit is 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.300
 achieved at room temperature 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.920
 be careful in the case of a freezer 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.490
 whose evaporator would be at temperature 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.040
 negative 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.410
 you must either wait temperatures will 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.930
 go back to a positive level or purged 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:12.700
 the evaporator at the front zot 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:15.400
 the intervention on the circuit it is 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.400
 important to respect the time of 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.830
 drying the locke glue ready in the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.990
 frame of the position of the fittings look 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.210
 rinne for copper 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.480
 let it dry for four minutes at 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:32.640
 an ambient temperature of +18 for the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.000
 to do eight minutes and for aluminum 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.000
 18 minutes 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.510
 as every opening of a circuit 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.070
 refrigerating it is necessary to 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.070
 replace the dehydrator 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.500
 to avoid clogging the end of the 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.290
 capillary 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:13.120
 care must be taken to do exceed the 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:15.100
 fitting then apply some 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.870
 drops of the ocs prep and turn their 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.870
 agree to spread the glue 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.129
 the circuit is now assembled 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.900
 let's go to the usual steps of the 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.060
 charge 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.050
 first of all the connection of the circuit to 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.050
 the charging station 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:04.399
 let's connect the bottle of 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:06.699
 fluid air r600 290 to the station 

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:06.699
 charge 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.319
 nature 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.360
 and the amount of fluid are indicated 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:20.270
 on the nameplate of the device 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:22.629
 in this case 45 g made the draw 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.629
 empty 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.069
 proceed now to charge in 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.379
 respecting the quantity of 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:34.069
 prescribed fluid using a scale 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.069
 electronic 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:44.580
 the device was put into operation during 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:48.919
 the fluid loading not that's where 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.919
 of loads with the closing pliers 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.169
 withdraw their fast and firm agreement is 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:59.119
 Hermetically the tail of Charles with 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.119
 a niche lot plug 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.280
 the intervention process concerns the 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.500
 simple refrigerant circuit consisting of a 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:29.979
 compressor condenser dehydrator 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:34.110
 capillaries and evaporator excluding 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.110
 solenoid valve circuits 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:52.009
 at the end of the intervention think about 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:56.029
 check the connections with a detector 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.490
 of gas leakage of course make sure 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:59.749
 to intervene in a local anti and 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.719
 Observe safety instructions 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:07.029
 usual adapted to an intervention 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:07.029
 on a circuit and horrific
