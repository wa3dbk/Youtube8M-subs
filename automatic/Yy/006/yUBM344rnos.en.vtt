00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.127
I want to make a furnace
vent cover, like this one

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:05.087
out of this
piece of wood

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:08.799
by cutting a series of slots
in it, like this slot here.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.510
But, before I'm
gonna cut the slot,

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.887
I'm gonna drill
a hole across

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:14.764
and that way I won't
get tear-out.

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:18.267
And that hole is for a dowel
to go across all these pieces

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.686
here to tie them together
and reinforce it.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.189
I'll clamp it to this piece of
firewood to help me hold it

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.281
vertically on the
drill press.

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.180
Well, my drill wasn't
actually long enough

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:58.391
to drill all the
way through

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.768
so, what I did then is
I used this drill to

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.312
drill a pilot hole all the
way out the other end.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.356
And then came in,
using that pilot hole

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:07.316
from the far end.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.819
And that way I was able
to line up these holes

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.362
to go perfectly
through.

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:15.324
I've laid out the slots on here
to correspond with this one.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.119
And most people would cut
these out with a router bit

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.955
like that, but that's
really slow going.

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:22.415
Especially with
really hard wood.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.667
So, I'm gonna cut these
on my table saw.

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.669
My homemade table
saw is not as good

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.588
as one you would
buy in the store,

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:31.800
but it is very good at
making plunge cuts.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.344
I got this clamped on
here as a front stop,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.388
and here's a
back stop,

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:40.600
so I can control how
long a cut I make here

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:44.220
to cut that slot and I'll use
a fence for the side guide.

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:39.909
Well, I goofed
up a bit.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.453
I had the fence set in the
wrong position for this slot

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:44.705
initially, so
I re-cut it

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.590
and I think I'll glue a piece
in there to fix it afterwards.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:20.825
Well, if I'd matched
the color a bit better

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.518
no one would
know at all.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.498
Now I need to cut
rabbets all around here

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.474
so they'll fit
into the hole,

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.392
more like the
old one does.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.624
Fits. To avoid
stubbing my toes

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:54.482
on these square edges, I
figure I should bevel them.

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:56.546
Except this saw doesn't tilt.

00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:58.805
But, solution for that,
