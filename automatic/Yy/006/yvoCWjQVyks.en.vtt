much as sailor one

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.839 
much as sailor one
but<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:26.129> didn't<00:02:26.340> work<00:02:26.459> out<00:02:26.609> how<00:02:26.819> I

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
but this one didn't work out how I

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.390 
but this one didn't work out how I
really<00:02:27.390> wanted<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:27.900> do<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.439> really<00:02:28.950> want<00:02:29.159> it<00:02:29.249> to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.729 
so I decided to cut the lace if you guys
hear<00:02:33.299> some<00:02:33.569> moaning<00:02:33.810> or<00:02:34.200> noise<00:02:34.439> in<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
hear some moaning or noise in the

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.140 
hear some moaning or noise in the
background<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.310> my<00:02:35.489> daughter<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.939> she's
