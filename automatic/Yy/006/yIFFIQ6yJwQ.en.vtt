00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
really really nice there is a difference

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.969 
really really nice there is a difference
between<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.540> fluted<00:01:36.960> barrel<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.830> one

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
between this fluted barrel and the one

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.590 
between this fluted barrel and the one
you<00:01:38.100> see<00:01:38.280> let's<00:01:38.490> say<00:01:38.670> from<00:01:38.909> from<00:01:39.240> basement

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you see let's say from from basement

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.929 
you see let's say from from basement
arms<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.310> threaded

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
arms is that it this is not a threaded

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.390 
arms is that it this is not a threaded
fluted<00:01:42.360> barrel<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.320> sits<00:01:43.590> usually<00:01:44.040> flush

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
fluted barrel so this sits usually flush

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.880 
fluted barrel so this sits usually flush
with<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:44.820> slide<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.869> has<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.260> 40<00:01:46.680> Smith

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
with your slide and it has the 40 Smith

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.000 
with your slide and it has the 40 Smith
&amp;<00:01:46.950> Wesson<00:01:47.369> low<00:01:47.520> markings<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> top<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
&amp; Wesson low markings on the top and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.160 
&amp; Wesson low markings on the top and
also<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.130> salient<00:01:50.640> logo<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> side

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
also the salient logo here on the side

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.520 
also the salient logo here on the side
so<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> great<00:01:53.340> quality<00:01:53.930> build<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.229> color

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
