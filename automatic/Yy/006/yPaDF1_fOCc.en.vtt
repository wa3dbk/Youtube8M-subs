00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
scootering of course I want to have

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.760 
scootering of course I want to have
square<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.630> my<00:03:33.750> first<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.230> as<00:03:34.500> much<00:03:34.740> as

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
square in my first and as much as

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.920 
square in my first and as much as
possible<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.490> draw<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.240> it<00:03:36.390> as<00:03:36.540> fast<00:03:36.780> as

cool<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:01.440> pulled<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.280> up<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.580> got<00:04:02.970> reactivated

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
cool I pulled it up I got reactivated

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.150 
cool I pulled it up I got reactivated
four<00:04:03.840> times<00:04:04.080> during<00:04:04.290> tournament<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:04.920> every

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
four times during tournament and every

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.120 
four times during tournament and every
time<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.340> got<00:04:06.330> your<00:04:06.450> activated<00:04:06.900> was<00:04:07.020> game<00:04:07.350> which

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
time I got your activated was game which

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.560 
time I got your activated was game which
is<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.310> nice<00:04:08.610> record<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.209> think<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.830> yeah<00:04:11.570> just

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
is a nice record I think and yeah just

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.880 
is a nice record I think and yeah just
in<00:04:12.720> general<00:04:12.900> false<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:15.230> pretty<00:04:16.230> situational

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
in general false is pretty situational

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.190 
in general false is pretty situational
but<00:04:17.310> if<00:04:17.520> you<00:04:17.730> activate<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.180> it's<00:04:18.570> mostly<00:04:18.959> game

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
but if you activate it it's mostly game

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.430 
but if you activate it it's mostly game
because<00:04:19.500> kills<00:04:19.890> I<00:04:20.250> know<00:04:20.730> maybe<00:04:21.720> three<00:04:22.049> or<00:04:22.080> four

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
because kills I know maybe three or four

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.350 
because kills I know maybe three or four
cards<00:04:22.770> your<00:04:22.890> opponent<00:04:22.919> controls<00:04:23.310> if<00:04:24.090> you're

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
cards your opponent controls if you're

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.129 
cards your opponent controls if you're
if<00:04:24.720> you're<00:04:24.900> really<00:04:25.110> lucky<00:04:25.320> just<00:04:25.800> kills<00:04:26.010> 5<00:04:26.280> but

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
if you're really lucky just kills 5 but

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.809 
if you're really lucky just kills 5 but
you<00:04:27.379> need<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.560> perfect<00:04:27.979> field<00:04:28.189> set<00:04:28.430> up<00:04:28.460> for<00:04:28.699> that

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
you need a perfect field set up for that

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:33.129 
you need a perfect field set up for that
and<00:04:29.289> um<00:04:30.289> then<00:04:31.099> I<00:04:31.159> ran<00:04:31.400> gear<00:04:32.120> golem<00:04:32.509> and<00:04:32.659> double

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
and um then I ran gear golem and double

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.260 
and um then I ran gear golem and double
gear<00:04:33.289> town<00:04:33.530> which<00:04:34.280> came<00:04:34.550> in<00:04:34.669> nice<00:04:34.909> but

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
gear town which came in nice but

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.019 
gear town which came in nice but
sometimes<00:04:35.779> I<00:04:36.080> just<00:04:36.229> tend<00:04:36.949> to<00:04:37.159> draw<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.520> gear

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:38.029 
sometimes I just tend to draw the gear

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:39.670 
sometimes I just tend to draw the gear
golem<00:04:38.360> before<00:04:38.779> I<00:04:38.810> draw<00:04:38.960> one<00:04:39.110> of<00:04:39.199> my<00:04:39.289> gear<00:04:39.439> towns

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
golem before I draw one of my gear towns

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.589 
golem before I draw one of my gear towns
which<00:04:40.219> is<00:04:40.400> really<00:04:40.580> improvable<00:04:41.029> because<00:04:41.389> I<00:04:41.479> run

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
which is really improvable because I run

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.559 
which is really improvable because I run
twice<00:04:42.050> as<00:04:42.110> many<00:04:42.409> of<00:04:42.590> them<00:04:42.740> but<00:04:43.249> still<00:04:44.120> happens

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
twice as many of them but still happens

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.320 
twice as many of them but still happens
and<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.069> sucks<00:04:46.069> that's<00:04:46.849> why<00:04:46.969> I<00:04:47.029> thought

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
and that sucks that's why I thought

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.540 
and that sucks that's why I thought
about<00:04:47.449> maybe<00:04:47.930> enlarging<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.740> engine<00:04:49.069> running

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
about maybe enlarging the engine running

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.580 
about maybe enlarging the engine running
to<00:04:49.849> triple<00:04:50.389> gear<00:04:50.539> town<00:04:50.779> and<00:04:51.020> maybe<00:04:51.199> even<00:04:51.409> a

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
to triple gear town and maybe even a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.200 
to triple gear town and maybe even a
terraforming<00:04:52.400> because<00:04:52.669> terraforming

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
terraforming because terraforming

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.290 
terraforming because terraforming
searches<00:04:53.569> for<00:04:53.659> my<00:04:53.779> gates<00:04:53.990> as<00:04:54.199> well<00:04:54.490> um<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:56.150> to

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
searches for my gates as well um just to

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.959 
searches for my gates as well um just to
make<00:04:56.449> sure<00:04:56.479> I<00:04:57.020> have<00:04:57.289> two<00:04:57.499> gates<00:04:57.740> in<00:04:58.069> the<00:04:58.129> gear

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:58.969 
make sure I have two gates in the gear

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.330 
make sure I have two gates in the gear
town<00:04:59.180> before<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.020> draw<00:05:00.259> the<00:05:00.289> golem<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:00.889> because

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
town before I draw the golem and because

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.100 
town before I draw the golem and because

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:19.189 
provisions because this tax got a really

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:23.379 
provisions because this tax got a really
bad<00:05:19.460> time<00:05:19.879> time<00:05:20.629> out<00:05:21.550> gameplay<00:05:22.550> like<00:05:22.849> if<00:05:23.210> it

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
bad time time out gameplay like if it

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.779 
bad time time out gameplay like if it
goes<00:05:23.599> to<00:05:23.810> time<00:05:24.050> you<00:05:24.650> mostly<00:05:25.009> lose<00:05:25.279> and<00:05:26.050> um

goes to time you mostly lose and um

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.249 
goes to time you mostly lose and um
that's<00:05:28.789> why<00:05:29.060> if<00:05:29.389> you<00:05:29.539> see<00:05:29.779> the<00:05:29.900> clocks<00:05:30.139> running

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
that's why if you see the clocks running

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.050 
that's why if you see the clocks running
low<00:05:30.560> well<00:05:30.860> side<00:05:31.129> taking<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:31.610> might<00:05:31.819> want<00:05:32.000> to
