00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
the regular hyperdunks too because I

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.000 
the regular hyperdunks too because I
thought<00:03:12.780> originally<00:03:12.990> like<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.530> katies<00:03:13.830> were

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
thought originally like the katies were

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.030 
thought originally like the katies were
just<00:03:14.190> kind<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.520> like<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:16.040> different

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
just kind of like a like a different

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.199 
just kind of like a like a different

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.210 
version of a hyperdunk or something like
that<00:03:18.269> but<00:03:18.600> now<00:03:18.900> they've<00:03:19.560> really<00:03:19.860> taken<00:03:19.890> on

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
that but now they've really taken on

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.680 
that but now they've really taken on
their<00:03:20.340> own<00:03:20.550> obviously<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.239> don't<00:03:21.390> have<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> tell

can make a hundred dollars on so I mean
it's<00:04:03.840> it's<00:04:04.170> less<00:04:04.410> risk<00:04:04.830> for<00:04:05.670> reward<00:04:06.180> otherwise

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
it's it's less risk for reward otherwise

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.780

you could have taken that one hundred or

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.460 
you could have taken that one hundred or
two<00:04:08.910> hundred<00:04:08.940> dollars<00:04:09.360> from<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.930> LeBron<00:04:10.320> that

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
two hundred dollars from the LeBron that

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.410 
two hundred dollars from the LeBron that
you<00:04:10.530> spent<00:04:10.799> about<00:04:11.250> two<00:04:11.459> pairs<00:04:11.670> of<00:04:11.760> katie's<00:04:12.090> and

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
you spent about two pairs of katie's and

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.810 
you spent about two pairs of katie's and
flip<00:04:13.080> them<00:04:13.200> for<00:04:13.260> six<00:04:13.709> hundred<00:04:13.799> instead<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.459> 4

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
flip them for six hundred instead of 4

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.180 
flip them for six hundred instead of 4
300<00:04:15.269> so<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:16.260> take<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.709> same<00:04:16.890> amount<00:04:16.919> of

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
300 so you you take the same amount of

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.159 
300 so you you take the same amount of
money<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.459> double<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:17.790> profit<00:04:18.239> like<00:04:18.570> so

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169
