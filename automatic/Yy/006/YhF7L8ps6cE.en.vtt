against<00:02:19.920> michael<00:02:20.250> sprott<00:02:20.550> Sprott<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.390> way

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
against michael sprott Sprott is way

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.100 
against michael sprott Sprott is way
past<00:02:21.900> his<00:02:22.110> best<00:02:22.380> right<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.780> unlikely<00:02:24.780> that

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
past his best right now so unlikely that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.170 
past his best right now so unlikely that
sprout<00:02:25.440> will<00:02:25.560> be<00:02:25.650> able<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.099> much<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.940> he's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
sprout will be able to do much but he's

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.390 
sprout will be able to do much but he's
very<00:02:27.390> experienced<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:29.010> could<00:02:29.190> probably

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
very experienced and you could probably

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.190 
very experienced and you could probably
say<00:02:29.610> his<00:02:29.640> bed<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:30.209> it's<00:02:30.360> backed<00:02:30.540> off<00:02:30.750> so

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
say his bed and then it's backed off so

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.360 
say his bed and then it's backed off so
