which<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.520> fair<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> say<00:01:29.909> not<00:01:30.299> at

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
which I think it's fair to say not at

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.630 
which I think it's fair to say not at
all<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> game<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:31.920> expecting<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.430> see

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
all the game that I was expecting to see

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.149 
all the game that I was expecting to see
no<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> don't<00:01:33.299> think<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.110> had<00:01:34.259> any<00:01:34.470> concept<00:01:34.770> of

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
no I don't think I had any concept of

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.380 
no I don't think I had any concept of
what<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.700> able<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.060> accomplish

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
what they would be able to accomplish

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.819 
what they would be able to accomplish
with<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.689> game<00:01:36.990> obviously<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.530> original

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
with this game obviously the original

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.890 
with this game obviously the original
steel<00:01:38.040> battalion<00:01:38.340> had<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> absolutely

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
steel battalion had that absolutely

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.590 
steel battalion had that absolutely
massive<00:01:40.290> controller<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> when<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.509> think

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
massive controller so when you think

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.179 
massive controller so when you think
about<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:43.860> connect

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
about that you think about what connect

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.469 
about that you think about what connect
could<00:01:44.399> add<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.850> experience<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> just

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
could add to that experience you just

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.460 
could add to that experience you just
think<00:01:45.780> okay<00:01:45.869> they're<00:01:46.110> gonna<00:01:46.200> put<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
think okay they're gonna put the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
think okay they're gonna put the
controller<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:47.040> screen<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.850> touch

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
controller on screen you just touch

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.240 
controller on screen you just touch
buttons<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> foot<00:01:49.380> switches<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.860> stuff<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
buttons and foot switches and stuff it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.819 
buttons and foot switches and stuff it
is<00:01:50.759> nothing<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.290> were<00:01:52.619> just

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
is nothing like that and if I were just

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.679 
is nothing like that and if I were just
kind<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.189> boil<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.640> down<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.240> its<00:01:54.360> simplest

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
kind of boil this down to its simplest

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.459 
kind of boil this down to its simplest
terms<00:01:54.810> its<00:01:55.409> making<00:01:56.369> making<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.229> full

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
terms its making making a kind of full

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.209 
terms its making making a kind of full

to<00:02:15.570> pull<00:02:15.720> down<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> periscope<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:17.070> pull<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
to pull down a periscope you pull the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.670 
to pull down a periscope you pull the
stick<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.840> left<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.260> make<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> tank

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
stick on the left to make the tank

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.860 
stick on the left to make the tank
accelerate<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.400> pull<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.850> right<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.270> to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
accelerate you pull on the right one to

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.200 
accelerate you pull on the right one to
turn<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.640> close<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.030> blast

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
turn it on you can close the blast

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.610 
turn it on you can close the blast
shield<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.690> make<00:02:24.810> sure<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.110> missiles<00:02:25.440> don't

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
shield to make sure that missiles don't

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470 
shield to make sure that missiles don't
come<00:02:25.770> flying<00:02:26.010> into<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.220> cockpit<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.270> what's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
come flying into the cockpit but what's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.820 
come flying into the cockpit but what's
interesting<00:02:27.630> about<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.350> game<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.710> it

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
interesting about this game is that it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.350 
interesting about this game is that it
adds<00:02:29.070> like<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.460> weird<00:02:29.700> personal<00:02:30.180> element

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
adds like this weird personal element

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.490 
adds like this weird personal element
but<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.630> don't<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:30.990> any<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.200> us<00:02:31.320> were

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
but I don't think any of us were

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.710 
but I don't think any of us were
expecting<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.370> at<00:02:33.030> various<00:02:33.330> points<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.630> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
expecting so at various points in the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.330 
expecting so at various points in the
game<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.290> way<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.680> interact<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:35.160> your

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
game the way that you interact with your

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.160 
game the way that you interact with your
crew<00:02:35.550> kind<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.940> affects<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> way<00:02:36.630> things<00:02:36.870> pan

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
crew kind of affects the way things pan

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.250 
crew kind of affects the way things pan
out<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:38.010> our<00:02:38.040> play<00:02:38.790> session<00:02:39.180> down<00:02:39.330> there<00:02:39.630> one

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
out so our play session down there one

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.480 
out so our play session down there one
member<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.500> could<00:02:40.740> actually<00:02:40.860> tried<00:02:41.340> to

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
member that could actually tried to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.920 
member that could actually tried to
escape<00:02:41.730> because<00:02:42.000> he<00:02:42.150> started<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.540> freak<00:02:42.780> out

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
escape because he started to freak out

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.260 
escape because he started to freak out
during<00:02:43.320> one<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> levels<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.270> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
during one of the levels and the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.820 
during one of the levels and the
solution<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.170> problem<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.560> either<00:02:46.680> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
solution to this problem is either to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.490 
solution to this problem is either to
just<00:02:46.980> let<00:02:47.130> him<00:02:47.160> go<00:02:47.550> let<00:02:47.850> him<00:02:48.090> go<00:02:48.300> or<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.290> pull

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
just let him go let him go or you pull

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.380 
just let him go let him go or you pull
him<00:02:49.680> back<00:02:49.890> down<00:02:50.130> into<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.520> tank<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.030> start

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
him back down into the tank and start

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.540 
him back down into the tank and start
punching<00:02:51.870> him<00:02:52.110> until<00:02:52.740> he<00:02:52.860> gets<00:02:53.010> back<00:02:53.190> into<00:02:53.430> his

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
punching him until he gets back into his

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.760 
punching him until he gets back into his
position<00:02:54.120> certain<00:02:54.540> him<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.780> lesson<00:02:55.020> yeah<00:02:55.500> and

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
for speed the run though hopefully a

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.690 
for speed the run though hopefully a
little<00:04:10.080> bit<00:04:10.320> better<00:04:10.590> one<00:04:10.920> would<00:04:11.070> think<00:04:11.220> yeah

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
little bit better one would think yeah

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.550 
little bit better one would think yeah
it's<00:04:11.910> interesting<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.450> mean<00:04:12.600> it<00:04:12.750> kind<00:04:13.320> of<00:04:13.350> seems

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
it's interesting I mean it kind of seems

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.140 
it's interesting I mean it kind of seems
like<00:04:13.650> they<00:04:13.890> do<00:04:14.190> want<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.700> game<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.030> just

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
like they do want the game that just

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.670 
like they do want the game that just
basically<00:04:15.450> has<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.720> different<00:04:16.080> vibe<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:16.560> the

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
basically has a different vibe and the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.220 
basically has a different vibe and the
vibe<00:04:16.830> that<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:17.100> got<00:04:17.310> from<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.609> was

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
vibe that I got from it was

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.780 
vibe that I got from it was
definitely<00:04:18.500> more<00:04:18.680> need<00:04:18.950> for<00:04:18.980> speed<00:04:19.340> ish<00:04:19.520> so

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
definitely more need for speed ish so

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
definitely more need for speed ish so
it'll<00:04:19.970> be<00:04:20.000> interesting<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.390> see<00:04:20.510> how<00:04:20.570> that

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
it'll be interesting to see how that

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.080 
it'll be interesting to see how that
turns<00:04:20.840> out<00:04:21.230> and<00:04:21.920> they<00:04:22.130> did<00:04:22.280> absolutely<00:04:22.670> point

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
turns out and they did absolutely point

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.790 
turns out and they did absolutely point
out<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.360> turn<00:04:23.810> 10<00:04:23.990> is<00:04:24.110> still<00:04:24.290> making<00:04:24.560> forts

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
out that turn 10 is still making forts

where did you go you just ran off and we

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.140 
where did you go you just ran off and we
totally<00:04:33.770> weren't<00:04:34.040> ignoring<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.610> completely

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
totally weren't ignoring you completely

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.700 
totally weren't ignoring you completely
I<00:04:35.300> was<00:04:35.480> off<00:04:35.660> enjoying<00:04:36.110> some<00:04:36.350> of<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.470> fine

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
I was off enjoying some of the fine

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.530 
I was off enjoying some of the fine
cookies<00:04:37.160> they've<00:04:37.340> got<00:04:37.520> on<00:04:37.670> this<00:04:37.760> player<00:04:38.030> some

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
cookies they've got on this player some

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.750 
cookies they've got on this player some
great<00:04:38.930> cookies<00:04:39.350> Maxwell<00:04:39.920> what<00:04:40.130> did<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:40.280> see<00:04:40.550> I

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
great cookies Maxwell what did you see I

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.760 
great cookies Maxwell what did you see I
got<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.120> check<00:04:41.270> out<00:04:41.420> Quantum<00:04:41.990> Conundrum<00:04:42.020> which

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
got to check out Quantum Conundrum which

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.980 
got to check out Quantum Conundrum which
is<00:04:42.890> a<00:04:42.920> bit<00:04:43.100> like<00:04:43.250> portal<00:04:43.820> meets<00:04:44.120> dr.<00:04:44.540> Seuss

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
is a bit like portal meets dr. Seuss

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.320 
is a bit like portal meets dr. Seuss
it's<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.320> very<00:04:45.560> sort<00:04:46.040> of<00:04:46.100> whimsical<00:04:46.550> cartoony

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
it's a very sort of whimsical cartoony

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.700 
it's a very sort of whimsical cartoony
world<00:04:47.540> that<00:04:47.720> you're<00:04:47.810> in<00:04:47.990> but<00:04:48.380> it's<00:04:48.530> also

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
world that you're in but it's also

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.010 
world that you're in but it's also
focused<00:04:49.310> on<00:04:49.460> first-person<00:04:50.330> problem<00:04:50.690> solving

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
focused on first-person problem solving

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.380 
focused on first-person problem solving
so<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:52.040> lot<00:04:52.220> of<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.400> puzzles<00:04:52.730> that<00:04:52.760> I<00:04:52.850> saw<00:04:53.150> were

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
so a lot of the puzzles that I saw were

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.930 
so a lot of the puzzles that I saw were
all<00:04:53.540> about<00:04:53.860> manipulating<00:04:54.860> these<00:04:55.100> heavy<00:04:55.400> boxes

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
all about manipulating these heavy boxes

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.150 
all about manipulating these heavy boxes
so<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.660> way<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.810> do<00:04:57.050> that<00:04:57.230> is<00:04:57.290> by<00:04:57.620> applying<00:04:57.950> I

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
so the way you do that is by applying I

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.190 
so the way you do that is by applying I
believe<00:04:58.370> they<00:04:58.490> were<00:04:58.580> called<00:04:59.050> dimensions<00:05:00.050> or

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
believe they were called dimensions or

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.080 
believe they were called dimensions or
realities<00:05:00.680> i<00:05:00.770> think<00:05:00.950> it<00:05:01.010> was<00:05:01.070> dimensions<00:05:01.580> so

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
realities i think it was dimensions so

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.000 
realities i think it was dimensions so
basically<00:05:02.600> there's<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.230> fluffy<00:05:03.560> dimension

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
basically there's the fluffy dimension

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.620 
basically there's the fluffy dimension
it<00:05:04.100> makes<00:05:04.280> everything<00:05:04.550> light<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.120> fluffy<00:05:05.300> so

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
it makes everything light and fluffy so

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.120 
it makes everything light and fluffy so
you<00:05:05.720> can<00:05:05.840> pick<00:05:05.990> up<00:05:06.020> these<00:05:06.200> heavy<00:05:06.410> boxes<00:05:06.800> move

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
you can pick up these heavy boxes move

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.770 
you can pick up these heavy boxes move
them<00:05:07.220> around<00:05:07.280> then<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.060> turn<00:05:08.300> on<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.480> heavy

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
them around then you turn on the heavy

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.720 
them around then you turn on the heavy
dimension<00:05:09.290> everything<00:05:09.890> gets<00:05:09.980> heavier<00:05:10.400> they

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
dimension everything gets heavier they

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.370 
dimension everything gets heavier they
can<00:05:10.880> become<00:05:11.090> resistant<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.600> lasers<00:05:12.110> because

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
can become resistant to lasers because

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.750 
can become resistant to lasers because
of<00:05:12.500> course<00:05:12.680> there's<00:05:12.830> going<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:13.010> be<00:05:13.040> lasers<00:05:13.550> and

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
of course there's going to be lasers and

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.510 
of course there's going to be lasers and
then<00:05:14.390> once<00:05:15.260> I<00:05:15.380> got<00:05:15.500> through<00:05:15.560> all<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.920> the<00:05:16.160> box

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
then once I got through all of the box

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.250 
then once I got through all of the box
on<00:05:16.730> button<00:05:17.060> puzzles<00:05:17.480> there<00:05:17.690> were<00:05:17.840> some

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
on button puzzles there were some

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.040 
on button puzzles there were some
slowdown<00:05:18.980> of<00:05:19.010> gravity<00:05:19.550> puzzles<00:05:19.970> so<00:05:20.210> that

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
slowdown of gravity puzzles so that

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.350 
slowdown of gravity puzzles so that
manifested<00:05:21.740> in<00:05:21.890> a<00:05:22.010> couple<00:05:22.340> of<00:05:22.460> jumping

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
manifested in a couple of jumping

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.230 
manifested in a couple of jumping
segments<00:05:23.810> ride<00:05:23.960> I'd<00:05:24.620> jump<00:05:25.340> on<00:05:25.490> a<00:05:25.520> sofa<00:05:25.850> being

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
segments ride I'd jump on a sofa being

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.210 
segments ride I'd jump on a sofa being
fired<00:05:26.480> from<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.840> cannon<00:05:27.020> it's<00:05:27.680> gravity<00:05:28.100> with

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
fired from a cannon it's gravity with

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.040 
fired from a cannon it's gravity with
slow<00:05:28.460> down<00:05:28.670> so<00:05:28.880> I<00:05:28.940> can<00:05:29.000> go<00:05:29.180> get<00:05:29.390> on<00:05:29.540> it<00:05:29.690> get<00:05:29.810> set

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
slow down so I can go get on it get set

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.080 
slow down so I can go get on it get set
up<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:30.500> would<00:05:30.650> speed<00:05:30.920> up<00:05:30.980> towards<00:05:31.580> some<00:05:31.700> lasers

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
up it would speed up towards some lasers

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.670 
up it would speed up towards some lasers
because<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.510> course<00:05:32.690> there's<00:05:32.870> lasers<00:05:33.260> you'd

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
because of course there's lasers you'd

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.140 
because of course there's lasers you'd
have<00:05:33.770> to<00:05:33.830> jump<00:05:34.100> over<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.400> lasers<00:05:34.760> gravity

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
have to jump over the lasers gravity

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.430 
have to jump over the lasers gravity
would<00:05:35.210> slow<00:05:35.420> back<00:05:35.600> down<00:05:35.630> you'd<00:05:35.960> land<00:05:36.140> on<00:05:36.290> it

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
would slow back down you'd land on it

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.590 
would slow back down you'd land on it
take<00:05:36.680> off<00:05:36.860> again<00:05:37.040> so<00:05:37.460> it's<00:05:38.060> very<00:05:38.150> interesting

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
take off again so it's very interesting

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.180 
take off again so it's very interesting
alright<00:05:38.960> cool<00:05:39.140> sounds<00:05:39.440> like<00:05:39.530> a<00:05:39.590> fun<00:05:39.770> puzzle

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
alright cool sounds like a fun puzzle

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.220 
alright cool sounds like a fun puzzle
game<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.790> coincidentally<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.870> fluffy

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.420 
dimension is how I themed my new bedroom
anyways<00:05:45.320> there<00:05:45.530> are<00:05:45.650> some<00:05:45.860> odds<00:05:46.040> and<00:05:46.220> ends

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
anyways there are some odds and ends
