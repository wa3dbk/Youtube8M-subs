00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it takes and now this rod piece just

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
it takes and now this rod piece just
together<00:01:13.080> where<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> lot<00:01:13.950> harder<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.430> get

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
together where it's a lot harder to get

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
together where it's a lot harder to get
off<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.570> why<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> lot<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.170> times<00:01:16.409> you'll<00:01:16.590> see

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
off that's why a lot of times you'll see

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
off that's why a lot of times you'll see
people<00:01:16.799> during<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> course<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.939> casting<00:01:18.540> all

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
people during the course of casting all

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
people during the course of casting all
of<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> sudden<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> tip<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> rod<00:01:20.250> comes<00:01:20.580> off

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
of a sudden the tip of the rod comes off

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
of a sudden the tip of the rod comes off
it's<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:21.930> didn't<00:01:22.229> put<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.500> rod

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it's because they didn't put the rod

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.499 
it's because they didn't put the rod
together<00:01:23.220> correctly<00:01:23.670> when<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:23.970> started<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
together correctly when they started the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.899 
together correctly when they started the
day<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.409> hands<00:01:25.770> close<00:01:26.189> together<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
day so hands close together to the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.539 
day so hands close together to the
ferrule<00:01:27.299> give<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> good<00:01:28.290> stout<00:01:28.770> push<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
ferrule give it a good stout push and

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.109 
ferrule give it a good stout push and
now<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.390> put<00:01:30.600> together<00:01:30.750> correctly<00:01:32.119> all

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
now it's put together correctly all

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.609 
now it's put together correctly all
right<00:01:33.270> let<00:01:33.450> me<00:01:33.479> show<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.140> trick<00:01:34.409> now

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.959 
them apart there's a real easy trick for
getting<00:02:01.170> them<00:02:01.380> apart<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.820> it's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
getting them apart like that and it's

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.539 
getting them apart like that and it's
using<00:02:03.270> these<00:02:03.540> little<00:02:03.810> rod<00:02:04.439> grips<00:02:04.890> it's

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
using these little rod grips it's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.999 
using these little rod grips it's
actually<00:02:06.320> material<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.560> use<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
actually material that you can use to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.509 
actually material that you can use to
line<00:02:08.190> tool<00:02:08.489> boxes<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
line tool boxes and

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.300 
line tool boxes and
got<00:02:10.149> him<00:02:10.329> here<00:02:10.539> in<00:02:10.659> the<00:02:10.750> shop<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.500> all<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.129> do

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
got him here in the shop and all you do

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.559 
got him here in the shop and all you do
it<00:02:12.459> just<00:02:12.579> gives<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.060> little<00:02:13.299> bit<00:02:13.450> of

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
it just gives you a little bit of

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.979 
it just gives you a little bit of
leverage<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:14.920> take<00:02:15.159> these<00:02:15.780> put<00:02:16.780> them<00:02:16.810> on

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
leverage you just take these put them on

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.199 
leverage you just take these put them on
either<00:02:17.230> side<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.890> ferrule<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:19.000> gives

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
either side of the ferrule and it gives

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.959 
either side of the ferrule and it gives
you<00:02:19.329> some<00:02:19.540> grip<00:02:19.840> on<00:02:20.019> that<00:02:20.200> narrow<00:02:20.609> rod<00:02:21.609> link

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
you some grip on that narrow rod link

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.970 
you some grip on that narrow rod link
and<00:02:22.719> just<00:02:22.900> allows<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.439> to<00:02:23.530> pull<00:02:23.739> them<00:02:23.890> apart

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
and just allows you to pull them apart

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.399 
and just allows you to pull them apart
now<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.640> isn't<00:02:25.000> real<00:02:25.150> sticky<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.019> we<00:02:26.139> put<00:02:26.319> it

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
now this isn't real sticky and we put it

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.559 
now this isn't real sticky and we put it
together<00:02:26.500> for<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:26.980> demonstration<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.299> trust

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
together for the demonstration but trust

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.750
