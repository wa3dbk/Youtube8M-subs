 the commander friend always present in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.680
 times of crying and pain in times of 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.680

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.440
 walk all the time 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:51.380
 the Bolivarian government in action 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 I work without rest from day to night 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.280

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.590

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.280
 but no 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.310
 think feelings about the situation that 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.030
 they are happening because it is not easy 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.120
 imagine a refugee in the house where 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.140
 one built his life but the start 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.640
 but but for the better so I want to say 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.080
