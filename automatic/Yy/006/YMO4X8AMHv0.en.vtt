00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
that's when they're starting to

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.450 
that's when they're starting to
overexpose<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.560> me<00:01:27.770> right<00:01:28.189> then

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
there that image looks a little bit too

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.410 
there that image looks a little bit too
overexposed<00:01:31.490> because<00:01:31.759> it<00:01:31.880> doesn't<00:01:32.210> really

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
overexposed because it doesn't really

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.690 
overexposed because it doesn't really
represent<00:01:32.719> the<00:01:33.469> kind<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.799> vibe<00:01:34.070> that<00:01:34.340> we<00:01:34.460> had

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700

here okay so rather than its then

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.010 
here okay so rather than its then
affecting<00:01:37.999> the<00:01:38.090> exposure<00:01:38.450> first<00:01:38.810> cuz<00:01:38.960> I

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
affecting the exposure first cuz I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.529 
affecting the exposure first cuz I
really<00:01:39.259> do<00:01:39.499> like<00:01:39.799> this<00:01:40.009> exposure<00:01:40.520> I'm<00:01:41.240> gonna

really do like this exposure I'm gonna
just<00:01:41.840> concentrate<00:01:42.619> on<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.189> white<00:01:43.490> point<00:01:43.850> it

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
just concentrate on the white point it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.330 
just concentrate on the white point it
the<00:01:44.149> white<00:01:44.299> point<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.749> a<00:01:44.780> point<00:01:45.109> where<00:01:45.409> for

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
the white point is a point where for

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.489 
the white point is a point where for
color<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.270> where<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.600> white<00:01:47.749> is<00:01:47.810> at<00:01:48.229> its

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
color that is where the white is at its

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.349 
color that is where the white is at its
truest<00:01:48.950> point<00:01:49.219> it's<00:01:49.429> kind<00:01:49.579> of<00:01:49.700> like<00:01:49.939> when<00:01:50.210> you

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
truest point it's kind of like when you

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.749 
truest point it's kind of like when you

it's gonna move the whites up and I'm

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.539 
it's gonna move the whites up and I'm
just<00:02:03.350> going<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.679> go<00:02:03.799> there<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.100> now<00:02:04.249> there's<00:02:04.460> a

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
just going to go there and now there's a

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.300 
just going to go there and now there's a
couple<00:02:04.759> areas<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.359> you<00:02:05.479> can<00:02:05.630> see<00:02:05.929> like<00:02:06.859> an<00:02:07.039> on

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
couple areas that you can see like an on

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.340 
couple areas that you can see like an on
the<00:02:07.429> bicycle<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:07.999> are<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.450> are<00:02:08.630> white<00:02:08.899> or

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
the bicycle that are that are white or

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.470 
the bicycle that are that are white or
so<00:02:09.890> what<00:02:10.039> happens<00:02:10.399> if<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.670> hit<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.180> the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
so what happens if I hit on the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.150 
so what happens if I hit on the
before-and-after<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.740> that<00:02:12.950> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
before-and-after you can see that the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.220 
before-and-after you can see that the
difference<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:13.700> very<00:02:13.760> marginal<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.080> can

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
difference is very marginal but you can

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.140 
difference is very marginal but you can
see<00:02:15.410> particularly<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.100> this<00:02:16.250> area<00:02:16.490> here<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
see particularly in this area here and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.910 
see particularly in this area here and
let<00:02:17.240> me<00:02:17.270> see<00:02:17.360> if<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.600> can<00:02:17.780> put<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.500> there

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
let me see if I can put that in there

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.890 
let me see if I can put that in there
for<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.220> that's<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.850> before<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.420> that's<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
for you that's the before and that's the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.480 
for you that's the before and that's the
after<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.410> can<00:02:21.560> see<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> whites<00:02:22.250> are<00:02:22.460> a

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
after you can see that the whites are a

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.680 
after you can see that the whites are a
little<00:02:22.610> bit<00:02:22.820> truer

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
little bit truer

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.600 
little bit truer
like<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.080> look<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.500> okay<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.430> now<00:02:25.550> I'm

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
like the look of that okay so now I'm

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.760 
like the look of that okay so now I'm
going<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.790> zip<00:02:26.090> out<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.470> am<00:02:27.500> going

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
going to zip out of that and I am going

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.150 
going to zip out of that and I am going
to<00:02:27.890> go<00:02:28.100> into<00:02:28.310> my<00:02:29.350> highlights<00:02:30.350> area<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:31.040> can

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
to go into my highlights area you can

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.350 
to go into my highlights area you can
see<00:02:31.280> there's<00:02:31.460> a<00:02:31.490> couple<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:31.880> areas<00:02:32.060> where<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
see there's a couple of areas where the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.820 
see there's a couple of areas where the
highlights<00:02:32.690> are<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> little<00:02:33.050> overblown<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:33.770> I'm

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
highlights are a little overblown so I'm

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.500 
highlights are a little overblown so I'm
just<00:02:33.950> gonna<00:02:34.040> drop<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.550> down<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.970> about<00:02:35.090> there

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
just gonna drop it down to about there

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.080 
just gonna drop it down to about there
and<00:02:35.660> that's<00:02:36.200> fine<00:02:36.560> okay<00:02:37.040> now<00:02:37.610> I'm<00:02:37.760> gonna<00:02:37.910> do

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
and that's fine okay now I'm gonna do

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.730 
and that's fine okay now I'm gonna do
the<00:02:38.180> same<00:02:38.240> thing<00:02:38.390> with<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.750> blacks<00:02:39.020> typically

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
the same thing with the blacks typically

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.060 
the same thing with the blacks typically
how<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.430> adjust<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.450> blacks<00:02:41.720> by<00:02:42.230> taste<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.890> don't

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
how I adjust the blacks by taste I don't

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.060 
how I adjust the blacks by taste I don't
typically<00:02:43.550> use<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.990> slider<00:02:45.440> for<00:02:45.800> this<00:02:45.920> but

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
typically use the slider for this but

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.070 
typically use the slider for this but
I'm<00:02:46.160> gonna<00:02:46.310> demonstrate<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.880> anyway<00:02:47.240> okay<00:02:47.450> so

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
I'm gonna demonstrate it anyway okay so

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.960 
I'm gonna demonstrate it anyway okay so
you<00:02:48.500> can<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:48.860> right<00:02:49.130> there<00:02:49.160> that's<00:02:49.610> where<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
you can see right there that's where the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.030 
you can see right there that's where the
blacks<00:02:50.210> are<00:02:50.420> clipping<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.470> go<00:02:51.620> down<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
blacks are clipping and if I go down the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.160 
blacks are clipping and if I go down the
blacks<00:02:52.220> will<00:02:52.370> clip<00:02:52.550> even<00:02:52.700> more<00:02:53.120> if<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.780> go<00:02:53.960> up

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
blacks will clip even more if I go up

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.050 
blacks will clip even more if I go up
like<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.190> point<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.580> blacks<00:02:55.850> are

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
like that to that point the blacks are

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.030 
like that to that point the blacks are
completely<00:02:56.660> not<00:02:56.930> clipping<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.590> means<00:02:57.800> that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
completely not clipping that means that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.680 
completely not clipping that means that
we're<00:02:58.190> probably<00:02:58.790> gonna<00:02:59.090> get<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.300> lot<00:02:59.510> more

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
we're probably gonna get a lot more

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.750 
we're probably gonna get a lot more
detail<00:03:00.080> in<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.290> shadowed<00:03:00.620> area<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.550> what<00:03:01.730> I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
detail in the shadowed area but what I

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.220 
detail in the shadowed area but what I
like<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.180> do<00:03:02.300> is<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.540> like<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.750> kind<00:03:03.020> of<00:03:03.080> adjust

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
like to do is I like to kind of adjust

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.770 
like to do is I like to kind of adjust
the<00:03:03.560> blacks<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:04.010> taste<00:03:04.400> okay<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.450> like<00:03:05.750> to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
the blacks to taste okay so I like to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.600 
the blacks to taste okay so I like to
have<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.200> little<00:03:06.680> bit<00:03:06.800> of<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:07.040> depth<00:03:07.370> and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
have a little bit of that depth and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.950 
have a little bit of that depth and
let's<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:07.880> look<00:03:08.120> what<00:03:08.270> happened<00:03:08.690> with<00:03:08.780> this

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
let's just look what happened with this

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.380 
let's just look what happened with this
edit<00:03:09.290> here<00:03:09.470> okay<00:03:10.100> it's<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.880> very<00:03:11.120> subtle

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
edit here okay it's a very subtle

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.820 
edit here okay it's a very subtle
difference<00:03:11.540> but<00:03:11.930> it's<00:03:12.200> starting<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.710> get

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
difference but it's starting to get

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.470 
difference but it's starting to get
somewhere<00:03:13.130> now<00:03:13.550> we're<00:03:14.030> gonna<00:03:14.180> look<00:03:14.270> at<00:03:14.390> our

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
somewhere now we're gonna look at our

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.720 
somewhere now we're gonna look at our
exposure<00:03:14.870> again<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.470> our<00:03:15.980> exposures<00:03:16.460> fine

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
exposure again and our exposures fine

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.580 
exposure again and our exposures fine
and<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.180> know<00:03:17.300> I<00:03:17.330> can<00:03:17.720> update<00:03:17.960> exposure<00:03:18.440> a

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
and you know I can update exposure a

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.650 
and you know I can update exposure a
little<00:03:18.710> bit<00:03:18.950> but<00:03:19.460> I<00:03:19.490> really<00:03:19.850> do<00:03:20.090> kind<00:03:20.390> of<00:03:20.450> like

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
this muted look that we have going on

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.160 
this muted look that we have going on
right<00:03:22.970> here<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.390> I'm<00:03:23.450> going<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.660> kind<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:23.990> keep

slider the clarity slider is gonna boost
my<00:03:40.520> mid-tones<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.330> in<00:03:41.390> doing<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:41.630> it's<00:03:41.959> kind

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
my mid-tones and in doing so it's kind

my mid-tones and in doing so it's kind
of<00:03:42.230> gonna<00:03:42.440> take<00:03:42.739> all<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:42.980> little<00:03:43.040> edge

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
of gonna take all the little edge

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.130 
of gonna take all the little edge
details<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.150> give<00:03:44.510> them<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.660> little<00:03:44.780> bit<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:45.080> a

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
details and give them a little bit of a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.430 
details and give them a little bit of a
shimmer<00:03:45.380> which<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.770> really<00:03:46.070> like<00:03:46.280> okay<00:03:46.850> and

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
shimmer which I really like okay and

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.960 
shimmer which I really like okay and
it's<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:48.590> gonna<00:03:48.680> make<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:49.010> image<00:03:49.340> appear<00:03:49.820> to

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
it's just gonna make the image appear to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.120 
it's just gonna make the image appear to
be<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.120> bit<00:03:50.480> sharper<00:03:50.989> now<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.500> don't<00:03:51.860> want<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.040> go

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
be a bit sharper now I don't want to go

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.770 
be a bit sharper now I don't want to go
to<00:03:52.190> this<00:03:52.400> point<00:03:52.670> because<00:03:53.180> then<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.540> image

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
to this point because then the image

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.479 
to this point because then the image
kind<00:03:53.959> of<00:03:54.110> looks<00:03:54.320> a<00:03:54.709> little<00:03:54.860> bit<00:03:55.100> kind<00:03:55.400> of

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
kind of looks a little bit kind of

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.430 
kind of looks a little bit kind of
ridiculous<00:03:55.910> although<00:03:56.390> there<00:03:56.600> is<00:03:56.810> something

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
ridiculous although there is something

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.190 
ridiculous although there is something
cool<00:03:57.709> about<00:03:57.769> that<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:59.390> want<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.900> kind<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.140> just

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
cool about that I want to kind of just

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.380 
cool about that I want to kind of just
take<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.860> back<00:04:01.070> to<00:04:01.310> what<00:04:01.550> I<00:04:01.580> think<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:02.269> a

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
take it back to what I think is just a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.720 
take it back to what I think is just a
little<00:04:02.660> bit<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:02.959> sharper<00:04:03.500> look<00:04:03.530> but<00:04:04.340> nothing

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
little bit of a sharper look but nothing

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.150 
little bit of a sharper look but nothing
too<00:04:04.880> crazy<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.540> I'm<00:04:06.260> going<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.739> look<00:04:06.920> at<00:04:07.070> the

too crazy and I'm going to look at the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.220 
too crazy and I'm going to look at the
before<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.489> after<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:08.360> you<00:04:08.480> guys<00:04:08.690> can<00:04:08.930> really

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.180 
gonna add more shadow detail okay
now<00:04:41.390> if<00:04:41.510> I<00:04:41.570> go<00:04:41.690> down<00:04:41.720> like<00:04:42.170> this<00:04:42.410> I'm<00:04:42.650> going<00:04:43.070> to

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
now if I go down like this I'm going to

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.950 
now if I go down like this I'm going to
reduce<00:04:43.580> my<00:04:43.820> shadow<00:04:44.120> detail<00:04:44.540> and<00:04:44.660> that's<00:04:44.720> where

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
reduce my shadow detail and that's where

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.240 
reduce my shadow detail and that's where
you<00:04:45.050> can<00:04:45.140> see<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.410> areas<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:45.920> are<00:04:46.040> really

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
you can see the areas that are really

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.220 
you can see the areas that are really
starting<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.640> go<00:04:46.820> black<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:47.420> know<00:04:47.510> they<00:04:47.690> go<00:04:48.200> to

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
starting to go black you know they go to

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.600 
starting to go black you know they go to
color<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.740> then<00:04:48.860> they<00:04:48.950> go<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.100> black<00:04:49.340> I

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
color and then they go to black I

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.540 
color and then they go to black I
actually<00:04:50.360> in<00:04:50.930> this<00:04:51.140> particular<00:04:51.320> case<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:52.010> like

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
actually in this particular case I like

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.820 
actually in this particular case I like
the<00:04:52.940> way<00:04:53.120> that<00:04:53.450> there's<00:04:53.660> fall-off<00:04:54.320> that<00:04:54.620> means

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
the way that there's fall-off that means

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.950 
the way that there's fall-off that means
that<00:04:54.980> these<00:04:55.130> areas<00:04:55.550> back<00:04:55.910> here<00:04:56.150> are<00:04:56.240> going<00:04:56.510> all

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
that these areas back here are going all

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.330 
that these areas back here are going all
the<00:04:57.260> way<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.410> black<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.860> think<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.190> that's

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
the way to black I think that that's

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.640 
the way to black I think that that's
really<00:04:58.640> really<00:04:58.970> cool<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.540> I<00:05:00.020> want<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.290> keep<00:05:00.470> it

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
really really cool and I want to keep it

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.040 
really really cool and I want to keep it
that<00:05:00.860> way<00:05:00.890> all<00:05:01.580> right<00:05:01.640> so<00:05:02.300> there<00:05:02.480> you<00:05:02.600> go<00:05:02.810> I

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
that way all right so there you go I

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.200 
that way all right so there you go I
