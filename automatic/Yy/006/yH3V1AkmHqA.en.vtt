useful plugin and it helps clear up lag

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.650 
useful plugin and it helps clear up lag
on<00:00:22.289> your<00:00:22.500> server<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.400> what<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.640> does<00:00:23.789> when<00:00:24.539> your

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
on your server so what it does when your

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.050 
on your server so what it does when your
players<00:00:24.900> drop<00:00:25.410> blocks<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.340> just<00:00:26.789> leave

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
players drop blocks and just leave

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
players drop blocks and just leave
blocks<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> floor<00:00:28.289> from<00:00:28.619> when<00:00:28.859> they<00:00:28.980> mine

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
blocks on the floor from when they mine

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.339 
blocks on the floor from when they mine
or<00:00:29.550> something<00:00:29.789> when<00:00:30.599> they<00:00:30.720> dig<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> ground

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
or something when they dig in the ground

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.530 
or something when they dig in the ground
dig<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.160> dirt<00:00:32.399> there's<00:00:32.820> there's<00:00:33.239> tons

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
dig for some dirt there's there's tons

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.959 
dig for some dirt there's there's tons
of<00:00:33.660> blocks<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.110> these<00:00:34.230> players<00:00:34.469> leave<00:00:34.800> behind

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
of blocks of these players leave behind

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.770 
of blocks of these players leave behind
especially<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> lot<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.540> players

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
especially if you have a lot of players

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
especially if you have a lot of players
so<00:00:37.380> these<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.770> blocks<00:00:37.980> they<00:00:38.280> forget<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
so these little blocks they forget it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.280 
so these little blocks they forget it
pick<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.210> they're<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.899> floating<00:00:40.079> around

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
pick up and they're just floating around

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.130 
pick up and they're just floating around
in<00:00:40.530> space<00:00:40.649> these<00:00:41.520> blocks<00:00:41.969> cause<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> lot<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> lag

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
in space these blocks cause a lot of lag

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.680 
in space these blocks cause a lot of lag
on<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:44.160> server<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.789> might<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.270> know<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
on your server you might not know that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.350 
on your server you might not know that
but<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.500> actually<00:00:47.190> true<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.210> this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
but it's actually true so with this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.810 
but it's actually true so with this
plugin<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.079> will<00:00:49.200> clear<00:00:49.469> every<00:00:50.129> block<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
plugin it will clear every block in

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970 
plugin it will clear every block in
every<00:00:51.210> world<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.500> floating<00:00:52.890> around

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
every world that's just floating around

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.549 
every world that's just floating around
in<00:00:53.219> space<00:00:53.550> every<00:00:54.360> minute<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.350> also

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
in space every minute and you can also

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.350 
in space every minute and you can also
change<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.160> amount<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> time<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> clears

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
change the amount of time that it clears

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
change the amount of time that it clears
so<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.140> change<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.590> five

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
so you can change it to like five

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
so you can change it to like five
minutes<00:00:59.309> or<00:00:59.430> something<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.449> what's<00:01:00.629> useful

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
minutes or something and what's useful

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.420 
minutes or something and what's useful
about<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.289> plugin<00:01:01.559> instead<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.039> radius<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
about this plugin instead of radius of

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.429 
about this plugin instead of radius of
blocks<00:01:02.760> towards<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.510> player<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.080> items

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
blocks towards a player that the items

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
blocks towards a player that the items
won't<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.100> cleared<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.790> no<00:01:05.880> items<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.299> be

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
won't be cleared so no items will be

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
won't be cleared so no items will be
cleared<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.110> radius<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> 10<00:01:07.740> blocks<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
cleared in a radius of 10 blocks to a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399 
cleared in a radius of 10 blocks to a
player<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.060> set<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.510> radius<00:01:09.960> which

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
player so you can set that radius which

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
player so you can set that radius which
is<00:01:10.439> very<00:01:10.799> useful<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.369> safe<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:12.090> some

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
is very useful and safe because some

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.359 
is very useful and safe because some
people<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:12.900> mind<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.189> leave

people when they mind they just leave

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.550 
people when they mind they just leave
the<00:01:14.520> blocks<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> floor<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.930> forget<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the blocks on the floor and forget it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.590 
the blocks on the floor and forget it
that<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.250> they<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:17.700> drop<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.240> item

or mind some diamonds forget to pick it
up<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> player<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.450> close<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
up but if the player is really close to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.870 
up but if the player is really close to
it<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.530> item<00:01:23.159> won't<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.430> clear<00:01:23.729> which

that<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> larger<00:01:47.369> or<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that you can make it larger or if you

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.730 
that you can make it larger or if you
don't<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.570> care<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.470> set<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740

zoom<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.090> interval<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> amount<00:01:51.899> of

on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> floor<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> guess<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.430> say<00:01:56.579> that

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
on the floor I guess you can say that

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.510 
on the floor I guess you can say that
broadcasts<00:01:57.659> message<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.619> warns<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
broadcasts message so this warns the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.609 
broadcasts message so this warns the
players<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.060> items<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.810> cleared<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
players that items not be cleared on the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.690 
players that items not be cleared on the
floor<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.130> this

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
floor and this

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.819 
floor and this
hence<00:02:02.880> how<00:02:03.539> many<00:02:03.719> seconds<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.140> left<00:02:04.200> before

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
hence how many seconds are left before

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.010 
hence how many seconds are left before
it<00:02:05.189> warns<00:02:05.490> them<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.299> there's<00:02:06.420> 10<00:02:06.630> seconds
