00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.770
 the first sailing all possibilities to play it out much better 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.689
 therefore and yes stayed lean ball conquer winner for in the highest 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:18.999
 pace at losing ball back to and at the highest pace jake it was in that 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.409
 meaning ex goalkeeper league football and then you have to get rid of it 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.969
 end emmen have released him two and three boys this morning the aches and pains 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.619
 ditto capelle be banned 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.579
 there you just see that for a number of boys the pipes are empty and and 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.700
 that you do not appear at all in the cup piece from each other there 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.690
 It's actually already falling that I'm saying you bad football but if you do 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.510
 also quite a few experienced players to win a yes but you 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.420
 So it looks as if in a number of cases experience is not so good 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.540
 A lot says Termont could just as a team and if that is the first 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.880
 there was the player of young 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.040
 and where just not able to get some rest with a game of balls 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.620
 hold in cover a boat to take out times man play good 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.230
 making choices construction started from days not good in they always came off 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.380
 a lot of attacker recently graduated also got away well behind 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.960
 andrÃ© also takes some good balls 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.060
 and there 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.030
 first wants to learn a lot 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.150
 but not the second goal made the stentor charged to boek.be or 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
 the post-rest phase there are currently to decide the match 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.960
 but well the toppers also have a bit of a feature that you get on those moments 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.790
 not to do well to do well 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.510
 and two penalties 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.439
 year after that 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.979
 I did hope that I meant one because then there is not much 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.939
 well considering that it was robert effort in the sixteen that was indeed in the 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.609
 sixteen I see you look the second man I'm just looking forward to it 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.289
 moderate jones against cocks that touched people's foot yes well nailed 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.459
 one morning both countries always have their own penalties against Cyprus and 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:48.920
 29 years as surprise 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 example and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.200
 I myself have spent the difficult penalties on one or the other 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.110
 worked a bit because a little researched the cut did not 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.390
 I can laugh about this 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.850
 yes as a farmer with a toothache 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.760
 while often having to sit through the city lets them know awkward 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.560
 today it was also the bar at the bottom and the ball then flies into it 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.459
 well that is a shame and 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.379
 do we have to train more on the first points within that of the 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.359
 conclusion 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:14.709
 the first point in thank you
