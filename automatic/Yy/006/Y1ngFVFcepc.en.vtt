downhill<00:00:32.689> specifically<00:00:33.560> sliding<00:00:34.040> is<00:00:34.310> as<00:00:34.580> you

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
downhill specifically sliding is as you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.140 
downhill specifically sliding is as you
can<00:00:34.940> see<00:00:35.060> the<00:00:35.660> huge<00:00:36.110> drops<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.800> high<00:00:37.460> W

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
can see the huge drops and high W

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.420 
can see the huge drops and high W
concave<00:00:38.750> really<00:00:39.500> locks<00:00:39.770> your<00:00:39.920> feet<00:00:40.160> in<00:00:40.280> there

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
concave really locks your feet in there

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.130 
concave really locks your feet in there
so<00:00:40.880> we're<00:00:41.000> getting<00:00:41.180> sideways<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:41.960> board

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
so we're getting sideways and the board

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.440 
so we're getting sideways and the board
swinging<00:00:42.590> out<00:00:42.740> got<00:00:43.400> a<00:00:43.430> lot<00:00:43.760> of<00:00:43.940> kind<00:00:44.390> of

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
swinging out got a lot of kind of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.970 
swinging out got a lot of kind of
resistance<00:00:45.050> your<00:00:45.200> feet<00:00:45.410> aren't<00:00:45.620> actually

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
resistance your feet aren't actually

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.860 
resistance your feet aren't actually
sliding<00:00:46.430> off<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.640> board<00:00:47.000> when<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:47.630> are

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
sliding off the board when you are

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.630 
sliding off the board when you are
getting<00:00:48.320> sideways<00:00:48.560> and<00:00:48.950> breaking<00:00:49.220> traction

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
getting sideways and breaking traction

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.930 
getting sideways and breaking traction
so<00:00:49.850> there's<00:00:50.690> board<00:00:50.900> 35<00:00:51.470> inches<00:00:51.860> long<00:00:52.580> it<00:00:52.880> is

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
so there's board 35 inches long it is

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.750 
so there's board 35 inches long it is
nine<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:54.020> half<00:00:54.050> inches<00:00:54.710> wide<00:00:54.770> at<00:00:55.280> its

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
nine and a half inches wide at its

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
nine and a half inches wide at its
widest<00:00:56.150> point<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.510> it's<00:00:56.900> got<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.260> 27<00:00:57.950> inch

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
widest point and it's got a 27 inch

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.280 
widest point and it's got a 27 inch
wheelbase<00:01:00.160> made<00:01:01.160> from<00:01:01.370> eight<00:01:01.580> plies<00:01:02.090> of<00:01:02.390> hard

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
wheelbase made from eight plies of hard

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.889 
wheelbase made from eight plies of hard
rock<00:01:03.650> maple<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:04.699> it's<00:01:04.790> gonna<00:01:04.879> be<00:01:04.970> super<00:01:05.239> stiff

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
rock maple so it's gonna be super stiff

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.959 
rock maple so it's gonna be super stiff
and<00:01:06.170> responsive<00:01:07.039> one<00:01:07.579> thing<00:01:07.700> that's<00:01:07.850> cool

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
and responsive one thing that's cool

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.639 
and responsive one thing that's cool
about<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.450> drops<00:01:08.719> is<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.200> if<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:09.439> think

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
about the drops is that if you think

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.490 
about the drops is that if you think
about<00:01:09.859> a<00:01:10.070> regular<00:01:10.579> skateboard<00:01:11.320> when<00:01:12.320> it's

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
about a regular skateboard when it's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.880 
about a regular skateboard when it's
turning<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.280> kind<00:01:13.460> of<00:01:13.520> turning<00:01:13.789> on<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.890> axis

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
turning it's kind of turning on the axis

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.849 
turning it's kind of turning on the axis
of<00:01:16.009> where<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.140> trucks<00:01:18.140> are<00:01:18.200> mounted<00:01:18.439> up<00:01:18.560> with

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
of where the trucks are mounted up with

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.249 
of where the trucks are mounted up with
this<00:01:19.159> it<00:01:19.460> kind<00:01:19.759> of<00:01:19.820> swings<00:01:20.210> out<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.200> you

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
this it kind of swings out and so you

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.099 
this it kind of swings out and so you
turn<00:01:21.619> more<00:01:21.890> like<00:01:22.009> this<00:01:22.219> as<00:01:22.490> opposed<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.420> this

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
turn more like this as opposed to this

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.620 
turn more like this as opposed to this
if<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.619> makes<00:01:24.950> sense<00:01:25.039> so<00:01:25.399> big<00:01:26.240> ole<00:01:26.359> drops

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
if that makes sense so big ole drops
