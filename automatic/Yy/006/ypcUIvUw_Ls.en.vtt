00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.580 
and these swatches are right there I
honestly<00:06:43.820> do<00:06:44.090> like<00:06:44.300> la<00:06:44.630> colors<00:06:44.990> and<00:06:45.199> I<00:06:45.260> find

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
honestly do like la colors and I find

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.409 
honestly do like la colors and I find
that<00:06:45.740> from<00:06:46.310> where<00:06:46.460> they<00:06:46.610> were<00:06:46.669> when<00:06:47.090> they<00:06:47.210> came

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
that from where they were when they came

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.450 
that from where they were when they came
out<00:06:47.630> a<00:06:47.930> quite<00:06:48.320> a<00:06:48.350> few<00:06:48.410> years<00:06:48.770> ago<00:06:48.949> to<00:06:49.100> where

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
out a quite a few years ago to where

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.670 
out a quite a few years ago to where
they<00:06:49.550> are<00:06:49.580> now<00:06:49.910> when<00:06:50.750> I<00:06:50.780> first<00:06:51.080> got<00:06:51.229> into<00:06:51.560> them

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
they are now when I first got into them

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.129 
they are now when I first got into them
they<00:06:51.919> were<00:06:52.010> terrible<00:06:52.940> quality<00:06:53.180> and<00:06:53.750> I<00:06:53.930> will

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
they were terrible quality and I will

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.200 
they were terrible quality and I will
say<00:06:54.350> that<00:06:54.500> these<00:06:54.620> are<00:06:54.680> actually<00:06:55.220> a<00:06:55.430> lot<00:06:55.970> better

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
say that these are actually a lot better

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.090 
say that these are actually a lot better
formula<00:06:57.199> than<00:06:57.410> what<00:06:57.500> the<00:06:57.590> other<00:06:57.680> ones<00:06:57.919> were

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
formula than what the other ones were

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.980 
formula than what the other ones were
but<00:06:58.760> this<00:06:58.970> one<00:06:59.210> honestly<00:06:59.660> in<00:06:59.750> particular

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
but this one honestly in particular

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.110 
but this one honestly in particular
makes<00:07:00.979> me<00:07:01.160> think<00:07:01.400> of<00:07:01.550> the<00:07:01.699> wet<00:07:01.880> and<00:07:02.030> wild

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
makes me think of the wet and wild

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.700 
makes me think of the wet and wild
palette<00:07:02.630> and<00:07:02.690> I<00:07:02.780> think<00:07:02.960> it's<00:07:03.080> called<00:07:03.260> dancing

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
palette and I think it's called dancing

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.230 
palette and I think it's called dancing
in<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:03.889> street<00:07:04.160> or<00:07:04.310> something<00:07:04.789> in<00:07:04.880> the<00:07:04.970> street

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
in the street or something in the street

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.540 
in the street or something in the street
and<00:07:05.419> it<00:07:06.020> looks<00:07:06.260> exactly<00:07:06.530> like<00:07:06.979> this<00:07:07.310> same

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
and it looks exactly like this same

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.650 
and it looks exactly like this same
colors<00:07:07.820> and<00:07:08.000> everything<00:07:08.330> and<00:07:08.449> there's<00:07:08.600> a

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
colors and everything and there's a

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.689 
colors and everything and there's a
couple<00:07:08.840> more<00:07:09.080> funky<00:07:09.470> colors<00:07:09.770> in<00:07:09.919> it<00:07:10.039> but<00:07:10.550> this

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699 
couple more funky colors in it but this

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:12.909 
couple more funky colors in it but this
reminds<00:07:11.180> me<00:07:11.240> of<00:07:11.360> that<00:07:11.570> so<00:07:11.840> much<00:07:12.050> so<00:07:12.229> I<00:07:12.320> think<00:07:12.710> I

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
reminds me of that so much so I think I

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:13.990 
reminds me of that so much so I think I
like<00:07:13.160> color<00:07:13.370> just<00:07:13.460> try<00:07:13.639> to<00:07:13.699> channel

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
like color just try to channel

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.150 
like color just try to channel
wet-and-wild<00:07:14.449> they<00:07:15.169> have<00:07:15.289> a<00:07:15.320> lot<00:07:15.650> of<00:07:15.800> really

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 
wet-and-wild they have a lot of really

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.219 
wet-and-wild they have a lot of really
good<00:07:16.310> products<00:07:16.970> and<00:07:17.090> there<00:07:17.240> are<00:07:17.330> some<00:07:17.600> hit<00:07:18.199> and

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:18.229 
good products and there are some hit and

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.170 
good products and there are some hit and
miss<00:07:18.350> products<00:07:18.860> obviously<00:07:19.010> every<00:07:19.850> major

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
miss products obviously every major

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.670 
miss products obviously every major
company<00:07:20.330> has<00:07:20.720> them<00:07:20.930> even<00:07:21.229> the<00:07:21.289> higher<00:07:21.440> end

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
company has them even the higher end

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.710 
company has them even the higher end
ones<00:07:21.919> have<00:07:22.190> hit<00:07:22.760> and<00:07:22.880> miss<00:07:22.970> products<00:07:23.449> but

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
ones have hit and miss products but

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.810 
ones have hit and miss products but
honestly<00:07:24.080> compared<00:07:25.070> to<00:07:25.280> the<00:07:25.370> higher<00:07:25.550> end

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820 
honestly compared to the higher end

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.300 
honestly compared to the higher end
products<00:07:26.330> that<00:07:26.479> you<00:07:26.570> could<00:07:26.810> hit<00:07:26.990> or<00:07:27.229> miss<00:07:27.310> this

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
products that you could hit or miss this

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.159 
products that you could hit or miss this
is<00:07:28.490> actually<00:07:28.789> not<00:07:28.880> that<00:07:28.940> bad<00:07:29.180> to<00:07:29.660> take<00:07:30.110> a

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:30.169 
is actually not that bad to take a

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:31.870 
is actually not that bad to take a
chance<00:07:30.380> on<00:07:30.560> because<00:07:30.800> it's<00:07:30.889> only<00:07:31.010> a<00:07:31.130> dollar<00:07:31.490> and

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:31.880 
chance on because it's only a dollar and

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.760 
chance on because it's only a dollar and
I'm<00:07:32.360> sure<00:07:32.599> if<00:07:32.720> you<00:07:32.810> have<00:07:32.930> coupons<00:07:33.139> you're

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:33.770 
I'm sure if you have coupons you're

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.100 
I'm sure if you have coupons you're
gonna<00:07:33.919> pay<00:07:34.190> even<00:07:34.430> less<00:07:35.120> than<00:07:35.360> that<00:07:35.570> so<00:07:35.870> it

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
gonna pay even less than that so it

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.350 
gonna pay even less than that so it
really<00:07:36.349> isn't<00:07:36.800> that<00:07:36.950> bad<00:07:37.220> but<00:07:37.669> until<00:07:38.180> next

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 
really isn't that bad but until next

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.640 
really isn't that bad but until next
time<00:07:38.570> thinking<00:07:39.020> guess<00:07:39.200> what<00:07:39.349> you're<00:07:39.530> watching

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.650 
time thinking guess what you're watching

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.360
