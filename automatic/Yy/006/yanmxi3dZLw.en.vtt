00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.960
 our task now is that in this case we can do it 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.560
 our users 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 nito 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:16.429
 petar rose 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.429
 to the folder that we 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.690
 the selected 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 six months old 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.950
 had operated 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.050
 the sensation will be cold 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 both to affiliate 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.110
 another fact 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 and it was not only the region 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 I wanted to faf 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.770
 in the south 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.249
 notice that this feat 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.909
 up to the station machine 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.859
 put him in a death on Friday 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.859
 and note that the user is full on this machine 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.679
 the user that we 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.149
 the other side 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.399
 coming to earth 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.389
 tonne 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.089
 but we must devalue 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.089
 who if users already find signs 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.809
 iphone will not be displayed 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.479
 unit only 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.379
 a force footprint 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:00.289
 there was access 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.289
 local unit 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:06.989
 And much less 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.989
 to the command prompt 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.809
 I observed that the user so far does not 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.859
 at the end of the bite 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.199
 or to apply TV quota 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.199
 the Primary Domain Controller 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.579
 Hugo controlled 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.149
 additional 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:36.149
 on the file server 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.029
 unity 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.169
 counting on a shovel 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.119
 what a paste he said 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.349
 and this partnership that was leaving the file server 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.159
 that means saying 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.069
 what the view 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.059
 should be made 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.059
 on this drive here 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.479
 then we will go to the properties 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.869
 local drive 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:05.839
 we will open the option to 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.569
 we'll turn on the 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.929
 we will pay the light 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.629
 if they exceed talula 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.930
 and both 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.930
 fifa wendt rabicÃ³ 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:24.189
 I'll look for the user 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.809
 Institute 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.009
 he cites names 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.009
 I found the user 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.989
 he was informed that this user has a dispute quota and 300 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.479
 megabytes 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.169
 and it will be notified in my pilot file that when it accepts 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.960
 290 average 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.569
 I'm going to talk here 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.930
 the sore notifications 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.930
 to enable the cut service from now on 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.180
 the quota service is being applied neither my file server 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.870
 and I'm going back to the workstation 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.430
 I'll have to use the s5 to update 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.759
 hopefully we now have a quota of three centimeters 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.539
 I'm going to lunch sector 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.360
 let's check 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.300
 if the pc is being created 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.300
 in the belt folder 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.740
 I'm going to 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.449
 the folder 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.879
 of my salary 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.169
 the boy is broke 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.330
 notice that he bets he will not share 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
 Shared Paints are the folders inside the folder 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.869
 user 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:57.869
 and there you find his profile 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.219
 our next step 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:04.349
 we will work 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.589
 with this shared file system through one of SS 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.580
 creating writings to be created 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.889
 units mapped away
