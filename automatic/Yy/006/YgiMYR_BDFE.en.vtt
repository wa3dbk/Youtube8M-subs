00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
very very weak this is a very very weak

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.670 
very very weak this is a very very weak
low<00:02:49.490> mass<00:02:49.790> ejection<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:52.570> therefore<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:54.080> had

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
low mass ejection and therefore I had

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.190 
low mass ejection and therefore I had
forecast<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.490> we<00:02:56.150> wouldn't<00:02:56.480> be<00:02:56.570> seeing<00:02:56.840> a

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
forecast that we wouldn't be seeing a

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.790 
forecast that we wouldn't be seeing a
very<00:02:57.980> strong<00:02:58.340> season<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.290> as<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.590> predicted

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
very strong season and as I predicted

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.620 
very strong season and as I predicted
the<00:03:02.200> storm<00:03:03.200> activity<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.800> was<00:03:03.830> following<00:03:04.630> the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
the storm activity it was following the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.510 
the storm activity it was following the
coronal<00:03:06.020> mass<00:03:06.830> ejections<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.320> now<00:03:09.520> I've

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
coronal mass ejections and now I've

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.780 
coronal mass ejections and now I've
inated<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.440> there<00:03:12.440> was<00:03:12.680> another<00:03:13.550> one<00:03:13.730> that

inated the there was another one that
came<00:03:14.060> after<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:14.600> down<00:03:14.870> here<00:03:15.290> in<00:03:15.710> the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
came after this down here in the

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.990 
came after this down here in the
southern<00:03:16.250> hemisphere<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.850> then<00:03:17.480> now<00:03:17.720> we<00:03:18.380> see

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
southern hemisphere and then now we see

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.090 
southern hemisphere and then now we see
this<00:03:20.080> yesterday<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.530> today<00:03:21.800> we're<00:03:22.670> getting<00:03:22.850> a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
this yesterday and today we're getting a

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.440 
this yesterday and today we're getting a
fairly<00:03:25.100> significant<00:03:25.910> coronal<00:03:26.270> mass<00:03:26.420> ejection

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
fairly significant coronal mass ejection

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.380 
fairly significant coronal mass ejection
this<00:03:27.050> isn't<00:03:27.410> this<00:03:27.800> isn't<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.550> mean<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:29.270> you

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
this isn't this isn't I mean if you

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.630 
this isn't this isn't I mean if you
compare<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.140> some<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.160> ones<00:03:31.340> from<00:03:31.459> the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
compare it to some of the ones from the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.910 
compare it to some of the ones from the
last<00:03:31.850> cycle<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.750> isn't<00:03:33.110> very<00:03:33.260> significant

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
last cycle this isn't very significant

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.640 
last cycle this isn't very significant
but<00:03:34.100> it's<00:03:34.670> it's<00:03:35.170> significant<00:03:36.170> for<00:03:36.230> what<00:03:36.500> we've

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
but it's it's significant for what we've

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.600 
but it's it's significant for what we've
been<00:03:36.830> seeing<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.610> so<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.709> going<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.860> be

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
been seeing and so this is going to be

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.410 
been seeing and so this is going to be
associated<00:03:41.300> with<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.510> storm<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:44.060> coming

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
associated with a storm in the coming

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.770 
associated with a storm in the coming
week<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.390> going<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.630> be<00:03:47.750> a

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
week and so this is going to be a

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.590 
week and so this is going to be a
southern<00:03:48.170> hemisphere<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:48.860> on<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:49.600> the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
southern hemisphere so on and so the

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.910 
southern hemisphere so on and so the
forecast<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.440> for<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:52.040> next<00:03:52.160> five<00:03:53.120> or<00:03:53.150> so<00:03:53.480> days

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
forecast is for the next five or so days

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.080 
forecast is for the next five or so days
we'll<00:03:54.920> see<00:03:55.220> this<00:03:55.730> same<00:03:56.060> calm<00:03:56.650> completely<00:03:57.650> calm

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.410 

map<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.390> then<00:04:03.130> about<00:04:04.130> six<00:04:04.550> or<00:04:04.970> seven<00:04:05.300> days

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
map and then about six or seven days

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.460 
map and then about six or seven days
from<00:04:05.480> now<00:04:05.690> we'll<00:04:06.020> see<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.910> tropical<00:04:07.910> depression

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
from now we'll see a tropical depression

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.690 
from now we'll see a tropical depression
form<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:10.250> will<00:04:10.370> turn<00:04:10.550> into<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:12.700> probably

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
form that will turn into a probably

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.310 
form that will turn into a probably
category<00:04:14.000> i<00:04:15.160> would<00:04:16.160> say<00:04:16.340> category<00:04:16.910> two<00:04:17.320> maybe

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
category i would say category two maybe

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.979 
category i would say category two maybe
possibly<00:04:19.100> category<00:04:19.669> three<00:04:19.880> hurricane<00:04:19.989> but

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
possibly category three hurricane but

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.469 
possibly category three hurricane but
probably<00:04:21.410> category<00:04:21.770> two<00:04:22.280> hurricane<00:04:22.310> this<00:04:23.300> is

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
probably category two hurricane this is

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.720 
probably category two hurricane this is
probably<00:04:23.750> category<00:04:24.110> two

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
probably category two

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.000 
probably category two
now<00:04:25.300> if<00:04:25.600> there's<00:04:26.170> another<00:04:26.440> coronal<00:04:26.860> mass

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
now if there's another coronal mass

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.860 
now if there's another coronal mass
ejection<00:04:27.750> that<00:04:28.750> follows<00:04:29.170> this<00:04:29.730> before<00:04:30.870> the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
ejection that follows this before the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.080 
ejection that follows this before the
this<00:04:32.800> this<00:04:33.190> moves<00:04:33.490> through<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.730> current

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
this this moves through the current

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.210 
this this moves through the current
sheet<00:04:34.270> that's<00:04:35.110> associated<00:04:35.470> with<00:04:35.920> a<00:04:35.950> large

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
sheet that's associated with a large

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.080 
sheet that's associated with a large
spike<00:04:36.610> in<00:04:37.000> x-rays<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.350> this<00:04:39.250> energetic<00:04:39.700> form

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
spike in x-rays this this energetic form

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.620 
spike in x-rays this this energetic form
could<00:04:40.270> be<00:04:40.390> disrupted<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.140> so<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:42.010> may<00:04:42.220> not

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
could be disrupted and so it may not

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.080 
could be disrupted and so it may not
reach<00:04:43.630> category<00:04:44.170> 2<00:04:44.380> if<00:04:44.920> it's<00:04:45.490> if<00:04:45.910> it's

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
reach category 2 if it's if it's

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.120 
reach category 2 if it's if it's
disrupted<00:04:46.810> by<00:04:47.050> another<00:04:47.470> coronal<00:04:48.010> mass

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
disrupted by another coronal mass

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.340 
disrupted by another coronal mass
ejection<00:04:48.240> but<00:04:49.240> as<00:04:49.360> long<00:04:49.540> as<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.840> Sun<00:04:50.020> remains

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
ejection but as long as the Sun remains

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.530 
ejection but as long as the Sun remains
calm<00:04:51.060> as<00:04:52.060> it's<00:04:52.270> been<00:04:52.480> for<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.980> next<00:04:54.300> few<00:04:55.300> days

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
calm as it's been for the next few days

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.370 
calm as it's been for the next few days
next<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:56.650> guess<00:04:56.950> five<00:04:57.490> or<00:04:57.640> six<00:04:57.820> days<00:04:58.030> then<00:04:58.990> we'll

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
next I guess five or six days then we'll

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.590 
next I guess five or six days then we'll
see<00:04:59.730> a<00:05:01.290> cyclonic<00:05:02.290> storm<00:05:02.680> start<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.130> form<00:05:03.600> down

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
see a cyclonic storm start to form down

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.520 
see a cyclonic storm start to form down
here<00:05:04.840> in<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.020> southern<00:05:05.320> hemisphere<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:06.450> so

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
here in the southern hemisphere and so

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.910 
here in the southern hemisphere and so
that<00:05:08.530> is<00:05:08.860> all<00:05:09.400> for<00:05:09.640> now<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:11.050> thank<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.710> for

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
that is all for now and thank you for
