once<00:01:52.500> again<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:54.289> start<00:01:55.289> off<00:01:55.409> with<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> big<00:01:55.679> jump

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
once again and start off with a big jump

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.620 
once again and start off with a big jump
fair<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.310> you'd<00:01:56.429> be<00:01:56.549> right<00:01:56.819> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> lead<00:01:57.209> once

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
fair so you'd be right in the lead once

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.929 
fair so you'd be right in the lead once
again<00:01:57.959> see<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:58.950> spike<00:01:59.250> has<00:01:59.399> any<00:01:59.579> more<00:01:59.789> of<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
again see if spike has any more of a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.219

I<00:03:02.860> am<00:03:02.980> easily<00:03:03.340> getting<00:03:03.670> over<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:03.970> world

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
I am easily getting over that world

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.420 
I am easily getting over that world
record<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.690> was<00:03:04.810> long<00:03:04.990> high<00:03:05.200> capacity<00:03:06.010> next

record that was long high capacity next
couple<00:03:06.700> events<00:03:07.000> there<00:03:07.870> we<00:03:07.990> go<00:03:08.140> over<00:03:08.800> number

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
couple events there we go over number

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.190 
couple events there we go over number
three<00:03:09.820> there<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.450> three<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.870> now<00:03:11.020> one

more and over the goal so all four goals
are<00:03:15.190> completed<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:15.940> get<00:03:16.209> an<00:03:16.420> easy<00:03:16.750> thousand

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
are completed I get an easy thousand

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.199 
are completed I get an easy thousand
points<00:03:17.740> so<00:03:18.310> much<00:03:18.430> over<00:03:18.580> those<00:03:18.730> ten<00:03:18.910> thousand

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
points so much over those ten thousand

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.410 
points so much over those ten thousand
645<00:03:20.050> reach<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.070> world<00:03:21.250> record<00:03:21.730> which<00:03:22.090> only

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
645 reach the world record which only

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.840 
645 reach the world record which only
gets<00:03:22.780> me<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:22.989> bronze<00:03:23.489> that's<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.640> thing<00:03:24.820> about

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
gets me a bronze that's the thing about

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.990 
gets me a bronze that's the thing about
it<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:26.080> bronze<00:03:26.410> medal<00:03:26.590> is<00:03:27.070> like<00:03:27.310> 10,000

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
it the the bronze medal is like 10,000

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.030 
it the the bronze medal is like 10,000
so<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.810> don't<00:03:29.170> know<00:03:29.230> how<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.350> necessarily<00:03:29.920> is

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
so I don't know how that necessarily is

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.620 
so I don't know how that necessarily is

here there we go once again don't
understand<00:03:37.270> how<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.510> works<00:03:37.690> but<00:03:38.140> spike<00:03:38.560> flew

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
understand how it works but spike flew

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.460 
understand how it works but spike flew
off<00:03:38.950> again<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.520> win<00:03:40.240> it<00:03:41.130> 840<00:03:42.130> points<00:03:42.430> there<00:03:42.640> and
