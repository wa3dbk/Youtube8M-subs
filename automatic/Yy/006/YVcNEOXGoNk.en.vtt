00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:10.829
 Welcome to the world we live in 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.269
 today we will know its exotic and wonderful Inca city that remains 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.440
 hidden for hundreds of years in an intricate and recondite place of 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.519
 Andes of Peru 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.439
 Lima is the capital 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.119
 the legendary peru 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.339
 city ​​near the sea 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.190
 but to know the splendid Inca past you have to climb the heights 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.400
 Andean 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.820
 The city of Cusco has a trampoline heritage 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.210
 As spanish 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.200
 and it is a city of obligatory step to find the archaeological treasure 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.310
 What are we searching for 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.370
 in the surroundings of cusco it is still possible to find 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.460
 archaeological ruins that show why the peoples in such a thing are 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.589
 considered 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.380
 the greatest teachers 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.380
 for construction with earth 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.510
 from cusco we crossed the Andes by train 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.950
 and we descend from the cold heights to the Urubamba river 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.750
 that begins to present a more tropical and lush vegetation 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.439
 finally we arrived at one of the most interesting archaeological centers of the 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.290
 world 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.670
 It's about Machu Picchu 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.650
 yes the Inca fortress 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.660
 that remained isolated and abandoned since the Spanish conquest 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.730
 from mexico 16 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.299
 and incredibly 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.299
 rediscovered until the early 20th century 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.390
 Macchu Picchu 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.670
 It is one of those strange places where exotic and mysterious beauty 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.800
 It is an extraordinary city 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.390
 It combines perfectly with a fabulous and spectacular 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.600
 natural environment 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.620
 stone constructions assembled to perfection 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.790
 they stand out with very deep precipices 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.570
 and high summits 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.910
 terraces on the slopes for old crops 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.139
 and those strange camelids 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.679
 called llamas 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:17.699
 they evoke us images of an interesting past ministries 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:23.539
 they certainly make Machu Picchu a migratory setback 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.009
 for all travelers who pass through Peru 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:28.299
 Fortunately 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.459
 the wonderful natural environment 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.549
 around this ghostly city 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.829
 remains in excellent state of preservation 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.429
 and it's not very different 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.269
 of the distant times of the fans 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.669
 and remember 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.669
 This is our last chance to save him 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.499
 or are you important to him 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.790
