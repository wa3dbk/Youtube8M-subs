00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
stories where the main relationship is a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.210 
stories where the main relationship is a
platonic<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> aspect<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
platonic one like that aspect of it

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.969 
platonic one like that aspect of it
totally<00:01:50.220> awesome<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.360> sea<00:01:51.600> battles<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
totally awesome but the sea battles I I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.310 
totally awesome but the sea battles I I
still<00:01:53.430> can't<00:01:53.670> decide<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.450> my<00:01:54.750> fault

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
still can't decide if this is my fault

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.300 
still can't decide if this is my fault
or<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.710> books<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:57.560> could<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.710> understand

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
or the books but I could not understand

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.280 
or the books but I could not understand
what<00:01:59.460> was<00:01:59.610> happening<00:01:59.640> during<00:02:00.600> them<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.170> think

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
what was happening during them I think

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.840 
what was happening during them I think
the<00:02:01.590> primary<00:02:02.159> issue<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:04.490> don't<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the primary issue is that I don't have a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.449
