what<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:37.000> want<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.209> do<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.450> go<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.170> decrement

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
what we want to do is go to decrement

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:47.300 
what we want to do is go to decrement
mode<00:02:40.650> now<00:02:41.650> we<00:02:41.709> have<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.160> value<00:02:42.400> we<00:02:42.549> want

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.740 

alright<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.489> now<00:02:48.819> this<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.239> last<00:02:49.480> digit

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
alright so now this is the last digit

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.270 
alright so now this is the last digit
which<00:02:50.049> would<00:02:50.230> be<00:02:50.350> hundreds<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.799> thousands

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
which would be hundreds of thousands

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.009 
which would be hundreds of thousands
miles<00:02:51.519> we're<00:02:52.120> not<00:02:52.269> going<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.480> set<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.810> value

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
miles we're not going to set this value

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.949 
miles we're not going to set this value
so<00:02:53.350> we'll<00:02:53.500> leave<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.799> at<00:02:53.890> zero<00:02:54.720> press<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.930> hold

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
so we'll leave it at zero press and hold

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.110 
so we'll leave it at zero press and hold
for<00:02:56.290> six<00:02:56.530> seconds<00:02:59.340> okay<00:03:00.340> now<00:03:00.549> what<00:03:00.849> it's<00:03:01.000> going

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
for six seconds okay now what it's going

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.360 
for six seconds okay now what it's going
to<00:03:01.180> do<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.510> go<00:03:01.660> through<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.230> display<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.099> you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
to do is go through a a display so you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.610 
to do is go through a a display so you
can<00:03:03.580> check<00:03:03.790> your<00:03:03.849> results<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.720> confirm<00:03:05.560> it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
can check your results in and confirm it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.920 
can check your results in and confirm it
at<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.010> end<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.730> way<00:03:06.910> if<00:03:07.150> you've<00:03:07.660> made<00:03:07.900> a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
at the end so that way if you've made a

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.050 
at the end so that way if you've made a
mistake<00:03:08.019> or<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.799> want<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.069> start<00:03:09.280> over<00:03:09.580> you

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
mistake or you want to start over you

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.729 
mistake or you want to start over you
could<00:03:10.239> power<00:03:10.420> off<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.810> motorcycle<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.530> turn

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
could power off the motorcycle and turn

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.440 
could power off the motorcycle and turn
it<00:03:11.860> back<00:03:11.980> on<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.760> would<00:03:12.880> start<00:03:13.090> from<00:03:13.299> the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
it back on and you would start from the

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.580 
it back on and you would start from the
beginning<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.329> show<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.630> next<00:03:16.870> screen<00:03:17.019> we

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
beginning so to show the next screen we

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.610 
beginning so to show the next screen we
press<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.010> hold<00:03:18.040> for<00:03:18.430> 3<00:03:19.120> seconds<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.870> again

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
press and hold for 3 seconds and again

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.620 
press and hold for 3 seconds and again
this<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.920> showing<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.280> first<00:03:21.519> three<00:03:21.790> digits

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
this is showing the first three digits

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.390 
this is showing the first three digits
of<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.200> odometer<00:03:23.890> reading<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:25.600> light<00:03:25.840> on<00:03:26.049> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
of the odometer reading the light on the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.309 
of the odometer reading the light on the
left<00:03:27.400> side<00:03:27.609> here<00:03:27.940> indicates<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.959> first

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
left side here indicates that the first

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.360 
left side here indicates that the first
three<00:03:29.560> digits<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:30.700> this<00:03:31.120> would<00:03:31.329> be<00:03:31.560> 21,000<00:03:32.560> if

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
three digits so this would be 21,000 if

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.300 
three digits so this would be 21,000 if
we<00:03:33.489> press<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:33.880> hold<00:03:33.910> for<00:03:34.269> 3<00:03:34.450> seconds<00:03:35.310> it'll

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
we press and hold for 3 seconds it'll

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.860 
we press and hold for 3 seconds it'll
show<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.549> last<00:03:36.819> three<00:03:37.120> digits<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.630> notice

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
show the last three digits and notice

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.349 
show the last three digits and notice
that<00:03:37.900> indicator<00:03:38.650> shifted<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.459> other<00:03:40.060> side

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
that indicator shifted to the other side

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.569 
that indicator shifted to the other side
there<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:41.079> now<00:03:41.230> we've<00:03:41.440> had<00:03:41.620> we<00:03:41.980> have<00:03:42.160> this<00:03:42.370> set

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
there so now we've had we have this set

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.370 
there so now we've had we have this set
for<00:03:42.819> 20<00:03:44.280> 1416<00:03:45.280> miles<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:46.600> this<00:03:47.019> is<00:03:47.200> exactly

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
for 20 1416 miles and this is exactly

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.680 
for 20 1416 miles and this is exactly
what<00:03:47.829> we<00:03:47.950> wanted<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.250> set<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.579> to<00:03:48.730> if<00:03:48.910> we<00:03:49.450> wanted

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
what we wanted to set it to if we wanted

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.840 
what we wanted to set it to if we wanted
if<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.260> was<00:03:50.440> incorrect<00:03:50.920> we<00:03:51.400> would<00:03:51.549> shut<00:03:51.730> off

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
if this was incorrect we would shut off

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.970 
if this was incorrect we would shut off
the<00:03:52.000> motorcycle<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.600> start<00:03:52.930> all<00:03:53.049> over<00:03:53.079> but

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
the motorcycle and start all over but

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.099 
the motorcycle and start all over but
since<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:54.639> proper<00:03:55.239> value<00:03:55.569> will<00:03:56.079> go

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
since this is the proper value will go

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.750 
since this is the proper value will go
ahead<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.560> press<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.010> hold<00:03:57.069> for<00:03:57.459> six<00:03:58.180> seconds

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
ahead and press and hold for six seconds

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.289 
ahead and press and hold for six seconds
and<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:02.470> screen<00:04:02.739> goes<00:04:02.889> off<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.459> tells

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
and the screen goes off and that tells

and the screen goes off and that tells
you<00:04:04.420> that<00:04:04.569> it's<00:04:04.780> it's<00:04:05.079> confirmed<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.889> it's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
you that it's it's confirmed and it's

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.640 
you that it's it's confirmed and it's
and<00:04:07.150> you're<00:04:07.359> done<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:08.049> what<00:04:08.230> you'll<00:04:08.350> do<00:04:08.500> is

you'll turn off the motorcycle and turn
it<00:04:11.470> back<00:04:11.500> on<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.100> then<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.180> would<00:04:13.329> be

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
it back on and then it would be

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.210 
it back on and then it would be
configured

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220
