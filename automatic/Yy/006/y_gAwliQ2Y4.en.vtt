00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.000
 well let's first proceed to 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.890
 remove the tx power supply remove 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.410
 four screws placed at the extreme corners 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.390
 of the upper part of which one will be 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.900
 under a small paper tag of 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.060
 then this protection will be removed 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.900
 open life and then removed aside 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.760
 superior exactly this way 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:40.070
 presents a tongue at the ends like this 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.930
 to facilitate the extraction done this 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.090
 we will have to disconnect two cables from the 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.580
 cooling fan and the small 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.920
 auto transformer that are connected 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.110
 women as small connectors then 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.170
 we remove the plastic lamella that 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.420
 hold cables to the keys together and the tele stop 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.510
 we remove them from the hole that made them 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.510
 go out 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.420
 done this we also remove the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.770
 clamp that does not include all the cables 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.330
 been this we should remove the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.729
 circuit board to be able to do it 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.800
 modify to do it we will have to remove 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.759
 the four screws also placed these ai 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.759
 extremes of the circuit 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.210
 in this way all four were removed 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.250
 the screws we proceed to extract the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.140
 circuit paying attention to one 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.720
 small plastic lamella on the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.520
 below for further insulation removed 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.460
 also this plastic tag 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.470
 we remove we turn the card of the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.939
 circuit to be able to more easily 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.240
 remove the two cables 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.580
 of the 220 volt power supply using 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.860
 the welder then use the welder 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.070
 we proceed to remove two cables that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.299
 they are simply tinned to the card 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.090
 doing a little strength because I am 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.390
 probably even tinned with a little 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.390
 of glue 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.400
 then removed the pcb we should disassemble 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.620
 the transformer car to do it we will have to 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.230
 remove the four screws which are art 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.259
 which for that keep him anchored to 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.130
 upper part of the case including two screws 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.380
 they are visually displayed while the others 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.680
 two are placed under the plate which 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.600
 indicates the various values ​​of our tix 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.670
 so we'll have to punch the card e 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.310
 remove the screws made this the car 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.470
 transformer will come away without problem a 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.310
 this point we should also remove the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.020
 fan 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.030
 this for a matter of space 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.370
 because it will allow us later to 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.170
 mount bushings to do it too 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.660
 this time we will have to move the four 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.030
 screws that hold it together with the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.760
 stuff done this we will have to make a mark 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.410
 at 2 cm from the top edge and do 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.750
 further signs at two centimeters of 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.030
 distance to starting from the bordeaux sub 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.280
 on the line on these on these points 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.190
 we should make a small first flight 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.260
 shape by helping us with a drill and a drill 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.380
 small piece of wood below for 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.840
 avoid bending to the houses and we do 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.570
 first small ebook then we proceed to 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.489
 make holes with a larger tip 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.570
 make all the holes so we could 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.570
 pass the next step 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.140
 so at this point we could 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.570
 change the fans to do it we will have to 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.580
 first of all remove the cable that 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.739
 is connected to the small jack that is 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.350
 connect to the card from the old one 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.910
 wind from the larger one and connect it 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.860
 to the two cables of adventure more 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.200
 small that we would have recovered from a 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.209
 another tix so to do it we cut the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.640
 old cable we hope the two extremes 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.370
 reunite with the other two for 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.000
 make it make the person make it better 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.470
 all 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.959
 I will use good we will put the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.810
 in this way so stringent 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.940
 then savior went down to the factory 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.130
 we will mount it next to the door ad 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.560
 230 volt power supply and in front of the 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.239
 circuit made this we will find ourselves in 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.700
 this situation we should 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.400
 mount the bushings on the holes we would have 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.209
 made the tires mounted to mount the tires 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.190
 first bushings we should take apart from the data 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.560
 remove the small part 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.810
 anchor it on the holes then 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.340
 screw the rest of the bushings one 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.350
 once done all this we will insert 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.820
 also a switch and we would be in 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.959
 this situation 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.700
 switch of the connected 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.350
 directly to the ground while the cables 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.170
 will be connected in this way to the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.210
 bushings done that we will find with 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.370
 a machine like this one 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.420
 unfortunately that other car I had 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.830
 built the black tix power supply 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.110
 unfortunately later discovered to have an effect 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.690
 technical and structural that prevented me from 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.140
 complete the project for which opted on 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.420
 this on the right that worked and was given 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.970
 our purpose so I'm done with here 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.750
 connect all the cables inside ho 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.140
 made switch for ignition 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.850
 turning off the tx so I replaced 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.040
 the fan back here for a matter 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.200
 of space because the big fan here 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.930
 above he could not give us no 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.120
 possibility then to put the bushings 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.530
 so I moved the transformer that 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.970
 he had to be here but he wasn't there 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.520
 enough space so I had to 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.130
 move here back to the entrance 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.680
 input I left the switch the 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.419
 default socket 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.020
 then quo the ring nut on with 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.780
 of the screws 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.880
 this is the project of the tx I hope that 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.210
 you like it and the next video hi a 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.210
 all
