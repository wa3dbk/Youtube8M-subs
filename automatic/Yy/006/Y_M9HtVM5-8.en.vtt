00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
basically sir pattern it's a compared to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.109 
basically sir pattern it's a compared to
last<00:01:21.689> year<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.380> dub<00:01:23.009> processor<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.729> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
last year the dub processor is going to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.539 
last year the dub processor is going to
be<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> same<00:01:25.110> D<00:01:25.350> buzzer<00:01:25.549> from

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
be that's just the same D buzzer from

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.639 
be that's just the same D buzzer from
the<00:01:26.729> processor<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> last<00:01:27.600> year<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.049> then<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
the processor of last year but then the

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.919 
the processor of last year but then the
the<00:01:29.549> internal<00:01:30.030> storage<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.810> be

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
the internal storage is going to be

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.660 
the internal storage is going to be
bigger<00:01:31.259> since<00:01:31.710> now<00:01:31.890> eight<00:01:32.130> petabytes

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
bigger since now eight petabytes

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.219 
bigger since now eight petabytes
compared<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> four<00:01:33.420> gigabytes<00:01:33.600> from<00:01:34.020> last

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
compared to four gigabytes from last

00:01:34.229 --> 00:02:28.550 
compared to four gigabytes from last
year<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.819> think<00:01:43.250> we<00:01:44.250> also<00:02:27.560> in

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
year and then but I think we also in

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.050 
year and then but I think we also in
also<00:02:28.950> leave<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.160> part<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.549> comes<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.940> variety

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
also leave a part it comes in a variety

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.030 
also leave a part it comes in a variety
of<00:02:30.420> colors<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:30.870> where<00:02:31.079> do<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.350> will<00:02:31.709> delegate

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
of colors so where do you will delegate

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.879 
of colors so where do you will delegate
the<00:02:32.280> dignity<00:02:32.819> muster<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.660> Java<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.590> comes

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
the dignity muster in a Java it comes

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.220 
the dignity muster in a Java it comes
with<00:02:35.069> 4<00:02:35.340> colors<00:02:35.549> but<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.540> only<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.019> block

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
with 4 colors but we only have the block

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.220 
with 4 colors but we only have the block
here<00:02:37.560> yes<00:02:37.889> sir<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.519> know<00:02:38.639> if<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.840> texture

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
here yes sir you know if I in texture
