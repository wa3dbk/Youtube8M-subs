on<00:00:10.469> Colonel<00:00:10.980> Gerhardt<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.710> didn't<00:00:13.710> really

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
on Colonel Gerhardt now I didn't really

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.320 
on Colonel Gerhardt now I didn't really
want<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> tell<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.519> but<00:00:14.580> I'm<00:00:14.820> gonna<00:00:15.089> try

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
want to tell you this but I'm gonna try

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.769 
want to tell you this but I'm gonna try
and<00:00:15.480> take<00:00:15.599> out<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.960> one<00:00:16.109> attack<00:00:16.230> now<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.779> wasn't

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and take out in one attack now I wasn't

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.609 
and take out in one attack now I wasn't
going<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> tell<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.260> because<00:00:19.380> I'm<00:00:19.529> probably

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
going to tell you because I'm probably

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.990 
going to tell you because I'm probably
not<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.520> then<00:00:20.670> look<00:00:20.820> like<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
not going to do it and then look like a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.490 
not going to do it and then look like a
total<00:00:21.359> idiot<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:23.510> I'm<00:00:24.510> pretty<00:00:24.900> sure<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.380> do

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
total idiot so I'm pretty sure I can do

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.339 
total idiot so I'm pretty sure I can do
this<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.769> two<00:00:25.830> attacks<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.430> heavy<00:00:26.609> zucca<00:00:27.349> but

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
this in two attacks with heavy zucca but

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.140 
this in two attacks with heavy zucca but
I'm<00:00:28.590> really<00:00:28.800> hoping<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.119> one

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
I'm really hoping that I can do in one

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.959 
I'm really hoping that I can do in one
attacker<00:00:30.929> bullzooka<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:32.640> depends

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
attacker bullzooka but it all depends

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.610 
attacker bullzooka but it all depends
that<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.239> get<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> start<00:00:33.719> right<00:00:33.930> that's<00:00:34.200> that's

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
that I get the start right that's that's

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.060 
that I get the start right that's that's
my<00:00:34.739> main<00:00:35.040> concern<00:00:35.600> because<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.719> i<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:37.079> Zukas

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
my main concern because if i get Zukas

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
my main concern because if i get Zukas
to<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.579> corner<00:00:38.820> there's<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.899> really

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
to up in that corner there's not really

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.950 
to up in that corner there's not really
much<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.469> damage<00:00:40.890> me<00:00:41.600> it's<00:00:42.600> only<00:00:42.809> really

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
much they can damage me it's only really

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.650 
much they can damage me it's only really
those<00:00:43.200> Rockets<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.100> shock<00:00:45.090> launcher<00:00:45.539> than

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
those Rockets the shock launcher than

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.139 
those Rockets the shock launcher than
that<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.350> can't<00:00:46.649> hit<00:00:46.860> me<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.820> rocket

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
that they can't hit me the rocket

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.840 
that they can't hit me the rocket
launchers<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.170> shock<00:00:49.440> blast<00:00:49.620> account<00:00:50.190> so

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
launchers can the shock blast account so

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.790 
launchers can the shock blast account so
I<00:00:51.059> only<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.510> need<00:00:51.629> two<00:00:51.899> shocks<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.620> make

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
I only really need two shocks to make

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.520 
I only really need two shocks to make
sure<00:00:52.980> I'm<00:00:53.129> safe<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.960> getting<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> zouk

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
sure I'm safe but it's getting the zouk

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.979 
sure I'm safe but it's getting the zouk
is<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.860> carefully<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.969> mean<00:00:57.629> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
is there carefully so I mean it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.630 
is there carefully so I mean it's
definitely<00:00:58.170> possible<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:58.920> attack<00:00:59.100> but

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
definitely possible in one attack but

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.540 
definitely possible in one attack but
you<00:01:00.480> need<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.899> probably<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.829> better<00:01:02.190> than<00:01:02.340> me

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you need to probably be better than me

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.799 
you need to probably be better than me
which<00:01:02.730> probably<00:01:02.969> isn't<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.329> hard<00:01:03.510> because

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
which probably isn't that hard because

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.090 
which probably isn't that hard because
quite<00:01:04.290> often<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.619> suck<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> lot<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.640> time<00:01:05.880> but

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
quite often I suck a lot of the time but

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.990 
quite often I suck a lot of the time but
anyway<00:01:08.100> we're<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.549> through<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.820> i

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
anyway we're going to go through this i

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
anyway we're going to go through this i
am<00:01:09.030> boosted<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:10.470> i<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.650> i<00:01:10.770> need<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
am boosted up because i know i need the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
am boosted up because i know i need the
gumbo<00:01:11.369> energy<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.909> definitely<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.630> clear<00:01:12.810> these

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
gumbo energy I definitely to clear these

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.410 
gumbo energy I definitely to clear these
mines<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> throw<00:01:15.030> bras

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
mines so I'm just going to throw bras

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.960 
mines so I'm just going to throw bras
down<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:15.960> hopefully<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:17.009> clear<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.729> quite

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
down there hopefully be clear and quite

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
down there hopefully be clear and quite
well<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:19.159> we<00:01:20.159> saw<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.670> did<00:01:20.900> so<00:01:21.900> I'm<00:01:22.439> gonna
