naysayers are gonna say hey it's only a
v6<00:00:47.610> engine<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.059> doesn't<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.449> enough<00:00:48.480> power

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
v6 engine it doesn't have enough power

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.149 
v6 engine it doesn't have enough power

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
but this new v6 engine puts out 302

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:59.329 
but this new v6 engine puts out 302
horsepower<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.619> certainly<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.129> no

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
horsepower so it certainly got no

complain<00:00:59.760> about<00:00:59.940> power<00:01:00.830> now<00:01:01.830> if<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.010> take<00:01:02.189> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
complain about power now if we take a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.649 
complain about power now if we take a
look<00:01:02.489> under<00:01:02.729> the<00:01:02.850> truck<00:01:03.089> we'll<00:01:03.269> see<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.540> new

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
look under the truck we'll see the new

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.890 
look under the truck we'll see the new
transmission<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.909> new<00:01:06.030> transmission<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
transmission the new transmission is a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.730 
transmission the new transmission is a
six-speed<00:01:07.740> automatic<00:01:08.430> transmission<00:01:09.740> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
six-speed automatic transmission and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.469 
six-speed automatic transmission and
it's<00:01:11.159> also<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.490> double<00:01:11.939> overdrive

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
it's also a double overdrive

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.070 
it's also a double overdrive
transmission<00:01:13.140> which<00:01:13.260> comes<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.619> real<00:01:13.890> handy

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
transmission which comes in real handy

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.030 
transmission which comes in real handy
because<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.200> you're<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.350> doing<00:01:16.830> anything

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
because if you're not doing anything

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.620 
because if you're not doing anything
when<00:01:17.369> driving<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.880> leave<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.270> double

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
when driving you leave it in double

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
when driving you leave it in double
overdrive<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.439> you're<00:01:19.560> towing<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.790> push

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
overdrive but if you're towing you push

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.520 
overdrive but if you're towing you push
the<00:01:21.150> tow<00:01:21.300> haul<00:01:21.510> button<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:24.510> light<00:01:25.080> comes<00:01:25.350> on

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the tow haul button the light comes on

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
the tow haul button the light comes on
and<00:01:25.770> you're<00:01:25.890> only<00:01:26.040> using<00:01:26.280> single<00:01:26.910> overdrive

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and you're only using single overdrive

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.530 
and you're only using single overdrive
instead<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.960> double<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.300> get<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
instead of a double so you can get the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
instead of a double so you can get the
best<00:01:30.720> gas<00:01:30.960> mileage<00:01:31.020> when<00:01:31.650> you're<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:31.950> towing

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
best gas mileage when you're not towing

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.370 
best gas mileage when you're not towing
but<00:01:32.880> still<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.330> plenty<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.780> power<00:01:33.960> when

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
but still have plenty of power when

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.130 
but still have plenty of power when
you're<00:01:34.530> towing<00:01:34.740> stuff<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> look

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you're towing stuff and if you look

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.160 
you're towing stuff and if you look
under<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.409> hood<00:01:38.510> you'll<00:01:39.510> notice<00:01:39.870> something

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
under the hood you'll notice something

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
under the hood you'll notice something
else<00:01:40.290> different<00:01:40.560> there's<00:01:41.310> no<00:01:41.460> power<00:01:41.700> steering

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.050 
else different there's no power steering
pump<00:01:43.250> now<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.550> get<00:01:44.670> better<00:01:44.820> gas

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
pump now that's to get better gas

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
pump now that's to get better gas
mileage<00:01:45.120> -<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.050> does<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.470> power<00:01:46.710> steering

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
mileage - it does have power steering

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.490 
mileage - it does have power steering
but<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.430> electronic<00:01:48.140> there's<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> steering

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
but it's electronic there's the steering

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.320 
but it's electronic there's the steering
and<00:01:49.830> it<00:01:49.920> goes<00:01:50.040> down<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> an<00:01:50.520> electronic<00:01:51.180> power

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
and it goes down to an electronic power

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.800 
and it goes down to an electronic power
steering<00:01:51.479> assembly<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.120> also<00:01:54.300> helps<00:01:54.720> they

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
steering assembly and it also helps they

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.860 
steering assembly and it also helps they
get<00:01:54.960> better<00:01:55.140> gas<00:01:55.320> mileage<00:01:56.330> so<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.450> next<00:01:57.630> time

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
get better gas mileage so the next time

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.990 
get better gas mileage so the next time
somebody<00:01:58.170> tells<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.650> all<00:01:58.950> full-size<00:01:59.580> trucks

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.250 
somebody tells you all full-size trucks
are<00:02:00.180> gas<00:02:00.390> odds<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.510> tell<00:02:03.750> them<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.110> that

isn't true

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.869
