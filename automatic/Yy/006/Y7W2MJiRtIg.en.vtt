until he meets this beautiful American
who<00:00:53.670> comes<00:00:53.850> over<00:00:54.230> caity<00:00:55.230> lotz<00:00:55.350> who<00:00:55.860> plays<00:00:56.129> over

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
who comes over caity lotz who plays over

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.540 
who comes over caity lotz who plays over
so<00:00:57.180> their<00:00:57.840> tech<00:00:58.109> combined<00:00:58.620> goes<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.399> this

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so their tech combined goes into this

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.180 
so their tech combined goes into this
new<00:01:00.090> creation<00:01:00.570> called<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> machine<00:01:01.230> which<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
new creation called the machine which is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.230 
new creation called the machine which is
in<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> image<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> ver<00:01:03.239> machine<00:01:05.119> open<00:01:06.119> your

the<00:01:10.350> Ministry<00:01:10.649> of<00:01:10.680> Defense<00:01:11.009> want<00:01:11.579> to<00:01:11.670> use<00:01:11.759> it

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
the Ministry of Defense want to use it

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:13.550 
the Ministry of Defense want to use it
as<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.969> weapon<00:01:12.149> but<00:01:12.899> well<00:01:13.020> they<00:01:13.110> don't<00:01:13.229> realize

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
as a weapon but well they don't realize

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.109 
as a weapon but well they don't realize
is<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.890> machines<00:01:14.159> got<00:01:14.250> its<00:01:14.430> own<00:01:14.490> feelings<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
is the machines got its own feelings and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480 
is the machines got its own feelings and
the<00:01:15.869> machine<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.500> an<00:01:16.890> interesting<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.399> me<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the machine is an interesting to me a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.969 
the machine is an interesting to me a
weapon<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.180> interested<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.810> being<00:01:19.020> thinking

with artificial intelligence and whole
thing<00:01:36.720> has<00:01:36.840> been<00:01:36.869> trying<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.350> create<00:01:37.799> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
thing has been trying to create a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.249 
thing has been trying to create a
conscious<00:01:38.399> machine<00:01:39.000> there's<00:01:39.600> been<00:01:39.840> her<00:01:40.049> work

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
conscious machine there's been her work

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.649 
conscious machine there's been her work
for<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> last<00:01:40.709> few<00:01:40.920> years<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:41.659> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
for the last few years and then the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.429 
for the last few years and then the
machine<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:44.599> completely<00:01:45.599> different<00:01:45.780> was

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
machine is completely different was

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.169 
machine is completely different was
really<00:01:46.679> fun<00:01:46.860> kind<00:01:47.099> of<00:01:47.250> finding<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.819> and

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
really fun kind of finding that and

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.510 
really fun kind of finding that and
getting<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.689> differences<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.229> there<00:01:52.520> it's

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
getting the differences in there it's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.100 
getting the differences in there it's
like<00:01:53.729> working<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.270> two<00:01:54.479> totally<00:01:54.929> different

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
like working with two totally different

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.589 
like working with two totally different
addresses<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.789> you<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:57.599 
addresses because you know you get you

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.960 
addresses because you know you get you
get<00:01:57.810> two<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.380> different<00:01:58.830> things<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.819> it<00:01:59.880> was

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
get two very different things so it was

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.190 
get two very different things so it was
wonderful<00:02:00.209> that<00:02:00.390> Toby<00:02:00.599> Stephens<00:02:00.750> came<00:02:01.049> on

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
wonderful that Toby Stephens came on

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.749 
wonderful that Toby Stephens came on
board<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:01.979> he's<00:02:02.099> a<00:02:02.130> very<00:02:02.189> charismatic

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
board you know he's a very charismatic

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.469 
board you know he's a very charismatic
and<00:02:04.009> powerful<00:02:05.009> actor<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.819> was<00:02:06.179> very<00:02:06.239> impressed

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and powerful actor I was very impressed

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.529 
and powerful actor I was very impressed
by<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.929> script<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.709> thought<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.539> was

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
by the script because I thought it was

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.300 
by the script because I thought it was
very<00:02:09.869> ambitious<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.649> what<00:02:10.799> it<00:02:10.890> was<00:02:11.009> trying<00:02:11.130> to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
very ambitious and what it was trying to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.800 
very ambitious and what it was trying to
do<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.670> mean<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.880> was<00:02:11.940> dealing<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.540> something

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
do I mean it was dealing with something
