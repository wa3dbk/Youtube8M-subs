00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
need to establish which spells your

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.190 
need to establish which spells your
wizard<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.100> use<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.630> by<00:01:48.840> rolling

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
wizard can use you do this by rolling

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.929

which we get a one and A three we're

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.400 
which we get a one and A three we're
going<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.150> using<00:02:00.180> these<00:02:00.540> data<00:02:00.690> magic<00:02:01.140> cards

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
you roll why your signature spell might

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.800 
you roll why your signature spell might
not<00:02:31.770> always<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.490> most<00:02:32.730> powerful<00:02:33.090> spell<00:02:33.510> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
not always be the most powerful spell it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.870 
not always be the most powerful spell it
might<00:02:34.500> still<00:02:34.830> be<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> better<00:02:35.220> option<00:02:35.310> than<00:02:35.730> a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
might still be a better option than a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.670 
might still be a better option than a
spell<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.240> you've<00:02:36.330> already<00:02:36.480> rolled<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.530> then

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
spell that you've already rolled so then

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.230 
spell that you've already rolled so then
we<00:02:37.770> separate<00:02:38.160> these<00:02:38.310> two<00:02:38.370> salts<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> pile

we separate these two salts in the pile

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.520 
we separate these two salts in the pile
because<00:02:39.480> we're<00:02:39.750> going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.960> be<00:02:40.050> using<00:02:40.110> them

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
because we're going to be using them

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.210 
because we're going to be using them
later<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.550> game<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.590> at<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> beginning<00:02:43.920> of
