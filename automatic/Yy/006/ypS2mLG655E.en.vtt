00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.749
 You have to get the news team out of our website on the internet today 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:07.080
 Friday the team commission were stable for almost the entire island but it 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.780
 he repeated another rainy afternoon and torments to be cautious and the west but when falling 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.620
 the night the rain dissipates but the perfect night for the enjoyment of 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.159
 social friday socially partially cleared 20 percent chance 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:19.810
 rainy 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.429
 for whom even what the national hurricane center tells us 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.329
 I have to like now not to me that tropical storm on the weekend 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.919
 has everything 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.349
 everything favorable so that it strengthens becomes a hurricane while 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.230
 we have that bad weather system southeast of puerto rico with 50% of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.390
 possibility of development let's see as maybe after another so far 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.960
 we have had enough stability however always old carrion generate 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.070
 some rains towards pro of the mountain and the west by the direction of the wind 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.639
 the heat and the amount of humidity in the environment but 

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:49.120
 in addition the study 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.290
 that goal from the southeast of the island and is moving towards the poor be 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.700
 completely to the west at the moment and every time they show little more 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.640
 organized dam that has 50% chance this tropical development in 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.579
 the next 48 hours of being able to become tropical depression and it is not ruled out 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.840
 that happened to happen on the weekend with this happening to the south of the region and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.630
 that the waters are quite warm 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.460
 that bad image of steam we have not enjoyed dry air yet neither 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.079
 the quarry and the amount of moisture that that system carries 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.349
 and that unit could reach the island when it is moving south of the 

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.590
 region and that would then cause a somewhat unstable climate let's work a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.909
 variable weather this weekend eat key sun and rain which in the afternoon 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.060
 could be quite strong we bring here he and what the model says 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.179
 could be happening south of puerto rico south of the spanish possibly 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.439
 entering the Spanish spoke the most reliable power are those that indicate what 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.009
 would be happening the south of the region has model of this system happening to the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.140
 south of puerto rico advancing a little more towards the west-northwest 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.409
 and for that the humidity could reach it and cause conditions also last night 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.590
 Saturday and Sunday especially Sunday will be the most unstable day 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.660
 Weekend 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.330
 with so much humidity we know what then the afternoon would be me together especially 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.510
 towards the interior the poles the northern half since it is also expected that the 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.590
 wind change a little from the southeast east and that could then cause that 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.810
 instability stopping the closeness with which it happens that if he loves you then 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.380
 let's see how much it impacts how soon we could rain 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.270
 receiving but healthy that Sunday would be the most unstable day we see 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.530
 here to igor tropical storm that could be a hurricane during 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.260
 next hours in the area is extremely favorable but the good thing is that 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.650
 I have a pretty altar attitude to 16 points 7 and well away 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.209
 that means that it's going to continue that moment there was talk about it starting to 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.940
 go up 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.200
 casiana a thousand two hundred miles east of puerto rico will begin yÃ¡var that curve 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.729
 northwestward 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:38.629
 in seven hundred streets 29 nautical miles east of the region on Wednesday to 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.049
 two o'clock in the afternoon so do not do here meyer which conjugate once 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.769
 would be going to the northeast of the region moving away from the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.780
 Caribbean region without affecting 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.680
 Puerto puerto alarmed without that so far and very positive what we are 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.440
 freezing as far as the equal but we will always be pending
