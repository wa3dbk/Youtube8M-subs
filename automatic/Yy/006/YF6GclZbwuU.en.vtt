00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.660
 Hi, how are you friends, say hello diego 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.090
 roses from the city of MedellÃ­n the day 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.090
 today I come to talk about a topic a 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.700
 little controls controversy a subject a 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.040
 little controversial because I'm going to talk 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.040
 about a little controversial company 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.719
 and today we are going to talk about the club 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.949
 Colombian then clarifying that no longer 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.149
 I belong to the club that what I'm going 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.860
 to say is based on what you investigate and 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.540
 really what surrounded and really what 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.199
 I wanted to give is an external opinion of the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.589
 company club is a company that was born in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.589
 Mexico 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.220
 and quickly it was expanding towards 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.310
 the usa colombia and peru 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.500
 under the supposedly 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 multilevel marketing I'm supposed to say 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.740
 because it really is handled like the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.300
 concept but they do it in a way 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.890
 different 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.720
 we'll start by saying that the club does not 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.170
 It has its own products 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.900
 klopp 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.060
 He says 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.770
 continue to consume the same as you are 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.110
 consuming in the brands that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.760
 are consuming but buy in the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.210
 establishments with which we have 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.620
 alliance then they make alliances 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:46.000
 with chain stores of each country 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.990
 they give you a debit card which you 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.240
 Top up and pay with it 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.860
 for consumers really that 's 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.920
 very attractive but really do not have a 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.600
 product they all do with agreements in 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 the profits the commissions for the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.829
 sales and the residuals are real are 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.270
 they are relatively much smaller than 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.270
 with any other multi-level company 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.960
 totally in another modality that 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.550
 called direct qualification that is the 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.330
 most controversial part of all the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.490
 rating company mode 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.960
 direct is where you allow yourself to pay 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.050
 a 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.480
 a money for your position in the network without 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.700
 receive products in exchange which is the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.010
 normal operation of a pyramid 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.310
 legal you pay money only for one 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.680
 position and really in the movement of 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.469
 products 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.480
 It is a very innovative company but very 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.659
 controversial so if you're 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.100
 thinking about entering this company you 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:55.440
 I recommend that you investigate more thoroughly 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.260
 I recommend that you advise 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.740
 I recommend you look at other options for 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.920
 that you can compare and see if you really 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:08.010
 cloud is an option for you or if 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.410
 it really seems to you very after 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.270
 invest your money there that recommendation 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.690

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.730
