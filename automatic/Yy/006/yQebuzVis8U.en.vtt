system tutorial and this last tutorial
we<00:00:15.440> will<00:00:15.650> have<00:00:15.950> a<00:00:15.980> closer<00:00:16.369> look<00:00:16.670> at<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.000> option

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
we will have a closer look at the option

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.230 
we will have a closer look at the option
to<00:00:17.390> build<00:00:17.689> your<00:00:17.869> very<00:00:18.080> own<00:00:19.240> individual

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
to build your very own individual

to build your very own individual
harbors<00:00:20.660> in<00:00:20.840> order<00:00:21.289> to<00:00:21.410> optimize<00:00:21.949> and<00:00:22.310> expand

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
harbors in order to optimize and expand

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.840 
harbors in order to optimize and expand
your<00:00:23.060> trade<00:00:23.330> routes<00:00:24.039> but<00:00:25.039> what<00:00:25.400> makes<00:00:25.640> it

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
your trade routes but what makes it

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.410 
your trade routes but what makes it
different<00:00:26.090> from<00:00:26.449> 1701<00:00:27.170> ad<00:00:27.529> is<00:00:28.000> it<00:00:29.000> comparable

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
different from 1701 ad is it comparable

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.679 
different from 1701 ad is it comparable
to<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.840> palace<00:00:30.230> in<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.410> prequel<00:00:31.269> we<00:00:32.269> asked

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
to the palace in the prequel we asked

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.380 
to the palace in the prequel we asked
Dirk<00:00:32.960> regard<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:34.550> ship<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:34.970> the<00:00:35.210> most

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
Dirk regard the ship is the most

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.009 
Dirk regard the ship is the most

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
important units in the n.o game so this

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.799 
important units in the n.o game so this
time<00:00:39.050> we<00:00:39.860> introduced<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.940> harbor<00:00:41.239> system<00:00:41.629> to

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
time we introduced the harbor system to

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.410 
time we introduced the harbor system to
the<00:00:41.839> game<00:00:42.339> to<00:00:43.339> make<00:00:43.670> a<00:00:43.729> connection<00:00:44.089> between

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
the game to make a connection between

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.939 
the game to make a connection between
the<00:00:44.720> settlement<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.229> the<00:00:45.290> player<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:45.860> the

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
the settlement of the player and the

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.090 
the settlement of the player and the

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
ships so with the harbor system the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.259 
ships so with the harbor system the
player<00:00:49.339> can<00:00:49.790> build<00:00:50.360> a<00:00:50.720> large<00:00:51.489> storage<00:00:52.489> houses

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
player can build a large storage houses

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.859 
player can build a large storage houses
he<00:00:54.170> can<00:00:54.379> build<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.920> defense<00:00:55.250> towers<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.239> taking

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:56.869 
he can build a defense towers and taking

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:58.960 
he can build a defense towers and taking
the<00:00:56.989> dogs<00:00:57.290> for<00:00:57.589> his<00:00:57.769> ships<00:00:58.159> for<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.640> trading

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
the dogs for his ships for the trading

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.539 
the dogs for his ships for the trading
routes<00:00:59.379> so<00:01:00.379> there's<00:01:00.650> a<00:01:00.769> lot<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:00.920> stuff<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.309> do

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
individual in uh no 1404 we have a very

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.130 
individual in uh no 1404 we have a very
flexible<00:01:34.009> customizable<00:01:34.609> harbor<00:01:35.450> system<00:01:35.869> that

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
flexible customizable harbor system that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.599 
flexible customizable harbor system that
makes<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.530> lot<00:01:36.649> of<00:01:36.710> purpose<00:01:37.159> for<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.369> player

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
makes a lot of purpose for the player

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.940 
makes a lot of purpose for the player
because<00:01:38.270> harbors<00:01:39.049> are<00:01:39.200> very<00:01:39.350> important<00:01:39.859> for

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
because harbors are very important for

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.529 
because harbors are very important for
the<00:01:40.070> game<00:01:40.249> in<00:01:40.460> each<00:01:40.609> island<00:01:41.090> just<00:01:41.179> looking

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
the game in each island just looking

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.090 
the game in each island just looking
different<00:01:41.719> each<00:01:42.259> player's<00:01:42.710> playing

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
different each player's playing

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.950 
different each player's playing
differently<00:01:43.609> so<00:01:44.299> if<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.570> want<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:44.810> make

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
differently so if you want to make

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.289 
differently so if you want to make
combat<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.469> will<00:01:45.649> create<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.609> different<00:01:46.850> haba

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
combat you will create a different haba

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.690 
combat you will create a different haba
then<00:01:47.929> if<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.259> want<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.560> be<00:01:48.679> a<00:01:48.710> trade<00:01:49.039> man<00:01:49.310> with

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
then if you want to be a trade man with

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.059 
then if you want to be a trade man with
a<00:01:49.729> lot<00:01:49.999> of<00:01:50.030> need<00:01:50.749> for<00:01:50.780> warehouses<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:51.710> storage

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
a lot of need for warehouses in storage

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.489 
a lot of need for warehouses in storage
for<00:01:52.100> example<00:01:52.789> and<00:01:52.939> also<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.020> end<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.319> have

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
for example and also in the end you have

00:01:54.499 --> 00:02:00.069 
for example and also in the end you have
a<00:01:54.530> very<00:01:54.890> unique<00:01:55.249> Island<00:01:58.569> hopefully<00:01:59.569> we<00:01:59.929> were

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
a very unique Island hopefully we were

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.379 
a very unique Island hopefully we were
able<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.439> cut<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.950> white<00:02:01.159> shirt<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.670> give<00:02:02.210> you
