00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
waist is very narrow actually if we take

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.730 
waist is very narrow actually if we take
a<00:04:36.070> measurement<00:04:36.580> on<00:04:36.850> this<00:04:37.240> waist<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
a measurement on this waist the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.510 
a measurement on this waist the
measurement<00:04:39.280> is<00:04:39.400> 20<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.470> 1/4<00:04:41.470> inches<00:04:41.980> this

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
measurement is 20 and 1/4 inches this

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.020 
measurement is 20 and 1/4 inches this
would<00:04:42.730> be<00:04:42.940> for<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.210> full-grown<00:04:43.750> woman<00:04:45.030> this

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
would be for a full-grown woman this

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.940 
would be for a full-grown woman this
particular<00:04:46.360> silhouette<00:04:47.110> as<00:04:47.350> with<00:04:47.530> all<00:04:47.770> of

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
particular silhouette as with all of

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.530 
particular silhouette as with all of
them<00:04:48.100> actually<00:04:48.520> would<00:04:48.700> have<00:04:48.760> been<00:04:48.940> corseted

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
them actually would have been corseted

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.500 
them actually would have been corseted
they<00:04:50.110> would<00:04:50.320> have<00:04:50.440> had<00:04:50.740> their<00:04:51.010> ribcage

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
they would have had their ribcage

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.210 
they would have had their ribcage
constricted<00:04:52.510> and<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:53.620> this<00:04:53.770> would<00:04:53.920> have<00:04:54.040> been

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
constricted and it this would have been

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.680 
constricted and it this would have been
something<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:54.970> would<00:04:55.180> have<00:04:55.270> been<00:04:55.360> done<00:04:55.480> as<00:04:55.630> a

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
something that would have been done as a

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.640 
something that would have been done as a
young<00:04:55.840> girl<00:04:56.050> actually

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
young girl actually

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.040 
young girl actually
so<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.220> ribcage<00:04:57.460> would<00:04:57.790> have<00:04:57.910> never<00:04:58.330> expanded

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
so the ribcage would have never expanded

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.290 
so the ribcage would have never expanded
to<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.530> capacity<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.250> ours<00:05:00.490> today

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
be compressed and then the corset was

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.620 
be compressed and then the corset was
very<00:06:20.620> rounded<00:06:21.220> and<00:06:21.370> women<00:06:21.970> would<00:06:22.120> actually

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
very rounded and women would actually

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.950 
very rounded and women would actually
stuff<00:06:23.140> this<00:06:24.130> part<00:06:24.490> of<00:06:24.610> their<00:06:24.820> chest<00:06:25.210> to<00:06:25.690> give

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
stuff this part of their chest to give

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.220 
stuff this part of their chest to give
it<00:06:26.140> a<00:06:26.320> very<00:06:26.590> rounded<00:06:27.520> silhouette<00:06:28.120> and<00:06:28.390> I<00:06:28.960> think

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
it a very rounded silhouette and I think

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.250 
it a very rounded silhouette and I think
you<00:06:29.350> can<00:06:29.530> see<00:06:29.800> here<00:06:30.160> this<00:06:30.520> almost<00:06:31.330> creates<00:06:31.930> an

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
you can see here this almost creates an

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.420 
you can see here this almost creates an
s-curve<00:06:33.600> it's<00:06:34.600> very<00:06:34.960> dramatic<00:06:35.380> the<00:06:35.860> shoulders

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
s-curve it's very dramatic the shoulders

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.910 
s-curve it's very dramatic the shoulders
were<00:06:36.550> back<00:06:36.820> the<00:06:37.360> chest<00:06:37.750> was<00:06:37.960> extended<00:06:38.530> the

were back the chest was extended the
waist<00:06:39.280> nipped<00:06:39.790> in<00:06:40.030> and<00:06:40.300> then<00:06:40.810> the<00:06:41.020> skirt<00:06:41.350> would

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
waist nipped in and then the skirt would

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.340 
waist nipped in and then the skirt would
flow<00:06:41.830> to<00:06:41.890> the<00:06:42.250> back<00:06:42.490> as<00:06:42.940> you<00:06:43.540> can<00:06:43.720> see<00:06:43.990> here<00:06:44.200> we

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
flow to the back as you can see here we

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.110 
flow to the back as you can see here we
have<00:06:44.530> several<00:06:44.770> different<00:06:44.950> body<00:06:45.580> shapes

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
represented just right here and this is

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.240 
represented just right here and this is
only<00:06:48.730> within<00:06:49.090> about<00:06:49.270> a<00:06:49.390> 50-year<00:06:49.960> period<00:06:50.250> you

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
only within about a 50-year period you

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.460 
only within about a 50-year period you
