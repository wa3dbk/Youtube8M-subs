00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello from France, my most 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.779
 best wishes today i will offer 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.309
 your attention is a salad which is quite 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.849
 Recently appeared in our menu is a salad 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.740
 which is made from shrimp corn 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.210
 eggs and tomatoes and parmesan cheese 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.460
 the origin of this salad can tell 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.400
 very random since the guests arrived 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.330
 and I promised to make a salad with 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.519
 shrimp 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.730
 but the original recipe which 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.600
 called sea pearl I did not find 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.500
 and then how did the mistress tell me 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.000
 recipe she accidentally deleted it and 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.670
 so I had to think of those 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.520
 the products that we had and how 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.920
 it is said from memory and this is what I have 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.719
 happened 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 so what we need we will need 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.570
 cook 3 eggs cut 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.219
 1 big tomato remove from it here 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.340
 these are the seminal chambers 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.360
 then we will need 50 grams of cheese 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.750
 Parmesan jar 150 grams of corn 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.880

 canned shrimp then you 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.119
 can use mayonnaise for sauce 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.909
 someone one garlic clove or same as me 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.509
