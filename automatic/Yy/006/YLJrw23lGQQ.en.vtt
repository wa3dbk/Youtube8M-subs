welcome 
to kekevicom kitchen, in this episode we are
making poppy seed tea buns or bread.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:44.560
first add some lukewarm water in the bowl, add fresh
or dried yeast and sprÄ±nkle the granulated sugar and wait for 5 minutes.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:07.000
Lets add the
other ingredients now. vegetable oil, egg white, unsweetened yogurt,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
flour and salt.
now we can begin to mix the dough.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.300
we want not very sticky but pliable soft dough. i
add more flour as needed.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.600
as you see the dough is soft but not sticky.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:49.200
now  close the bowl with plastic wrap and let it
rise until doubled about 1 hour.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:06.400
our dough is almost in triple size. First lets give
a long shape. then cut in 6 pieces and give a round shape

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:16.549
. here i have roasted poppy seed
paste, i will add vegetable oil and mix. our filling is ready

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:23.619
. Now we can begin to give
the give the shape. first take one piece of

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:32.319
the dough and roll out in the floured counter.
spread some of the filling on the dough with spoon

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.319
. now roll out the second piece of dough
and add it over the filling and repeat the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.350
steps again until all dough pieces and the
filling is used. it is fun to watch right

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.350
but you will like to do it yourself too. after
adding the last piece you can stretch the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:21.220
dough little with your hand and cut all the
pieces in half.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:31.479
And put one of the them on the other like this. Now we have a 12 layered
dough. now i am going to cut strips.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.800
i am using dough scraper for this which is easier
to do. Now pull the strip a little and twist

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.800
it. and beginning from the middle put it in
a round baking tray. you should grase the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.630
baking tray before of course.. i continue
to shape the dough and put it in the baking sheet

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:26.800
. as you can see there are some 
parts of the dough that does't have filling
much on the sides. if you can put these parts

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.940
around the bigger strips they will get mix
with other pieces.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.950
lastly i will egg wash the dough 
and bake in a preheated 190C oven until it
is golden colour about 50 minutes.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.680
here is the result of this delicious baked good. the
ingrediengs list and amounts are in the info

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.080
