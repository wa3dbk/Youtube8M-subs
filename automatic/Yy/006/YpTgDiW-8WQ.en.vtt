assessment<00:05:39.120> within<00:05:39.690> 24<00:05:40.320> hours<00:05:40.350> I<00:05:40.979> think

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
assessment within 24 hours I think

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.640

everybody<00:05:41.789> in<00:05:42.180> my<00:05:42.300> class<00:05:42.360> that<00:05:42.870> took<00:05:43.470> this

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
everybody in my class that took this

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.890 
everybody in my class that took this

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
course has passed their state boards so

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.930 
course has passed their state boards so
I<00:05:45.930> think<00:05:46.080> that's<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.530> final<00:05:46.950> testament<00:05:47.490> to

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
I think that's the final testament to

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.210 
I think that's the final testament to
their<00:05:48.060> success<00:05:48.440> when<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.530> class<00:05:49.770> work<00:05:50.039> is

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
their success when the class work is

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.000 
their success when the class work is
over<00:05:50.580> and<00:05:50.850> the<00:05:51.270> state<00:05:51.539> exams<00:05:51.900> are<00:05:52.080> passed<00:05:52.380> the
