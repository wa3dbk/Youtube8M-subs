00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.679
 we were preparing to remove it willy 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.870
 well in this video I'll show you in 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.930
 the alternative method the form 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.420
 alternative to arrive 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.530
 to the platform where the weapon of the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.650
 scale in the previous video 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.860
 and I've shown you how to get there with the vans 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.640
 and how good is the best method but the 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.759
 otherwise 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.320
 which is what you are going to see next 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.140
 this in the final part of metropolis of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.510
 the metropolis phase came the skull 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.870
 sputnik activated 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.180
 and good what is there to do 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.100
 first we have to carry this box or 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.100
 a similar box of this size 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.500
 at the beginning of the bridge the area 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.540
 initial of the bridge 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.510
 we have to drag it with care of 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.910
 that we do not fall into the water 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.329
 and then we also need to take 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.790
 over the rocket launcher that is what we 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.549
 will allow to give the impulse to 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.570
 reach the upper platform where 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.570
 is the weapon we are looking for 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.600
 well I'm going to place I'm going to place 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.840
 here the box 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.920
 neither do I need to place it 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.869
 exactly as it appears in the video 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.530
 it can be a bit to the side at 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:30.580
 another but good the idea is the position 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:34.690
 roughly what is this more or less is 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.130
 well and good another other detail agrees 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.590
 give yourself a little hurry before you 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.899
 leave the control point since this 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.460
 point is very useful because it looks already 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.430
 I have everything prepared with the rocket launcher 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.440
 I'm out of the box and I'm waiting for 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.360
 to know the checkpoint and no 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.399
 failure that is normal to fail 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.619
 I do not have to repeat all the time again 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.039
 process of dragging the box 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.850
 there and prepare me, it's already gone 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.130
 point the first attempt I'm short 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.190
 but as I had prepared everything and 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.720
 I already knew the control point because it 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.769
 can invent as many times as needed 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.769
 until it comes out 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.720
 here our first attempts I'm not 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.630
 being short 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.770
 now the opposite can also happen 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.620
 that you go very high that is an impulse 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:31.210
 too strong and you also die with what 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.380
 which does not help you either, you have to look for the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.860
 proper impulse 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.920
 it's not that easy but we're going to 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.280
 try it yourself you 're calibrating you're going 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.280
 seeing 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.230
 what you need in the power that 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.650
 you need to get here this is the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.530
 I'm finally trying to get it right 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.890
 I have reached the top 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.530
 and well here we have his weapon is 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.220
 face looks like a normal plasma rifle 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.810
 but it shoots the ray of the escalafÃ£ there what 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.650
 you have is a very powerful weapon 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.099
 very spectacular also look at the effect 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.720
 what it does seems to destroy the soil and 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.989
 good and no stockings and you shoot very close 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.140
 you die because there is something that has a lot 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.000
 power 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.880
 and then also 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.750
 has infinite ammunition and I do not know 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.460
 overload with which is probably 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.860
 the best game weapon or one of the 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.160
 top 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.800
 ok we have the gun but 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.910
 how to go back down because you can not be 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.270
 the whore 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.110
 since if so if the other way 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.940
 you die because of the height 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.710
 and that's why I told you at the beginning that it 's 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.600
 better the basij method because so if 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.090
 can go back down 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.370
 there could be a way in the way 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.970
 cooperative I was not approved but what 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.170
 one stays down and in the riva dies and 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.680
 let's say you drop the weapon to the one below 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.700
 go urges the scale of this part 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.000
 end of the level but 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.620
 if you play alone because you can not 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.380
 go down you have to die yes or yes and good 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:29.830
 Well that's it if you liked this 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:32.590
 Give video like and subscribe 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.570
 I write 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.080
 and now I got in and put the one who shot me 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.080
 that I shot 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.389
 I subscribe
