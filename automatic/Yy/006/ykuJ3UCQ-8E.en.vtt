to<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.560> practice<00:02:08.039> test

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to get out and do a little practice test

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.780

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
but we were third the truck was a little

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.340 
but we were third the truck was a little
slick<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.209> beginning<00:02:12.690> but<00:02:12.840> after<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
slick and beginning but after that I

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.990 
slick and beginning but after that I
kind<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.650> figured<00:02:14.010> out<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.160> got<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.760> better

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
kind of figured out I got going better

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.830 
kind of figured out I got going better
but<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:16.200> biggest<00:02:16.410> problem<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:17.070> me<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:18.720> was

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
but the biggest problem for me is it was

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960 
but the biggest problem for me is it was
so<00:02:19.020> cold<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.440> was<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.650> 42<00:02:19.950> degrees<00:02:20.430> out<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.880> is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.080 
so cold I was like 42 degrees out in is
raining<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.560> after<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.310> few<00:02:23.340> laughter<00:02:23.850> picked

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
raining so after a few laughter picked

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.870 
raining so after a few laughter picked
on<00:02:24.270> my<00:02:24.390> hands<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.870> actually<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.880> session

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
on my hands and actually in the session

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.440
