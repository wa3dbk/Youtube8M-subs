00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
match of our history since 1975 when we

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.889 
match of our history since 1975 when we
beat<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.750> Sounders<00:01:05.140> 21<00:01:06.009> @<00:01:06.789> at<00:01:07.300> home<00:01:07.479> in<00:01:07.750> the

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
beat the Sounders 21 @ at home in the

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.230 
beat the Sounders 21 @ at home in the
playoffs<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.470> should<00:01:09.220> be<00:01:09.280> good<00:01:09.399> I<00:01:09.670> think

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
playoffs so should be good I think

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.060 
playoffs so should be good I think
tomorrow<00:01:10.750> we<00:01:10.840> have<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.960> chance<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.410> advancing

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
tomorrow we have a chance of advancing

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.400 
tomorrow we have a chance of advancing
to<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.280> next<00:01:12.399> round<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:13.660> think<00:01:14.080> that's<00:01:14.289> a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
to the next round and I think that's a

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.139 
to the next round and I think that's a
huge<00:01:14.950> step<00:01:14.979> for<00:01:15.369> our<00:01:15.399> club<00:01:15.670> being<00:01:15.910> in<00:01:16.030> our

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
huge step for our club being in our

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.900 
huge step for our club being in our
third<00:01:16.390> year<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.930> gaining<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.890> flouse<00:01:18.160> this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
third year and gaining a flouse this

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.850 
third year and gaining a flouse this
year<00:01:19.149> and<00:01:19.360> so<00:01:19.780> it's<00:01:20.530> going<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.740> mean

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
year and so it's going to mean

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.620 
year and so it's going to mean
everything<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.369> us<00:01:22.020> from<00:01:23.020> bad<00:01:23.320> bear<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:24.939> to
