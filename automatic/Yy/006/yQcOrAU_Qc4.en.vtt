00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
once the tuile we use the brown shrimp

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.530 
once the tuile we use the brown shrimp
to<00:01:42.870> make<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> tuile<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.860> make<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.160> puree<00:01:44.640> kind

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
to make the tuile and make a puree kind

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.100 
to make the tuile and make a puree kind
of<00:01:45.630> smear<00:01:46.310> bake<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:47.670> about<00:01:47.790> 3-4<00:01:48.750> minutes

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.770 
of smear bake it for about 3-4 minutes
end<00:01:49.920> result<00:01:50.370> is<00:01:50.580> one<00:01:50.730> of<00:01:50.820> these<00:01:50.910> looks<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.660> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
end result is one of these looks like a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.530 
end result is one of these looks like a
little<00:01:51.930> spoon<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.730> basically<00:01:54.120> a<00:01:54.210> shrink
