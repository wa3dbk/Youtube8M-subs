00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.580
 good that we start with the new 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.799
 translation of the cross we are already entering 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.469
 all translated into Spanish this time 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.900
 we kept the format the colors of the 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.059
 cross instead of putting red colors 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.920
 like the last time we saw a 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.240
 Spanish writers and let's go into 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.029
 any 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.990
 to see how the black market is 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.050
 translated the buttons below also 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.119
 the options are also translated 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.780
 there is a small mistake quoted that we are going to go 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:37.160
 correcting that is for example 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.430
 looking here he receives he says yes he without 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.930
 attraction m 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.880
 We are looking for how to find 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.680
 solutions or when we do not find what 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.930
 let's fix in the next 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.930
 upgrade 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.260
 we see a little volume bar and listen to the 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.940
 audios 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.940

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.360
 now yes 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.690
 we entered the store that are also 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.220
 all translated but respecting the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.220
 colors of blacks 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.619
 also translated 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.149
 as always less critical about everything 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.470
 what comes from the server what 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.040
 it's inside kings files that's what 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.350
 we left as was 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.920
 things 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.920
 among others 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.540

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.479

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.650
 to 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.720
 to 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:49.810
 in anything 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.960
 they let us know and next time we want 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.030

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.540
