why<00:01:00.769> I<00:01:00.829> like<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:01.160> much<00:01:01.280> is<00:01:01.519> it's<00:01:01.670> designed

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
why I like it so much is it's designed

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.719 
why I like it so much is it's designed
to<00:01:02.600> kind<00:01:02.839> of<00:01:02.899> mimic<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.530> popular<00:01:04.009> teal<00:01:04.429> orange

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
to kind of mimic the popular teal orange

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.480 
to kind of mimic the popular teal orange
color<00:01:05.600> scheming<00:01:06.050> and<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.800> color<00:01:07.039> grading

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
color scheming and the color grading

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.270 
color scheming and the color grading
that<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:07.729> see<00:01:07.940> in<00:01:08.149> Hollywood<00:01:08.690> films<00:01:09.050> now<00:01:09.679> why

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
that you see in Hollywood films now why

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.010 
that you see in Hollywood films now why
do<00:01:10.340> they<00:01:10.550> use<00:01:10.729> teal<00:01:11.060> orange<00:01:11.330> well<00:01:11.720> because

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
do they use teal orange well because

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.560 
do they use teal orange well because
they're<00:01:12.350> complementary<00:01:12.920> colors<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:13.940> orange

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
they're complementary colors so orange

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.210 
they're complementary colors so orange
which<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:14.899> close<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.170> basically<00:01:15.649> here<00:01:15.950> your

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
which is close to basically here your

a really nice kind of cohesive look to
the<00:01:27.560> overall<00:01:28.399> color<00:01:28.700> grading<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:29.780> typically

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
the overall color grading so typically

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.719 
the overall color grading so typically
with<00:01:30.470> films<00:01:30.800> you're<00:01:30.950> seeing<00:01:31.190> like<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.550> use<00:01:31.700> of

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
with films you're seeing like the use of

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.029 
with films you're seeing like the use of
either<00:01:32.420> complementary<00:01:33.110> colors<00:01:33.470> or<00:01:33.649> analogous

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:36.739 
colors in those color schemes and this

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:38.440 
colors in those color schemes and this
is<00:01:36.860> what<00:01:36.979> this<00:01:37.069> preset<00:01:37.429> is<00:01:37.550> based<00:01:37.729> on<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.270> let's

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
is what this preset is based on so let's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.520 
is what this preset is based on so let's
select<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.899> now<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:39.170> you'll<00:01:39.289> see<00:01:39.440> exactly

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
select it now and you'll see exactly

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.440 
select it now and you'll see exactly
what<00:01:39.979> it<00:01:40.069> does<00:01:40.220> what<00:01:40.849> we're<00:01:41.000> going<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.179> do<00:01:41.270> is

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
what it does what we're going to do is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.089 
what it does what we're going to do is
overall<00:01:41.899> you<00:01:42.020> see<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.229> lot<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.560> green<00:01:42.830> right<00:01:42.979> now

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
overall you see a lot of green right now

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.639 
overall you see a lot of green right now
that's<00:01:43.310> because<00:01:43.580> this<00:01:43.759> is<00:01:43.970> underexposed<00:01:44.649> so

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
that's because this is underexposed so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.469 
that's because this is underexposed so
because<00:01:46.160> their<00:01:46.340> skin<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.670> also<00:01:47.000> under<00:01:47.179> exposed

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
because their skin is also under exposed

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.150 
because their skin is also under exposed
its<00:01:47.660> falling<00:01:48.050> into<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.349> green<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:48.800> we<00:01:48.950> have<00:01:49.039> to

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
its falling into the green so we have to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.740 
its falling into the green so we have to
do<00:01:49.280> right<00:01:49.489> now<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.640> dial<00:01:50.119> in<00:01:50.330> our<00:01:50.509> base

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
do right now is dial in our base

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.990 
do right now is dial in our base
adjustment<00:01:51.319> and<00:01:51.500> take<00:01:52.129> it<00:01:52.250> up<00:01:52.310> about<00:01:52.489> one<00:01:52.729> stop

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
adjustment and take it up about one stop

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.580 
adjustment and take it up about one stop
and<00:01:53.239> you'll<00:01:53.330> see<00:01:53.539> automatically<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.470> the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
and you'll see automatically that the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.400 
and you'll see automatically that the
skin<00:01:54.890> bumps<00:01:55.250> into<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.259> kind<00:01:57.259> of<00:01:57.319> the

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
skin bumps into the kind of the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.960 
skin bumps into the kind of the
highlight<00:01:57.679> range<00:01:57.890> which<00:01:58.069> is<00:01:58.099> more<00:01:58.340> orange<00:01:58.729> so

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
highlight range which is more orange so

and you'll kind of notice that as we're
going<00:03:26.209> through<00:03:26.329> here<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.319> common<00:03:27.980> thing

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
going through here the the common thing

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.440 
going through here the the common thing
that<00:03:28.189> all<00:03:28.489> these<00:03:28.639> images<00:03:29.000> have<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.329> we're

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
that all these images have that we're

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.720 
that all these images have that we're
applying<00:03:29.599> this<00:03:29.840> effect<00:03:30.169> two<00:03:30.379> is<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.489> the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
applying this effect two is that the the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.250 
applying this effect two is that the the
subjects<00:03:32.180> aren't<00:03:32.389> necessarily<00:03:32.720> looking<00:03:32.840> into

this shot all we did was we just applied
the<00:03:49.849> effect<00:03:50.329> we<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:51.019> just<00:03:51.470> wanted<00:03:51.680> my<00:03:51.769> base

saturation does is it kind of it pulls

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.450 
saturation does is it kind of it pulls
down<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:51.380> vibrance<00:06:51.680> kind<00:06:51.860> of<00:06:51.920> goes<00:06:52.040> down<00:06:52.250> the

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
down the vibrance kind of goes down the

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.740 
down the vibrance kind of goes down the
saturation<00:06:52.880> goes<00:06:53.030> up<00:06:53.180> and<00:06:53.330> what<00:06:53.450> that<00:06:53.600> does

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
saturation goes up and what that does

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.210 
saturation goes up and what that does
essentially<00:06:54.200> it<00:06:54.350> pulls<00:06:54.590> down<00:06:54.740> some<00:06:55.040> of<00:06:55.070> the

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
essentially it pulls down some of the

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.070 
essentially it pulls down some of the
tones<00:06:55.430> while<00:06:55.730> brightening<00:06:56.330> are<00:06:56.690> not

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
tones while brightening are not

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.380 
tones while brightening are not
brightening<00:06:57.470> but<00:06:57.620> saturating<00:06:58.190> only<00:06:58.520> the<00:06:58.730> kind

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
brightening but saturating only the kind

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
of more bright colors all right so we

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.930 
of more bright colors all right so we
call<00:07:02.330> it<00:07:02.480> reverse<00:07:02.840> saturation<00:07:03.460> okay<00:07:04.460> so<00:07:04.520> now

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
call it reverse saturation okay so now

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.820 
call it reverse saturation okay so now
