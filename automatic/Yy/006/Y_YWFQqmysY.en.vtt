on this particular racket I'm going to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.070 
on this particular racket I'm going to

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
a starting clamp to hold the string I

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.770 
a starting clamp to hold the string I
like<00:01:12.860> this<00:01:12.979> a<00:01:13.040> little<00:01:13.220> better<00:01:13.400> than<00:01:14.240> using<00:01:14.690> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
like this a little better than using the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.830 
like this a little better than using the
regular<00:01:14.960> clamps<00:01:15.560> it's<00:01:16.340> fairly<00:01:16.580> strong<00:01:17.030> that's

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
regular clamps it's fairly strong that's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.780 
regular clamps it's fairly strong that's
pretty<00:01:18.110> quick<00:01:18.290> just<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:18.680> put<00:01:18.950> on<00:01:19.100> there<00:01:19.340> real

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
pretty quick just to put on there real

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.640 
pretty quick just to put on there real
fast<00:01:19.820> holds<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.479> little<00:01:20.600> better<00:01:20.840> than<00:01:21.470> your

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
fast holds a little better than your

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.730 
fast holds a little better than your
regular<00:01:21.799> clamps<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.610> don't<00:01:23.000> have<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.740> tighten

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
regular clamps I don't have to tighten

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.590 
regular clamps I don't have to tighten
them<00:01:24.860> down<00:01:25.040> as<00:01:25.220> much<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.880> compress<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
them down as much and compress the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.170 
them down as much and compress the
string<00:01:27.250> so<00:01:28.250> we<00:01:28.310> thread<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.640> up<00:01:28.909> through<00:01:29.120> the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
string so we thread it up through the

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.930 
string so we thread it up through the
head<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.920> we<00:01:30.920> were<00:01:31.040> getting<00:01:31.250> ready<00:01:31.370> to<00:01:31.520> pull

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
head and we were getting ready to pull

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.740 
head and we were getting ready to pull
the<00:01:32.090> tension<00:01:32.600> on<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.610> first<00:01:34.610> string<00:01:34.820> as<00:01:35.630> you

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
the tension on the first string as you

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.060 
the tension on the first string as you
can<00:01:35.960> see<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:36.260> pulled<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.590> tension<00:01:36.890> on<00:01:36.979> the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
can see we pulled the tension on the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.580 
can see we pulled the tension on the
first<00:01:37.280> string<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:38.780> little<00:01:39.080> plunger<00:01:39.440> right

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
first string this little plunger right

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.950 
first string this little plunger right
here<00:01:39.979> has<00:01:40.700> popped<00:01:41.000> out<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.570> string

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
here has popped out and the string

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.609 
here has popped out and the string
reaches<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.890> correct<00:01:43.040> tension<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.510> we<00:01:44.960> go

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
reaches the correct tension and we go

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.039 
reaches the correct tension and we go
ahead<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:45.979> put<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.250> clamp<00:01:46.520> on<00:01:46.700> here<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.270> so

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
ahead and put the clamp on here and so

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.429 
ahead and put the clamp on here and so
now<00:01:48.170> we<00:01:48.320> can<00:01:48.470> release<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:49.040> string<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.439> start

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
now we can release the string and start

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.700 
now we can release the string and start
on<00:01:51.770> our<00:01:52.070> next<00:01:52.790> main<00:01:53.290> okay<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:54.350> now<00:01:54.530> I've<00:01:54.590> done

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
on our next main okay so now I've done

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.250 
on our next main okay so now I've done
the<00:01:54.830> first<00:01:55.010> four<00:01:55.369> mains<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:56.000> each<00:01:56.810> side<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.140> the

next<00:02:07.430> side<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.000> then<00:02:08.509> another<00:02:08.720> two<00:02:09.080> on<00:02:09.409> this

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
next side and then another two on this

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.580 
next side and then another two on this
side<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:11.060> you're<00:02:11.180> never<00:02:11.299> more<00:02:11.510> than<00:02:11.569> two<00:02:12.379> ahead

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
side so you're never more than two ahead

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.339 
side so you're never more than two ahead
on<00:02:12.950> either<00:02:13.099> side<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:14.150> can<00:02:14.299> go<00:02:14.450> one<00:02:14.719> or<00:02:14.749> two

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
on either side you can go one or two

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.470 
on either side you can go one or two
I<00:02:15.379> wouldn't<00:02:16.010> go<00:02:16.129> past<00:02:16.159> that

before I did that I like to weed the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.470

next<00:03:33.169> cross<00:03:33.410> ahead<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:35.000> makes<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.359> little

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
next cross ahead it makes it a little

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.710 
next cross ahead it makes it a little
easier<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.109> weave<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.880> strings<00:03:38.209> line<00:03:38.419> up<00:03:38.630> a

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
easier to weave the strings line up a

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.259 
easier to weave the strings line up a
little<00:03:38.900> better<00:03:39.079> so<00:03:39.590> as<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:39.829> can<00:03:39.919> see<00:03:40.060> before<00:03:41.060> I

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
little better so as you can see before I

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.479 
through the racket it gives you a little
more<00:03:59.090> space<00:03:59.720> as<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.769> can<00:04:00.829> see<00:04:01.099> you're<00:04:01.280> going

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
more space as you can see you're going

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.099 
more space as you can see you're going
from<00:04:01.760> that<00:04:01.970> much<00:04:02.150> space<00:04:02.419> instead<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:03.019> if

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
from that much space instead of if

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.289 
from that much space instead of if
you're<00:04:03.230> going<00:04:03.349> straight<00:04:03.650> across<00:04:04.090> using<00:04:05.090> that

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
you're going straight across using that

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.599 
you're going straight across using that
much<00:04:05.889> just<00:04:06.889> makes<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.129> go<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.310> little<00:04:07.459> bit

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
much just makes it go a little bit

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.129 
much just makes it go a little bit
faster<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.329> little<00:04:08.510> bit<00:04:08.629> easier<00:04:08.900> on<00:04:08.930> your

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
faster a little bit easier on your

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.500 
faster a little bit easier on your
fingers<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:10.700> have<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.849> little<00:04:11.090> bit<00:04:11.180> farther<00:04:11.389> to

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
fingers you have a little bit farther to

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.319 
fingers you have a little bit farther to
go<00:04:11.780> but<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.709> find<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.069> saves<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.400> little<00:04:13.639> time<00:04:13.819> in

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
go but I find it saves a little time in

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.770 
go but I find it saves a little time in
the<00:04:14.389> long<00:04:14.930> run<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:17.299> when<00:04:17.419> you're<00:04:17.539> pulling

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
the long run and when you're pulling

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.629 
the long run and when you're pulling
your<00:04:17.870> strings<00:04:18.229> you<00:04:19.010> definitely<00:04:19.370> don't<00:04:19.459> want

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
your strings you definitely don't want

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:20.620 
your strings you definitely don't want
to<00:04:19.669> pull<00:04:19.849> them<00:04:19.940> straight<00:04:20.269> across

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
to pull them straight across

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.740 
to pull them straight across
the<00:04:21.620> whole<00:04:21.769> time<00:04:22.010> like<00:04:22.250> this<00:04:22.460> what<00:04:23.389> I<00:04:23.449> like<00:04:23.599> to

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
the whole time like this what I like to

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.860 
the whole time like this what I like to
do<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.169> take<00:04:25.099> my<00:04:25.220> fingers<00:04:25.550> pull<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.630> string

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
do is take my fingers pull the string

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.170 
do is take my fingers pull the string
down<00:04:27.219> with<00:04:28.219> one<00:04:28.400> hand<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.820> then<00:04:28.909> with<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
down with one hand and then with the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.030 
down with one hand and then with the
other<00:04:29.210> hand<00:04:29.599> pull<00:04:30.409> them<00:04:30.560> across

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
other hand pull them across

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.270 
other hand pull them across
and<00:04:31.220> kind<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.550> bury<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.510> up<00:04:33.140> and<00:04:33.380> down<00:04:33.860> now<00:04:34.100> I'm

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
and kind of bury it up and down now I'm

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.030 
and kind of bury it up and down now I'm
see<00:04:34.460> not<00:04:34.640> especially<00:04:35.120> on<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.240> string<00:04:35.480> like<00:04:35.660> this

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
see not especially on a string like this

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.980 
see not especially on a string like this
on<00:04:37.040> this<00:04:37.190> poly<00:04:37.490> it's<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.120> tends<00:04:38.480> to<00:04:38.570> heat<00:04:38.780> up<00:04:38.810> a

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
on this poly it's it tends to heat up a

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.970 
on this poly it's it tends to heat up a
little<00:04:39.080> bit<00:04:39.260> when<00:04:39.380> you're<00:04:39.470> pulling<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.860> so

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
little bit when you're pulling it so

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.760 
little bit when you're pulling it so
don't<00:04:40.130> pull<00:04:40.280> it<00:04:40.310> too<00:04:40.400> fast<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:41.500> very<00:04:42.500> where

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
don't pull it too fast and very where

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.670 
don't pull it too fast and very where
the<00:04:42.890> string<00:04:43.160> is<00:04:43.190> going<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.660> that<00:04:44.780> wood<00:04:44.900> won't

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
the string is going and that wood won't

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.250 
the string is going and that wood won't
leave<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:45.950> with<00:04:46.100> any<00:04:46.250> burns<00:04:46.550> or<00:04:46.940> any<00:04:47.780> nicks<00:04:48.110> in

leave you with any burns or any nicks in

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.220 
leave you with any burns or any nicks in
your<00:04:48.350> string<00:04:49.600> okay<00:04:50.600> so<00:04:50.690> now<00:04:50.840> we<00:04:50.930> finish

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
your string okay so now we finish

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.050 
your string okay so now we finish
stringing<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.560> crosses<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.520> on<00:04:52.910> this

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
stringing the crosses and on this

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.180 
stringing the crosses and on this
particular<00:04:53.240> racket<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.230> calls<00:04:54.470> for<00:04:54.710> the

particular racket it calls for the

particular racket it calls for the
process<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.270> be<00:04:56.390> tied<00:04:56.630> off<00:04:56.660> on<00:04:57.050> ten<00:04:57.560> throat

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
process to be tied off on ten throat

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.240 
process to be tied off on ten throat
which<00:04:58.550> is<00:04:58.730> that<00:04:58.970> one<00:04:59.210> right<00:04:59.390> there<00:05:00.250> normally

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
which is that one right there normally

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.650 
which is that one right there normally
on<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.400> racket<00:05:01.700> you<00:05:01.850> can<00:05:01.970> tell<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.300> grommets

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
on the racket you can tell the grommets

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.130 
on the racket you can tell the grommets
will<00:05:02.780> probably<00:05:03.080> a<00:05:03.260> little<00:05:03.890> bit<00:05:04.130> larger<00:05:05.140> where

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
will probably a little bit larger where

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.980 
will probably a little bit larger where
the<00:05:06.290> tie<00:05:07.010> off<00:05:07.220> needs<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.700> be<00:05:07.850> at<00:05:08.030> or<00:05:08.780> if<00:05:08.870> you're

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
the tie off needs to be at or if you're

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.920 
the tie off needs to be at or if you're
unsure<00:05:09.140> you<00:05:09.380> can<00:05:09.800> go<00:05:10.010> to<00:05:10.270> babylon<00:05:11.270> website<00:05:11.750> now

unsure you can go to babylon website now

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.530 
unsure you can go to babylon website now
they<00:05:12.140> give<00:05:12.610> pretty<00:05:13.610> detailed<00:05:13.790> instructions

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
they give pretty detailed instructions

on how to string these rackets where the

tie offs are and whatnot so we're going
to<00:05:20.120> go<00:05:20.210> ahead<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.420> use<00:05:20.510> we're<00:05:20.660> going<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.840> use

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
to go ahead and use we're going to use

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.250 
to go ahead and use we're going to use
the<00:05:20.990> same<00:05:21.170> knot<00:05:21.490> we<00:05:22.490> used<00:05:22.670> on<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.060> other<00:05:23.390> three

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
the same knot we used on the other three

the same knot we used on the other three
tie<00:05:24.530> offs<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:25.180> go<00:05:26.180> ahead<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.450> get<00:05:26.510> this<00:05:26.720> done

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
tie offs and go ahead and get this done

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.140 
tie offs and go ahead and get this done
okay<00:05:27.280> so<00:05:28.280> now<00:05:28.430> we've<00:05:28.580> got<00:05:28.670> the<00:05:28.790> racket<00:05:29.060> all

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
okay so now we've got the racket all

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.560 
okay so now we've got the racket all
done

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
done

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.300 
done
I<00:05:29.600> just<00:05:30.320> finished<00:05:30.530> straightening<00:05:31.100> out<00:05:31.160> the

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
I just finished straightening out the

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.940 
I just finished straightening out the
strings<00:05:31.640> I<00:05:32.050> prefer<00:05:33.050> to<00:05:33.170> do<00:05:33.290> this<00:05:33.320> after<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:33.860> get

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
strings I prefer to do this after I get

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.150 
strings I prefer to do this after I get
done<00:05:34.310> with<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.730> racket<00:05:35.120> you<00:05:35.750> can<00:05:35.990> do<00:05:36.380> this<00:05:36.620> as

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
done with the racket you can do this as

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.520 
done with the racket you can do this as
you<00:05:37.370> go<00:05:37.580> or<00:05:38.300> after<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:38.990> get<00:05:39.140> done<00:05:39.290> I<00:05:39.350> just

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
you go or after you get done I just

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.690 
you go or after you get done I just
think<00:05:39.770> it's<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:39.890> little<00:05:39.980> bit<00:05:40.160> faster<00:05:40.490> just<00:05:40.520> to

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
think it's a little bit faster just to

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.880 
think it's a little bit faster just to
do<00:05:40.880> them<00:05:41.030> all<00:05:41.120> at<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.330> end<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.530> also<00:05:42.680> like

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
do them all at the end and I also like

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.200
