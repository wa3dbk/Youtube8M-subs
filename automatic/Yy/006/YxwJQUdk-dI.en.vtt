phantom flying wing with a PM to got six
and<00:00:08.389> went<00:00:09.389> through<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.599> process<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:10.260> pulling

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
and went through the process of pulling

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.400 
and went through the process of pulling
the<00:00:10.920> telemetry<00:00:11.309> log<00:00:11.730> data<00:00:12.030> off<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.750> after

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the telemetry log data off of here after

the telemetry log data off of here after
I<00:00:13.440> crashed<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:14.040> UAV<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.020> video<00:00:16.230> I

I crashed this UAV so in that video I

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.260 
I crashed this UAV so in that video I
showed<00:00:16.740> kind<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.190> diagnosis<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:18.210> you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
showed kind of the diagnosis of how you

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.700 
showed kind of the diagnosis of how you
look<00:00:18.539> through<00:00:18.750> some<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> data<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.560> I'm

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
look through some of the data and I'm

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890 
look through some of the data and I'm
still<00:00:19.980> learning<00:00:20.160> thank<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.180> guys<00:00:21.330> for<00:00:21.390> all

what<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.660> thought<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.080> wrong<00:00:25.289> there<00:00:25.769> was<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
what you thought was wrong there was a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.099 
what you thought was wrong there was a
guy<00:00:26.099> named<00:00:26.340> Eric<00:00:26.640> from<00:00:27.060> DIY<00:00:27.570> drones<00:00:27.869> who

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
guy named Eric from DIY drones who

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.810 
guy named Eric from DIY drones who
actually<00:00:28.260> downloaded<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> telemetry<00:00:29.400> blog

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
actually downloaded the telemetry blog

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.999 
actually downloaded the telemetry blog
that<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.119> posted<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.900> kind<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.619> came<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
that I posted and kind of came to the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.670 
that I posted and kind of came to the
same<00:00:32.219> conclusion<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.390> once<00:00:33.989> again<00:00:34.140> thank<00:00:34.590> you

for<00:00:34.800> looking<00:00:35.070> into<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.059> learned<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
for looking into that and I learned a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.360 
for looking into that and I learned a
lot<00:00:36.570> from<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.960> suggestions<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.250> that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
lot from your suggestions so in that

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.090 
lot from your suggestions so in that
video<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:39.180> led<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> believe<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
video I was led to believe that the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.030 
video I was led to believe that the
clevis<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.760> my<00:00:42.000> left<00:00:42.329> wing<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> culprit

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
clevis on my left wing was the culprit

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.369 
clevis on my left wing was the culprit
now<00:00:44.430> I've<00:00:44.579> ordered<00:00:44.850> some<00:00:45.000> metal<00:00:45.600> clevis<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
now I've ordered some metal clevis and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.930 
now I've ordered some metal clevis and
some<00:00:46.559> higher<00:00:46.739> end<00:00:46.770> ones<00:00:47.250> those<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> come

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
some higher end ones those how to come

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.439 
some higher end ones those how to come
in<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.539> shame<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.620> me<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.789> back<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
in so shame on me for going back to the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
in so shame on me for going back to the
films<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> nylon<00:00:52.170> class<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.399> what<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> did

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
films with a nylon class but what I did

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.240 
films with a nylon class but what I did
do<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.480> put<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.440> band<00:00:55.710> around<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
do is put a little band around the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.080 
do is put a little band around the
clevis<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:57.420> keep<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.500> clamped<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> hopefully

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
clevis to keep it clamped and hopefully

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
clevis to keep it clamped and hopefully
not<00:01:00.300> create<00:01:01.230> too<00:01:01.410> much<00:01:01.590> tension<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.280> rod

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
not create too much tension on that rod

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
not create too much tension on that rod
which<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.329> ultimately<00:01:03.510> broke<00:01:04.199> from<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
which is what ultimately broke from the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.219 
which is what ultimately broke from the
control<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.750> somewhat<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.080> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
control more so this is somewhat of a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.289 
control more so this is somewhat of a
Redemption<00:01:07.830> video<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> cut<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
Redemption video I'm going to cut to

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.510 
Redemption video I'm going to cut to

today<00:01:13.729> same<00:01:14.729> mission<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.740> flew<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.759> couple

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
today same mission that I flew a couple

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.270 
today same mission that I flew a couple
weeks<00:01:18.750> ago<00:01:18.869> where<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> thought<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.650> clevis<00:01:19.979> was

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
weeks ago where I thought the clevis was

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.999 
weeks ago where I thought the clevis was
broken<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.780> we're<00:01:21.780> getting<00:01:21.930> closer<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
broken so we're getting closer to the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.550 
broken so we're getting closer to the
point<00:01:23.400> where<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.390> crotch<00:01:24.659> happens<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.409> want

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
point where the crotch happens so I want

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.950 
point where the crotch happens so I want
to<00:01:25.619> watch<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.159> observe<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.750> learn

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to watch and observe and see if I learn

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
to watch and observe and see if I learn
anything<00:01:27.990> heading<00:01:29.390> north<00:01:31.220> into<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.460> little<00:01:32.579> bit

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
anything heading north into a little bit

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.760 
anything heading north into a little bit
of<00:01:32.880> wind<00:01:34.909> days<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.390> today<00:01:36.450> are<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:36.900> really

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
of wind days like today are just really

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.710 
of wind days like today are just really
perfect<00:01:38.549> doing<00:01:39.030> these<00:01:39.150> missions<00:01:39.570> there's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
perfect doing these missions there's

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.830 
perfect doing these missions there's
only<00:01:39.840> about<00:01:39.960> five<00:01:40.439> miles<00:01:40.650> an<00:01:40.829> hour<00:01:40.920> when<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.840> PM

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
only about five miles an hour when a PM

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
is keeping the Phantom nice and level

transmission lines can see them over
there<00:01:55.250> I'll<00:01:56.250> try<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.460> capture<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:58.219> you

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
there I'll try to capture this but you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.709 
there I'll try to capture this but you
can<00:01:59.369> definitely<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.909> that<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:01.070> UAV<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.719> way

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
can definitely see that the UAV is way

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.590 
can definitely see that the UAV is way
way<00:02:04.110> above<00:02:04.320> those<00:02:04.680> lines<00:02:05.009> were<00:02:06.000> flying<00:02:06.420> at

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
way above those lines were flying at

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.380 
way above those lines were flying at
about<00:02:07.819> 375<00:02:08.819> feet<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:10.760> my<00:02:11.760> guess<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.360> that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
about 375 feet and my guess is that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.700 
about 375 feet and my guess is that
those<00:02:12.780> lines<00:02:13.050> are

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
those lines are

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.800 
those lines are
definitely<00:02:14.460> less<00:02:14.610> than<00:02:14.790> 200<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.660> see

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
definitely less than 200 so you can see

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.350 
definitely less than 200 so you can see
it<00:02:15.900> banking<00:02:16.290> right<00:02:16.470> there<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:17.210> talk<00:02:18.210> about

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
it banking right there and talk about

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.600 
it banking right there and talk about
being<00:02:18.780> way<00:02:18.960> over<00:02:19.290> those<00:02:19.470> lemon<00:02:20.310> tree<00:02:20.430> looks

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
being way over those lemon tree looks

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.790 
being way over those lemon tree looks
good<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.300> have<00:02:21.800> ninety-seven

features about mission planner and

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.950 
features about mission planner and
telemetry<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.820> can<00:03:12.060> double<00:03:12.390> click<00:03:12.420> any<00:03:12.870> of

telemetry so you can double click any of

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.790 
telemetry so you can double click any of
these<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.620> then<00:03:14.520> select<00:03:15.390> what<00:03:16.140> parameter<00:03:16.680> you

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
want to display so let's just say want

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.720 
want to display so let's just say want
to<00:03:18.450> display<00:03:18.780> distance<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.440> home<00:03:19.620> click<00:03:20.550> that

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
to display distance to home click that

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.120 
to display distance to home click that
and<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.180> see<00:03:21.420> now<00:03:22.410> it's<00:03:22.590> updated<00:03:23.040> and

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
and you can see now it's updated and

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.940 
and you can see now it's updated and
we're<00:03:23.250> about<00:03:23.340> 500<00:03:23.850> meters<00:03:24.240> from<00:03:24.570> home<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:25.770> can

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
we're about 500 meters from home you can

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.780 
we're about 500 meters from home you can
see<00:03:26.190> we're<00:03:26.430> at<00:03:26.580> about<00:03:27.150> way<00:03:27.420> point<00:03:27.720> 30<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.790> then

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
see we're at about way point 30 and then

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.240 
see we're at about way point 30 and then
we're<00:03:29.970> coming<00:03:30.120> home<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:30.900> same<00:03:31.800> mission<00:03:32.130> is

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
we're coming home so same mission is

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.240 
we're coming home so same mission is
last<00:03:32.490> time<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.820> feel<00:03:32.970> much<00:03:33.210> better<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.250> still

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
last time I feel much better and still

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.790 
last time I feel much better and still
led<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.880> believe<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.330> clevis<00:03:36.660> was<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
led to believe the clevis was the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.280 
led to believe the clevis was the
culprit<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.760> hit<00:03:38.970> our<00:03:39.120> last<00:03:39.390> Waypoint<00:03:40.020> and

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
culprit just hit our last Waypoint and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.220 
culprit just hit our last Waypoint and
you<00:03:40.350> can<00:03:40.530> see<00:03:40.770> that<00:03:40.800> it's<00:03:41.810> making<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:43.020> beeline

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
you can see that it's making a beeline

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.110 
you can see that it's making a beeline
home<00:03:43.740> let's<00:03:44.040> take<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> look<00:03:44.490> see<00:03:44.670> if<00:03:44.700> we<00:03:44.820> can<00:03:44.940> see

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
home let's take a look see if we can see

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.880 
home let's take a look see if we can see
it<00:03:45.240> in<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.450> air<00:03:45.600> there<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.290> coming<00:03:46.680> right

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
it in the air there it is coming right

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.520 
it in the air there it is coming right
at<00:03:47.100> us<00:03:47.570> so<00:03:48.570> I'm<00:03:48.870> going<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.020> let<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.200> come<00:03:49.470> over

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
at us so I'm going to let it come over

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.110 
at us so I'm going to let it come over
loiter<00:03:50.130> for<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.390> one<00:03:51.630> loop<00:03:52.670> then<00:03:53.670> I'll

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
loiter for just one loop then I'll

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.320 
loiter for just one loop then I'll
switch<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.630> fly<00:03:54.840> by<00:03:55.050> wire<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.530> mode<00:03:56.090> take<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.210> to
