here's<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.080> Expo<00:00:04.770> Bar<00:00:04.980> Brutus<00:00:05.460> for<00:00:07.760> having<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
here's a Expo Bar Brutus for having a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.250 
here's a Expo Bar Brutus for having a
little<00:00:09.150> bit<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.480> problem<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.990> may<00:00:10.139> be

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
little bit of a problem I may be

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.720 
little bit of a problem I may be
somebody<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.860> knows<00:00:11.040> more<00:00:11.070> than<00:00:11.309> they<00:00:11.550> can

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
somebody that knows more than they can

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.029 
somebody that knows more than they can
figure<00:00:11.910> out<00:00:14.179> I<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.690> don't<00:00:15.990> seem<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.710> able<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
figure out I I don't seem to be able to

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.390 
figure out I I don't seem to be able to
get<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.810> brute<00:00:18.810> pressure<00:00:19.140> up<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.890> optimal

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
get the brute pressure up to the optimal

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.290 
get the brute pressure up to the optimal
eight<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.820> nine<00:00:21.029> bars<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:22.050> pressure<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.300> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
eight to nine bars of pressure and I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.509 
eight to nine bars of pressure and I
think<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.260> because<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.949> little<00:00:26.189> relief

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
think is because of this little relief

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
think is because of this little relief
valve<00:00:26.820> over<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:28.099> which<00:00:29.099> basically<00:00:30.650> seems<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
valve over here which basically seems to

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.380 
valve over here which basically seems to
be<00:00:32.870> discharging<00:00:33.890> lots<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.070> water<00:00:36.860> basically

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
be discharging lots of water basically

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.030 
be discharging lots of water basically
I'm<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.450> gonna<00:00:39.719> run<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.800> see<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I'm just gonna run it so you can see the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530 
I'm just gonna run it so you can see the
amount<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> water<00:00:41.550> that's<00:00:41.790> coming<00:00:42.059> down<00:00:42.329> from

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
amount of water that's coming down from

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.500 
amount of water that's coming down from
there<00:00:42.840> even<00:00:43.250> though<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> relief

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
there even though if this is a relief

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.670 
there even though if this is a relief
valve<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:46.050> shouldn't<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:49.230> should<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.530> no

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
valve it shouldn't be it should be no

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.130 
valve it shouldn't be it should be no
discharge<00:00:50.219> from<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:51.059> know<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:51.780> pressure

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
discharge from it we know back pressure

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.430 
discharge from it we know back pressure
on

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.389 

you<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> bit<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.420> warning

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
you see there's but a bit of warning

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.110 
you see there's but a bit of warning
I<00:00:59.230> also<00:01:00.230> know<00:01:00.590> this

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
I also know this

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.299 
I also know this
the<00:01:02.450> group<00:01:02.660> pressure<00:01:02.960> there's<00:01:03.920> no<00:01:04.070> coffee

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
the group pressure there's no coffee

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.209 
the group pressure there's no coffee
here

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.219

doesn't<00:01:05.939> mean<00:01:05.999> enjoy<00:01:06.179> a<00:01:06.299> tune<00:01:06.570> about

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
doesn't mean enjoy a tune about

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.480 
doesn't mean enjoy a tune about
both<00:01:08.180> wash<00:01:09.610> now<00:01:10.610> it's<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:10.940> quick<00:01:11.180> demo<00:01:12.310> this<00:01:13.310> is

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
both wash now it's a quick demo this is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.010 
both wash now it's a quick demo this is
about<00:01:13.730> a<00:01:13.790> one-month<00:01:14.570> old

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020

old and just want you guys to see the
the<00:01:51.080> fact<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.650> doesn't<00:01:51.860> go<00:01:52.130> up<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.430> drew

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
the fact that it doesn't go up to drew

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.280 
the fact that it doesn't go up to drew
pressure<00:01:52.910> and<00:01:53.300> I'm<00:01:53.570> going<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.810> see<00:01:54.110> the

there's enough amount of coffee I'm

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.500 
there's enough amount of coffee I'm
getting<00:02:44.520> actually<00:02:45.770> quite<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> bit<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.070> coffee

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
getting actually quite a bit of coffee

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.890 
getting actually quite a bit of coffee
it's<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.600> good<00:02:48.780> tamping<00:02:49.170> pressure<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:51.660> I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
it's a good tamping pressure and this I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.430 
it's a good tamping pressure and this I
also<00:02:52.110> not<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> notice<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.720> after<00:02:54.720> he<00:02:55.080> finishes

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
also not a notice that after he finishes

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.470 
also not a notice that after he finishes
brewing<00:02:56.040> that's<00:02:56.310> when<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.760> actual<00:02:57.210> pressure

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
brewing that's when the actual pressure

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.400 
brewing that's when the actual pressure
goes<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:59.000> so<00:03:00.000> maybe<00:03:00.570> somebody<00:03:00.900> with<00:03:01.200> some

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
goes up so maybe somebody with some

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.270 
goes up so maybe somebody with some
knowledge<00:03:02.100> better<00:03:02.760> than<00:03:02.970> mine<00:03:03.180> would<00:03:04.130> tell<00:03:05.130> me

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
knowledge better than mine would tell me

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.590 
knowledge better than mine would tell me
what<00:03:05.490> this<00:03:05.850> one<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.420> all<00:03:06.660> about<00:03:06.690> thank<00:03:07.440> you
