00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
me three different ones but I decided to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
me three different ones but I decided to
go<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.399> unfortunately<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
go with this one so unfortunately it is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
go with this one so unfortunately it is
quite<00:00:57.539> pricey<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.010> u.s.<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
quite pricey in the u.s. it is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.400 
quite pricey in the u.s. it is
thirty-eight<00:01:00.090> dollars<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.570> Sephora<00:01:00.960> witches

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
thirty-eight dollars at Sephora witches

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.529 
thirty-eight dollars at Sephora witches
it's<00:01:01.829> enough<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.640> least<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:03.030> more

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it's enough but at least it's more

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
it's enough but at least it's more
reasonable<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.290> Canada<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:04.949> forty-nine

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
reasonable in Canada it is forty-nine

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.870 
reasonable in Canada it is forty-nine
dollars<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.540> about<00:01:07.020> 50<00:01:07.409> bucks<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.860> what<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
dollars so about 50 bucks for what I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.280 
dollars so about 50 bucks for what I
first<00:01:09.210> thought<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:09.960> tiny

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
first thought is like for this tiny

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.320 
first thought is like for this tiny
little<00:01:10.470> thing<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.040> that's<00:01:11.729> ridiculous

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
little thing that's that's ridiculous

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.660 
little thing that's that's ridiculous
but<00:01:12.750> luckily<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> texture<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
but luckily because of the texture you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.450 
but luckily because of the texture you
actually<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.299> need<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:16.049> much<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.220> first

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
actually don't need that much the first

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.429 
actually don't need that much the first
time<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> used<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> put<00:01:18.540> way<00:01:18.869> too<00:01:18.900> much<00:01:19.080> out

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
time I used it I put way too much out

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
time I used it I put way too much out
because<00:01:19.770> i<00:01:19.860> put<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:20.460> hand<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.090> i<00:01:21.210> take

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
because i put on my hand and then i take

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.330 
because i put on my hand and then i take
it<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.780> put<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.200> my<00:01:22.350> face<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.100> probably

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it and put it on my face and I probably

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.120 
it and put it on my face and I probably
put<00:01:23.640> almost<00:01:23.909> double<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:26.009> like

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
put almost double so then I was like

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.760 
put almost double so then I was like
okay<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.610> least<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.840> spent<00:01:28.140> fifty<00:01:28.470> dollars

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
okay at least if I spent fifty dollars

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
okay at least if I spent fifty dollars
on<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> makes<00:01:29.310> sense<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.360> will

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
on it it makes sense because this will

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.330 
on it it makes sense because this will
actually<00:01:30.659> last<00:01:30.990> me<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> long<00:01:31.439> time<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:32.100> say<00:01:32.310> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
actually last me a long time they say I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340 
actually last me a long time they say I
mean<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> small<00:01:33.060> little<00:01:33.210> bottle<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
mean it's a small little bottle but it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
mean it's a small little bottle but it
will<00:01:34.799> actually<00:01:35.009> last<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.640> while<00:01:35.759> because

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
will actually last you a while because

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.730 
will actually last you a while because
you<00:01:36.210> only<00:01:36.390> need<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> very<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.350> bit<00:01:37.500> each

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you only need a very little bit each

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.310 
you only need a very little bit each
time<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.549> when<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> first<00:01:39.329> put<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.020> noticed

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
time so when I first put it on I noticed

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.460 
time so when I first put it on I noticed
that<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.860> very<00:01:41.189> mousse<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.229> it's<00:01:43.229> very

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that it's very mousse like it's very

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.520 
that it's very mousse like it's very
airy<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.340> light<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:46.110> blendable

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
airy and light and it's very blendable

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
airy and light and it's very blendable
as<00:01:46.740> well<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.250> once<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.180> blended<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
as well and once it's all blended and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.030 
as well and once it's all blended and
you<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:49.079> even<00:01:49.200> notice<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.860> you're

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you don't even notice that you're

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460 
you don't even notice that you're
wearing<00:01:50.369> any<00:01:50.579> foundation<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:52.290> I

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
wearing any foundation it's just as I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.039 
wearing any foundation it's just as I
say<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.250> lightweight<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.689> just

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
say it is really lightweight and it just

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.380 
say it is really lightweight and it just
makes<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.799> skin<00:01:56.070> feel<00:01:56.460> really<00:01:57.000> nice<00:01:57.149> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
makes your skin feel really nice and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
makes your skin feel really nice and
smooth<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.110> don't<00:01:58.350> feel<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> are

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
smooth and you don't feel that you are

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.520 
smooth and you don't feel that you are
wearing<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.520> heavy<00:01:59.670> foundation<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.350> is

wearing a heavy foundation and it is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.219 
wearing a heavy foundation and it is
very<00:02:01.710> buildable<00:02:02.549> i<00:02:02.880> found<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229

very buildable i found that to get the
full<00:02:04.530> coverage<00:02:05.340> i<00:02:05.610> had<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.090> build<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.600> twice<00:02:06.840> so

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
full coverage i had to build it twice so

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.839 
full coverage i had to build it twice so
i<00:02:07.079> had<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> put<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.890> then<00:02:07.950> specifically

in a couple extra spots i had to put
second<00:02:11.150> coat<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.989> um<00:02:12.650> but<00:02:12.980> because<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.580> is

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
second coat of it um but because it is

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
foundation so it is a matte foundation

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.690 
foundation so it is a matte foundation
but<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:54.799> doesn't<00:02:55.069> give<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.220> kind<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.519> that

but it doesn't give you kind of that
really<00:02:56.060> dull<00:02:56.450> plain<00:02:57.410> Matt<00:02:57.829> coverage<00:02:58.549> but<00:02:59.180> it

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
really dull plain Matt coverage but it

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.640 
really dull plain Matt coverage but it
doesn't<00:02:59.540> make<00:02:59.599> you<00:02:59.660> shine<00:02:59.989> either<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.530> it's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
doesn't make you shine either so it's

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.229 
doesn't make you shine either so it's
kind<00:03:00.859> of<00:03:00.920> it's<00:03:01.099> a<00:03:01.190> nice<00:03:01.459> amount<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:02.030> matte

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
kind of it's a nice amount of matte

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.780 
kind of it's a nice amount of matte
finish<00:03:03.170> now<00:03:03.530> I'm<00:03:03.739> always<00:03:03.920> hesitant<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.549> switch

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
finish now I'm always hesitant to switch

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.330 
finish now I'm always hesitant to switch
foundations<00:03:05.450> because<00:03:05.900> i<00:03:06.109> am<00:03:06.440> very<00:03:06.769> acne-prone

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
foundations because i am very acne-prone

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.059 
foundations because i am very acne-prone
so<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.000> don't<00:03:08.359> like<00:03:08.660> trying<00:03:09.140> something<00:03:09.349> new<00:03:09.560> in

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
so I don't like trying something new in

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.819 
so I don't like trying something new in
fear<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:10.640> gonna<00:03:10.760> break<00:03:11.060> out<00:03:11.269> my<00:03:11.420> skin

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
fear that it's gonna break out my skin

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.559 
fear that it's gonna break out my skin
but<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.859> reason<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.609> wanted<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.000> switch<00:03:14.359> was

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
but the reason I wanted to switch was

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.390 
but the reason I wanted to switch was
because<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:14.930> used<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.380> be<00:03:15.500> using<00:03:15.859> make<00:03:16.040> up<00:03:16.190> for

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
because I used to be using make up for

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.759 
because I used to be using make up for
ever<00:03:16.489> matte<00:03:16.849> velvet<00:03:17.090> plus<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:18.200> really<00:03:18.590> did

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
ever matte velvet plus and I really did

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.610 
ever matte velvet plus and I really did
love<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.970> just<00:03:20.209> worked<00:03:20.660> really<00:03:21.019> nicely<00:03:21.169> on

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
love it it just worked really nicely on

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.460 
love it it just worked really nicely on
my<00:03:21.769> skin<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> only<00:03:23.299> concern<00:03:23.810> was<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.440> that

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
my skin but the only concern was is that

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.550 
my skin but the only concern was is that
in<00:03:24.980> photographs<00:03:25.970> in<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.690> evening<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.410> would

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
in photographs in the evening it would

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.890 
in photographs in the evening it would
reflect<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.310> flash<00:03:28.639> from<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.060> camera<00:03:29.150> so

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
reflect the flash from the camera so

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.860 
reflect the flash from the camera so
much<00:03:30.169> that<00:03:30.829> even<00:03:31.280> if<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.299> rest<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.660> my<00:03:32.720> body

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
much that even if the rest of my body

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.569 
much that even if the rest of my body
was<00:03:33.139> tanned<00:03:33.410> like<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.769> was<00:03:34.069> looking<00:03:34.340> at<00:03:34.459> my
