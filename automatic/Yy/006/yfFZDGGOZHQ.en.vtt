treatment options that give them

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.590 
treatment options that give them
usually<00:01:00.130> very<00:01:00.460> good<00:01:00.640> results<00:01:01.030> these

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
usually very good results these

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.079 
usually very good results these
deformities<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.739> lot<00:01:03.370> of<00:01:03.489> times<00:01:03.670> happen

from trauma sometimes from cancer
resection<00:01:13.420> sometimes<00:01:14.020> from<00:01:14.200> radiation<00:01:14.620> and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
resection sometimes from radiation and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.190 
resection sometimes from radiation and
there<00:01:15.490> are<00:01:15.550> a<00:01:15.610> lot<00:01:15.760> of<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:16.180> variety<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.900> causes
