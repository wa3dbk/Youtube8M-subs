00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.990 
wasn't for the books that I've read and
I<00:03:10.260> am<00:03:10.380> 100<00:03:11.100> percent<00:03:11.130> believe<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.880> be<00:03:11.910> true

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
I am 100 percent believe that to be true

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.970 
I am 100 percent believe that to be true
I<00:03:12.180> think<00:03:12.330> every<00:03:12.780> book<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.500> take<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.740> little

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
I think every book you take a little

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.590 
I think every book you take a little
piece<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:14.610> becomes<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:15.300> when<00:03:15.480> you

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
piece of it and it becomes you when you

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.660 
piece of it and it becomes you when you
read<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.380> definitely<00:03:16.830> think<00:03:17.250> books<00:03:17.489> have

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
read it so I definitely think books have

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.000 
read it so I definitely think books have
benefitted<00:03:18.090> me<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.450> have<00:03:19.230> taught<00:03:19.530> me<00:03:19.739> things

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
benefitted me and have taught me things

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.660 
benefitted me and have taught me things
and<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.700> made<00:03:20.940> my<00:03:21.090> life<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.510> greater

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
and have made my life a greater

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.530 
and have made my life a greater
