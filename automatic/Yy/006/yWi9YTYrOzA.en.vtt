00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
they like and asks them to stop at a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.870 
they like and asks them to stop at a
card<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.010> card<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:38.430> going<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.670> be<00:03:38.790> an

card and that card is going to be an

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.570 
card and that card is going to be an
indicated<00:03:39.420> card<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.500> let's<00:03:40.950> say<00:03:41.220> they<00:03:41.340> stop

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
indicated card so let's say they stop

indicated card so let's say they stop
right<00:03:41.790> here<00:03:42.150> that's<00:03:42.900> an<00:03:43.200> indicator<00:03:43.620> card

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
right here that's an indicator card

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.650 
right here that's an indicator card
which<00:03:44.130> means<00:03:44.310> three<00:03:44.610> cards<00:03:44.970> down<00:03:45.209> will<00:03:45.450> be<00:03:45.570> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
which means three cards down will be the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.050 
which means three cards down will be the
prediction<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.830> three<00:03:47.220> cards<00:03:47.520> down<00:03:47.670> from<00:03:47.940> the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
prediction so three cards down from the

prediction so three cards down from the
three<00:03:48.360> one<00:03:49.050> two

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
three one two

three one two
the<00:03:50.580> third<00:03:50.820> card<00:03:51.120> down<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.720> ace<00:03:51.870> of

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
the third card down is the ace of

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.440 
the third card down is the ace of
diamonds<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.800> he<00:03:53.700> opens<00:03:54.030> up<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.270> envelope

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
diamonds and he opens up the envelope

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.650 
diamonds and he opens up the envelope
and<00:03:54.989> in<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.650> envelope<00:03:56.130> there<00:03:56.910> is<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.360> ace<00:03:57.480> of
