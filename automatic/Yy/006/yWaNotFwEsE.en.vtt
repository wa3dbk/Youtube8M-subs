00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.280
 today in our dessert court 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.650
 Christmas we are going to make cookies during 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.170
 the day decorated because it would not be Christmas 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.170
 yes the beautiful little tree biscuits and 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.690
 flakes and gingerbread mets we had 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.730
 that making those cookies are perfect 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.430
 for gifts they must beautiful in those 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.890
 transparent boxes with a bows and 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.490
 big blood red beautiful by 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.840
 example I made a pasture a tree like 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:45.290
 with snow I made the interpreters and they are 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.930
 little friends and also the snowflakes 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.730
 course and I put them to your remove as 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.220
 participate well shine 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.350
 and then let's start 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.380
 The first thing we are going to access is in a 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.880
 blender we are going to mix two bars of 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.880
 butter with sugar 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.140
 while this is mixing in another 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.380
 bowl let's put the ingredients 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.400
 dry that is flour and powder for 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.860
 to bake 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.550
 we are going to mix it a little bit and we are going to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.550
 set aside 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.700
 now to our butter mixture and 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.390
 sugar we are going to add vanilla 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.440
 and the almond extract 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.440
 the egg 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.479
 and so we should be staying in our 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.850
 mass right now we are going to 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.210
 add the dry ingredients a little to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.210
 bit 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.300
 so you must bring us closer to our mass not 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.400
 worry if they feel they are being 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.840
 crumbling right now that we started 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.840
 work is going to gather all 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.190
 and we are going to start extending it with 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.010
 the roller we want the cookies 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.720
 remain thick because if they do not remain 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.820
 skinny are going to burn in the oven 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.820
 then that has thick 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.020
 now if our cookies are ready 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.360
 for the oven we are going to put them from 6 to 8 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.470
 minutes depending on how crispy 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.470
 they like their cookies 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.490
 now if we can start doing our 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.890
 bitumen we go in an electric blender to 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.650
 put 3 egg whites at temperature 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.390
 environment and a little trickle of vanilla and what 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.210
 let's stir until it's in those 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.590
 little bubbles now if we are going to add 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.590
 the icing sugar 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.490
 and we're going to mix it until it's gone 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.490
 lumps and soft peaks remain 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.200
 Now we'll paint you can use 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.980
 dye gel or liquid colorant 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.069
 that you have 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.019
 and then they can put it in a cycle 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.200
 the truth if it's there in easy to do it 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.200
 A) Yes 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.820
 and now let your creativity fly and 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.139
 start decorating your cookies with more 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.139
 languages ​​like it 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:38.910
 First you can outline the cookies 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.440
 and then they add so much water to the bitumen 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.050
 just so there is a little more 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.530
 liquid and thus it is easier to fill 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.530
 cookies 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.580
 and I like it a lot because when 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.419
 until little time it will dry then 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.419
 it's perfect 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.030
 little ready they did not look beautiful me 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.139
 they love those cookies and they are perfect 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.289
 to give 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.860
 You can put them in these boxes 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.810
 transparent with a bow and they will 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.289
 love they will be super good 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.289
 gifts 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.660
 it's good that they liked them, I left them 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.340
 recipe down for anything and we 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.340
 we see in the next video bay
