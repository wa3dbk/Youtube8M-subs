check and make sure that this back bit

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.319 
check and make sure that this back bit
is<00:00:36.059> done<00:00:37.010> it's<00:00:38.010> clipped<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.460> there<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.120> is

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
is done it's clipped in there this is

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.180 
is done it's clipped in there this is
make<00:00:39.810> sure<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.050> clipped<00:00:40.380> in<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.680> side<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
make sure it's clipped in this side this

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.069 
make sure it's clipped in this side this
is<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> important<00:00:41.970> side<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.420> left-hand<00:00:42.840> side

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
is the important side the left-hand side

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.590 
is the important side the left-hand side
as<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:43.380> looking<00:00:43.470> to<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> trunk<00:00:44.600> because

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
as you're looking to the trunk because

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.540 
as you're looking to the trunk because
that's<00:00:46.310> microswitch<00:00:47.310> in<00:00:47.640> there<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.899> will

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
that's microswitch in there that will

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.830 
that's microswitch in there that will
make<00:00:50.550> sure<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:50.970> connecting<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.690> it

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
make sure that's connecting is it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.920 
make sure that's connecting is it
switches<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.230> micro<00:00:52.649> switch<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.750> okay

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
switches a micro switch in there okay

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.810 
switches a micro switch in there okay
so<00:00:55.470> make<00:00:55.680> sure<00:00:55.710> that's<00:00:56.160> pushed<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.670> way

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
so make sure that's pushed all the way

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.360 
so make sure that's pushed all the way
in<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.680> okay<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.820> fine<00:01:01.370> in

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
in on that okay so that's that's fine in

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:13.359 
in on that okay so that's that's fine in
neutral<00:01:04.070> handbrake<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:06.590> your<00:01:07.590> clips<00:01:09.170> are<00:01:10.170> both

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
hand brakes on the trunk compartment has

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.170 
hand brakes on the trunk compartment has
pushed<00:01:42.920> pushed<00:01:43.190> back<00:01:43.810> these<00:01:45.220> have<00:01:46.220> been<00:01:46.430> done

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
problem I have with Maya voxel tigre is

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.050 
problem I have with Maya voxel tigre is
that<00:03:24.510> I've<00:03:24.720> got<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.990> beeping<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:25.880> I've<00:03:26.880> done

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
that I've got the beeping and I've done

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.820 
that I've got the beeping and I've done
everything<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.630> did<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.959> latch<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.470> checked

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
everything I did the latch is checked

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.090 
everything I did the latch is checked
everything<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.520> I<00:03:30.060> still<00:03:30.300> got<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> beeping

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
everything and I still got the beeping

everything and I still got the beeping
so<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.130> figured<00:03:32.610> well<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.200> don't<00:03:34.200> particularly

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
so I figured well I don't particularly

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.170 
so I figured well I don't particularly
want<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.800> take<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> dealer<00:03:35.550> as<00:03:36.000> it's

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
want to take it to a dealer as it's

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.370 
want to take it to a dealer as it's
going<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.360> cost<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.660> lot<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.870> money<00:03:36.990> just<00:03:37.110> for

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
going to cost a lot of money just for

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.760 
going to cost a lot of money just for
them<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.560> check<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.870> anyway<00:03:40.320> when<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.620> went

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
them to check it so anyway when I went

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.400 
them to check it so anyway when I went
round<00:03:40.920> my<00:03:41.070> friend's<00:03:41.430> house<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.330> tested<00:03:42.990> a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
round my friend's house and we tested a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.560 
round my friend's house and we tested a
few<00:03:43.740> things<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.310> everything<00:03:44.910> had<00:03:45.180> just<00:03:45.209> kept

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
few things and everything had just kept

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.140 
few things and everything had just kept
on<00:03:46.340> checking<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> few<00:03:47.520> things<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.940> still

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
on checking a few things and still

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.990 
on checking a few things and still
didn't<00:03:48.360> work<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.950> was<00:03:50.069> gluing<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.400> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
didn't work and I was gluing the the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.970 
didn't work and I was gluing the the
boot<00:03:51.209> was<00:03:51.480> going<00:03:51.780> up<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.110> going<00:03:52.290> down<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.920> we

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
boot was going up and going down and we

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.140 
boot was going up and going down and we
were<00:03:53.100> checking<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:53.910> all<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> sudden

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
were checking this and all of a sudden

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.500 
were checking this and all of a sudden

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
it in and just bear in mind that when

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.770 
it in and just bear in mind that when
you<00:04:23.640> disconnect<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.090> battery<00:04:24.419> there<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.690> an

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
you disconnect the battery there is an

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.240 
you disconnect the battery there is an
alarm<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.229> goes<00:04:25.260> off<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:25.770> there's<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.040> special

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
alarm that goes off so there's a special

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.940 
alarm that goes off so there's a special
way<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.520> disconnecting<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.240> battery

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
way of disconnecting the battery

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.490 
way of disconnecting the battery
otherwise<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.130> sounder<00:04:29.550> goes<00:04:29.760> off<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.500> you

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
otherwise the sounder goes off and you

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.570 
otherwise the sounder goes off and you
might<00:04:31.680> want<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.890> check<00:04:32.040> in<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.220> book<00:04:32.370> first

sometimes when I drove away I mean for a
second<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.289> some<00:05:17.100> warning<00:05:17.490> about<00:05:17.910> something

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
second and some warning about something

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.240 
second and some warning about something

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
even tried the other battery started it

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.710 
even tried the other battery started it
up<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.860> revved<00:05:32.099> it<00:05:32.220> right<00:05:32.430> up<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.150> was<00:05:33.270> on
