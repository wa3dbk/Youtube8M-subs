and of course the big the big deal is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
and of course the big the big deal is
it's<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> two<00:01:08.729> square<00:01:09.060> base<00:01:09.299> big<00:01:09.810> old

it's on a two square base big old
cavalry<00:01:10.500> style<00:01:11.040> base<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:12.180> means<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.720> does

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
cavalry style base which means it does

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.830 
cavalry style base which means it does
it<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.560> considered<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> occupy<00:01:15.030> two<00:01:15.090> squares

two squares it is simply less

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.380 
two squares it is simply less
maneuverable<00:01:28.590> than<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> Fledermaus<00:01:29.840> or<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:32.390> SSU

square<00:01:36.990> bases<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:39.540> does<00:01:39.750> make<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> difference

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
square bases it does make a difference

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.219

make you have to think about your

the<00:02:19.940> building<00:02:20.360> it's<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.990> base<00:02:21.170> won't<00:02:21.440> allow

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
the building it's the base won't allow

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.780 
the building it's the base won't allow
you<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:22.010> do<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.750> bases<00:02:24.110> are<00:02:24.200> very

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
you to do it and the bases are very

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.680 
you to do it and the bases are very
loose<00:02:25.790> by<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.510> way<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.340> before<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.240> talk<00:02:29.480> about

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
loose by the way so before we talk about

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.090 
loose by the way so before we talk about
the<00:02:29.900> model<00:02:30.350> anymore

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
the model anymore

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.420 
the model anymore
the<00:02:31.970> actual<00:02:32.450> physical<00:02:34.390> edifice<00:02:35.390> here<00:02:36.430> maybe

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
the actual physical edifice here maybe

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.640 
the actual physical edifice here maybe
them<00:02:37.640> all<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:38.000> cha<00:02:38.210> there's<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:39.020> air<00:02:39.260> battle

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
them all in cha there's the air battle

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.410 
them all in cha there's the air battle
of<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.860> century<00:02:40.040> let's<00:02:40.790> look<00:02:41.120> at<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.930> stats

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
of the century let's look at the stats

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.790 
of the century let's look at the stats
actually<00:02:44.420> we'll<00:02:44.510> start<00:02:44.720> with<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> diving<00:02:45.350> topic

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
actually we'll start with a diving topic

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.140 
actually we'll start with a diving topic
that<00:02:45.950> was<00:02:46.040> mellowing<00:02:46.370> birdie<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.910> diving

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
that was mellowing birdie this is diving

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.210 
that was mellowing birdie this is diving

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
caliber machine gun which is kind of odd

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.260 
caliber machine gun which is kind of odd
to<00:02:55.850> say<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:57.740> 500<00:02:58.340> kilogram<00:02:58.640> bombs<00:02:58.910> which

to say and to 500 kilogram bombs which

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.450 
to say and to 500 kilogram bombs which
work<00:02:59.480> just<00:02:59.780> like<00:03:00.470> any<00:03:00.680> other<00:03:00.830> bombs<00:03:01.130> they're

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
work just like any other bombs they're

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.630 
work just like any other bombs they're
single-use<00:03:02.950> you've<00:03:03.950> got<00:03:04.100> air<00:03:04.280> superiority

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
single-use you've got air superiority

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.610 
single-use you've got air superiority
which<00:03:05.180> means<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.570> make<00:03:05.750> sustained<00:03:06.230> attacks

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
which means you make sustained attacks

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.350 
which means you make sustained attacks
you<00:03:07.040> make<00:03:07.220> all<00:03:07.430> attacks<00:03:07.850> made<00:03:08.120> against

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
you make all attacks made against

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.600 
you make all attacks made against
aircraft<00:03:08.540> or<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.110> there<00:03:09.290> as<00:03:09.500> as<00:03:09.650> far<00:03:09.860> as<00:03:10.400> if

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
aircraft or is there as as far as if

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.600 
aircraft or is there as as far as if
they're<00:03:10.820> sustained<00:03:11.270> attacks<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:12.350> it's<00:03:13.280> 59

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
they're sustained attacks and it's 59

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.380 
they're sustained attacks and it's 59
points<00:03:14.680> let<00:03:15.680> me<00:03:15.800> start<00:03:16.070> off<00:03:16.160> by<00:03:16.370> saying<00:03:16.580> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
points let me start off by saying the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.900 
points let me start off by saying the
bombs<00:03:17.630> are<00:03:17.960> very<00:03:18.230> powerful<00:03:18.530> in<00:03:19.070> situ<00:03:19.550> skull

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
bombs are very powerful in situ skull

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.310 
bombs are very powerful in situ skull
one<00:03:20.450> eight<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.920> cross<00:03:22.880> they're<00:03:23.660> very<00:03:23.990> powerful

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
one eight to cross they're very powerful

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.070 
one eight to cross they're very powerful
but<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.430> only<00:03:25.580> get<00:03:25.760> two<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.000> them<00:03:26.270> and<00:03:26.420> they

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
but you only get two of them and they

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.980 
but you only get two of them and they
are<00:03:27.110> only<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.680> range<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.220> one<00:03:28.460> and<00:03:31.720> despite<00:03:32.720> the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
are only a range of one and despite the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.560 
are only a range of one and despite the
power<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.740> bombs<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.310> just<00:03:35.060> don't<00:03:35.330> find

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
power of the bombs I just don't find

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.890 
power of the bombs I just don't find
them<00:03:35.750> as<00:03:35.990> useful<00:03:36.730> well<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:38.540> get<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> look<00:03:38.840> at

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
them as useful well you get a look at

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.830 
them as useful well you get a look at
the<00:03:38.990> bombs<00:03:39.200> we<00:03:39.590> come<00:03:39.770> over<00:03:39.800> here<00:03:39.980> we<00:03:40.810> have<00:03:41.810> a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
the bombs we come over here we have a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.620 
the bombs we come over here we have a
second<00:03:42.380> airplane<00:03:43.370> that's<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.060> bombs

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
second airplane that's the bombs

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.900 
second airplane that's the bombs
that's<00:03:45.080> the<00:03:45.320> rockets<00:03:45.740> this<00:03:46.550> is<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.760> aircraft

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
that's the rockets this is the aircraft

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.700 
that's the rockets this is the aircraft
with<00:03:47.510> its<00:03:47.630> landing<00:03:47.990> gear<00:03:48.050> out<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.410> know<00:03:48.590> you

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
with its landing gear out I know you

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.350 
with its landing gear out I know you
really<00:03:48.830> can't<00:03:49.070> see<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.580> landing<00:03:49.940> gear<00:03:50.150> very

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
really can't see the landing gear very

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.880 
really can't see the landing gear very
well<00:03:50.630> but<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:50.990> does<00:03:51.170> have<00:03:51.350> functioning

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
well but it does have functioning

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.940 
well but it does have functioning
landing<00:03:52.340> gear<00:03:52.610> which<00:03:53.120> we'll<00:03:53.330> talk<00:03:53.510> about<00:03:53.570> in<00:03:54.080> a

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
landing gear which we'll talk about in a

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.570 
landing gear which we'll talk about in a
minute<00:03:55.100> why<00:03:55.430> that's<00:03:55.700> not<00:03:57.190> not<00:03:58.190> really<00:03:58.340> that

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
minute why that's not not really that

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.900 
minute why that's not not really that
great<00:03:59.560> but<00:04:00.560> as<00:04:00.800> I<00:04:00.950> saying<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.400> bombs<00:04:01.580> are<00:04:01.760> very

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
great but as I saying the bombs are very

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.040 
great but as I saying the bombs are very
powerful<00:04:02.270> but<00:04:02.360> they<00:04:02.450> have<00:04:02.570> a<00:04:02.600> limited<00:04:02.720> range

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
powerful but they have a limited range

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.160 
powerful but they have a limited range
which<00:04:03.830> is<00:04:03.860> why<00:04:04.160> I<00:04:04.430> prefer<00:04:04.900> bellowing<00:04:05.900> birdie

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
which is why I prefer bellowing birdie

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.560 
which is why I prefer bellowing birdie
he<00:04:06.440> slipped<00:04:06.710> these<00:04:06.860> four<00:04:07.100> points<00:04:07.250> cheaper<00:04:07.820> his

he slipped these four points cheaper his
rockets<00:04:09.110> aren't<00:04:09.560> quite<00:04:09.920> as<00:04:10.190> powerful<00:04:10.460> against

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
rockets aren't quite as powerful against

rockets aren't quite as powerful against
armored<00:04:11.750> vehicles<00:04:12.200> they're<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:13.010> as

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
armored vehicles they're just as

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
powerful against a well they're not just

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.530 
powerful against a well they're not just
as<00:04:17.780> powerful<00:04:17.900> they're<00:04:18.260> nearly<00:04:18.620> as<00:04:18.710> powerful

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
as powerful they're nearly as powerful

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.280 
as powerful they're nearly as powerful

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.730 
of damage less here and there but
they're<00:04:32.780> powerful<00:04:33.260> enough

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
they're powerful enough

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.040 
they're powerful enough
you<00:04:33.890> have<00:04:34.070> no<00:04:34.280> difficulty<00:04:34.970> whatsoever<00:04:35.120> taking

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
you have no difficulty whatsoever taking

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.390 
you have no difficulty whatsoever taking
out<00:04:36.230> whatever<00:04:36.530> you're<00:04:36.800> shooting<00:04:37.130> at<00:04:37.280> with

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
out whatever you're shooting at with

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.620 
out whatever you're shooting at with
these<00:04:37.550> rockets<00:04:38.000> trust<00:04:38.300> me

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
these rockets trust me

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.130 
these rockets trust me
I<00:04:38.660> took<00:04:39.050> out<00:04:39.350> half<00:04:39.650> an<00:04:40.040> SS<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.240> army<00:04:41.750> with<00:04:41.930> only

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
I took out half an SS you army with only

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.870 
I took out half an SS you army with only
two<00:04:42.410> bellowing<00:04:42.920> birdies<00:04:43.280> it's<00:04:43.520> not

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
two bellowing birdies it's not

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.510 
two bellowing birdies it's not
impossible<00:04:45.190> especially<00:04:46.190> given<00:04:46.460> the

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
impossible especially given the

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.250 
impossible especially given the
advantage<00:04:46.820> of<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.300> ground<00:04:47.540> rockets<00:04:47.930> having<00:04:48.200> a

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
advantage of the ground rockets having a

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.300 
advantage of the ground rockets having a
range<00:04:48.440> of<00:04:48.650> three<00:04:48.980> this<00:04:49.640> allows<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:51.310> another

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
range of three this allows you another

range of three this allows you another
range<00:04:52.610> of<00:04:52.730> three<00:04:52.910> don't<00:04:53.060> seem<00:04:53.600> like<00:04:53.750> much<00:04:53.780> but

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
range of three don't seem like much but

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.250 
range of three don't seem like much but
it<00:04:54.290> allows<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.920> to<00:04:55.220> maneuver<00:04:55.720> more<00:04:56.720> to<00:04:56.990> your

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
it allows you to maneuver more to your

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.080 
it allows you to maneuver more to your
advantage<00:04:57.680> in<00:04:58.160> point<00:04:58.490> because<00:04:58.730> remember

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
advantage in point because remember

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.920 
advantage in point because remember
every<00:04:59.990> term<00:05:00.290> an<00:05:00.620> aircraft<00:05:01.190> without<00:05:01.430> hover<00:05:01.930> so

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
every term an aircraft without hover so

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.400 
every term an aircraft without hover so
this<00:05:03.380> plane<00:05:03.680> or<00:05:03.950> this<00:05:04.100> plane<00:05:04.960> has<00:05:05.960> to<00:05:06.230> make<00:05:06.380> a

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
this plane or this plane has to make a

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.200 
this plane or this plane has to make a
forced<00:05:06.860> move<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.250> helicopter<00:05:07.430> because<00:05:08.090> it

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
forced move the helicopter because it

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.080 
forced move the helicopter because it
has<00:05:08.360> hover<00:05:08.660> can<00:05:09.500> just<00:05:09.740> sit<00:05:10.280> in<00:05:10.370> one<00:05:10.550> place<00:05:10.580> it

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
has hover can just sit in one place it

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.360 
has hover can just sit in one place it
doesn't<00:05:11.270> have<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.690> move<00:05:11.840> every<00:05:12.170> turn<00:05:12.410> but<00:05:13.250> the

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
doesn't have to move every turn but the

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.860 
doesn't have to move every turn but the
fixed-wing<00:05:13.820> aircraft<00:05:14.000> have<00:05:14.540> to<00:05:14.690> make<00:05:14.840> a

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
fixed-wing aircraft have to make a

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.290 
fixed-wing aircraft have to make a
forced<00:05:15.380> move<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:16.340> you<00:05:16.400> need<00:05:16.730> to<00:05:16.880> plan<00:05:17.090> ahead

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
forced move so you need to plan ahead

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.080 
forced move so you need to plan ahead
for<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.230> that<00:05:19.220> little<00:05:19.520> bit<00:05:19.670> of<00:05:19.760> extra

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
for that and that little bit of extra

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.590 
for that and that little bit of extra
range<00:05:20.510> on<00:05:21.470> those<00:05:21.800> rockets<00:05:22.400> helps<00:05:23.210> you<00:05:23.390> plan

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
range on those rockets helps you plan

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.210 
range on those rockets helps you plan
ahead<00:05:23.750> because<00:05:24.200> you<00:05:24.290> don't<00:05:24.500> have<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.770> go<00:05:24.890> right

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
ahead because you don't have to go right

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.970 
ahead because you don't have to go right
up<00:05:25.400> on<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.760> enemy<00:05:26.180> and<00:05:26.440> then<00:05:27.440> when<00:05:27.830> you're

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
up on the enemy and then when you're

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.030 
up on the enemy and then when you're
forced<00:05:28.370> move<00:05:28.610> comes<00:05:29.000> along<00:05:29.830> you're<00:05:30.830> not

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
forced move comes along you're not

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.760 
forced move comes along you're not
sitting<00:05:33.370> face-to-face<00:05:35.170> with<00:05:36.170> something<00:05:36.440> like

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
sitting face-to-face with something like

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.150 
sitting face-to-face with something like
this<00:05:38.200> which<00:05:39.200> is<00:05:39.230> what<00:05:39.470> you<00:05:39.620> don't<00:05:39.770> want<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.040> be

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
this which is what you don't want to be

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.020 
this which is what you don't want to be
doing<00:05:40.310> I<00:05:41.590> mean<00:05:42.590> yes<00:05:42.830> this<00:05:43.580> thing<00:05:43.640> has<00:05:44.000> a

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
doing I mean yes this thing has a

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.850 
doing I mean yes this thing has a
limited<00:05:44.420> range<00:05:44.480> but<00:05:45.020> if<00:05:45.260> you<00:05:45.410> remember

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
limited range but if you remember

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.160 
limited range but if you remember
against<00:05:46.340> aircraft<00:05:46.880> all<00:05:47.150> that<00:05:47.600> all<00:05:47.840> weapons

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
against aircraft all that all weapons

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.300 
against aircraft all that all weapons
have<00:05:48.830> a<00:05:48.860> range<00:05:49.190> of<00:05:49.400> 6<00:05:50.650> because<00:05:51.650> aircraft<00:05:52.160> are

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
have a range of 6 because aircraft are

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.160 
have a range of 6 because aircraft are
so<00:05:52.430> speedy<00:05:55.060> so<00:05:56.060> that's<00:05:56.390> something<00:05:56.660> to<00:05:56.810> keep<00:05:57.020> in

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
so speedy so that's something to keep in

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.020 
so speedy so that's something to keep in
mind<00:05:57.230> that<00:05:57.650> that<00:05:58.160> little<00:05:58.370> bit<00:05:58.490> of<00:05:58.610> extra<00:05:58.790> range

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
mind that that little bit of extra range

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.520 
mind that that little bit of extra range
that<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.300> rocket<00:05:59.660> gives<00:05:59.840> you<00:05:59.990> gives<00:06:00.350> you<00:06:00.500> a

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
that the rocket gives you gives you a

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.290 
that the rocket gives you gives you a
lot<00:06:00.800> of<00:06:00.830> advantages<00:06:01.160> and<00:06:01.490> planning<00:06:01.910> where<00:06:02.120> the

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
lot of advantages and planning where the

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.660 
lot of advantages and planning where the
plants<00:06:02.690> going<00:06:02.900> to<00:06:03.020> fly<00:06:03.320> to<00:06:03.350> next<00:06:04.130> more<00:06:04.490> than

plants going to fly to next more than

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.800 
plants going to fly to next more than
anything<00:06:04.880> else<00:06:06.640> but<00:06:07.640> yeah<00:06:07.850> that's<00:06:08.060> my<00:06:08.270> bait<00:06:08.600> my

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
anything else but yeah that's my bait my

anything else but yeah that's my bait my
basic<00:06:09.230> verdict<00:06:09.650> on<00:06:09.830> the<00:06:09.980> aircraft

basic verdict on the aircraft
bellowing<00:06:11.240> birdie<00:06:11.630> is<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:12.050> way<00:06:12.170> to<00:06:12.230> go<00:06:12.440> I<00:06:12.680> know

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
bellowing birdie is the way to go I know

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.310 
bellowing birdie is the way to go I know
I'm<00:06:13.790> not<00:06:13.940> going<00:06:14.480> into<00:06:14.750> a<00:06:14.780> huge<00:06:15.050> amount<00:06:15.110> of

I'm not going into a huge amount of

I'm not going into a huge amount of
detail<00:06:15.440> but<00:06:15.890> I<00:06:16.930> I'm<00:06:17.930> fielding<00:06:18.380> -<00:06:18.560> bellowing

support<00:06:25.000> now<00:06:26.000> let's<00:06:26.210> talk<00:06:26.360> a<00:06:26.420> little<00:06:26.510> bit

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
support now let's talk a little bit

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.880 
support now let's talk a little bit
about<00:06:27.170> the<00:06:27.380> model<00:06:27.710> itself<00:06:29.230> here<00:06:30.230> you<00:06:30.500> can<00:06:30.650> see

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
about the model itself here you can see

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.820 
about the model itself here you can see
they<00:06:31.220> have<00:06:31.750> vectored<00:06:32.750> thrust<00:06:32.780> on<00:06:33.350> the<00:06:33.440> engines

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
they have vectored thrust on the engines

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.000 
they have vectored thrust on the engines
that<00:06:34.010> actually<00:06:34.520> move<00:06:34.820> and<00:06:35.390> they<00:06:36.350> have<00:06:36.530> landing

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
that actually move and they have landing

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.930
