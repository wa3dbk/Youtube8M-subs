well and you really feel the performance

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.900 
well and you really feel the performance
on<00:06:15.630> them<00:06:15.780> is<00:06:16.230> because<00:06:16.470> of<00:06:16.800> the<00:06:16.920> custom<00:06:17.370> silicon

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
on them is because of the custom silicon

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.750 
on them is because of the custom silicon
that<00:06:18.600> we<00:06:18.870> designed<00:06:19.260> for<00:06:19.410> this<00:06:19.650> product<00:06:20.220> that
