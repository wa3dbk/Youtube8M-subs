00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.240
 cheap duck 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.920
 day 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.090
 and so with girls or people people 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.100
 only many of you are 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.920
 asking exactly what is this 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.070
 video and a little bit of what is going so that 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.150
 has entered us yet in this video is going to go 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.919
 a little bit about my first 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.930
 impressions of what is being 1.7 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.790
 point 2 considering that I've seen 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.950
 a video of more or less an hour and some 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.180
 more analysis than another about this 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.070
 update I'm going to my impressions 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.239
 I'm going to be a few things, nothing more 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.130
 open the world that you are already seeing 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.260
 you and I'm going to tell you this is the most 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.640
 updates look now you can see 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.230
 this for for the particles that is a 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.520
 of the things that they have also added and 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.810
 I like it well you can see the cane 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.370
 sugar that has different color that is 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.960
 adapts the different biomes and how 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.250
 this nonsense thousands and others by 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.470
 example the red flowers you see that they are 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.600
 different and the yellow ones that are 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.540
 there I think that this is also a new 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.550
 tree is not a nickname this is new this 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.510
 comes minecraft from now on and the 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.640
 truth is that it is quite impressive 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.310
 is the update that has most 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.300
 surprised and more I liked 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.650
 minecraft so I do a review 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.750
 because good the radio did not fall more 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.310
 review reviews we go from this that 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.750
 it has to last an hour and a half and without 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.070
 However, I think there are very good channels 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.830
 of minecraft have made some reviews and not 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.560
 I need to do it, therefore, as 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.420
 commented my raw evaluations is the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.130
 better expansion there are the best parents 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.160
 that using the sims the best 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.780
 minecraft update that I have lived 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.820
 me and well I think it's the improvement 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.800
 includes a lot of things for example 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.979
 If we go to the model it is different is 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.869
 this does not know how well I see me 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.810
 and the other youtubers I imagine that 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.119
 they have also really put a lot 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.950
 of new things both new food and 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.020
 new fish like 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.030
 new blocks that are crystals that yes 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.299
 woods the wood is going also changes 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.579
 a little bit to see is one thing really 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.380
 amazing some biomes guys 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.030
 this is a biome I do not know which one this 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.390
 I imagine that it must be like this one from samanÃ¡ 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.490
 of savannah or I know but there are a lot 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.780
 are a lot the biomes that incorporates 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.269
 see if I touch now an island of these 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.610
 who they have nothing and I gave a sack 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.360
 but good 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.640
 look and go down there in chad jejejejeje 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.000
 in order where I am good because it is 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.890
 amazing is really the expansion that 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.790
 why do I say expansion is good I say 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.620
 expansion because I imagine that as 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.470
 so many updates my head says in 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.010
 his head is an expansion but good is 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.180
 an update that gives a lot of play 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.620
 right now you are seeing only this 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.690
 no but it is that it includes a lot of 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.470
 things we can do now too 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.140
 gigantic forest trees 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.230
 snowed and incorporates many new features 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.400
 and I was very pleasantly surprised I do not know 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.299
 you who have appeared this and 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.490
 I also do it to see you 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.280
 impressions you liked as 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.020
 given some loss of performance apart 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.050
 I think that right now maybe 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.090
 this is not true but it sounds to me that 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.550
 now there are no no lighting books 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.710
 that I do not know if it's true it sounds like me 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.360
 yes but I want it and I think it 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.270
 there are not them is to say now it should be seen 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.500
 all perfect the truth a 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.450
 amazing update on everything 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.550
 for the issue of biomes that are new 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.940
 very many apart also includes a 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.650
 world rendering mode which 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.000
 it makes you a super big world all 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.070
 the truth that I'm not interested in 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.500
 a lot because the truth is to go from one place to 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.150
 another one would be quite difficult and it will be 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.920
 quite complicated not to play in this 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.800
 type of modality but good here you see 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.140
 another biome this this is the typical one seems 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.610
 be but good is a lot 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.440
 biomes that includes let's get into 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.750
 creative 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.300
 ok so I can not I'll open the land and 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.820
 I'm going to allow tricks, let's go to 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.320
 close to one and we will see a little bit 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.310
 above what has generated the 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.330
 world and we meet the 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.760
 different than just us 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.200
 we would find to begin with as I say 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.880
 there is not little lighting that that 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.000
 love there are these kinds of flowers that 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.880
 you can see they are kind of pokemon berries that 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.950
 they grow from top to bottom and good we 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.830
 they leave the flower itself so that's why 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.710
 but well this is just the beginning 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.090
 a lot of little things is really 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.100
 amazing has surprised me very 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.050
 pleasantly here you can see how many looks 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.090
 you see if you have enough distance 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.500
 you do all the particles and here 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.640
 let's see flowers of these now all 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.890
 now there are different flowers of 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.330
 Many colors and each flower gives you a 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.610
 different dye is to say you do not have to 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.890
 go to one place to another only that you do not 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.060
 there is white dye in the sense of 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.430
 flower is still the dye of the descent 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.440
 of fps is giving me just follow 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.540
 being in the bone powder dye 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.340
 there is not a white dye flower that 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.350
 let's say but well here you see another 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.690
 biome this one I do not find it in 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.830
 a normal minecraft both flavors 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.930
 whites 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:53.180
 but never in my life you see here all 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.920
 together all of them here we can see look 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.480
 mushrooms out there there is a biome that I 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.610
 love to see if I find it before 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.350
 finish the video and really this is a 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.660
 video to give you my impressions that are 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.250
 good is the best performance I've seen 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.960
 never last night a review because as I have 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.690
 said I think that they have already done very 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.970
 good reviews and I do not know I do not know about you 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.680
 but I would like to know what you think of the 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.900
 stream there you go some white flowers but 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.180
 this is not white but it is light gray 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.950
 there is no white with the flowers I do not know if 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.600
 they will put there are colorful crystals that 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.520
 love that 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.140
 There also have condensed ice 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.790
 also improved the ice have put that 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.890
 for example the portals can be 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.600
 different measures is to say a lack 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.310
 that are 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.780
 squares that more good 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.430
 rectangular as they wanted but 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.930
 for bridges in other ways and that 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.400
 pleasantly surprised here let's see 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.280
 another type of biome this will not be resolved 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.080
 generate in this way has not been seen 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.480
 never but I do not know in this way so 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.400
 strange as no no no I do not know is 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.650
 really amazing I do not know about you 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.020
 what will it offer to me this surprises me very 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.330
 pleasantly it gives me very good I do not know to me 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.100
 every time they update something and they do 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.800
 for good and not just improve things 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.800
 I do not know editorial you really think 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.910
 missing for example the 1.6 point 4 there 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.590
 many that are not good for anything makes me 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.090
 this how nice look how good it kills 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.520
 monkey to make us a house or a 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.870
 series and starting here you could was a 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.980
 volcano as you see 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.289
 but hey, look at how nice text is 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.979

 today I wanted to take a look 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.639
 apart I am also thinking about doing 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.749
 some survival series and I do not know if 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:41.509
 do it enough in some only one 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:43.309
 thing or put mods I have no idea 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.709
 I'm thinking exactly what to do and 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:47.300
 good also depends on you 

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:49.009

 towards guys like that a video a bit 

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.069
 different since I think it's the first 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:00.439
 so I make some first impressions 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:01.819
 of something but good I do not know you that 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.909
