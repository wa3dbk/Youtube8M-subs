00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.690
 much deeper and welcome to 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.059
 19 episode of our pack road to glory 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.440
 Today it is a special episode we 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.940
 Only pax thien will be seen today 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.670
 already a dazzling team of the bottom right 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.500
 to draw year are the case cristiano 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.529
 Ronaldo and Lionel Messi but we 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.279
 get yes there might already with 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.529
 Introduce spec 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.330
 but then we pulled chico 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.750
 its defender from the premier 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.329
 league and lana is a four star 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.520
 Scilla will also come to us 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.350
 now here are the contract cards two 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.010
 Add more and we will 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.360
 Selling 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.100
 otherwise we can not do the rest 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.500
 Use is just mist it that would be 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.579
 Do not drop before we pack the next one 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.070
 we will take a look 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.810
 Throw on the exchange stack because we 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.580
 have sold a lot 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.470
 and before we get it all here 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.900
 we can not delete any players either 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.120
 or cards have to be so satisfied 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.960
 We'll do it all away 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.760
 I have that a bit more now 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830
 it's just going to be too fast for us 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.900
 take a long time 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.170
 and yes come now to the next 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.480
 patch today you will only 7500 textile 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.630
 because if we have the 15,000 shares on 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.310
 just to pull less packs and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.150
 so come to the next day and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.030
 there we are in there 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.760
 cesc fábregas the central 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.800
 midfielder of barcelona real 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.810
 awesome aspect you have to say yes 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.240
 already good player good passwords the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.280
 educator three stars it is considered three stars 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.360
 we can force weak feet on 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.100
 we still need every case 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.590
 forward and liked the coming 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.030
 both of course, too 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 In addition, yes we are displaced 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.720
 of course, everyone is back on the pile 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.930
 then I see and deliver 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.160
 there is still a silver fitness 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.420
 captain five times 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.250
 will certainly be a bit more 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.290
 take the rest of the off and then 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 we also come directly to the next pack 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.119
 We have lionel messi in and out 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.580
 But we have gündogan 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.360
 Well, so from the stars really 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.280
 good and yes look at that one on there 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.530
 still looks like Crete to 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.080
 right-back from chelsea so in 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.179
 kaluga four stars weak 5 4 stars 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.130
 skills of the boy of the real talents it 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.060
 simply on it comes to us can we 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.490
 definitely use 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.710
 otherwise but then still contract cards 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.710
 on Mars, of course, and then there we have 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.690
 nor 4000 coins and another 3421 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.510
 card that one can use for the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.000
 Defender because it is better with 44 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.900
 All three of us have one chain 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.430
 play with three formation 352 and 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.480
 also come directly to the next pack and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.459
 there htc brings tasci serdar tasci from 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.080
 is it stuttgart today yes it is 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.910
 Stuttgart we have then in 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.030
 other players from the Spanish league 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.360
 Of course, Noranda Hassli will come too 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.069
 to 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.050
 yes only a lot of players I guess we 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.430
 will definitely be several teams 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.530
 and then you can someday 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.780
 say with which we play with it 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.030
 I should have a fitness card here 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.700
 and one more and then there was one more 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.530
 umts card and still tremoulinas the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.379
 syndicate we look there we have 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.010
 another 4 4 2 4 3 2 1 better of that 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.950
 Formally this time he comes to it and the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.019
 he just comes back and weighs 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.459
 now come through to the next day 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.590
 yes I said many packs again 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.670
 pull and that 's nothing we have 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.709
 Inside, Monday Julia reads that exactly 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.480
 from ac milan 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.739
 who actually has a pretty good network 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.120
 then we have here 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.579
 other players we still have 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.129
 Bocchetti he's got in any case 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.560
 good fight and fast 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.360
 head strength but parts come 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.930
 must first again on the exchange 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.549
 stack in addition and here otherwise for 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.409
 Some do not even really need anything 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.360
 That's why we put the whole shit here 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.180
 and come directly to the next one 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.260
 pack and there we have people in there now 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.510
 Who have we have the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.860
 we have petrow that looks now the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.900
 especially good and yes you in the pet 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.250
 In any case , really everyone 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.250
 we still need players here 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.610
 no idea plays in any case 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.540
 We can possibly galatasaray 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.190
 I think so use one 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.629
 care canada need is indeed the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.669
 only team out of warmth the 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.430
 maybe that 's why of the 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.019
 nation if we need it 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.419
 otherwise we can now here the times 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.400
 whole moral card so that we too 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.130
 a good moral have for next game 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.840
 of which we are not scenes in this episode 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.130
 will be only about seven 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.940
 I'll take you for that 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.330
 promise that the next episode on 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.919
 victoria arrives on Monday and will be there 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.690
 Of course we also play a game 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.000
 has exactly as we also very again 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.560
 many packs will be pulling 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.460
 there is definitely on monday criticism 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.680
 drawn to it like now 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.660
 very good left-back from the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.209
 Russian league I think that was now 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.929
 what was 

00:04:54.209 --> 00:05:00.759
 which is now the team after that 

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:02.319
 absolutely card plus 10 rami gets the 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.800
 perhaps wanted a little bit 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.399
 more quickly 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.559
 the rest will just drop us off and 

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:11.019
 to the next patch dirt so hard 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:14.229
 have it on and in here 

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:15.339
 we have nasri samir nasri of 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.499
 manchester city 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:20.110
 this is the second big player 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:21.699
 which we have samir nasri who has in it 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.039
 but four star skills and four stars 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.449
 weak foot 84 speed and his 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.739
 also does not succeed badly so 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.979
 We can definitely see 

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:32.409
 broken after patras discovers the two 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.909
 thick fish at the angel and otherwise 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.739
 we still have it loose 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.999
 he also comes to contract cards 

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:38.169
 again on mars all come on the 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:39.999
 Exchange of the appeal will now be direct 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.429
 also make a bit faster 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:46.899
 since we have not done much for a long time 

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:48.659
 and then we have another three 

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:51.939
 parties will definitely be there 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.319
 soldo I had to feel it already 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.509
 That's why I have myself before 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:58.179
 Sorry so we have now 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.199
 here's a moral card you can do it 

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:01.269
 we do not need that because of that 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.629
 also directly to the next pack and have 

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:04.719
 in it 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:06.069
 it is elia from werder bremen to sterns 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.059
 We can definitely do that killer 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.129
 also use 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:12.020
 in the left middle field and 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.789
 star killer three star feeble feet 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.929
 set so optimally but five stars 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.199
 skills what do you want more 

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:19.999
 his dribbling phenomenal and yes the 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.919
 contract garden nothing more 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:23.209
 say these contract cards have it 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.309
 just way too many 

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:27.019
 I think it's good if we have a few 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:27.469
 more players go instead of distributed 

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.929
 race 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:32.059
 Well you can it fell on my 

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:34.279
 question comes is the question at ea 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.889
 we also come to the next pack and it 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:40.550
 is in it 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:42.769
 jeff jarvis is of west ham united 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.899
 that I still have tips in the left midfield 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:46.729
 years later then we can look at each one 

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:48.830
 fall use five stars weak foot 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.559
 it looks very good and there is also 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.990
 no bad he has good pace - 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:58.429
 defender and that's it too 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:59.569
 it was there, people will be that's it then 

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:01.249
 also from the episode 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.499
 I promised you on Monday 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:05.209
 In any case, the next one comes there 

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:05.659
 will also pack a lot again 

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:07.009
 pull 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:10.839
 and I hope I liked it myself 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.839
 I am now good at housing until then
