00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
running team but there's no reason why

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.520 
running team but there's no reason why
we<00:02:10.590> should<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.459> able<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.239> back<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.020> we

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
we should not be able to get back and we

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.790 
we should not be able to get back and we
did

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
did

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
did
for<00:02:14.010> most<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.610> last<00:02:14.940> 10<00:02:15.900> minutes<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.290> the
