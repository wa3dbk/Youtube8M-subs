00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
this is the normandy sr one from mass

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.769 
this is the normandy sr one from mass
effect<00:00:19.190> she<00:00:20.190> has<00:00:20.550> been<00:00:20.760> here<00:00:20.970> before<00:00:21.000> she<00:00:21.300> was

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
effect she has been here before she was

effect she has been here before she was
here<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.200> 2010<00:00:22.740> which<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.760> pretty<00:00:23.940> exciting

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
here in 2010 which is pretty exciting

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.609 
here in 2010 which is pretty exciting
since<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> first<00:00:25.080> show<00:00:25.200> that<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.410> went

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
since this is the first show that I went

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.800 
since this is the first show that I went
to<00:00:25.770> so<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.490> good<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.820> back

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
to so this is it's good to be back

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.269 
to so this is it's good to be back
she<00:00:28.290> took<00:00:28.470> about<00:00:28.800> 250<00:00:29.490> hours<00:00:29.520> to<00:00:30.360> construct

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
she took about 250 hours to construct

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.340 
she took about 250 hours to construct
over<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> period<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.730> about<00:00:32.990> three<00:00:33.990> or<00:00:34.170> four

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
over the period of about three or four

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.660 
over the period of about three or four
months<00:00:34.620> something<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.280> couple

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
months something like that a couple

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.410 
months something like that a couple
months<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.320> she's<00:00:38.070> been<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.490> three<00:00:39.210> shows

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
months and she's been to three shows

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.810 
months and she's been to three shows
this<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> third<00:00:39.930> show<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.670> one

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
this is a third show this is the one

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.750 
this is a third show this is the one
behind<00:00:41.970> is<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:42.560> Norman<00:00:43.560> ESR<00:00:43.830> -<00:00:44.010> from<00:00:44.640> Mass

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760

Effect<00:00:45.060> 3<00:00:45.120> she's<00:00:45.900> about<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> same<00:00:46.500> 250<00:00:47.070> hours

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
Effect 3 she's about the same 250 hours

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.680 
Effect 3 she's about the same 250 hours
but<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:47.790> I<00:00:47.820> knew<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.150> was<00:00:48.270> doing<00:00:48.510> more

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
but because I knew what I was doing more

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
but because I knew what I was doing more
it<00:00:49.470> took<00:00:49.620> less<00:00:49.830> time<00:00:51.260> she<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:53.160> shown<00:00:53.370> in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it took less time she was first shown in

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.850 
it took less time she was first shown in
Texas<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.150> 2013<00:00:54.720> built<00:00:55.200> for<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.380> show<00:00:55.590> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
Texas in 2013 built for that show so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.630 
Texas in 2013 built for that show so
that's<00:00:56.070> pretty<00:00:56.280> exciting

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that's pretty exciting

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.880 
that's pretty exciting
oh<00:00:56.790> yeah<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:57.810> these<00:00:57.900> are<00:00:57.960> both<00:00:58.290> incredible

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
oh yeah and these are both incredible

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.410 
oh yeah and these are both incredible
ships<00:00:59.190> here<00:00:59.430> when<00:00:59.640> you're<00:00:59.760> working<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.180> these

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
ships here when you're working on these

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.120 
ships here when you're working on these
where<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> inspiration<00:01:01.650> as<00:01:02.100> far

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
where do you get the inspiration as far

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.740 
where do you get the inspiration as far
as<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.520> looking<00:01:02.790> at<00:01:02.880> maybe<00:01:02.970> screen<00:01:03.330> shots<00:01:03.600> or

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
as like looking at maybe screen shots or

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.820 
as like looking at maybe screen shots or
something<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.140> how<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.259> you<00:01:04.379> decide<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
something or how do you decide the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.560 
something or how do you decide the
design<00:01:05.100> well<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.640> treat<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
design well I treat it for this one I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.940 
design well I treat it for this one I
actually<00:01:06.810> rip<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> model<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> game

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
actually rip the model out of the game

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.800 
actually rip the model out of the game
and<00:01:08.670> spun<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.150> around<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.570> viewer<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and spun it around in the viewer and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.570 
and spun it around in the viewer and
took<00:01:10.020> some<00:01:10.170> pictures<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:11.100> was<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> little

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
took some pictures so this was a little

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.999 
took some pictures so this was a little
harder<00:01:11.850> there's<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.600> guy<00:01:12.750> who<00:01:12.810> takes<00:01:13.680> very

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
harder there's a guy who takes very

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.980 
harder there's a guy who takes very
high-resolution<00:01:14.399> pictures<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
high-resolution pictures with the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.639 
high-resolution pictures with the
original<00:01:16.350> game<00:01:16.499> assets<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:18.170> puts<00:01:19.170> them<00:01:19.289> on<00:01:19.439> on

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
original game assets and puts them on on

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.520 
original game assets and puts them on on
a<00:01:20.340> DVR<00:01:21.179> and<00:01:21.359> so<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> grabbed<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.289> took

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
a DVR and so I grabbed that and took

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
a DVR and so I grabbed that and took
some<00:01:22.679> measurements<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.159> that's<00:01:23.939> where<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.179> did

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
some measurements and that's where I did

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.459 
some measurements and that's where I did
most<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.549> sizing<00:01:26.549> work<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:28.140> how<00:01:28.319> do<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
most of the sizing work and how do you

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.169 
most of the sizing work and how do you
decide<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.039> scale<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.579> these<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.969> don't

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
decide the scale for these then I don't

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.340 
decide the scale for these then I don't
know<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> original<00:01:31.020> scale<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
know it was this the original scale you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.779 
know it was this the original scale you
were<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.219> build<00:01:32.429> it<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.640> kind

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
were going for as you build it you kind

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.599 
were going for as you build it you kind
of<00:01:32.819> expand<00:01:33.149> it<00:01:33.359> or<00:01:33.479> made<00:01:33.569> it<00:01:33.689> smaller<00:01:33.929> so<00:01:34.609> the

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
of expand it or made it smaller so the

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.669 
of expand it or made it smaller so the
sr1<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.149> sort<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.569> picked<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> scale<00:01:37.469> that<00:01:37.649> I

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
sr1 I sort of picked the scale that I

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:38.719 
sr1 I sort of picked the scale that I
thought<00:01:37.920> would<00:01:38.039> work<00:01:38.069> with<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.429> technique

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
thought would work with the technique

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.629 
thought would work with the technique
best<00:01:38.999> and<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.990> nor<00:01:40.139> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.289> sr2<00:01:40.679> is<00:01:40.829> built<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:41.639 
best and the nor of the sr2 is built to

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:43.789 
best and the nor of the sr2 is built to
scale<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.999> the<00:01:42.119> sr1<00:01:42.389> and<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.289> can<00:01:43.439> guarantee

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
scale with the sr1 and I can guarantee

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.709 
scale with the sr1 and I can guarantee
you<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.549> weren't<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.819> case<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.569> not

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
you if that weren't the case I would not

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.120 
you if that weren't the case I would not
have<00:01:45.810> built<00:01:45.960> her<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.139> big<00:01:46.319> because<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
have built her as big because it was a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.359 
have built her as big because it was a
disaster<00:01:48.109> so<00:01:49.109> I<00:01:49.139> guess<00:01:49.499> maybe<00:01:49.740> go<00:01:50.009> into<00:01:50.219> some

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
disaster so I guess maybe go into some

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.709 
disaster so I guess maybe go into some
more<00:01:50.399> detail<00:01:50.520> about<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.060> what<00:01:51.359> are<00:01:51.389> some<00:01:51.600> of

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
more detail about that what are some of

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.029 
more detail about that what are some of
the<00:01:51.810> pitfalls<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.469> hard<00:01:52.679> parts<00:01:52.920> about

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
the pitfalls and hard parts about

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.859 
the pitfalls and hard parts about
putting<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.369> together<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.909> when<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.689> work

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
putting this together so when you work

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.149 
putting this together so when you work
at<00:01:55.020> scale<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.590> are<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.679> lot<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.829> things<00:01:56.069> that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
at scale there are a lot of things that

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.249 
at scale there are a lot of things that
become<00:01:56.280> way<00:01:56.700> more<00:01:56.880> important<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.020> can't

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
become way more important like you can't

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.050 
become way more important like you can't
get<00:01:58.469> away<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.709> a<00:01:58.889> lot<00:01:59.069> of<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> smaller

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
get away with a lot of the smaller

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.370 
get away with a lot of the smaller
connections<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:02.090> as<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.020> know<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
connections and as you get to you know a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.730 
connections and as you get to you know a
couple<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.459> 6<00:02:05.789> 5<00:02:06.029> 6<00:02:06.329> 7<00:02:06.659> feet<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:07.109> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
couple you know 6 5 6 7 feet like the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.930 
couple you know 6 5 6 7 feet like the
weight<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.160> thing<00:02:08.310> starts<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> become<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
weight of the thing starts to become a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.460 
weight of the thing starts to become a
real<00:02:09.090> issue<00:02:09.240> like<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.050> probably<00:02:10.229> tell

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
real issue like you can probably tell

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.750 
real issue like you can probably tell
she's<00:02:10.709> sagging<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> little<00:02:11.340> bit<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> middle

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
she's sagging a little bit the middle

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.130 
she's sagging a little bit the middle
and<00:02:11.970> there's<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> lot<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.540> work<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.959> wings

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and there's a lot of work in the wings

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.930 
and there's a lot of work in the wings
to<00:02:13.230> get<00:02:13.380> them<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.250> know<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.580> as

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
to get them to be you know to be as

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.059 
to get them to be you know to be as
straight<00:02:15.480> as<00:02:15.600> they<00:02:15.690> are<00:02:15.840> but<00:02:16.080> like<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> lot<00:02:16.950> of

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
straight as they are but like a lot of

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.920 
straight as they are but like a lot of
things<00:02:17.220> start<00:02:17.459> stopped<00:02:17.819> working

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
things start stopped working

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.459 
things start stopped working
that's<00:02:19.049> unfortunate<00:02:19.560> yeah<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.700> imagine<00:02:21.469> then

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
that's unfortunate yeah I imagine then

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.770 
that's unfortunate yeah I imagine then
you<00:02:22.590> got<00:02:22.799> I<00:02:22.829> see<00:02:23.340> kind<00:02:23.579> of<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:24.209> wings<00:02:24.450> on

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
you got I see kind of the the wings on

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.479 
you got I see kind of the the wings on
the<00:02:24.930> side<00:02:25.140> here<00:02:25.439> what's<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.799> structure<00:02:26.129> like

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
the side here what's the structure like

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.789 
the side here what's the structure like
in<00:02:26.670> those<00:02:26.790> two<00:02:26.939> keep<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.269> up<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.349> there<00:02:28.560> are

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
in those two keep that up so there are

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.209 
in those two keep that up so there are
there's<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.760> lot<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.180> technique<00:02:30.540> work<00:02:30.750> inside

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:31.219 
there's a lot of technique work inside

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.530 
there's a lot of technique work inside
to<00:02:32.219> get<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.489> angle<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.000> it's<00:02:33.090> basically<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
to get the angle and it's basically a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.500 
to get the angle and it's basically a
bunch<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.870> beams<00:02:34.109> with<00:02:35.040> pins<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.489> in<00:02:35.670> two

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
bunch of beams with pins and in two

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.459 
bunch of beams with pins and in two
layers<00:02:36.689> of<00:02:36.989> bricks<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:38.129> then<00:02:38.310> there's<00:02:38.670> some

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469 
layers of bricks and then there's some

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.009 
layers of bricks and then there's some
some<00:02:40.469> axles<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:40.829> hold<00:02:41.099> them<00:02:41.219> in<00:02:41.340> but<00:02:42.299> most<00:02:42.840> of

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
some axles that hold them in but most of

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.059 
some axles that hold them in but most of
the<00:02:43.079> weight<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.349> actually<00:02:43.500> held<00:02:43.739> by<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:43.920> two

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
the weight is actually held by the two

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.949 
the weight is actually held by the two
white<00:02:44.219> pillars<00:02:44.489> underneath<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.030> part<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.840> it

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
white pillars underneath and part of it

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.140 
white pillars underneath and part of it
is<00:02:45.989> resting<00:02:46.590> down<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.010> wing<00:02:47.189> and<00:02:47.400> today

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
is resting down to the wing and today

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.030 
is resting down to the wing and today
right<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.989> tables<00:02:49.590> aren't<00:02:49.799> quite

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
right here the tables aren't quite

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.129 
right here the tables aren't quite
straight<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.639> so<00:02:51.209> there's<00:02:51.419> a<00:02:51.510> lot<00:02:51.689> of<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.870> lot

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
straight and so there's a lot of a lot

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.659 
straight and so there's a lot of a lot
of<00:02:52.230> stress<00:02:52.439> out<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.680> there<00:02:52.769> he's<00:02:53.340> not<00:02:53.489> going<00:02:53.609> to

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
of stress out of there he's not going to

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.119 
of stress out of there he's not going to
come<00:02:53.760> home<00:02:53.879> in<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.090> same<00:02:54.239> same<00:02:54.810> stage<00:02:55.099> yeah

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
come home in the same same stage yeah

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.159 
come home in the same same stage yeah
and<00:02:56.489> then<00:02:57.030> when<00:02:57.329> you're<00:02:57.480> moving<00:02:57.599> these<00:02:57.930> from

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
and then when you're moving these from

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.360 
and then when you're moving these from
convention<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.650> convention<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.099> mentioned

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
convention you convention you mentioned

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.649 
convention you convention you mentioned
they've<00:02:59.489> been<00:02:59.609> to<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.790> few<00:03:00.000> shows<00:03:00.030> how<00:03:00.510> does

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
they've been to a few shows how does

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.050 
they've been to a few shows how does
that<00:03:00.780> work<00:03:01.049> not<00:03:01.319> very<00:03:01.409> well

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
that work not very well

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.699 
that work not very well
so<00:03:03.060> they're<00:03:03.540> all<00:03:03.719> all<00:03:04.139> the<00:03:04.319> pieces<00:03:04.500> are

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
so they're all all the pieces are

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.920 
so they're all all the pieces are
labeled<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.129> chunks<00:03:05.370> say<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.489> can<00:03:05.700> show<00:03:05.849> you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.690 

she<00:03:08.470> comes<00:03:08.650> into<00:03:08.830> pieces<00:03:09.159> about<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.489> size

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
she comes into pieces about that size

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.309 
she comes into pieces about that size
they're<00:03:09.970> all<00:03:10.060> labeled<00:03:10.269> otherwise<00:03:11.049> they<00:03:11.200> would

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
they're all labeled otherwise they would

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.199 
they're all labeled otherwise they would
never<00:03:11.470> go<00:03:11.590> back<00:03:11.620> together<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.819> keel<00:03:13.000> goes

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
never go back together the keel goes

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.229 
never go back together the keel goes
into<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.810> couple<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.650> pieces<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.129> then<00:03:15.280> ends<00:03:16.150> up

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
into a couple of pieces and then ends up

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.270 
into a couple of pieces and then ends up
in<00:03:16.360> boxes<00:03:16.690> under<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.900> under<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.319> table<00:03:17.590> yeah

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
in boxes under the under the table yeah

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.550 
in boxes under the under the table yeah
so<00:03:19.030> works<00:03:19.330> well<00:03:21.060> yeah<00:03:22.060> well<00:03:22.720> those<00:03:22.840> are<00:03:23.080> super

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
so works well yeah well those are super

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.140 
so works well yeah well those are super
incredible<00:03:24.010> builds<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.610> do<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.849> enjoy<00:03:24.909> doing
