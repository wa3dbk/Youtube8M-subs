00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670 

hey<00:00:00.179> guys<00:00:00.359> how's<00:00:00.630> it<00:00:00.659> going<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.170> in<00:00:01.410> her<00:00:01.469> next

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
hey guys how's it going I'm in her next

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.949 
hey guys how's it going I'm in her next
door<00:00:01.860> and<00:00:02.159> today<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.090> was<00:00:03.300> going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.540> talk<00:00:03.720> about

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
door and today I was going to talk about

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.430 
door and today I was going to talk about
how<00:00:04.710> scientists<00:00:05.700> detect<00:00:06.060> extrasolar<00:00:06.930> planets

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
how scientists detect extrasolar planets

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.530 
how scientists detect extrasolar planets
so<00:00:07.770> an<00:00:07.859> extrasolar<00:00:08.220> planet<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.910> just<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.300> planet

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
so an extrasolar planet is just a planet

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.690 
so an extrasolar planet is just a planet
that<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:09.960> outside<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.650> our<00:00:10.769> solar<00:00:11.040> system

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
that is outside of our solar system

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.959 
that is outside of our solar system
so<00:00:12.059> planets<00:00:12.509> like<00:00:12.660> Uranus<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.620> Mercury<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
so planets like Uranus and Mercury and

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.720 
so planets like Uranus and Mercury and
Mars<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.599> Venus<00:00:15.809> those<00:00:16.590> are<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:17.130> extrasolar

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
Mars and Venus those are not extrasolar

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.609 
Mars and Venus those are not extrasolar
planet<00:00:18.240> an<00:00:18.359> extrasolar<00:00:18.750> planet<00:00:19.170> has<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.529> be

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
planet an extrasolar planet has to be

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.590 
planet an extrasolar planet has to be
going<00:00:19.859> around<00:00:19.980> another<00:00:20.340> star<00:00:20.460> that's<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.510> we

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
going around another star that's what we

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.019 
going around another star that's what we
mean<00:00:21.779> by<00:00:22.100> extrasolar<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.519> there's<00:00:23.699> actually

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
mean by extrasolar so there's actually

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.700 
mean by extrasolar so there's actually
quite<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.359> few<00:00:24.630> different<00:00:24.689> ways<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> detect

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
quite a few different ways to detect

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.550 
quite a few different ways to detect
extrasolar<00:00:26.310> planets<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.480> big<00:00:27.750> two<00:00:28.199> is

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
extrasolar planets but the big two is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.189 
extrasolar planets but the big two is
the<00:00:28.980> transit<00:00:29.580> method<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.750> radial

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the transit method and the radial

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.709 
the transit method and the radial
velocity<00:00:32.009> method<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:33.149> both<00:00:33.360> these<00:00:33.480> methods

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
velocity method so both these methods

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.139 
velocity method so both these methods
are<00:00:34.110> indirect<00:00:34.800> methods<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.730> means<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
are indirect methods what that means is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.240 
are indirect methods what that means is
we're<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.480> looking<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:37.230> planets<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
we're not looking at planets and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.549 
we're not looking at planets and
actually<00:00:39.180> photographing<00:00:39.960> them<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.440> when

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
actually photographing them so when

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.709 
actually photographing them so when
astronomers<00:00:40.770> find<00:00:41.309> bodies<00:00:41.700> inside<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.510> solar

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
astronomers find bodies inside the solar

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.500 
astronomers find bodies inside the solar
system<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> directly<00:00:45.000> image<00:00:45.300> them

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
system they like to directly image them

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.580 
system they like to directly image them
and<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.930> means<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.260> they're<00:00:46.410> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and what that means is they're just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830 
and what that means is they're just
taking<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.950> picture<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.430> them<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.629> what

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
taking a picture of them so that's what

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.590 
taking a picture of them so that's what
they're<00:00:48.989> looking<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.770> actual<00:00:50.600> objects

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
they're looking for is actual objects

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.410 
they're looking for is actual objects
with<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> camera<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.039> are<00:00:53.460> moving<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:54.390> of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
with a camera that are moving some of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.660 
with a camera that are moving some of
these<00:00:54.600> objects<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
these objects that we see out in the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.880 
these objects that we see out in the
Kuiper<00:00:56.940> belt<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.570> example<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.230> really<00:00:58.620> small

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
Kuiper belt for example are really small

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.279 
Kuiper belt for example are really small
they<00:00:59.070> take<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.789> pixel<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.930> they're

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
they take up like one pixel but they're

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.869 
they take up like one pixel but they're
still<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.760> on

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
still there and we can see them on

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 
still there and we can see them on
camera<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.690> don't<00:01:03.840> usually<00:01:03.989> see

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
camera so we don't usually see

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.429 
camera so we don't usually see
extrasolar<00:01:05.250> planets<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:06.030> can't<00:01:06.439> directly

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
extrasolar planets we can't directly

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.990 
extrasolar planets we can't directly
image<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.010> can't<00:01:08.189> take<00:01:08.340> pictures<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
image them we can't take pictures of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.420 
image them we can't take pictures of
them<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.840> compared<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> star<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
them because compared to the star that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.980 
them because compared to the star that
they're<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.119> around<00:01:12.240> they're<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.840> very

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
they're going around they're not very

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.230 
they're going around they're not very
bright<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.979> instead<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.880> use

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
bright so what we do instead is we use

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.440 
bright so what we do instead is we use
indirect<00:01:16.140> methods<00:01:16.619> non<00:01:17.040> picture<00:01:17.850> methods<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
indirect methods non picture methods to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.480 
indirect methods non picture methods to
find<00:01:18.659> them<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> radio<00:01:19.470> velocity<00:01:19.619> method

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
find them so the radio velocity method

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 
find them so the radio velocity method
is<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.210> very<00:01:21.840> very<00:01:22.020> common<00:01:22.500> method<00:01:22.619> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
is a very very common method of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.219 
is a very very common method of
detecting<00:01:23.460> extrasolar<00:01:23.939> planets<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.689> what

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
detecting extrasolar planets and what

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
detecting extrasolar planets and what
that<00:01:25.409> does<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.860> also<00:01:26.009> called<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> wobble

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that does it's also called the wobble

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.030 
that does it's also called the wobble
method<00:01:26.909> sometimes<00:01:27.810> hopefully<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> call<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
method sometimes hopefully it call the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.499 
method sometimes hopefully it call the
wobble<00:01:29.400> method<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> hear

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
wobble method or if you if you hear

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.030 
wobble method or if you if you hear
anything<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.049> wobble<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.560> probably

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
anything about a wobble it's probably

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.590 
anything about a wobble it's probably
the<00:01:32.159> radial<00:01:32.490> velocity<00:01:32.610> method<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.479> what

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the radial velocity method so what

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.810 
the radial velocity method so what
happens<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.619> gravity<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.400> reason<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
happens with gravity the reason that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
happens with gravity the reason that
we're<00:01:36.000> orbiting<00:01:36.390> around<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.869> Sun<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.320> because

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
we're orbiting around the Sun is because

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.160 
we're orbiting around the Sun is because
we<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.640> caught<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.270> Sun's<00:01:39.450> gravity<00:01:39.990> right

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
we are caught in the Sun's gravity right

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.679 
we are caught in the Sun's gravity right
we<00:01:40.439> want<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.130> rotate<00:01:41.400> around<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.970> Sun<00:01:42.119> however

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
we want to rotate around the Sun however

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.749 
we want to rotate around the Sun however
if<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.380> remember<00:01:43.770> gravity<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.670> those

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
if you remember gravity is one of those

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.069 
if you remember gravity is one of those
things<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.450> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> two-way

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
things that it's kind of a two-way

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:46.520 
things that it's kind of a two-way
street

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
street

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.399 
street
everything<00:01:47.509> exerts<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.750> force<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
everything exerts a force a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.039 
everything exerts a force a
gravitational<00:01:50.220> force<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.899> everything<00:01:51.899> else

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
gravitational force on everything else

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.990 
gravitational force on everything else
so<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> Sun<00:01:53.250> we'll<00:01:53.640> call<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
so if we have the Sun we'll call it the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.240 
so if we have the Sun we'll call it the
primary<00:01:54.240> body<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.500> Jupiter<00:01:55.979> we'll

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
primary body and we have Jupiter we'll

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.600 
primary body and we have Jupiter we'll
call<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.520> secondary<00:01:57.060> body<00:01:57.439> that<00:01:58.439> mass<00:01:59.189> is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
call it the secondary body that mass is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.670 
call it the secondary body that mass is
going<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.090> pulling<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.990> Sun<00:02:01.229> now<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
going to be pulling on the Sun now the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.499 
going to be pulling on the Sun now the
Sun<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.130> much<00:02:02.310> much<00:02:02.790> bigger<00:02:03.090> than<00:02:03.360> Jupiter

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
Sun is much much bigger than Jupiter

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.069 
Sun is much much bigger than Jupiter
right<00:02:04.140> way<00:02:04.409> way<00:02:04.950> bigger<00:02:05.219> however<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.869> still

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
right way way bigger however it's still

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.309 
right way way bigger however it's still
going<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> start<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.489> kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.910> wobble<00:02:09.690> because

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
going to start to kind of wobble because

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.140 
going to start to kind of wobble because
Jupiter<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.830> pulling<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.520> Jupiter<00:02:11.970> goes

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
Jupiter is pulling on it as Jupiter goes

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.940 
Jupiter is pulling on it as Jupiter goes
around<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:13.440> star

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
around the star

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.430 
around the star
it<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.160> actually<00:02:15.150> shifting<00:02:15.599> around<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.170> that's

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
it is actually shifting around so that's

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.890 
it is actually shifting around so that's
what's<00:02:16.680> happening<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.819> Jupiter<00:02:18.209> Sun

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
what's happening with the Jupiter Sun

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.640 
what's happening with the Jupiter Sun
system<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.360> big<00:02:21.660> enough<00:02:21.930> object<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
system so you have a big enough object a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.699 
system so you have a big enough object a
star<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.760> big<00:02:24.000> enough<00:02:24.209> body<00:02:24.569> say<00:02:25.170> Jupiter

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
star and a big enough body say Jupiter

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.610 
star and a big enough body say Jupiter
pulling<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.120> primary<00:02:27.420> body<00:02:27.900> you're

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
pulling on that primary body you're

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.130 
pulling on that primary body you're
going<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.099> get<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.519> wobble<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.630> that's<00:02:30.959> what's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
going to get a wobble and that's what's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.660 
going to get a wobble and that's what's
going<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.290> happen<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.739> have<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.099> wobbling

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
going to happen you have this wobbling

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.380 
going to happen you have this wobbling
effect<00:02:33.440> now<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.980> we've<00:02:35.130> covered<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.610> what

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
effect now that we've covered that what

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.750 
effect now that we've covered that what
happens<00:02:36.840> with<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.050> wobble<00:02:37.769> is<00:02:37.980> if<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.489> star

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
happens with that wobble is if a star

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.670 
happens with that wobble is if a star
let's<00:02:39.000> say<00:02:39.180> we're<00:02:39.450> here<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.900> earth<00:02:40.170> we<00:02:40.470> see<00:02:40.650> a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
let's say we're here on earth we see a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.229 
let's say we're here on earth we see a
star<00:02:40.980> way<00:02:41.160> out<00:02:41.340> there<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.940> star<00:02:42.209> is

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
star way out there and the star is

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.350 
star way out there and the star is
wobbling<00:02:42.780> well<00:02:43.650> how<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.459> we<00:02:44.700> detect<00:02:45.090> that

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
wobbling well how can we detect that

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.449 
wobbling well how can we detect that
wobble<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.349> can<00:02:46.530> do<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.799> with<00:02:46.980> something

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
wobble we can do it with something

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.949 
wobble we can do it with something
called<00:02:47.730> spectroscopy

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
called spectroscopy

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.850 
called spectroscopy
and<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.799> Doppler<00:02:50.489> shift<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.650> don't

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
and the Doppler shift so if you don't

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.680 
and the Doppler shift so if you don't
know<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.160> these<00:02:53.280> things<00:02:53.489> are<00:02:53.730> that's<00:02:54.090> ok<00:02:54.420> all

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
know what these things are that's ok all

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.080 
know what these things are that's ok all
you<00:02:54.870> really<00:02:55.079> need<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.440> know<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.920> when<00:02:56.910> an

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
you really need to know is that when an

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.440 
you really need to know is that when an
object<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.810> moving<00:02:58.280> towards<00:02:59.280> us<00:02:59.459> the<00:03:00.150> light

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
object is moving towards us the light

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.780 
object is moving towards us the light
that<00:03:00.690> we're<00:03:00.840> getting<00:03:01.019> is<00:03:01.519> different<00:03:02.519> we<00:03:02.670> can

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
that we're getting is different we can

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.789 
that we're getting is different we can
spectroscopically<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.900> can<00:03:04.049> take<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.560> light

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
spectroscopically we can take that light

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.890 
spectroscopically we can take that light
apart<00:03:05.190> look<00:03:05.610> at<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.090> go<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:06.660> light

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
apart look at it and go and this light

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.470 
apart look at it and go and this light
is<00:03:06.930> different<00:03:07.290> then<00:03:08.040> light<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.730> something<00:03:09.329> is

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
is different then light as something is

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.509 
is different then light as something is
traveling<00:03:09.810> away<00:03:10.290> from<00:03:10.530> us<00:03:10.650> now<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.220> isn't

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
traveling away from us now this isn't

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.860 
traveling away from us now this isn't
really<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.790> property<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.390> nearness<00:03:12.660> and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
really a property of nearness and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.440 
really a property of nearness and
farness<00:03:13.860> what<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.579> is<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> property<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.209> is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
farness what this is a property of is

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.500 
farness what this is a property of is
moving<00:03:16.110> towards<00:03:16.769> us<00:03:16.950> or<00:03:17.220> moving<00:03:17.730> away<00:03:17.880> from<00:03:18.209> us

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
moving towards us or moving away from us

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.750 
moving towards us or moving away from us
so<00:03:18.989> there<00:03:19.139> has<00:03:19.319> to<00:03:19.350> actually<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:19.920> movement<00:03:20.519> for

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
so there has to actually be movement for

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.940 
so there has to actually be movement for
us<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.000> detect<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:22.139> difference<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.799> that

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
us to detect the difference in that

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.490 
us to detect the difference in that
light<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.459> shift<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.299> light<00:03:24.480> but<00:03:25.139> if

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
light that shift in the light but if

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.830 
light that shift in the light but if
something<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.040> wobbling<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:27.450> can<00:03:27.600> see<00:03:27.750> this

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
something is wobbling we can see this

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.670 
something is wobbling we can see this
very<00:03:28.079> regular<00:03:28.620> very<00:03:28.980> periodic<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:30.329> light

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
very regular very periodic the light

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.800 
very regular very periodic the light
gets<00:03:31.680> squished<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.639> light<00:03:32.970> gets<00:03:33.329> lengthened

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
gets squished the light gets lengthened

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.750 
gets squished the light gets lengthened
out<00:03:33.930> light<00:03:34.410> gets<00:03:34.680> squished<00:03:34.950> light<00:03:35.430> gets

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
out light gets squished light gets

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.520 
out light gets squished light gets
lengthened<00:03:36.269> out<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:36.989> see<00:03:37.170> something

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
lengthened out so we can see something

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.199 
lengthened out so we can see something
coming<00:03:37.739> towards<00:03:38.190> us<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.639> away<00:03:38.730> from<00:03:38.910> us

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
coming towards us and away from us

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.660 
coming towards us and away from us
towards<00:03:39.720> us<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.139> away<00:03:40.200> from<00:03:40.350> us<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.769> even<00:03:41.400> if

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
towards us and away from us and even if

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.379 
towards us and away from us and even if
that<00:03:42.060> difference<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.989> very<00:03:43.769> very<00:03:43.920> small<00:03:44.130> on<00:03:44.700> an

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
that difference is very very small on an

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.629 
that difference is very very small on an
astronomical<00:03:45.720> level<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.889> object<00:03:47.190> the

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
astronomical level and this object the

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.509 
astronomical level and this object the
star<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.209> very<00:03:48.420> far<00:03:48.750> away<00:03:48.870> from<00:03:49.019> us<00:03:49.319> we<00:03:49.980> can

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
star is very far away from us we can

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.509 
star is very far away from us we can
conclude<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.540> there<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:51.930> something<00:03:52.709> pulling

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
conclude that there is something pulling

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.699 
conclude that there is something pulling
on<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.120> star<00:03:54.510> something<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.019> we<00:03:55.139> don't<00:03:55.500> see

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
on that star something that we don't see

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.300 
on that star something that we don't see
now<00:03:56.639> depending<00:03:57.269> on<00:03:57.359> how<00:03:57.569> much<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.590> thing<00:03:59.010> is

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
now depending on how much that thing is

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.819 
now depending on how much that thing is
pulling<00:03:59.880> on<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> star<00:04:00.329> we<00:04:00.959> can<00:04:01.200> pretty<00:04:01.620> much

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
pulling on the star we can pretty much

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.580 
pulling on the star we can pretty much
determine<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.579> mass<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.690> thing<00:04:03.930> right<00:04:04.349> if

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
determine the mass of the thing right if

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.580 
determine the mass of the thing right if
we<00:04:05.099> see<00:04:05.819> that<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.239> star<00:04:06.540> has<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.810> really<00:04:07.260> large

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
we see that this star has a really large

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.220 
we see that this star has a really large
wobble<00:04:08.250> there's<00:04:08.819> probably<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.299> really<00:04:09.930> big

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
wobble there's probably a really big

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.559 
wobble there's probably a really big
planet<00:04:10.889> going<00:04:11.190> around<00:04:11.549> this<00:04:11.790> star<00:04:12.120> now<00:04:12.419> of

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
planet going around this star now of

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.839 
planet going around this star now of
course<00:04:12.750> things<00:04:13.349> are<00:04:13.680> much<00:04:13.859> much<00:04:14.099> hairier<00:04:14.579> in

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
course things are much much hairier in

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.330 
course things are much much hairier in
real<00:04:15.090> life<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.870> that's<00:04:16.560> an<00:04:16.680> oversimplified

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
real life the that's an oversimplified

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.789 
real life the that's an oversimplified
version<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:18.000> distance<00:04:18.539> between<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.200> large

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
version the distance between a large

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.610 
version the distance between a large
body<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.760> much<00:04:20.910> larger<00:04:21.450> star<00:04:21.840> does<00:04:22.260> matter

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
body and a much larger star does matter

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.940 
body and a much larger star does matter
but<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.510> indirect<00:04:25.200> method<00:04:25.289> the

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
but this is the indirect method the

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.470 
but this is the indirect method the
radial<00:04:26.400> velocity<00:04:26.550> method

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
radial velocity method

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:47.510 
radial velocity method
of<00:04:27.600> finding<00:04:28.110> stars<00:04:28.440> based<00:04:29.190> on<00:04:29.460> their<00:04:29.970> wobbling

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.460 

so<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.550> lot<00:04:48.760> of<00:04:48.790> times<00:04:49.060> sigh<00:04:49.540> so<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.020> lot<00:04:50.170> of<00:04:50.200> times

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
so a lot of times sigh so a lot of times

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.860 
so a lot of times sigh so a lot of times
when<00:04:50.740> so<00:04:51.220> when<00:04:51.370> astronomers<00:04:51.580> find<00:04:52.150> bodies<00:04:52.630> in

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
when so when astronomers find bodies in

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.730 
when so when astronomers find bodies in
the<00:04:53.290> solders<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:54.310> what<00:04:54.550> radial<00:04:54.940> velocity

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
the solders so what radial velocity

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.960 
the solders so what radial velocity
philosophy<00:04:56.740> yeah<00:04:57.070> that's<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.400> word<00:04:57.580> philosophy

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
philosophy yeah that's a word philosophy

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.210 
philosophy yeah that's a word philosophy
like<00:04:58.660> velocity<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.350> philosophy<00:04:59.920> together

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
like velocity and philosophy together

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.640 
like velocity and philosophy together
yeah
