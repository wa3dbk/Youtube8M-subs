 elite artplay production represents 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello my favorite viewers 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.070
 when developing games and programs 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.350
 developers often leave trash or 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.920
 just forget to delete certain 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.900
 resources when I was climbing dota 2 resources 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.810
 ours brun i found two cards from 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.570
 dota developers themselves like them 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.260
 run open console and drive 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.590
 for example, map test basic, see first 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.680
 card first card is pretty simple 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.660
 we have a landscape on it cost two 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
 the throne I do not know what it did 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.590
 maybe something tested 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.770
 but it's interesting to dig that is 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.989
 here are the pens of trees and everything but the second card 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.559
 more interesting we overlap 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.170
 console in one clip test on the second card 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.500
 we are already seeing the one used 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.409
 the desert that is the texture of the desert that is not 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.350
 knows let it be dota in this style in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.600
 desert style and the most interesting thing 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.640
 kids have any new creeps this 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.380
 liked you can ask what 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 the essence of this card but maybe something 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.869
 tested so that there creeps did not move 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.720
 I know I noticed firstly, he is the first 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.369
 new creep did not see this and what 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.189
 the seller or it may be 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.680
 Arcana on mipo but hardly Tarkan us on 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.100
 Well I do not know what it looks like but sat on the IIEP 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.549
 and rhino oddly to see that 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.220
 creep was not at all in dota rhino can 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.159
 they will replace a model of the ancients 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.840
 creeps maybe just added for 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.770
 custom games 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:54.120
