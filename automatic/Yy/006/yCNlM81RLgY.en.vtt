00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.670
 guardians previously only 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.990
 we had only one list one single 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.580
 game mode in what was the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.010
 first week of the launch 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.630
 but he was already doing the second 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.210
 week was added what is this 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.519
 modality and basically it 's a meeting 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.039
 of four against four of one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.900
 reappearance comes out so you play it 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.540
 well a little more carefully more 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.059
 strategically more so go not so 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.680

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.030
 I hope it reaches five rounds 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.620
