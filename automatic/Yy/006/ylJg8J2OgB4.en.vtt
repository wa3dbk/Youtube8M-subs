00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.960
 most amino acid complexes 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.280
 contains the most important elements 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.559
 not enough can 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.719
 cover the body 's vitamin needs 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.880
 drugs containing only 350 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 milligrams of this substance in portions because 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.960
 this amino acid comes to a hundred 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.789
 sixty percent of all muscle tissue 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.010
 as well as participation in a number of important 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.140
 functions in the body without which 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.630
 anabolic processes can never 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.490
 reach your maximum but with the drug 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.650
 the power system company you are at any time 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.570
 you can get exactly so much glutamine 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.940
 how much your body needs and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.790
 glutamine contains the purest form of it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.010
 amino acids nothing more vitamin 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.629
 teahouse live for building muscle so 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.370
 how is the main material of 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.829
 which muscle fibers consist 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.570
 even being a replaceable element is capable 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.430
 synthesized by other ingredients 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.199
 lack of glutamine will trigger 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.660
 lack of a number of amino acids 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.940
 spent for reimbursement 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.399
 glutamine but accelerated muscle growth 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 tissues while taking glutamine you are not 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.030
 only supply to the body is necessary 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 building element a scientific 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 Studies have convincingly proven that you 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.939
 Tomin is a powerful stimulant 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.010
 synthesis of own growth hormone 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.570
 5 grams of extra glutamine per day 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.610
 provokes increased production 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.380
 growth hormone in the body for four hundred 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.299
 thirty percent such help 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.400
 anabolic process your body 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.710
 feels all athletes without exception 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.049
 because growth hormone is not the most powerful 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.009
 anabolic sex hormone 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.659
 nighttime advantage 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.340
 time is exactly during sleep the body 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.650
 gets the opportunity to completely 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.780
 set your day reserves 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.720
 that with active help growth hormone 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.299
 makes it much easier to notice or 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.220
 assimilation of glucose cause recruitment of excess 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.079
 weight gain along with muscle mass often 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.780
 lies in the wrong assimilation of carbohydrate 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.399
 during the night sleep the body is time 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.090
 do not spend a significant amount 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.130
 energy 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.420
 forcing excess glucose to be deposited in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.119
 form of subcutaneous fat 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.189
 but the increase in growth hormone in the body 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.350
 slows down glucose absorption without allowing 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.090
 her create peak sugar concentrations 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.340
 blood another great 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.340
 the property of vitamin in the body is 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.469
 his transformation of the black gene is usually for 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.690
 these goals are used fast carbohydrates 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.000
 glucose but for a variety of reasons 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.610
 use and glutamine as 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.610
 glycogen precursor much more efficient 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.780
 firstly overuse 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.180
 glucose leads to the formation of subcutaneous 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.340
 fat of which will never happen when 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.470
 use and glutamine in the second 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.390
 glutamine will be indispensable operational 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.879
 source of fuel during 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.739
 low-calorie diets when entering 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.900
 fast carbs in the body is tough 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.300
 limited and the athlete is experiencing due 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.099
 this lack of energy reception 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.379
 Additionally, glutamine is also important. 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.420
 because this amino acid is especially 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.930
 sensitive to aggressive habit 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.239
 environment 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.010
 up to 75 percent known 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.870
 consumed with food glutamine and not 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.730
 pass the gastrointestinal barrier 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.310
 therefore, the body absorbs only a small 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.470
 part of glutamine but glutamine contains 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.650
 Only a purified glutamine schiysya 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.510
 faster than he can be destroyed 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.739
 acid-base gastric environment 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.050
 this drug should be used 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.870
 so dissolve a portion of glass 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.450
 water and take dori after workout 2 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.379
 times a day 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.580
