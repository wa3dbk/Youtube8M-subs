00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.840
 good afternoon with you workshop blocks 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.629
 today in review 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.230
 one of our knives steel p18 given 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.340
 steel has 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.139
 firmly four hours a man made 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.240
 the knife handle is made of a coffin here 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.609
 also grabbe there is a bone die with 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 both sides with a pattern under the fingers 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.730
 cut well from the sides of this classic 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.590
 yards now we wanted to tell you 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.330
 how strong is our abdomen 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.869
 second to kanderus point for this is with us 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.869
 today is 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.450
 can we walk in a circle 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.190
 knife then open and parallel you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.579
 so naturally, then we still have 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 elk horn that we, too, by the fender of them 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.520
 enough with good power they have colds 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.610
 lightly held and bottle bottled and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.430
 I knit the neck of the other side of the knife 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.329
 butt and exactly from we stick this toy 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.719
 start with canned food now we 'll go through it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:17.750
 that is, a strong break up the group, that is 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:20.400
 we really hit hard 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.119
 see that he is multiplying chipping 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.060
 no stayed this canned knife 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.130
 roughly speaking about the original condition 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.130
 now take a piece 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:46.600
 that is, the knife he bent. his 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.120
 cuts like I'm going to rock now 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.420
 rock have high enough hardness 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:02:12.280
 much harder bones usual that is rock 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:16.030
 we are also crimson that is again possible 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.720
 but under your breath click to see what's here 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:26.920
 again there is nothing chipping on the blade 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:33.640
 Then we take a new leaf again our knife 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:37.330
 cuts like a blade now move on to 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.600
 the most interesting tube that is a man 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.390
 as from steel to happen must cut 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:53.380
 glass is that a coward 34 units now we 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:55.810
 go through the neck loss in a circle bye 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.420
 don't know grose clubs he wanted you 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.430
 say the fact that knives stunner senate with us 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.980
 starts from only 3000 rubles 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.090
 I'm not mistaken the knives go with us 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.239
 with us skin which can be considered 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.239
 closer 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.450
 free shipping 79 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:33.430
 the load is quite time consuming 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:04:01.919
 less spoons to scratch the columns in contrast 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:04:01.919
 from others began to spend 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:40.530
 the noise and the seam of us was the runes principle can 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.530
 try to break 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:04.360
 so exactly as expected went the test 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:04.360
 again, we'll open the Chancellor 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:06:03.710
 try again whether the risks for this test 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.990
 They wanted to show that our knives and steel 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.640
 since we do not lose sharpening they 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.610
 hard enough not to be on them 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.680
 for the teeth even the metal 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.030
 Well, in principle, this is likely to finish 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.030
