00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.410

 perdomo tenant deposit counter 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.150
 actually thought of at the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.230
 compete the world's fastest drummer 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.689
 the number of trox singles in one 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.779
 minute to count who so most 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.870
 singles crux in a minute creates the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.579
 s world sums up drummer so you can 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.360
 set a countdown here I have 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.579
 Set 60 seconds and the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.629
 countdown when the zero is heard 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.879
 But I do not have this before now 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.840
 try something different with the device too 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.059
 namely make within a minute 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.090

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.270
 exactly specified number of hits too 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.489

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.590
 Worried about chance a chance too 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:29.030
 a 3 that is the 36 and a 0 3 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030
 60 and off you go 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:23.530
 finished another number 1 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.530
 2 a 4 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.290
 245 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:03:01.769

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:19.260
 and another nine 499 in a minute 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.260
