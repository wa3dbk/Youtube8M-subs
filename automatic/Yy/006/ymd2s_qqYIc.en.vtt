00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.690

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.920 
now it's like a bright lime green color
and<00:02:23.290> with<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.950> have<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> piece<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.720> pop

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
in the bath bubble bar because I think

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:52.770
