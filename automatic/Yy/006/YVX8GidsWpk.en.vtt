00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.910
 well up to now there are simply the 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.950
 rumors referring to god if clicks from 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.770
 people using images either 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.320
 photoshop etcetera for characters 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.269
 dear ones like ice climber smith bradley 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.590
 and among others 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.820
 wolf too for example but nothing a 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.860
 thing we can say is that 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.960
 confirming the idea that he already exclaimed not 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.420
 is in the game of all 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.079
 There are some mistakes 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.940
 apparently remnants of the matter that 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.550
 isolate was tested to be in the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.489
 8 day version before discarding your 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.469
 existence and this good rumor 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.539
 humans later this is like a kind 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.210
 of glitch that can be seen in the game 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.670
 a story perhaps that is past 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.739
 later because in reality so that 0 what 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.079
 they're going to leave there because that's not 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.209
 should happen and the thing happens 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.239
 supposedly she is playing in the world 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:06.640
 history and having of enemies or 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.610
 players on stage at the villa 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.530
 against night mario, they are in 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.540
 high percentages and buzzing by 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.610
 opponents quickly 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.230
 and easy instead of listening to the cheerleader 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.570
 encouraging by two agenda or by that of the 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.580
 villa you will listen as anima of the six 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.100
 that we see how they are known for their 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.960
 original names each one own 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.620
 little and nothing and in this case well 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.620
 only listen 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.060
 good is how they were set there if you 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.730
 hear that the dead are cheering 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.410
 put it and pop even though they are not in 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.090
 the game 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.000
 this may be that it stayed there and that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.500
 they finished deleting those details from 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.170
 implemented in the game and that after 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.510
 ran these details or stays like this 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.190
 every time you are in a situation 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.570
 similar 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.450
 you'll hear how they can swim there 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.869
 little bit 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.599
 I will not talk about the situation that already 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.489
 the error of the 3ds max valdÃ©s version 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.129
 is totally bonn in 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.569
 internet and that there have been several 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.819
 different people talking about the 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.950
 situation and therefore I do not know which 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.630
 believe him and which will have the apparent reason 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.340
 of these situations remember that image 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.269
 that I showed him about the arrows that 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.269
 they were in the game applied 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.049
 referring to the possibility that 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.690
 make more characters and scenarios 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.760
 unlockable day by day or if again 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.200
 the ex her the of course rumor of 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.130
 connect the will you with your 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.040
 days then then this person was 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.720
 of looking for information of the round and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.060
 among them are these details of 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.640
 scenarios where they mention a few 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.130
 things like stage all turned off 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.319
 all on turn off all the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.510
 scenarios but among them there is one that 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.799
 says see the scenarios you've 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.360
 downloaded gentlemen downloaded 16 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.569
 then this can apply to two 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.269
 ideas or there will actually be 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.280
 and where you download scenarios or 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.830
 simply 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.020
 and there will also be a way to download 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.690
 scenarios of the windows version for 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.880
 Version 8 days and vice versa this 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.470
 it could be one of the reasons but 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.300
 example if he found this detail 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.800
 about the scenarios there must have been 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.910
 found something for the characters 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.010
 also this is only in see and 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.739
 if this really was in the rom this 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.870
 indicates in any way that there will be 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.239
 something concerning the scenarios that 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.950
 have to do with download and also 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.130
 we can see estimated where it mentions 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.170
 these details and that one can remember 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.780
 that there is a space in the right corner 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.820
 bottom that is blank and like that 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.830
 they should not leave that there but that 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.920
 maybe there then you can add 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.630
 a scenario perhaps of the stage is that 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.010
 one way in the wii or if it's true 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.010
 that this mode comes back to wii 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.510
 about the arrows that you can pass from 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.020
 side to side and you can see more 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.090
 scenarios of which are here then 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.760
 also it is on the brow deliveries 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.250
 of your for example you have the scenarios 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.050
 you can go to the retro stages or 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.360
 you can go to cost scenarios and my 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.550
 tablets in options that are in the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.590
 lower screen then to me in the 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.480
 screen at least down then in 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.580
 this situation in the wii or the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.870
 beans or at least that of beans 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.030
 is what we have now the places 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.580
 would indicate moving to another area where 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.250
 they show us more scenarios too and 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.070
 nothing that's all for now and I hope that 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.350
 this is a grain of salt that we can 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.200
 count on it to be true 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.830
 in the future and nothing beware much happy 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.830
 xmas
