riding a two-stroke engine with a
straight<00:00:28.960> pipe<00:00:29.279> hurt<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.490> engine<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:31.689> a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
straight pipe hurt the engine like a

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.240 
straight pipe hurt the engine like a
four-stroke

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
four-stroke

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.640

I<00:00:33.340> can't<00:00:33.910> find<00:00:34.300> an<00:00:34.480> exhaust<00:00:34.840> that<00:00:35.140> will<00:00:35.260> fit<00:00:35.500> it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
I can't find an exhaust that will fit it

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.320 
I can't find an exhaust that will fit it
what<00:00:36.100> he's<00:00:36.220> talking<00:00:36.580> about<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.970> these<00:00:37.180> little

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
two-stroke engines that go on these

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.540 
two-stroke engines that go on these
total<00:00:39.790> new<00:00:40.270> cycle<00:00:40.690> snowblowers<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:42.070> I've<00:00:42.400> got

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
total new cycle snowblowers and I've got

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.220 
total new cycle snowblowers and I've got
a<00:00:42.580> couple<00:00:42.790> engines<00:00:43.300> here<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.780> I'm<00:00:43.960> going<00:00:44.170> to

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
a couple engines here and I'm going to

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.799 
a couple engines here and I'm going to
show<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.890> options<00:00:45.340> that<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:45.760> have<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
show you the options that you have to

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.619 
show you the options that you have to
remedy<00:00:47.170> that<00:00:48.030> before<00:00:49.030> I<00:00:49.059> show<00:00:49.239> you<00:00:49.270> what<00:00:49.390> I've

remedy that before I show you what I've

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.770 
remedy that before I show you what I've
got<00:00:49.980> basically<00:00:50.980> your<00:00:51.850> engines<00:00:52.239> not<00:00:52.510> going<00:00:52.690> to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
got basically your engines not going to

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.869 
got basically your engines not going to
run<00:00:52.900> as<00:00:53.110> good<00:00:53.440> if<00:00:53.710> it's<00:00:53.949> coming<00:00:54.430> straight<00:00:54.640> out

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
run as good if it's coming straight out

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.330 
run as good if it's coming straight out
of<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.420> exhaust<00:00:56.199> port<00:00:56.680> it's<00:00:56.920> always<00:00:57.160> better

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
of the exhaust port it's always better

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.759 
of the exhaust port it's always better
to<00:00:57.460> have<00:00:57.640> some<00:00:57.970> kind<00:00:58.120> of<00:00:58.269> pipe<00:00:58.540> there<00:00:58.870> even<00:00:59.680> if

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
to have some kind of pipe there even if

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.340 
to have some kind of pipe there even if
it<00:00:59.890> is<00:00:59.980> straight<00:01:00.250> pipe<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:01.019> it's<00:01:02.019> better<00:01:02.199> if

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
it is straight pipe and it's better if

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.570 
it is straight pipe and it's better if
you<00:01:02.410> have<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.559> muffler<00:01:02.800> because<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.220> creates<00:01:03.489> a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
you have a muffler because it creates a

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.400 
you have a muffler because it creates a
bit<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:03.820> back<00:01:04.000> pressure<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.690> your<00:01:05.110> engine

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
bit of back pressure and your engine

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.050 
bit of back pressure and your engine
runs<00:01:05.619> better<00:01:05.890> I've<00:01:06.190> seen<00:01:06.550> engines<00:01:06.880> before

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
runs better I've seen engines before

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.240 
runs better I've seen engines before
where<00:01:07.990> they<00:01:08.140> didn't<00:01:08.380> have<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.530> muffler<00:01:09.040> they

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
where they didn't have a muffler they

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.430 
where they didn't have a muffler they
were<00:01:09.340> running<00:01:09.520> straight<00:01:09.970> pipe<00:01:10.360> or<00:01:11.020> straight

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
were running straight pipe or straight

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.830 
were running straight pipe or straight
out<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.920> exhaust<00:01:12.490> port<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.660> Rings

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
out of the exhaust port and the Rings

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.800 
out of the exhaust port and the Rings
cracked<00:01:14.759> so<00:01:15.759> here's<00:01:16.060> what<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.300> think<00:01:16.390> this

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
cracked so here's what I think this

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.300 
cracked so here's what I think this
youtuber<00:01:17.259> is<00:01:17.320> talking<00:01:17.710> about<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.130> these

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
youtuber is talking about is these

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.910 
youtuber is talking about is these
little<00:01:18.570> total<00:01:19.570> snow<00:01:20.050> blowers<00:01:20.320> I've<00:01:20.560> got<00:01:20.740> one

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
little total snow blowers I've got one

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.150 
little total snow blowers I've got one
in<00:01:20.950> parts<00:01:21.310> unlike<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.880> junk<00:01:22.149> shed<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:23.160> he

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
in parts unlike the junk shed and he

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.790 
in parts unlike the junk shed and he
says<00:01:24.430> that<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.789> muffler<00:01:25.149> here<00:01:25.479> which<00:01:25.930> goes

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
says that the muffler here which goes

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.940 
says that the muffler here which goes
all<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.039> way<00:01:27.190> down<00:01:27.310> by<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.090> wheels<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.780> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
all the way down by the wheels and that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.520 
all the way down by the wheels and that
all<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.250> way<00:01:30.369> down<00:01:30.580> over<00:01:30.610> here<00:01:31.119> even<00:01:31.440> it's<00:01:32.440> a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
all the way down over here even it's a

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.139 
all the way down over here even it's a
bit<00:01:32.680> cumbersome<00:01:33.220> if<00:01:33.369> you're<00:01:33.550> using<00:01:33.759> it<00:01:34.000> on<00:01:34.119> a

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
bit cumbersome if you're using it on a

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.690 
bit cumbersome if you're using it on a
mini<00:01:34.509> bike<00:01:34.690> or<00:01:34.930> something<00:01:35.289> like<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.950> can

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
mini bike or something like that I can

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.840 
mini bike or something like that I can
see<00:01:36.910> his<00:01:37.000> point<00:01:37.270> but<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.689> pipe<00:01:37.930> does<00:01:38.850> come

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
see his point but the pipe does come

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.940 
see his point but the pipe does come
apart<00:01:39.970> right<00:01:40.360> here<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.170> could<00:01:41.439> keep<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.920> a

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
apart right here so you could keep it a

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.800 
apart right here so you could keep it a
straight<00:01:42.250> pipe<00:01:42.490> like<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:43.150> can't<00:01:43.479> see<00:01:43.689> how

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
straight pipe like that I can't see how

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.410 
straight pipe like that I can't see how
that<00:01:43.840> would<00:01:44.200> really<00:01:44.560> hurt<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.760> may<00:01:45.939> not<00:01:45.970> run

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
that would really hurt it it may not run

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.410 
that would really hurt it it may not run
as<00:01:46.630> good<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.490> don't<00:01:48.820> think<00:01:49.000> it's<00:01:49.150> going<00:01:49.330> to

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
as good but I don't think it's going to

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.230 
as good but I don't think it's going to
damage<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:49.930> motor<00:01:50.759> now<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.820> other<00:01:52.060> option

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
damage the motor now the other option

so the simple answer is yes this is
normal<00:03:59.820> you're<00:04:00.420> gonna<00:04:00.570> get<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.900> higher<00:04:01.140> reading

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
normal you're gonna get a higher reading

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.810 
normal you're gonna get a higher reading
from<00:04:02.430> husky<00:04:02.970> chainsaws<00:04:03.540> steel<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:05.280> even<00:04:05.490> the

in Sweden as well by Electrolux which is

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.570 
in Sweden as well by Electrolux which is
basically<00:04:11.880> they<00:04:12.120> make<00:04:12.330> Husqvarna<00:04:13.460> you<00:04:14.460> will

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
basically they make Husqvarna you will

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.830 
basically they make Husqvarna you will
get<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> higher<00:04:14.970> reading<00:04:15.210> from<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.660> better

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
get a higher reading from the better

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.840 
get a higher reading from the better
sauce<00:04:16.170> from<00:04:16.829> these<00:04:17.070> will<00:04:17.370> get<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.549> lower

sauce from these will get a lower

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.310 
sauce from these will get a lower
reading<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:19.320> happens<00:04:19.709> all<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:19.980> time

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
reading and that happens all the time

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.230 
reading and that happens all the time
one<00:04:22.320> reason<00:04:22.680> could<00:04:22.710> be<00:04:23.070> is<00:04:23.220> that<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.610> lot<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
one reason could be is that a lot of the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.050 
one reason could be is that a lot of the
better<00:04:24.510> saws<00:04:24.930> their<00:04:25.919> pistons<00:04:26.430> are<00:04:26.669> chromed

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
a Swedish saw as well so that's very

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.700 
a Swedish saw as well so that's very
normal<00:04:59.990> it's<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.169> same<00:05:01.380> with<00:05:01.560> these

well<00:05:04.620> you're<00:05:04.890> going<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.130> get<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.430> lot<00:05:05.640> lower

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
well you're going to get a lot lower

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.360 
well you're going to get a lot lower
compression<00:05:06.390> on<00:05:06.720> these<00:05:06.950> then<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.100> would<00:05:08.250> on<00:05:08.340> a

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
compression on these then you would on a

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.990 
compression on these then you would on a
steel<00:05:08.790> or<00:05:09.060> an<00:05:09.240> echo<00:05:10.220> so<00:05:11.220> I<00:05:11.250> guess<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.729> get<00:05:11.880> what

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
steel or an echo so I guess you get what

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.940 
steel or an echo so I guess you get what
you<00:05:12.120> pay<00:05:12.270> for<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.780> always<00:05:13.050> recommend<00:05:13.380> buying

the better brand names even if you're

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.980 
the better brand names even if you're
just<00:05:16.380> using<00:05:16.740> your<00:05:17.160> product<00:05:17.610> at<00:05:17.700> home<00:05:17.930> now<00:05:18.930> the

just using your product at home now the

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.219 
just using your product at home now the
last<00:05:19.290> question<00:05:19.470> I<00:05:19.919> have<00:05:20.130> is<00:05:20.540> does<00:05:21.540> to<00:05:21.840> cycle

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
last question I have is does to cycle

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.940 
last question I have is does to cycle
oil<00:05:22.380> have<00:05:22.919> a<00:05:22.950> fuel<00:05:23.340> stabilizer<00:05:23.940> in<00:05:24.360> it

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
oil have a fuel stabilizer in it

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.640 
oil have a fuel stabilizer in it
mighty<00:05:25.950> cycle<00:05:26.550> gas<00:05:26.820> seems<00:05:27.540> to<00:05:27.810> last<00:05:27.990> longer

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
mighty cycle gas seems to last longer

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.340 
mighty cycle gas seems to last longer
well<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.669> don't<00:05:30.030> think<00:05:30.270> there<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.479> any<00:05:30.900> fuel

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
well I don't think there is any fuel

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
well I don't think there is any fuel
stabilizer<00:05:31.830> in<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:33.300> new<00:05:33.570> cycle<00:05:33.870> oil<00:05:34.290> but<00:05:35.220> it

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
stabilizer in the new cycle oil but it

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.490 
stabilizer in the new cycle oil but it
does<00:05:35.580> help<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.090> gas<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.660> last<00:05:36.900> longer

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
does help the gas to last longer

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.070 
does help the gas to last longer
definitely<00:05:38.280> a<00:05:38.550> lot<00:05:39.060> of<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:39.330> new<00:05:39.540> cycle<00:05:39.750> oil

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
definitely a lot of this new cycle oil

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.750 
definitely a lot of this new cycle oil
if<00:05:40.380> you<00:05:40.410> read<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:40.830> in<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.100> back<00:05:41.310> it's<00:05:41.610> not

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
if you read it in the back it's not

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.430 
if you read it in the back it's not
going<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:42.030> tell<00:05:42.240> you<00:05:42.419> that<00:05:42.810> there<00:05:43.080> is<00:05:43.169> any

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
going to tell you that there is any

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.190 
going to tell you that there is any
additives<00:05:44.250> that<00:05:45.150> would<00:05:45.300> make<00:05:45.450> your<00:05:45.600> gas<00:05:45.810> last

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
additives that would make your gas last

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.430 
additives that would make your gas last
longer<00:05:47.210> there<00:05:48.210> are<00:05:48.240> some<00:05:48.510> Husqvarna<00:05:49.200> oil

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
longer there are some Husqvarna oil

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.640 
longer there are some Husqvarna oil
that's<00:05:50.160> a<00:05:50.280> quicker<00:05:50.490> state<00:05:51.080> so<00:05:52.080> like<00:05:52.260> I<00:05:52.410> said

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
that's a quicker state so like I said

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.590 
that's a quicker state so like I said
even<00:05:52.830> though<00:05:53.040> there's<00:05:53.340> no<00:05:53.520> fuel<00:05:53.850> stabilizers

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
even though there's no fuel stabilizers

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.960 
even though there's no fuel stabilizers
in<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.320> oil<00:05:55.590> it<00:05:56.160> does<00:05:56.370> make<00:05:56.580> it<00:05:56.729> last<00:05:56.880> longer

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
in the oil it does make it last longer

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.300 
in the oil it does make it last longer
it's<00:05:57.330> kind<00:05:57.479> of<00:05:57.540> like<00:05:57.690> diesel<00:05:57.990> fuel<00:05:58.440> it's<00:05:59.040> very

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
it's kind of like diesel fuel it's very

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.880 
it's kind of like diesel fuel it's very
hard<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.610> spoil<00:06:00.000> diesel<00:06:00.419> fuel

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
hard to spoil diesel fuel

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.340 
hard to spoil diesel fuel
and<00:06:01.010> it<00:06:01.280> has<00:06:01.430> a<00:06:01.460> higher<00:06:01.760> it<00:06:02.690> seemed<00:06:02.990> like<00:06:03.170> an

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
and it has a higher it seemed like an

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.060 
and it has a higher it seemed like an
oil<00:06:03.620> content<00:06:04.220> to<00:06:04.490> it

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
oil content to it

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.310 
oil content to it
do<00:06:05.730> you<00:06:05.820> know<00:06:05.940> that<00:06:06.090> if<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.360> put<00:06:06.600> my<00:06:06.630> minions

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
do you know that if I put my minions

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.370 
do you know that if I put my minions
away<00:06:07.590> and<00:06:07.710> I<00:06:07.770> forgot<00:06:07.980> to<00:06:08.490> run<00:06:08.910> them<00:06:09.090> dry<00:06:09.360> or<00:06:10.170> but

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
away and I forgot to run them dry or but

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.490 
away and I forgot to run them dry or but
no<00:06:10.710> stabilizer<00:06:11.280> in<00:06:11.550> them<00:06:11.760> often<00:06:12.660> times<00:06:12.960> that

no stabilizer in them often times that

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.290 
no stabilizer in them often times that
it'll<00:06:13.860> still<00:06:14.070> be<00:06:14.220> good<00:06:14.490> in<00:06:14.700> the<00:06:15.060> following

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
it'll still be good in the following

it'll still be good in the following
season<00:06:15.980> there<00:06:16.980> must<00:06:17.190> be<00:06:17.310> something<00:06:17.700> in<00:06:17.790> the

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
season there must be something in the

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.970 
season there must be something in the
oil<00:06:18.210> that<00:06:18.300> just<00:06:18.480> helps<00:06:19.110> preserve<00:06:19.290> the<00:06:19.470> life<00:06:19.800> of

for<00:06:23.790> all<00:06:23.850> my<00:06:24.030> new<00:06:24.240> cycle<00:06:24.600> engines<00:06:24.990> and<00:06:25.260> I<00:06:25.950> do

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
for all my new cycle engines and I do

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.690 
for all my new cycle engines and I do
find<00:06:26.520> that<00:06:26.960> last<00:06:27.960> night<00:06:28.260> so<00:06:29.160> that's<00:06:29.370> what<00:06:29.580> you

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
find that last night so that's what you

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.450 
find that last night so that's what you
can<00:06:29.880> do<00:06:30.060> do<00:06:30.720> you<00:06:30.930> feel<00:06:31.410> stabilizer<00:06:32.010> if<00:06:32.310> you're

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
can do do you feel stabilizer if you're
