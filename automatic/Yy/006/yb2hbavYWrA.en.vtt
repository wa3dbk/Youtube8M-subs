barium<00:00:14.299> treatment<00:00:14.750> yes<00:00:23.169> so<00:00:24.169> there<00:00:24.739> it<00:00:25.369> is

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
barium treatment yes so there it is

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.700 
barium treatment yes so there it is
typically<00:00:25.910> done<00:00:26.029> in<00:00:26.150> Safari<00:00:26.810> movies<00:00:29.559> one<00:00:30.559> is

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
typically done in Safari movies one is

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.619 
typically done in Safari movies one is
whether<00:00:30.980> you<00:00:31.189> are<00:00:31.369> using<00:00:31.550> killing<00:00:32.090> only<00:00:32.390> heat

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
whether you are using killing only heat

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.319 
whether you are using killing only heat
and<00:00:32.660> gas<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:33.469> you<00:00:33.770> are<00:00:33.920> going<00:00:34.190> to<00:00:34.340> need<00:00:34.550> plus

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
and gas and you are going to need plus

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.080 
and gas and you are going to need plus
no<00:00:36.050> chemicals<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:36.710> those<00:00:37.640> were<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.059> ones

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
no chemicals and those were the ones

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.690 
no chemicals and those were the ones
that<00:00:38.450> I<00:00:38.570> show<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:38.930> which<00:00:39.440> were<00:00:39.649> basically<00:00:40.190> the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
that I show you which were basically the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:49.149 
that I show you which were basically the
version<00:00:41.149> of<00:00:41.270> white<00:00:45.429> so<00:00:47.199> we<00:00:48.199> are<00:00:48.320> we<00:00:48.829> are<00:00:48.859> only

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
version of white so we are we are only

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.979 
version of white so we are we are only
giving<00:00:49.550> on<00:00:49.850> heat<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.670> only<00:00:52.670> son<00:00:52.940> we're<00:00:53.600> giving

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
giving on heat and only son we're giving

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.860 
giving on heat and only son we're giving
only<00:00:54.289> gas<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:54.920> be<00:00:55.159> no<00:00:55.670> chemical<00:00:56.269> issues

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
only gas and be no chemical issues

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.479 
only gas and be no chemical issues
now<00:00:57.620> insert<00:00:58.609> certificate<00:00:59.539> is<00:00:59.629> we<00:00:59.960> want

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
now insert certificate is we want

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.579 
now insert certificate is we want
respond<00:01:01.489> with<00:01:01.670> this<00:01:01.819> and<00:01:02.120> thanks<00:01:03.019> Sonia<00:01:03.229> will

respond with this and thanks Sonia will
always<00:01:03.859> remain<00:01:04.070> three<00:01:04.400> whatever<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.940> do

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
always remain three whatever you do

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.080 
always remain three whatever you do
whatever<00:01:06.020> he<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.440> give<00:01:06.620> order<00:01:06.950> gas<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.640> single

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
whatever he to give order gas a single

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.510 
whatever he to give order gas a single
those<00:01:08.810> kind<00:01:09.080> of<00:01:09.170> materials<00:01:09.590> then<00:01:09.890> we<00:01:10.280> treat

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
those kind of materials then we treat

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.750 
those kind of materials then we treat
them<00:01:10.700> with<00:01:10.909> individual<00:01:12.760> temperature

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
them with individual temperature

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.080 
them with individual temperature
solution<00:01:14.360> omelets<00:01:14.750> then<00:01:15.350> can<00:01:15.650> become<00:01:16.090> more

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
solution omelets then can become more

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.860 
solution omelets then can become more
yellow<00:01:17.510> or<00:01:17.690> orange<00:01:18.050> and<00:01:18.620> you<00:01:19.040> can<00:01:19.220> see<00:01:19.430> the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
yellow or orange and you can see the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.350 
yellow or orange and you can see the
colors<00:01:20.870> here<00:01:22.060> so<00:01:23.650> barium<00:01:24.650> works<00:01:25.070> as<00:01:25.250> a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
colors here so barium works as a

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.740 
colors here so barium works as a
coloring<00:01:26.360> agent<00:01:26.480> I<00:01:28.060> think<00:01:29.060> make<00:01:29.300> with<00:01:29.570> this

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
coloring agent I think make with this

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.570 
coloring agent I think make with this
stuff<00:01:30.110> No

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.120 

you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.390> it's

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.100 

you<00:01:43.130> know<00:01:43.190> come<00:01:43.400> but<00:01:43.940> what<00:01:44.300> it<00:01:44.450> does<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.780> it

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
you know come but what it does is it

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.470 
you know come but what it does is it
changes<00:01:45.350> into<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.640> yellow<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.910> oxygen

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
changes into that yellow and the oxygen

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.630 
changes into that yellow and the oxygen
and<00:01:50.630> hydrogen<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:51.260> use<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.460> for

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
and hydrogen you use that is for

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.430 
and hydrogen you use that is for
oxidization<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.510> reduction<00:01:54.050> or<00:01:54.200> for

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
oxidization and reduction or for

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.960 
oxidization and reduction or for
something<00:01:54.680> else<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.650> one<00:01:57.950> thing<00:01:58.160> we<00:01:58.730> are

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
something else and the one thing we are

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.060 
something else and the one thing we are
told<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.660> are<00:02:00.020> working<00:02:00.320> with<00:02:00.560> Indian

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
told that you are working with Indian

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.060 
told that you are working with Indian
materials<00:02:01.580> so<00:02:02.330> especially<00:02:02.660> Indian<00:02:03.560> Ruby<00:02:03.860> that

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
materials so especially Indian Ruby that

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.570 
materials so especially Indian Ruby that
is<00:02:04.190> corundum<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:06.800> have<00:02:06.950> not<00:02:07.130> explained

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
is corundum you have not explained

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:33.340 
is corundum you have not explained
anything<00:02:07.820> about<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.690> what<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
anything about that so what is the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.340 
anything about that so what is the
reason<00:02:34.070> there<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:35.300> Indian<00:02:35.630> material<00:02:36.050> cannot

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
reason there that Indian material cannot

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.850 
reason there that Indian material cannot
be<00:02:36.410> treated<00:02:40.060> concise<00:02:41.060> which<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:42.650> don't

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
be treated concise which you don't

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.850 
be treated concise which you don't
become<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.489> range<00:02:44.300> of<00:02:44.420> temperatures<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.560> you

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
become of a range of temperatures so you

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.060 
become of a range of temperatures so you
cannot<00:02:46.100> go<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.430> high<00:02:46.610> temperatures<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.330> there

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
cannot go to high temperatures and there

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.490 
cannot go to high temperatures and there
is<00:02:49.070> material<00:02:49.280> which<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.630> know<00:02:50.750> make<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.050> okay
