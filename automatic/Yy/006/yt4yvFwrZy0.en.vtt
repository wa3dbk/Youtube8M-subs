00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.590 
look around where is it some where is it
let's<00:02:09.880> try<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.149> again<00:02:10.890> okay<00:02:11.890> there<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.190> is

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
let's try that again okay there it is

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.630 
let's try that again okay there it is
this<00:02:13.600> massive<00:02:14.080> asteroid<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.890> starts<00:02:15.340> flying

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
this massive asteroid just starts flying

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.180 
this massive asteroid just starts flying
out<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.180> sky<00:02:16.209> straight<00:02:16.959> at<00:02:17.200> us<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.650> it's<00:02:18.130> a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
out of the sky straight at us and it's a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.740 
out of the sky straight at us and it's a
bit<00:02:18.310> funny<00:02:18.549> cuz<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.910> got<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.090> shaders<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.570> so

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
bit funny cuz I got the shaders on so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.150 
bit funny cuz I got the shaders on so
it's<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> bit<00:02:19.989> be<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.410> bit<00:02:20.560> see-through<00:02:20.769> another

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
happens I didn't know that happens as

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.440 
happens I didn't know that happens as
you<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.070> see<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.370> leaves<00:02:33.549> his<00:02:33.670> big<00:02:33.940> trail

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
you can see it leaves his big trail

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.840 
you can see it leaves his big trail
behind<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.290> slowly<00:02:35.620> slowly<00:02:36.220> fades<00:02:36.640> away

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
behind it that slowly slowly fades away

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.660 
behind it that slowly slowly fades away
and<00:02:37.269> if<00:02:37.780> we<00:02:37.930> take<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.320> look<00:02:38.680> at<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:38.980> big<00:02:39.280> block

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
and if we take a look at this big block

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and if we take a look at this big block
it<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.180> fact<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.690> massive<00:02:41.500> pig<00:02:42.070> head<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.730> so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
it is in fact a massive pig head and so

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.300 
it is in fact a massive pig head and so
we're<00:02:43.780> gonna<00:02:43.930> wait<00:02:44.110> for<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.410> whoa<00:02:44.530> okay<00:02:45.070> I'm

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
we're gonna wait for that whoa okay I'm

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.280 
we're gonna wait for that whoa okay I'm
stuck<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.670> block<00:02:45.880> or<00:02:46.090> particle<00:02:46.750> or<00:02:46.900> stuck<00:02:47.260> in

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
stuck in a block or particle or stuck in

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.949 
stuck in a block or particle or stuck in
something<00:02:47.829> but<00:02:48.640> let's<00:02:49.180> keep<00:02:49.360> an<00:02:49.540> eye<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:49.720> it

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
something but let's keep an eye on it

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.530 
something but let's keep an eye on it
cuz<00:02:50.230> now<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.500> crazy<00:02:51.100> stuff<00:02:51.610> happens<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
cuz now the crazy stuff happens and you

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.360 
cuz now the crazy stuff happens and you
can<00:02:52.720> sear<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.140> III<00:02:53.709> that's<00:02:53.980> just<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
can sear to this III that's just the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.149 
can sear to this III that's just the
shaders<00:02:54.790> being<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.840> bit<00:02:55.959> funny<00:02:56.260> with<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.470> that's

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
shaders being a bit funny with it that's

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.490 
shaders being a bit funny with it that's
not<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:58.269> normally<00:02:58.659> it's<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.989> solid<00:02:59.319> block

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
not there normally it's a solid block

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.039 
not there normally it's a solid block
usually<00:02:59.739> but<00:03:00.700> let's<00:03:01.180> see<00:03:01.329> what<00:03:01.450> happens

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
usually but let's see what happens

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.410 
usually but let's see what happens
whoa<00:03:02.290> okay<00:03:02.829> here<00:03:03.129> it<00:03:03.219> is<00:03:03.310> here<00:03:03.849> it<00:03:03.969> goes<00:03:04.120> it's

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
whoa okay here it is here it goes it's

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.759 
whoa okay here it is here it goes it's
growing<00:03:04.659> where's<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.019> body<00:03:05.170> for<00:03:05.500> it

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
growing where's the body for it

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.770 
growing where's the body for it
a<00:03:05.799> horse<00:03:06.250> behind<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.700> there's<00:03:07.180> another<00:03:07.390> one

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
a horse behind it there's another one

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.929 
a horse behind it there's another one
over<00:03:07.810> there<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.409> as<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.040> can<00:03:09.159> see<00:03:09.219> it<00:03:09.670> just

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
over there and as you can see it just

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.539 
over there and as you can see it just
destroys<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.140> wrecks<00:03:11.620> everything<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.400> its

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
destroys and wrecks everything in its

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:21.000 
destroys and wrecks everything in its
path<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.359> is<00:03:13.829> incredibly<00:03:14.829> insane<00:03:15.340> Wow

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
safe to say this village is no longer

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.869 
safe to say this village is no longer
inhabitable<00:04:00.730> oh<00:04:01.239> my<00:04:01.870> god<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:03.280> what<00:04:03.669> can<00:04:03.849> she

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
do with these guys he's right them and

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.990 
do with these guys he's right them and
I'm<00:04:05.680> trying<00:04:05.919> to<00:04:05.979> work<00:04:06.099> out<00:04:06.280> how<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.579> do<00:04:06.819> that

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
I'm trying to work out how to do that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.619 
I'm trying to work out how to do that
but<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.079> doesn't<00:04:08.560> seem<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.979> be<00:04:09.129> working

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
but it doesn't seem to be working

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.119 
but it doesn't seem to be working
possibly<00:04:10.629> because<00:04:10.989> there<00:04:11.349> is<00:04:11.470> an<00:04:11.650> immense

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
possibly because there is an immense

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.629 
possibly because there is an immense
amount<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.909> lag<00:04:13.239> right<00:04:13.629> to<00:04:13.810> now<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:15.340> it's<00:04:15.519> just

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
amount of lag right to now but it's just

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.319 
amount of lag right to now but it's just
ain't<00:04:15.909> happening

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
ain't happening

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.140 
ain't happening
it<00:04:16.479> ain't<00:04:16.659> happening<00:04:17.079> don't<00:04:17.620> know<00:04:17.739> why<00:04:21.150> these

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
it ain't happening don't know why these

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.560 
it ain't happening don't know why these
guys<00:04:22.330> let's<00:04:22.780> take<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.260> look<00:04:23.560> at<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.919> pigzilla

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
guys let's take a look at the pigzilla

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.830 
guys let's take a look at the pigzilla
invasion<00:04:25.570> okay<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:26.580> my<00:04:28.110> village<00:04:30.539> okay<00:04:31.539> okay
