00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
be-bop scale on my left hand now the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.420 
be-bop scale on my left hand now the
be-bop<00:00:18.810> scale<00:00:18.840> takes<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.710> major<00:00:19.980> scale

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
be-bop scale takes this major scale

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.590 
be-bop scale takes this major scale
which<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.760> seven<00:00:20.970> notes<00:00:23.000> one<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.269> three<00:00:24.300> four

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
which is seven notes one two three four

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.230 
which is seven notes one two three four
five<00:00:24.869> six<00:00:25.080> seven<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.980> we're<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.760> add<00:00:26.970> an

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
five six seven and we're going to add an

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
five six seven and we're going to add an
extra<00:00:27.630> note<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.710> inharmonic<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
extra note that is inharmonic to the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.640 
extra note that is inharmonic to the
scale<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.420> outside<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> skills<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.410> use

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
scale so outside of the skills we use

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950 
scale so outside of the skills we use
one<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:32.009> black<00:00:32.309> notes<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.960> passing

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
one of these black notes as a passing

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:51.490 
one of these black notes as a passing
tone<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.160> an<00:00:35.280> even<00:00:35.610> number<00:00:35.640> scale

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.840 

no<00:00:52.500> some<00:00:52.710> playing<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> B<00:00:53.190> flat<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
no some playing this B flat so it's that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
no some playing this B flat so it's that
theory<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.110> out<00:01:01.290> of<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
theory that you can go in and out of the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
theory that you can go in and out of the
scale<00:01:01.860> but<00:01:02.519> as<00:01:02.610> long<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.089> use<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.420> scale

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
scale but as long as you use the scale

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.930 
scale but as long as you use the scale
as<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.680> basis<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.519> you're<00:01:05.700> playing

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
as the the basis for what you're playing

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.910 
as the the basis for what you're playing
in<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.270> right<00:01:06.420> hand<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:07.229> will<00:01:07.350> always<00:01:07.530> sound

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
in your right hand it will always sound

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.109 
in your right hand it will always sound
good<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.369> we're<00:01:08.490> going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.729> through<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
good so we're going to go through and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.850 
good so we're going to go through and
play<00:01:09.270> those<00:01:09.570> minor<00:01:09.840> chords<00:01:10.289> now<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.710> some

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
play those minor chords now with some

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:29.130 
play those minor chords now with some
