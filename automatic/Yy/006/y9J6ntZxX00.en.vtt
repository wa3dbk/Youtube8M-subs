00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.650
 hello very good at all I am to be at a 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.630
 new magic development video and this 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.770
 it's going to be dynamo 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.510
 I'm going to do the trick of dynamo has 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.300
 three glasses 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:25.860
 and one with water then pours water on 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.260
 each one removes them and removes them 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.870
 to see the others 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.890
 we have normal water 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.890
 in a glass 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.770
 Y 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.770
 we started rowing 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.560
 remove and in which glass is the water 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.890
 and the public will say this 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.820
 and you with the base 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.820
 and then we want 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.810
 next we take water 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.490
 and with the same procedure 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.500
 we will pour 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 we have 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.680
 if we have changed 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
 yes 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.259
 yes 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.570
 and the public will say where you tell the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.550
 point where is the water and the public 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.480
 will tell 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.480
 A) Yes 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.980
 It has nothing 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.980
 let's go to the third 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.600
 we cast now 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.600
 then we remove 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.120
 mons 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.220
 s 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.220
 I was not there 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.460
 volcanoes 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.120
 Y 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.910
 this is the trick, let's have fun 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.520
 the fairly simple relationship and what 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.890
 we will need is paul yutera not of 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.640
 softball yutera no sodium I do not know if what 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.100
 I say good 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.930
 it's a compound that 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.930
 to the reaction with water or some 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.890
 liquid absorb six hundred times its 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.800
 size is a small powder 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:08.590
 it basically becomes as if they were 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:12.270
 go as if it were but it's there like that and not 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.780
 it falls it stays there and 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.210
 it's pretty cool where we can 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.030
 get the sodium polyurethane and what 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.740
 we can get in two doses 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.740
 we can not get it 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.190
 in baby diapers 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.410
 how to get it you can leave a link 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.600
 here 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.670
 so you can see how it is done and how it 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.670
 conscious and how you get it is a 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.730
 little dust and one thing that I want 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.360
 say they are three glasses and the glasses have 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.110
 that be opaque that is not seen because if 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.110
 there would not be a sunrise 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.680
 if you see the liquid there 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.100
 it would be very, this has been all for today and 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.100
 until next
