00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.790
 Yes, hello. 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.179
 Rooted practices 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.399
 first 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:14.179
 Today I will study about the situation of the week. 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.460
 Today, especially the first place in the union 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.089
 Again, 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.429
 Even if you have the same mind 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.179
 It can lead to 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.669
 On the other hand, 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.269
 It is a value and a heart. 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.719
 ls can also be different dollars 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.630
 Gold coins can be Piessi 030000 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.830
 Mother 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.430
 Let's take a look around. 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.720
 Whether or not the presentation conditions of acquisition are accepted 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.720
 I'll kick you once. 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.290
 If I tell you this again, 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.790
 Gubong Seoul print culture 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.910
 Mystery is not to be introduced to the sister 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.040
 It is. 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.520
 But only 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.630
 Many people are integrating it to my soul to survive 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.060
 Age 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.460
 Is now the beginning for the castle 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.850
 Because it's 9th in the training center. 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.860
 But 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.900
 In order to conquer a large number in the future, 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.440
 The first time you change your location, 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.420
 Never solve it 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 There are a lot of books to go forward in the future. 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.480
 In order to diversify these scientific inconveniences in the future, 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.880
 This way, it's very important. 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.950
 Not a complaint. 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.609
 From this first step all created. 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.440
 There must be an index. 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.130
 From the front 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.190
 I am now burning the pdp panel for that bad protection 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.380
 I'll pay for it. 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.629
 Is it reasonable? 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.460
 For the movie 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.710
 Standing on Jesus 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.910
 Please try the contents of 7 hours is very simple Condition 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.040
 I've done it many times and watched it, 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.349
 Please keep going back from 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.739
 In 2002, I rushed to head to the head, 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.449
 past 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:43.619
 In the end, the shape is touched with our fingers and our education 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:44.919
 That shape 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.339
 2007 - 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.619
 So later on, all we did on the piano street 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.719
 To freely use 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.809
 Most essential 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.569
 Basic - 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.819
 It's going to be difficult for those in the early stages of each chapter. 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.180
 Please do 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.839
 If 10 seconds is strong, it will be very easy later. 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:09.079
 You guys are going to happen again. 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.980
 Then, in a moment 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.479
 second 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.480
 I'll meet you on the ground. 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.860
 Not.
