so<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.740> 3d<00:03:53.010> def<00:03:53.400> slider<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.240> right<00:03:54.360> up

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
so the 3d def slider to the right up

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:07.350 
so the 3d def slider to the right up
Rashmi<00:03:55.020> knob<00:03:55.230> everyone

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.240 

it's<00:04:08.360> got<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.540> lot<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.810> calibration<00:04:09.650> effects

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
it's got a lot of calibration effects

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:18.870 
it's got a lot of calibration effects
here<00:04:11.560> activating<00:04:12.560> 3d<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.730> one<00:04:17.350> amazing

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
here activating 3d to one amazing

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.340 
here activating 3d to one amazing
obviously<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:19.970> cannot<00:04:20.209> see<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.049> fading

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
obviously you cannot see the fading

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.150 
obviously you cannot see the fading
effect<00:04:21.650> on<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:23.240> video<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:24.680> have<00:04:24.800> seen<00:04:25.070> this

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
effect on this video we have seen this

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.550 
effect on this video we have seen this
for<00:04:25.370> yourself

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
for yourself

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.439 
for yourself
this<00:04:28.130> screen<00:04:28.370> is<00:04:28.400> made<00:04:28.669> by<00:04:28.850> sharp<00:04:29.180> it's<00:04:29.360> a

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
this screen is made by sharp it's a

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.430 
this screen is made by sharp it's a
parallax<00:04:29.990> barrier<00:04:30.380> screen<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:32.000> projects<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.810> I

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
parallax barrier screen it projects to I

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.020 
parallax barrier screen it projects to I
think<00:04:34.010> it<00:04:34.070> alternate<00:04:34.490> from<00:04:34.850> what<00:04:35.000> I

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
think it alternate from what I

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.740 
think it alternate from what I
understand<00:04:35.419> it<00:04:35.540> alternates<00:04:35.930> two<00:04:37.750> images

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
understand it alternates two images

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.390 
understand it alternates two images
simultaneously<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.710> give<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:39.979> illusion<00:04:40.190> of

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
simultaneously to give the illusion of

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.200 
simultaneously to give the illusion of
death<00:04:40.669> free<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:41.690> do<00:04:41.900> so<00:04:42.699> I've<00:04:43.699> got<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.000> lot<00:04:44.180> more

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
death free to do so I've got a lot more

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.180 
death free to do so I've got a lot more
our<00:04:44.510> calibration<00:04:44.870> stuff<00:04:45.320> going<00:04:45.590> on<00:04:45.680> here<00:04:45.919> so

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
our calibration stuff going on here so

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.870 
our calibration stuff going on here so
I'll<00:04:46.699> plug<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.300> video<00:04:47.660> back<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:48.080> when<00:04:48.919> playing

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
I'll plug the video back on when playing

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.000 
I'll plug the video back on when playing
actual<00:04:50.300> games<00:04:50.510> or<00:04:50.720> whatever<00:04:50.900> right<00:04:51.440> so<00:04:51.800> this
