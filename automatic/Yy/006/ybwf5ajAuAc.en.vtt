00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 And then guys, finally I came back with 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.230
 another video after my 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.660
 tendinitis healed by eight and quotes do not want 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.000
 part of excel will never cure 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.580
 finally I came back to talk about some 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.670
 Curiosities about the united states that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 maybe you already know the houses or not 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.720
 really does not have a gate that most 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.730
 before I came here on my 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.470
 adolescence when watching movies and 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.660
 American series I always stayed 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.090
 thinking my why these people always 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.309
 They enter houses through the gate and not 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.890
 Ring the doorbell and go straight to the door. 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.380
 the houses also not some garage 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 so there's a certain Jorge juan henrique 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.969
 flame that is a space that you for a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.160
 car in front of your house with theft 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.950
 by car here is not as common as in 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.020
 Brazil people steal cars 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.440
 even though you are inside them you 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.449
 stops on the street and has some areas on the street 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.090
 it is reserved for people who 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.280
 they live around which are usually 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.829
 regions of houses that do not have a 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.589
 nor joy the houses are made of wood 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.150
 there is nothing concrete and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.000
 cement says you remember 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.350

 niece speaks more than her size 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.549

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.759
 My mother's family is in business to wash the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.189
 Dishware in the hand does not exist 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.990

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.869
 who knows this business of passing by 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.820
 clothes killing themselves intensely ours not 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.909

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.500
 clothes do not come out very mass to 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.380
 unless it's that much shirt 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.509

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.790
 a lot of laundry does not strip the dryer 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.540
 I already wear a skirt and the staff does not run. 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.619

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.500
 choose the one from the holy day in the cold in the snow 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.120
 in the heat in the dark they run all the time 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.060
 some mothers get a child in the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.530
 cart which bought them a cart 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.599

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.900
 I think they follow an agreement after 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.480
 My house is gringo's little business. 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.069
