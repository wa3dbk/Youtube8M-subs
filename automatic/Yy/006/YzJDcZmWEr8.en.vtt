00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.860
 in 1991 in the province of santa fe 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.599
 Argentina an expert fell you can 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.980
 see wants to know the story wants 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.680
 know what is behind this and what is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
 what has happened in other parts of the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.919
 planet join us in the next 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.919
 zero point research 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.180
 point 0 well this is a sphere that was 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.950
 donated by a Rosario archaeologist because 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.510
 this sphere fell in the locality of 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.270
 Casilda in the Province of Santa Fe in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.790
 1991 and this when it was donated I always 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.390
 I thought our team thought that it is 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.300
 this one from the holes of the russian Soyuz probe 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.640
 7 because at that time he had an accident 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.379
 and was leaving remains along 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.170
 our country to the province of 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.170
 mendoza or that this one but I have 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.470
 happened things that although this I follow 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.930
 thinking that it's 87 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.330
 unfortunately this or rather to 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.550
 this pleasantly for me I had the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.649
 opportunity to share with alexander 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.820
 balankin that his Russian cosmonauts in a 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.160
 world congress in 2006 and there it is 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.550
 I took the sphere for him to tell me 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.340
 if she belonged to 87 and did not know her 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.979
 he said neither at 87 nor at any other not the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.560
 knew the sphere had just in a 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.159
 soyuz that went towards the russian station mir 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.219
 because he had to 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.649
 the certain things and this was one of 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.109
 the Russian astronauts who in marx was 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.780
 floating in space for seven 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:53.689
 hours that is a person by 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.969
 other qualified but this one would already be 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.119
 go into detail that sincerely 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.130
 I do not know but he said he did not know him 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.679
 and that really caught my attention 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.310
 because there are so many spheres 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.470
 I think there are several spheres in Mexico 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.400
 also found in Spain in others 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.470
 countries where this classroom really 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.470
 Spain was analyzed by Ballester Elms 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.290
 an excellent Spanish researcher who 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.019
 took as a phenomenon be hidden 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.879
 even because apparently they have 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.190
 taken to that sphere sincerely 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.579
 I not know what was the end of it 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.359
 but honestly we do not know to what 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.910
 keep us well weighs weighs 8 kilos in your 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:40.549
 interior is perfectly the whole or 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.849
 are not two half cups say 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.750
 joined by a weld if you have a 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.540
 welding thing that asks the common 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.390
 and he told me that in space there is no 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.760
 welding that holds that is that we have 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.030
 a lot of data that we honestly do not know 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.190
 this to think about it I continue 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.380
 thinking that since the 87 because it gives the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.750
 chance that was found justly 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.270
 when this probe had an accident 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.970
 our to the vertical of our country 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.600
 has this one mouth that evidently 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.440
 something attached was embedded, let's say 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.230
 then have this here back that really 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.440
 no no I do not have a significance 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.400
 concrete to explain what should be 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.890
 honestly if this charger 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.220
 something we absolutely do not know 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.260
 which is how it was found but it is 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.140
 that I do not have much more elements because 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.500
 have wanted to come this to make you 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.540
 analysis but it happens that as is 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.660
 perfectly whole I do not want the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.420
 It would depart really very sorry I know 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.220
 that this in Mexico there is one that is broken 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.920
 the part of one of its poles 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.380
 could any scientist communicate 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.240
 with mexico and get a rest of this 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.880
 break this to the truth that I do not have 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.520
 No wish is not of these 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.060
 sincerely if studies have been done 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.180
 but superficial, that is, if there is this 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.220
 some energy that can result 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.980
 malignant for the man if you can touch 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.709
 or not no, not absolutely resolved at all 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.600
 dangerous this so it's in the museum 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.560
 simply as one of the many 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.560
 pieces that we have 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.970
 yes 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.950
 yes 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.200
 it's like a kind of demarcation 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.800
 notice that you have this as if it were a 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.470
 perfect drawing that has relief 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.440
 even because if you touch it you have a 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.600
 embossed as something that protects or goes 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.600
 to know that we honestly do not know 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.340
 you hope that at a certain moment 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.430
 Maybe it can come from some agency 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.050
 space maybe from russia maybe usa or from 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.820
 some other country we do not know until the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.490
 moment for investigations are 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.720
 open in various parts of the world my 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.720
 Name Yohanan DÃ­az Vargas 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.360
 Y 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.800
 good
