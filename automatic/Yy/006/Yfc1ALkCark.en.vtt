gold and silver again it's it's pretty

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.170 
gold and silver again it's it's pretty
neat<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.829> Quranic<00:03:01.430> I've<00:03:01.910> learned

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
neat in the in the Quranic I've learned

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.449 
neat in the in the Quranic I've learned
it<00:03:02.810> only<00:03:03.019> mentions<00:03:03.440> two<00:03:03.650> types<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.129> currency

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
it only mentions two types of currency

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.119 
it only mentions two types of currency
and<00:03:04.879> that<00:03:05.420> was<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.900> gold<00:03:06.349> dinar<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:07.040> the

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
and that was the gold dinar and the

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.160 
and that was the gold dinar and the
silver<00:03:07.549> dirham<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.239> that's<00:03:08.810> what<00:03:09.019> they're

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
silver dirham and that's what they're

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.520 
silver dirham and that's what they're
actually<00:03:09.379> making<00:03:09.940> right<00:03:10.940> now<00:03:10.970> manna<00:03:11.870> people

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
actually making right now manna people

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.520 
actually making right now manna people
are<00:03:12.650> trading<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.310> their<00:03:13.549> fiat<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.810> using

are trading in their fiat and using

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.379 
are trading in their fiat and using
these<00:03:16.130> coins<00:03:17.829> it's<00:03:18.829> pretty<00:03:19.130> another<00:03:20.060> thing<00:03:20.269> I

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
these coins it's pretty another thing I

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.629 
these coins it's pretty another thing I
thought<00:03:20.569> was<00:03:20.870> really<00:03:21.109> interesting<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.130> in<00:03:22.579> the

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
thought was really interesting is in the

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.140 
thought was really interesting is in the
Quran<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.690> guess<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:25.250> I'm<00:03:25.489> certainly<00:03:25.970> no

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
Quran I guess and I'm certainly no

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.720 
Quran I guess and I'm certainly no
expert<00:03:26.180> on<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.810> Quran<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.560> people<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.609> are

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
expert on the Quran so people that are

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.059 
expert on the Quran so people that are
can<00:03:29.030> certainly<00:03:29.450> correct<00:03:29.750> me<00:03:29.989> but<00:03:30.139> based<00:03:30.709> on<00:03:30.920> my

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
can certainly correct me but based on my

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.490 
can certainly correct me but based on my
readings<00:03:31.549> it<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:32.299> seems<00:03:32.660> as<00:03:32.900> though<00:03:33.049> that<00:03:33.079> you

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
readings it it seems as though that you

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.039 
readings it it seems as though that you
know<00:03:33.590> assets<00:03:34.130> paper<00:03:34.579> assets<00:03:35.150> like<00:03:35.389> bonds<00:03:35.690> and

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
know assets paper assets like bonds and

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.099 
know assets paper assets like bonds and
shares<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.709> promissory<00:03:37.280> notes<00:03:37.609> those<00:03:38.450> are

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
shares and promissory notes those are

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.309 
shares and promissory notes those are
not<00:03:39.470> considered<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:41.150> be<00:03:41.299> in<00:03:41.630> line<00:03:41.930> with<00:03:42.200> the

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
not considered to be in line with the

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.080 
not considered to be in line with the
teachings<00:03:42.799> of<00:03:43.130> Islam<00:03:44.169> so<00:03:45.169> they<00:03:45.889> are<00:03:46.220> like<00:03:46.970> I

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
teachings of Islam so they are like I

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.050 
teachings of Islam so they are like I
said<00:03:47.120> there's<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.750> big<00:03:47.989> push<00:03:48.200> right<00:03:48.440> now<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:49.060> get
