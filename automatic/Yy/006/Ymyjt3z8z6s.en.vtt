room isn't as I personally thought the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.220

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
briefcase is not on the line i've bought

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.720 
briefcase is not on the line i've bought
this<00:00:22.410> match<00:00:22.650> probably<00:00:23.039> would<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.250> had<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.609> i

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
this match probably would have had it i

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.370 
this match probably would have had it i
think<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.090> would<00:00:24.269> add<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> match<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
think this would add it to the match and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.779 
think this would add it to the match and
also<00:00:25.890> i<00:00:25.920> wouldn't<00:00:26.189> mind<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> scene<00:00:26.670> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
a team Rhodes Scholars you know they

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.869 
a team Rhodes Scholars you know they
weren't<00:00:43.500> very<00:00:43.590> successful<00:00:43.980> they<00:00:44.520> never<00:00:44.730> won

weren't very successful they never won

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
weren't very successful they never won
the<00:00:44.910> tag<00:00:45.210> team<00:00:45.450> belts<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:45.989> should<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.350> won

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
the tag team belts they should have won

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.470 
the tag team belts they should have won
them<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.550> never<00:00:47.700> won<00:00:47.969> they'll<00:00:48.180> attack

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
them but they never won they'll attack

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.209 
them but they never won they'll attack
team<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.870> attacked<00:00:49.320> him<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:49.770> quite<00:00:49.920> some

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
team we attacked him in for quite some

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.549 
team we attacked him in for quite some
time<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:51.860> guess<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.250> an<00:00:53.340> injury<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
time and I guess I think an injury to

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.450 
time and I guess I think an injury to
Cody<00:00:55.559> Rhodes<00:00:55.860> also<00:00:56.780> ruined<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.079> ruined<00:00:58.460> their

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
Cody Rhodes also ruined and ruined their

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
Cody Rhodes also ruined and ruined their
momentum<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.359> Cody<00:01:00.570> Rhodes<00:01:00.719> came<00:01:01.020> back

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
momentum and then Cody Rhodes came back

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.529 
momentum and then Cody Rhodes came back
and<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:01.640> formed<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> team<00:01:03.030> again<00:01:03.359> they

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and they formed as a team again they

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.090 
and they formed as a team again they
never<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:03.870> got<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.229> again<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:06.479> think

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
never really got going again and I think

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.280 
never really got going again and I think
the<00:01:08.100> best<00:01:08.310> thing<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.880> these<00:01:09.600> two<00:01:09.810> guys<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.260> a

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.170 
intelligence and picked the right moment
so<00:03:31.950> having<00:03:32.950> him<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.129> the<00:03:33.280> briefcase<00:03:33.760> i<00:03:33.940> think

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
so having him have the briefcase i think

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.240 
so having him have the briefcase i think
does<00:03:34.690> more<00:03:34.989> for<00:03:35.019> Santa<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.530> think<00:03:35.739> Cody<00:03:35.980> Rhodes

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
does more for Santa I think Cody Rhodes

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.520 
does more for Santa I think Cody Rhodes
I<00:03:36.639> wouldn't<00:03:37.329> mind<00:03:37.540> seeing<00:03:37.840> him<00:03:37.989> just<00:03:38.169> be<00:03:38.260> built

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
I wouldn't mind seeing him just be built

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.369 
I wouldn't mind seeing him just be built
up<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:39.090> when<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.209> when<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.750> world<00:03:40.959> whatever

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
up and when it when the world whatever

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.050 
up and when it when the world whatever
championship<00:03:41.829> belt<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.280> think<00:03:42.730> he's<00:03:42.879> good

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
championship belt I think he's good

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.270 
championship belt I think he's good
enough<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.359> think<00:03:43.389> he<00:03:43.769> should<00:03:44.769> have<00:03:44.859> been<00:03:44.919> in

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
enough I think he should have been in

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.670 
enough I think he should have been in
the<00:03:45.310> title<00:03:45.730> picture<00:03:46.230> beforehand<00:03:47.230> but<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.470> don't

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
the title picture beforehand but I don't

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.140 
the title picture beforehand but I don't
know<00:03:47.769> what<00:03:47.980> W<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.459> really<00:03:48.699> doing<00:03:48.940> with<00:03:49.060> him

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
know what W is really doing with him

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.430 
know what W is really doing with him
they're<00:03:49.269> not<00:03:49.480> too<00:03:49.720> sure<00:03:49.930> what<00:03:50.109> they're<00:03:50.230> doing

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
they're not too sure what they're doing

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.930 
they're not too sure what they're doing
with<00:03:50.530> him<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.859> think<00:03:51.280> they've<00:03:51.400> given<00:03:51.549> him<00:03:51.699> some

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
with him I think they've given him some

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.180 
with him I think they've given him some
pushes<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.569> he<00:03:53.139> just<00:03:53.379> hasn't<00:03:53.590> been<00:03:53.739> able<00:03:53.949> to

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
pushes and he just hasn't been able to

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.550 
pushes and he just hasn't been able to
run<00:03:54.400> with<00:03:54.549> it<00:03:54.699> and<00:03:54.879> I<00:03:55.720> think<00:03:55.900> he<00:03:55.959> needs<00:03:56.169> to<00:03:56.319> find

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
run with it and I think he needs to find

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.920 
run with it and I think he needs to find
his<00:03:56.949> character<00:03:57.519> is<00:03:57.669> just<00:03:57.699> a<00:03:58.150> bit<00:03:58.660> bland

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
his character is just a bit bland

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.539 
his character is just a bit bland
there's<00:03:59.260> nothing<00:03:59.530> really<00:03:59.709> about<00:04:00.069> him<00:04:00.250> nothing

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
there's nothing really about him nothing

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.129 
there's nothing really about him nothing
really<00:04:00.790> different<00:04:00.970> about<00:04:01.209> him<00:04:01.629> so<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:01.840> think<00:04:02.079> he

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
really different about him so I think he

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.890 
really different about him so I think he
needs<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.470> kind<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.769> find<00:04:03.040> who<00:04:03.730> he<00:04:03.940> is<00:04:04.150> buying

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
needs to kind of find who he is buying

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.800 
needs to kind of find who he is buying
the<00:04:05.019> character<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.470> works<00:04:05.829> for<00:04:06.040> him<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.810> go

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
the character that works for him and go

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.750 
the character that works for him and go
from<00:04:07.989> there<00:04:08.199> I<00:04:08.470> think<00:04:09.280> that's<00:04:09.370> always<00:04:09.639> gonna

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
from there I think that's always gonna

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.580 
from there I think that's always gonna
hold<00:04:10.120> Cody<00:04:10.419> Rhodes<00:04:10.599> back<00:04:10.900> until<00:04:11.230> he<00:04:11.260> finds

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
hold Cody Rhodes back until he finds

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.909 
hold Cody Rhodes back until he finds
like<00:04:11.859> finds<00:04:12.639> that<00:04:12.730> character<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.440> I'm<00:04:14.440> Sandow

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
like finds that character and I'm Sandow

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.469 
like finds that character and I'm Sandow
has<00:04:14.949> got<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.519> character<00:04:16.030> whether<00:04:16.239> or<00:04:16.389> not

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
has got that character whether or not

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.550 
has got that character whether or not
it's<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.840> main<00:04:17.079> event<00:04:17.440> whatever

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
it's a main event whatever

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.690 
it's a main event whatever
championship-caliber<00:04:20.560> character<00:04:21.250> I'm<00:04:21.459> not

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
championship-caliber character I'm not

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.950 
championship-caliber character I'm not
too<00:04:21.909> sure

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
too sure

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.150 
too sure
lot<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.050> people<00:04:23.229> don't<00:04:23.650> think<00:04:23.889> it<00:04:23.979> is<00:04:24.130> that

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
lot of people don't think it is that

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.070 
lot of people don't think it is that
they<00:04:24.490> believe<00:04:24.789> it's<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.030> midcard<00:04:25.270> character<00:04:25.900> I

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
they believe it's a midcard character I

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.650 
they believe it's a midcard character I
think<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:27.009> could<00:04:27.280> go<00:04:27.759> either<00:04:27.789> way<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.449> mean

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
think it could go either way I mean

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.350 
think it could go either way I mean
Santa<00:04:29.229> has<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.590> talent<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:30.069> pull<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.430> off<00:04:30.550> to

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
Santa has the talent to pull it off to

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.860 
Santa has the talent to pull it off to
make<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:32.020> world<00:04:32.289> championship<00:04:32.800> caliber

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
make it a world championship caliber

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.990 
make it a world championship caliber
character<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.530> he<00:04:36.009> has<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.370> but<00:04:36.550> as<00:04:36.729> the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
character and he has the but as the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.790 
character and he has the but as the
briefcase<00:04:37.479> and<00:04:37.840> he's<00:04:38.110> not<00:04:38.259> going<00:04:38.349> to<00:04:38.440> lose<00:04:38.590> the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
briefcase and he's not going to lose the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.600 
briefcase and he's not going to lose the
briefcase<00:04:39.660> thankfully<00:04:40.949> so<00:04:41.949> that's<00:04:42.099> good<00:04:42.370> I

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
briefcase thankfully so that's good I

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.659 
briefcase thankfully so that's good I
think<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.740> constantly<00:04:44.740> stand<00:04:45.039> out<00:04:45.220> cashing<00:04:45.580> it

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
think I constantly stand out cashing it

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.059 
think I constantly stand out cashing it
in<00:04:45.699> until<00:04:45.910> Survivor<00:04:46.389> Series<00:04:46.690> at<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.139> earliest

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
in until Survivor Series at the earliest

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.580 
in until Survivor Series at the earliest
in<00:04:48.400> my<00:04:48.880> opinion<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.599> mean<00:04:50.080> he<00:04:50.169> needs<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.500> be

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
in my opinion I mean he needs to be

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.770 
in my opinion I mean he needs to be
built<00:04:50.800> up<00:04:51.009> the<00:04:51.729> thing<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.000> money<00:04:52.419> in<00:04:52.509> the<00:04:52.539> bank

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
built up the thing is money in the bank

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.219 
built up the thing is money in the bank
guys<00:04:52.990> they<00:04:53.530> always<00:04:54.069> lose<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:55.330> lose<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:56.139> lose

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
guys they always lose and lose and lose

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.420 
guys they always lose and lose and lose
so<00:04:57.039> it<00:04:57.400> makes<00:04:57.970> logic<00:04:58.449> that<00:04:59.009> Damien<00:05:00.009> Sandow

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
so it makes logic that Damien Sandow

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.370 
so it makes logic that Damien Sandow
will<00:05:00.580> probably<00:05:01.060> lose<00:05:01.240> this<00:05:01.479> match<00:05:01.720> Cody<00:05:02.139> Ross

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
will probably lose this match Cody Ross

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.920 
will probably lose this match Cody Ross
of<00:05:02.590> course<00:05:02.830> did<00:05:03.430> turn<00:05:03.699> baby<00:05:03.970> face<00:05:04.270> from<00:05:04.750> this

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
of course did turn baby face from this

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.050 
of course did turn baby face from this
feud<00:05:05.259> so<00:05:05.560> they're<00:05:06.190> probably<00:05:06.220> going<00:05:06.669> to<00:05:06.880> give

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
feud so they're probably going to give

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.939 
feud so they're probably going to give
Cody<00:05:07.300> Rhodes<00:05:07.449> a<00:05:07.599> bit<00:05:07.720> of<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:07.870> push<00:05:08.139> but<00:05:08.919> I

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
Cody Rhodes a bit of a push but I

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.620 
Cody Rhodes a bit of a push but I
wouldn't<00:05:09.250> mind<00:05:09.370> seeing<00:05:09.729> these<00:05:09.820> guys<00:05:10.060> these

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
wouldn't mind seeing these guys these

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.570 
wouldn't mind seeing these guys these
two<00:05:11.050> guys<00:05:11.229> have<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.560> bit<00:05:11.680> of<00:05:11.770> a<00:05:11.830> series<00:05:12.250> you<00:05:12.460> know

two guys have a bit of a series you know

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.890 
two guys have a bit of a series you know
don't<00:05:12.820> just<00:05:13.030> have<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.270> one<00:05:13.419> match<00:05:13.660> because

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
don't just have the one match because

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.909 
don't just have the one match because
they<00:05:14.530> have<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.710> one<00:05:14.949> match<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:16.740> send<00:05:17.740> our

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
they have the one match and send our

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.360 
they have the one match and send our
wins<00:05:18.220> then<00:05:19.349> that<00:05:20.349> would<00:05:20.590> make<00:05:20.770> sense<00:05:21.069> if<00:05:21.250> they

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
wins then that would make sense if they

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.830 
wins then that would make sense if they
were<00:05:21.430> one<00:05:21.610> month<00:05:21.819> one<00:05:22.090> match<00:05:22.330> to<00:05:22.360> Cody<00:05:22.690> Rhodes
