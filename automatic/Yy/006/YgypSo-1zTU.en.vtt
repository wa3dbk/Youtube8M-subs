00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
distorted to where it would be

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.020 
distorted to where it would be
completely<00:03:29.200> unusable<00:03:29.770> that<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.370> no<00:03:30.640> longer<00:03:30.820> a

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
completely unusable that is no longer a

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.210 
completely unusable that is no longer a
problem<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.930> notice<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.680> when<00:03:32.800> importing

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
problem I notice that when importing

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.949 
problem I notice that when importing
videos<00:03:33.520> and<00:03:33.790> looking<00:03:34.030> at<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.239> sound<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.690> still

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
videos and looking at the sound it still

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.199 
videos and looking at the sound it still
hits<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.440> red<00:03:35.680> zone<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.580> point<00:03:36.940> where<00:03:37.000> it's

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
hits the red zone to a point where it's

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.750 
hits the red zone to a point where it's
uncomfortable<00:03:38.020> I<00:03:38.320> hope<00:03:38.560> they<00:03:38.800> further<00:03:39.310> fix

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
uncomfortable I hope they further fix

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.370 
uncomfortable I hope they further fix
that<00:03:40.030> because<00:03:40.270> it's<00:03:40.450> kind<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.720> ridiculous<00:03:40.870> and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
that because it's kind of ridiculous and

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.530 
that because it's kind of ridiculous and
stupid<00:03:41.410> but<00:03:41.890> at<00:03:42.340> least<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.730> audio<00:03:43.060> in<00:03:43.360> your

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
stupid but at least the audio in your

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.080 
stupid but at least the audio in your
videos<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:43.989> is<00:03:44.320> now<00:03:44.650> usable<00:03:45.310> also<00:03:45.820> an

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
videos and is now usable also an

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.400 
videos and is now usable also an
interesting<00:03:46.570> thing<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:46.870> they've<00:03:47.020> done<00:03:47.260> with

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
interesting thing that they've done with

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.680 
interesting thing that they've done with
video<00:03:47.830> is<00:03:48.190> that<00:03:48.489> when<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:48.760> are<00:03:48.880> recording<00:03:49.330> you

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
video is that when you are recording you

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.229 
video is that when you are recording you
now<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.900> option<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.530> pause<00:03:51.010> in<00:03:51.459> video<00:03:51.880> that's

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
now the option to pause in video that's

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.780 
now the option to pause in video that's
something<00:03:52.570> that's<00:03:52.690> really<00:03:53.170> rare<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:54.280> wish

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
something that's really rare and I wish

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.580 
something that's really rare and I wish
that<00:03:55.030> even<00:03:55.360> my<00:03:55.480> video<00:03:55.750> cameras<00:03:56.200> would<00:03:56.350> have

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
that even my video cameras would have

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.440 
that even my video cameras would have
that<00:03:56.860> so<00:03:57.430> watch<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:58.030> can<00:03:58.120> hit<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.330> pause

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
that so watch this you can hit the pause

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.470 
that so watch this you can hit the pause
button<00:03:58.510> I'm<00:03:59.080> at<00:03:59.350> 19<00:03:59.830> seconds<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:01.239> sits

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
button I'm at 19 seconds and it sits

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.150 
button I'm at 19 seconds and it sits
there<00:04:01.720> at<00:04:01.810> 19<00:04:02.140> seconds<00:04:02.500> it's<00:04:02.650> not<00:04:02.830> going<00:04:03.070> to

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
there at 19 seconds it's not going to

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.590 
there at 19 seconds it's not going to
record<00:04:03.520> anything<00:04:03.760> else<00:04:04.030> but<00:04:04.239> at<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.420> same

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
record anything else but at the same

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.170 
record anything else but at the same
time<00:04:04.810> you're<00:04:05.080> not<00:04:05.290> stopping<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:06.340> having<00:04:07.000> to

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
time you're not stopping and having to

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.300 
time you're not stopping and having to
start<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.720> new<00:04:07.750> video<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.590> i<00:04:08.620> can<00:04:08.709> literally

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
start a new video so i can literally

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.210 
start a new video so i can literally
just<00:04:09.610> hit<00:04:09.820> resume<00:04:10.330> now<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:11.290> can<00:04:11.500> see<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:12.070> got

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
just hit resume now you can see it's got

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.330 
just hit resume now you can see it's got
22<00:04:12.760> 23<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:13.750> then<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:14.500> can<00:04:14.650> stop<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.160> clip

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
22 23 and then you can stop the clip

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.280 
22 23 and then you can stop the clip
altogether<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.180> just<00:04:16.209> create<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.750> new<00:04:16.989> video

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
altogether and just create a new video

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.240 
altogether and just create a new video
clip<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:17.919> find<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.220> really<00:04:18.580> cool

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
clip so I find that really cool

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.069 
clip so I find that really cool
especially<00:04:19.640> if<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:20.000> like<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.329> do<00:04:20.480> on<00:04:20.510> screen

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
especially if you like to do on screen

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.170 
especially if you like to do on screen
editing<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:22.340> makes<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.640> convenient<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.150> can

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
editing it makes it convenient you can

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.730 
editing it makes it convenient you can
just<00:04:23.390> simply<00:04:23.630> pause<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.230> go<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.560> film

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
just simply pause it and go and film

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.320 
just simply pause it and go and film
something<00:04:24.980> else<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.520> then<00:04:25.610> pause<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.180> go

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
something else and then pause it and go

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.450 
something else and then pause it and go
to<00:04:26.390> another<00:04:26.960> thing<00:04:27.260> your<00:04:27.770> brother<00:04:27.980> is<00:04:28.100> blowing

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
to another thing your brother is blowing

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.950 
to another thing your brother is blowing
out<00:04:28.580> his<00:04:28.670> candles<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.360> don't<00:04:29.540> know<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.840> then

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
out his candles I don't know and then

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.560 
out his candles I don't know and then
you<00:04:29.990> can<00:04:30.140> do<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.350> aftermath<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.420> see<00:04:32.420> him

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
you can do the aftermath and see him

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.450 
you can do the aftermath and see him
opening<00:04:32.900> his<00:04:32.960> presents<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:33.890> that<00:04:34.100> allows<00:04:34.310> you

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
opening his presents so that allows you

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.160 
opening his presents so that allows you
to<00:04:34.490> do<00:04:34.700> that<00:04:34.850> simply<00:04:35.210> by<00:04:35.330> pushing<00:04:35.660> pause<00:04:35.990> I

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
to do that simply by pushing pause I

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.920 
to do that simply by pushing pause I
want<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.410> test<00:04:36.620> something<00:04:36.740> though<00:04:37.690> what<00:04:38.690> will

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
want to test something though what will

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:48.060 
want to test something though what will
happen<00:04:39.500> if<00:04:39.770> i<00:04:40.580> push<00:04:40.820> pause<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:43.330> lock<00:04:44.330> it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.100 

will<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.430> let<00:04:49.640> me<00:04:49.700> still<00:04:50.210> resume<00:04:50.720> is<00:04:50.960> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
will it let me still resume is the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.560 
will it let me still resume is the
question<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.280> seems<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:52.700> when<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.180> lock

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
question so it seems that when you lock

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.230 
question so it seems that when you lock
the<00:04:53.930> device<00:04:54.020> even<00:04:54.710> if<00:04:54.830> you've<00:04:54.950> paused<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:55.640> it

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
the device even if you've paused it it

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.090 
the device even if you've paused it it
will<00:04:56.419> automatically<00:04:56.930> want<00:04:57.260> you<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.590> record<00:04:57.950> a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
will automatically want you to record a

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.490 
will automatically want you to record a
new<00:04:58.130> clip<00:04:58.780> something<00:04:59.780> else<00:04:59.960> cool<00:05:00.290> is<00:05:00.440> that

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
new clip something else cool is that

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.350 
new clip something else cool is that
when<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.980> hold<00:05:01.340> down<00:05:01.580> your<00:05:01.640> home<00:05:02.060> button<00:05:02.330> and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
when you hold down your home button and

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.030 
when you hold down your home button and
get<00:05:02.540> to<00:05:02.660> your<00:05:02.750> recent<00:05:03.140> apps<00:05:03.320> window<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:03.800> know

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
get to your recent apps window you know

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.700 
get to your recent apps window you know
of<00:05:04.160> a<00:05:04.250> menu<00:05:04.520> here<00:05:04.760> on<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.030> bottom<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:06.140> can<00:05:06.169> get

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
of a menu here on the bottom you can get

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.159 
of a menu here on the bottom you can get
to<00:05:07.190> your<00:05:07.520> running<00:05:07.850> applications<00:05:08.450> finally

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
to your running applications finally

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.710 
to your running applications finally
from<00:05:09.650> there<00:05:09.950> that's<00:05:10.310> quite<00:05:10.820> nice<00:05:11.030> I<00:05:11.360> can<00:05:11.510> end
