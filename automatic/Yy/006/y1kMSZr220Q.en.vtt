00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Devoted fans 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 in association with 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
 those who want you to stay 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 show 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 BECOME AT HOME, WALT 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 A real warrior. Super hero. Without him, we certainly would not have won this medal. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 His entry into the basket ... We all know how incredibly fast he can be. 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 And in fact, it is largely for him to come to matches. 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.900
 I love Walt, because he is always himself ... He never fakes anyone. 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.900
 When he plays, he always gives his best. He is my hero and he will always be. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.600
 And I'm for putting all my heart into the game. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 For the fact that he is fighting for his goals and that he never gives up. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 I would very much like you to stay, but you will decide. Zielona Góra loves you! 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 The decision is yours... 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.200
 The whole team ... 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.000
 Your fans ... 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.800
 ... we all miss you! 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 So come back ... 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 and stay home, Walt. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Stay in Zielona Góra.
