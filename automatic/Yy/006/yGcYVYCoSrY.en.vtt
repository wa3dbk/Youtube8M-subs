00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.940
 good these methods are a new video 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:08.139
 we are here in the bizarre eyes 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.389
 adventure I do not know what and basically 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.790
 is the delay the discharge from earlier in the 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:16.470
 history and such 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.580
 and I want to show the balls a little like that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.290
 you want to get a little the three 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.570
 characters can be a fight with each 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.550
 one and that is to say that I practiced almost 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.699
 nothing or 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.090
 that without a true grip that I am given 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.570
 pretty bad but it's pretty enough 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.910
 handsome the truth that it is a game of 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.590
 fighting you have 2d gameplay but not 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.659
 we can go to the sides by pressing a 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.159
 button is something strange I do not know I had not 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:44.159
 seen before I remember 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.910
 to be 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.190
 the special grant 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.019
 I love our game wants to take care 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.920
 the one who receives connective does this 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:04.510
 perfect you can eat 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.510
 and live it live 513 style let's go 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.250
 well I think bizarre eyes that's a 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.050
 manga or something like that I do not know is that I do not know 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.300
 I know I have no fucking idea I do not know 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.650
 even if it is pronounced in the same way 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.780
 three is shitting our winning 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.780
 heimtextil to porrillo 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.050
 on Thursday something like the street 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.110
 fighter in what are combos and so on 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.360
 half moons and this but sometimes it's 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.640
 very slow it gives the feeling that being 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.980
 you do not play practice like a last live 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.590
 or you do any then I'll throw you there 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.840
 couple of hours like that to see if I can play 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.090
 well and if I see that I can play well I'll 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 I will surely buy to upload the video 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.840
 because he 's pretty cool 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 quiet 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.720
 I know how something has been good 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.600
 bust me 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.890
 the fucked up dirty 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.760
 is that sometimes it is as very slow as 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.050
 that we are left to the enemy and I and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.790
 they all show 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.180
 it is very very very state with a heart 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.180
 but I like it a lot 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.590
 regards 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.470
 and now in the next match he will catch me 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.550
 another fighter and nothing until now and 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.320
 here we are in a new combat of 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.840
 this great game is not the other character and 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.739
 it seems to me that it distributes more 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.700
 also weird queers if it deals 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.700
 more but it does very strange things 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.690
 with this being practiced nothing or nothing 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.300
 half moons and buttons have been extended 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.540
 to the rock to see if I find out something 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.160
 and if I get some things, you can 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.160
 do that too 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.799
 I can make a life that removes the type 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.799
 It's the typical 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.060
 bursting so much getting up is a 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.060
 bitch you fuck 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.310
 before falling 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.069
 very good 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.670
 not as a different group 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.670
 jover 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.380
 now how do i explain you ultra special 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:52.069
 from the entity to the entity and that I killed 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.060
 eat meats 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.950
 never 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.950
 knockout knockout 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:08.730
 audio flip point 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.730
 round 2 fight fight 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.190
 click 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.250
 that's cool 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.430
 and that you can cut it or not 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:29.039
 you can stop because it is a slower 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.039
 attack to another is flippantly mind inside 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.910
 or it picks up quickly the tranquillo of the 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.780
 I 'm really pressing a button on 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.230
 cancel 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.720
 well that's pretty much it catches it 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:46.330
 fast the essential but I imagine that 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.330
 make as handsome will cost the whole life 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.150
 do not 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.500
 I was loading software person to 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.000
 charge god 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.000
 as well as with the fact that 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.320
 do not 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.040
 we were shot like a fool 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.710
 Exterior 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.120
 and some kids we'll see each other in the next 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.240
 with the next character so far 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.580
 same 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.250
 well let's go with a new super battle 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.020
 the last one with the last character that 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.180
 I have left to use 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.180
 let's fight 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.200
 I am in character I do not like much is 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.430
 a little 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.430
 when it exists I liked it 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.680
 as you can see because they can be done 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.820
 long combos too but 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.820
 really not very well 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.749
 the as we might say they are 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.999
 similar to those of blas what would not be 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:56.639
 as I do not know it's very difficult to compare 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:56.639
 gender you away from our land 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.449
 God forgives especially 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.860
 my mother 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.860
 the flip action just this 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.900
 Hahaha 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.509
 I dirty 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.499
 suddenly to 10 10 hosts 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.210
 sometimes it 's when it's also a combo 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.210
 it is very for audio 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.490
 it's the only thing I do not like about this 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.490
 game 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.789
 There is power I think I could have done 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.789
 something 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:50.589
 and my God 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.689
 I do not know how it has 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:06.280
 pim pam 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.280
 nothing comes to you now 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.370
 I'm going to finish it 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.740
 Oh 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.180
 executed in you or does not die dies 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:29.449
 they arrived on this course and all time 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.449
 special grace let's review it 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:36.360
 the one who attacks takata will attack 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:36.360
 fair 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.470
 the eyes 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.470
 what font 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:50.950
 shit I ate it 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.950
 I have eaten superespecial 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:59.610
 there are plans for now now now 

00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:59.610
 and hours 

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:09.800
 in the gameplay I do not know I do not know how is the 

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:12.440
 game tell me how do you see it if you 

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.550
 liked if you do not like do not know we'll see 

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.710
 see what I do try to learn to 

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.030
 learn to play and if you like me 

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.330
 you end up buying it so nothing until the 

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.330
 next
