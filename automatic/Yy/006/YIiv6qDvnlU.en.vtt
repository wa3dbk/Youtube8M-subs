00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello together and welcome 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.170
 Back to a new fashion review today 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.639
 is there the all you want mod and without 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.139
 I shit that I may have often 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.179
 but that is one of the hottest 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.860
 if I even the ghost mod the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.990
 minecraft has ever seen 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.539
 so this mod you can every item 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.240
 every entity simply does everything in minecraft 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.580
 so adjust as you like the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.529
 means you can customize a flower so 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 could be adapted to a blade of grass that way 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.460
 grass blog so just adjust everything 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.929
 you can only imagine somehow 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.000
 and we'll just catch that one 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.950
 basics in quotation marks and that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.540
 how will the interface come for that 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.180
 he just goes to a normal inventory 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.010
 and click on anyone online 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.200
 learn inventory space it also works 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.270
 the following and la paz but I suppose 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.899
 always the main one was down here so is 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.760
 The easiest 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.620
 then you just click honor then comes 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.730
 their place in the menu looks at the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.379
 first look maybe a bit 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.930
 But it is not confusing at all 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.039
 it's hard to say and we leave 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.360
 Now just step by step 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.289
 I 'll just show you how it works 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.910
 whole works 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.899
 we can easily do it on any one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.129
 Click below to at 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.799
 Then we come through the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.229
 There are also many pages through it 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.880
 everything is not normal in minecraft 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.420
 is called woodblocks on all four 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.619
 sides of wood are surrounded immediately though 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.240
 Now let's go up here 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.740
 a stone then we have this in here 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.909
 is the old magic once and now 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.619
 we can still the number at the top 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.240
 that is, if we are 64 stones 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.240
 we want to have that you can enter 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.860
 then we still have the devil you 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.110
 but that brings us so well 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.240
 that's nothing but armor 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.640
 and for 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.970
 swords and so on necessary now 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.290
 we have our item lane below 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.810
 we say we can our team 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.899
 naming that means what once 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.020
 stone 1 then the whole 64 stones 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.549
 stone 1 and what a very cool we are 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.840
 can also give the whole a color 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.220
 give for that there is a code in 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.220
 minecraft and pay would have to do that 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.720
 law sign take that and then look 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.270
 some number behind with kg this 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.700
 I also believe or k did you 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.780
 such a citizen in the thing but that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.020
 Now I just want to mean we 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.630
 take the new songs here 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.190
 we are an orange green or so always 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.959
 krauth and I know exactly what I am doing 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.150
 Sorry but you can just that 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.319
 Just use the colors there 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.330
 internet is definitely there 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.860
 a list of minecraft and what also 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.450
 still cool so we have to be a kind 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.090
 that means we can stay up here as well 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.720
 a second leyen that means who 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.489
 with store 12 and it just means that 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.080
 12 is we can go over here and 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.630
 enter three 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.420
 is that then a 23 then we get 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.080
 again to pass up here 4 1 1 2 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.209
 3 4 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.680
 So just like that, let's click below 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.940
 on rare then we just have ours 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.400
 control 1 2 3 4 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.260
 we can set and that's it 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.450
 we'll just go ahead with that 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.799
 the tools or weapons because there 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.269
 There are still many things that 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.480
 Personally, I think it's really cool 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.320
 Just start as a place one man 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.320
 should also write correctly 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.670
 so take my diamond sword like 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.489
 just stay in and now it comes 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.549
 damage or damage line to use 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.049
 we can now simply the order 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.459
 enter sword that is when we enter 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.940
 The sword almost wants to break then 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:16.069
 Let's enter 1300 or so somehow 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.389
 Something like that has 1500 okay just 1500th 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.930
 we only get 60 more 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.730
 beat 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.769
 and if we now the Swiss 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.060
 have that completely so then let 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.980
 We just give it to me again 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.180
 here is pure damage from 0 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.920
 Now we can do it all again 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.150
 name where it is still cool we are 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.160
 can make all the requests 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.980
 unbreakable means it never will 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.239
 break is also down here 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.910
 and now we can do it again quickly 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.830
 to change 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.780
 I am also slowly getting something 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.210
 and now we come to the in chains 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.250
 because you can on all items all 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.290
 enchantment pack this in this game 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.840
 there is no case that menus 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.040
 again very simple 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.690
 you can just do everything on you her 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.300
 Can you cousin before that on the sword 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.030
 you can often make it hard 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.580
 we can find him on that 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.720
 so make all the chapman man sword 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.050
 do not normally have on the swords 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.940
 can 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.260
 then we click on save we get 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.250
 the sword in the inventory now we have 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.410
 as ldg sword with fatter of 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:15.170
 infiniti it is a rule that it works 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.170
 never broken and then water 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.710
 next we come to the player 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.840
 heart because here too there is one 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.940
 special features you can use 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.680
 Of course there are still very many 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.210
 many other things I do but in 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.460
 not all can show this video 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.170
 just look in the forum bit 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.120
 above there are all things again exactly 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.770
 and detailed in it but you should 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.970
 also a little fun on that 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.960
 motto so you can try it all out 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.460
 Just try it yourself a bit 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.290
 and just do it with the players 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.120
 continue as I said because here are 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.700
 again a special feature like the 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.080
 normal player has the damage because 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.700
 you have to go for three leagues, I know 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.920
 not why but it is just like that 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.600
 and what is special as I said 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.160
 we can enter the player next to it 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.410
 So if we had the player the cast 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.450
 crafter call french again correctly 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.020
 write us again as correct 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.120
 Write and then we also click save 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.050
 then we get a task rafters 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.880
 had 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.890
 and if we put the e10 then he has 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.180
 also my texture was formerly only with 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.580
 command blocks resp 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.960
 with command out of the normal 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.170
 boss possible as well as most 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.210
 looked out of this mod and thats easy 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.650
 very cool especially because all the items 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.510
 you put with this mother 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.120
 multiplayer work too long 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.710
 creative on the server have so and then 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.420
 we get already to the relative 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.490
 Last I will tell you in this video 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.320
 wants to show because you can too 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:46.360
 fireworks yes custom designer is behind 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.310
 now just for this they are also 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.080
 again a custom button 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.680
 click to buy then we can all a 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.810
 give 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.040
 who is familiar with extra this time the 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.990
 can give here the colors from such a 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.110
 we now called something like that to 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.980
 what do I want to hurt? 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.450
 ff 80 yes and then we click on aetka 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.610
 and then we have out there with 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.100
 Colors are the fed color then 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.590
 the secondary color, so to speak 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.110
 we can do the same again 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.520
 we can take the league again then 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.620
 Can we take a smart one? 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.150
 can a load we can easily 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.910
 we'll do everything here now 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.400
 rod custom fade to custom something 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:28.490
 it would not be displayed now 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:31.050
 and then click on sase 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.960
 Celebrate rocket and the goals 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.870
 Shoot because they are very nice 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.060
 so I just have one now 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.050
 correct op until zusammengebastelt 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.580
 I do not know what I thought 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.040
 but I have it somehow funny 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.230
 found and indeed this armor has 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.660
 also a headset or something like that 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.430
 Similar to exit a speed 1 help 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.770
 springs a campus and a 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.380
 regeneration effect and has 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.190
 they resistance and protection fire 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.970
 protection 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.230
 that means I should actually now 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.990
 okay three games pleased with the fist 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.640
 So it is really tough if 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.560
 you think how fast you know how 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.660
 high you can jump and how the whole 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.610
 It's just so blatant and you 're off 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.990
 actually immortal and you have to 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:17.040
 you can imagine this armor 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.620
 even in normal on every server 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.730
 as long as creative have it and that
