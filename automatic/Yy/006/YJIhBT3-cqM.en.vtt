00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
different from running next to him

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.969

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.190 
compared to
my<00:02:09.459> video<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:11.140> like<00:02:12.069> better<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.909> be<00:02:13.090> next<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.959> him
