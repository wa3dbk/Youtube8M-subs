of the reason why didn't blog as much

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.340 
of the reason why didn't blog as much

about<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.060> didn't<00:00:27.840> want<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> make

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
about that but I didn't want to make

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
about that but I didn't want to make
content<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.920> takes<00:00:29.130> away<00:00:29.279> from<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.670> show

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
content that takes away from the show

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820 
content that takes away from the show
because<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.630> feels<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.109> most<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.650> things

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
because it feels like most of the things

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.610 
because it feels like most of the things
I<00:00:32.040> talk<00:00:32.309> about<00:00:32.630> would<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.809> relevant<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
I talk about would be relevant to the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.530 
I talk about would be relevant to the
show<00:00:34.829> cuz<00:00:35.130> uh<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.820> live<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> house<00:00:36.510> with

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
them and I don't want to spoil anything

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.670 
them and I don't want to spoil anything
because<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.360> showed<00:00:39.600> us<00:00:39.780> come<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.079> about<00:00:40.320> like

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
because it showed us come out about like

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.240 
because it showed us come out about like
maybe<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.190> week<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.790> after<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:43.200> fact<00:00:43.440> or<00:00:43.710> after

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
maybe a week to after the fact or after

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.420 
maybe a week to after the fact or after
what<00:00:44.430> has<00:00:44.610> actually<00:00:44.850> happened<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.930> so

what has actually happened here so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.529 
what has actually happened here so
that's<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> biggest<00:00:47.940> reasons<00:00:48.420> but

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that's one of the biggest reasons but

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299 
that's one of the biggest reasons but
moving<00:00:48.840> forward<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.200> feel<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.710> there's<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> lot
