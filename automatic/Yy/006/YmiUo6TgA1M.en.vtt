00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.080

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.280
 british 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.819
 part 14 or 15 March 20 do not pay see labels 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.269
 it comes to the number if there is something of a time why these numbers too and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.339
 speed driving away this normally costs namely chosen by me from the many 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.800
 submissions that there was a lot of demand for it 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 they were all such a wide standalone true 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.720
 also live ex response at youtube a truck page 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.619
 the figure is organized and it really comes to mind 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.260
 I mean it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.100
 if and is fat 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.690
 i would not know where were from the premier league that we have previously done with 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.200
 June 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.440
 click here it comes to a few days of corruption in the country the baby 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.610
 was about this 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.210
 mark shots for a b new york 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.950
 just take a good look yourself 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.660
 because off and on described in the bible for her is the parking operators 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.860
 goods until 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.490
 b billion to 3 9 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.450
 cj zitman what is that 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.020
 besides all this kind of people there is nothing for it 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.780
 this was a beggar 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.290
 suddenly 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.180
 that is a baby a 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.920
 a good result is the answer yes already did in the egyptian media 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 almere anp an egyptian channel you would say I have nothing to do with this time 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.060
 with the women 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.230
 but she is in fact in it 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.490
 then July 18 of may run on printout will probably not last long 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 position 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.479
 only in the region around that city 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.420
 the boys like the English language 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.800
 but I want to go get it again one day 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 I agree I have many responses from people 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.630
 yes that even unimaginable yourself a few times dangerous is positive but 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 how the hell do you get them in between 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.160
 or me 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.440
 with aggression 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.030
 just very many need an air duel 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.120
 whatever you can do is from serravalle in language of p 2 3 she is to 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.040
 der struijk second cutting 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.600
 9 do the rounds 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.000
 I look at it all day I immediately thought it was going and I touched us 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.449
 not to that 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.999
 like Ajax also updates for the finest van 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.009
 the plate unintentionally as one 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.859
 but other guitarists sit down believe it or not on such a short finger a 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.459
 the hema sausage on earth and 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.689
 age is it says never for each other 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.969

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.979
 in the stadium why not watch these tones 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.359
 And do this action yourself only with Clinton's state 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.079
 he doesn't become a flute 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.649
 with this 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:45.899
 we feel there 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.899
 the card is that this number go 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:54.929
 concentra media 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.629

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:08.129

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.339
 annemiek I spent 15 minutes explaining the agreement when I am allowed 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.360
 If you are allowed to own Cuban beer, then something will do with it 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.059

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.239
 grandfather's grandfather everyone who's watching I've heard and everyone just this guitar 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.389
 play that and don't smoke 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.789
 and the table all positive responses 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.789
 we will start with the number 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.919
 I like that with singing 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.999
 Rome residents a new school 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.589
 it would already be brief in between 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.919
 two are that man 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.069
 And should Apple Pear people watch out 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.050
 give up phone from k your own car from a dry how it was a whole other 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.050
 battle names a look always goes far from power 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.889
 and that no measure was reached on the other side 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.749
 you are also because beesd is told a bit Wednesday morning 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.749
 8 completely against it 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.809
 indeed 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.689
 the recruitment 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.449
 aniek rides with when I see I'm already there is going completely 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:20.960

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.600
 time is up 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.539
 for this lesson 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:58.779
 to return a battery to the room 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.409
 according to says 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.680
 you will naturally find angry reactions 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.659
 teach the Utrecht professor or fallout 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.099
 I am always available gent articles from could the positive responses 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.050
 it's not about it 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.210

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:20.539
