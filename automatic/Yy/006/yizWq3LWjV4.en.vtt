00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
think what are the things that most can

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.129 
think what are the things that most can
affect<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> future<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.389> humanity<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.900> I

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
affect the future of humanity and I

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.839 
affect the future of humanity and I
wanted<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.679> be<00:00:13.769> involved<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.460> least<00:00:14.610> some

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
wanted to be involved in at least some

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.430 
wanted to be involved in at least some
of<00:00:14.880> those<00:00:15.000> things<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.599> didn't<00:00:16.049> expect<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> be

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
of those things I didn't expect to be

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.130 
of those things I didn't expect to be
involved<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.830> all<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.070> them<00:00:17.539> but<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.690> mostly<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
involved in all of them but it mostly I

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.480

just wanting to be involved in things
that<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.789> thought<00:00:20.970> were<00:00:21.150> traumatic<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
that I thought were traumatic to the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.700 
that I thought were traumatic to the
future<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:23.810> to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.900> able<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> look<00:00:25.470> back<00:00:25.650> and

future and to be able to look back and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230 
future and to be able to look back and
say<00:00:25.980> okay<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> did<00:00:26.490> something<00:00:26.820> useful<00:00:26.970> there

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240

you<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.260> specific<00:00:28.740> role<00:00:28.949> models<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.750> were

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
you have specific role models that were

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
you have specific role models that were
influential<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> decisions<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.520> you

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
influential and the decisions that you

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.990 
influential and the decisions that you
made<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.620> or<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.309> some<00:00:35.760> type

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
made that you or was it just some type

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760 
made that you or was it just some type
of<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.420> an<00:00:36.660> internal<00:00:37.230> understanding

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
of you know an internal understanding

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.260 
of you know an internal understanding
that<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.640> needed<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.120> I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that this is what you needed to do I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.490 
that this is what you needed to do I
would<00:00:39.420> say<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.809> wouldn't<00:00:40.020> say<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.260> was<00:00:40.350> like

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
would say I wouldn't say there was like

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.990 
would say I wouldn't say there was like
one<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.280> wasn't<00:00:41.610> any<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:41.820> particular

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
one but it wasn't any one particular

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.280 
one but it wasn't any one particular
evolved<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.600> mean<00:00:42.750> there's<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:42.989> many<00:00:43.050> many

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
evolved I mean there's so many many

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.920 
evolved I mean there's so many many
people<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> admire<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.160> history<00:00:44.690> test<00:00:45.690> at

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
people that I admire in history test at

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
people that I admire in history test at
Tesla<00:00:46.170> obviously<00:00:46.620> doing<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> them<00:00:47.160> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
Tesla obviously doing one of them I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.299 
Tesla obviously doing one of them I
think<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.719> stems<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.800> had<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.129> like

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
think it stems because I had this like

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279 
think it stems because I had this like
existential<00:00:50.910> crisis<00:00:51.329> when<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.539> was<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> kid<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
existential crisis when I was a kid and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
existential crisis when I was a kid and
I<00:00:53.070> try<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.340> figure<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.610> what's<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.059> about

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
I try to figure out what's it all about

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.720 
I try to figure out what's it all about
and<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.870> none<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> books<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.160> read<00:00:56.309> seem<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and can none of the books I read seem to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.569 
and can none of the books I read seem to
actually<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> good<00:00:57.899> answer<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.399> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
actually have a good answer you know so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.160 
actually have a good answer you know so
I<00:00:59.609> said<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.000> read<00:01:00.180> all<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> religious<00:01:00.750> texts

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
I said I read all the religious texts

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.689 
I said I read all the religious texts
and<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.350> read<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> bunch<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.980> philosophy<00:01:02.460> books

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and I read a bunch of philosophy books

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.590 
and I read a bunch of philosophy books
and<00:01:03.030> they're<00:01:03.750> all<00:01:03.840> quite<00:01:03.989> depressing

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
and they're all quite depressing

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
and they're all quite depressing
particularly<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> Germans<00:01:10.460> actually<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
particularly the Germans actually when I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.300 
particularly the Germans actually when I
read<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:13.080> jack<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> guy<00:01:14.250> who

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
read the jack is kind of the guy who

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.300 
read the jack is kind of the guy who
thought<00:01:14.700> okay<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> pretty<00:01:15.509> good<00:01:15.689> one

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
thought okay this is a pretty good one

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.460 
thought okay this is a pretty good one
you<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.850> sort<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> try<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.470> gain

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you know just to sort of try to gain

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.780 
you know just to sort of try to gain
greater<00:01:19.740> enlightenment<00:01:20.040> over<00:01:20.460> time<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
greater enlightenment over time that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.429 
greater enlightenment over time that
seems<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> good<00:01:21.360> goal<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> don't

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
seems like a good goal if you don't

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.030 
seems like a good goal if you don't
really<00:01:22.650> know<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> meaning<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.659> life<00:01:24.659> is

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
really know what the meaning of life is

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.230 
really know what the meaning of life is
but<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.430> even<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:26.909> what<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> right

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
but or even really what the right

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.640 
but or even really what the right
questions<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> ask<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.470> can

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
questions are to ask but if we can

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
questions are to ask but if we can
improve<00:01:29.490> our<00:01:29.729> static<00:01:30.090> universe<00:01:30.270> then

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
improve our static universe then

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.480 
improve our static universe then
eventually<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.860> figure<00:01:32.100> out<00:01:32.220> what<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
eventually we can figure out what the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.749 
eventually we can figure out what the
right<00:01:32.579> question<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> ask<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:34.650> know<00:01:34.759> just

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
right question to ask is you know just

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.240 
right question to ask is you know just
not<00:01:35.939> meeting<00:01:36.119> life<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.540> something<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.079> know

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
not meeting life it's something you know

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.880
