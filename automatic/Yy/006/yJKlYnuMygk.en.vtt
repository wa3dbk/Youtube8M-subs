00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
light I was probably just thought what a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.570 
light I was probably just thought what a
 confidence<00:01:18.900> thing<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.580> think

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
 confidence thing but I'm think

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
composition that's definitely there the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
composition that's definitely there the
confidence<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.790> definitely<00:01:24.450> coming<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
confidence is definitely coming out of
