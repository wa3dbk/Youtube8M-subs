 needs 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.380
 although I often do not understand 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.160
 more than silence in response to 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.820

 the material conditions that now has to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.020
 nothing is good if I do not remember who 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.380
 live in the affliction of the body and soul bread 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.500

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.180

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.180
 mistakes 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.850
 My faults forgive when it becomes 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.210
 cold my heart when you allow the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.869
 badly if outside and in the form of aggression 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.209
 that more than talking one knows how to listen 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.610
 instead of judging your wrist you welcome 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.670
 not cultivating violence 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.610
 I will be peace saying no to 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.350
 requirements can 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.350
 to thank 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.750
 forgive me as I forgive those 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.209
 to offend me even when my 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.630
 heart is hurt by the bitterness and 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.910
 of tastes of ingratitude can I 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.670
 lord of life, remember that no one 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.150
 eternal sorrow and that the only way 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.690
 that makes me sublime is the humble road 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.900
 do not let me fall into the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.010
 temptations of errors and selfishness that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.900
 make me slaves of me to malevolence 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.330
 before your light is upon me 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.640
 enlightening me that I may find you 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.120
 inside my soul as part of that 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.700
 'this essence of my essence and deliverance dictated 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.750
 of all the violence of the whole 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.510
 misfortune of all disease is 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.350
 deliver me from all the pain of all sorrow and 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.690
 of all disillusionment but still when 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.040
 difficulties if they are necessary 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.989
 that I have the strength and courage to say 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.989
 Thank you father for more this mission. 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.700
 everything around us and divine poetry there is a 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.409
 trace of God in every being of creation 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.260
 because we have for it in the blossoming of 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:46.980
 flowers running down the waters in the corner of 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:51.000
 wind in the singular of the stars but above 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.609
 we seek for it in our interior 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.739
 it suffices that for a moment we close the 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.010
 eyes and the inner 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.790
 there he is giving rhyme verses of 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.790
 our lives
