throw it four-wheel drive give it some

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.430 
throw it four-wheel drive give it some
throttle<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.770> still<00:00:35.760> didn't<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.000> anywhere

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
throttle and I still didn't go anywhere

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.110

so<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> problem

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so that was a little bit of a problem

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.229 
so that was a little bit of a problem
for<00:00:39.300> me<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:40.070> think<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.489> I've<00:00:41.579> got<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.090> a

for me I think what I've got is a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.760 
for me I think what I've got is a
problem<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.660> my<00:00:42.750> hubs<00:00:42.989> not<00:00:43.230> walking<00:00:43.620> so

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

through<00:00:45.090> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.750> diagnosing<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.770> see

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
through kind of diagnosing this and see

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.189 
through kind of diagnosing this and see
what<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.489> find<00:00:47.670> out<00:00:50.690> all<00:00:51.690> right<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.050> right

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
what we can find out all right so right

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
what we can find out all right so right
now<00:00:52.350> I'm<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.739> two-wheel<00:00:53.100> drive<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.910> my<00:00:54.180> hubs

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
now I'm in two-wheel drive and my hubs

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.139 
now I'm in two-wheel drive and my hubs
are<00:00:54.870> unlocked<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.340> should<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.879> able<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
are unlocked so I should be able to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.709 
are unlocked so I should be able to
rotate<00:00:57.390> these<00:00:57.870> freely<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.820> can't<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
rotate these freely and I can't as you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.550 
rotate these freely and I can't as you
see

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.020 

and<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.130> both<00:01:08.400> rotating

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.550 

now<00:01:12.150> correct

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.100 

see<00:01:18.159> if<00:01:18.250> I<00:01:18.310> rotate<00:01:18.700> this<00:01:18.880> so<00:01:19.240> going<00:01:19.750> forward

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
see if I rotate this so going forward

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.260 
see if I rotate this so going forward
that<00:01:21.070> one<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.460> now<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:23.229> back<00:01:23.500> so<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.180> have

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
that one is now going back so and I have

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.180 
that one is now going back so and I have
an<00:01:25.360> open<00:01:25.450> differential<00:01:25.900> up<00:01:26.170> here<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.920> next

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
an open differential up here the next

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.469 
an open differential up here the next
thing<00:01:27.310> we're<00:01:27.430> going<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.580> do<00:01:27.759> is<00:01:28.000> I'm<00:01:28.330> going<00:01:28.360> to

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
thing we're going to do is I'm going to

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.609 
thing we're going to do is I'm going to
climb<00:01:28.659> into<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.990> truck<00:01:29.229> put<00:01:29.440> it<00:01:29.530> in

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
climb into the truck put it in

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.380 
climb into the truck put it in
four-wheel<00:01:29.860> drive<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.690> I<00:01:32.520> believe<00:01:33.520> these<00:01:33.790> are

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
four-wheel drive and I believe these are

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.230 
four-wheel drive and I believe these are
supposed<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.899> have<00:01:35.110> vacuum<00:01:35.940> but<00:01:36.940> I<00:01:37.000> haven't

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
supposed to have vacuum but I haven't

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:45.260 
supposed to have vacuum but I haven't
actually<00:01:37.360> checked<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:39.149> see<00:01:40.149> abs<00:01:40.630> I<00:01:42.450> see

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
actually checked that see abs I see

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.100 
actually checked that see abs I see
brake<00:01:46.270> line<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.770> really<00:01:48.220> kind<00:01:48.490> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
brake line which is really kind of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.440 
brake line which is really kind of
stretched<00:01:50.110> I'm<00:01:50.410> not<00:01:50.560> wild<00:01:51.039> about<00:01:51.160> that<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:52.030> I

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
stretched I'm not wild about that and I

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.249 
stretched I'm not wild about that and I
see<00:01:52.660> if<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:52.869> has<00:01:52.990> been<00:01:53.200> zip<00:01:53.440> tied<00:01:53.679> up<00:01:53.890> here<00:01:54.250> oh

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
see if this has been zip tied up here oh

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.980 
see if this has been zip tied up here oh
boy

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
you know the peers of my vacuum system

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.460 
you know the peers of my vacuum system
has<00:02:00.880> been<00:02:01.179> disconnected

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
has been disconnected

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.190 
has been disconnected
so<00:02:02.770> I'm<00:02:02.860> manual<00:02:03.280> only<00:02:03.640> hubs<00:02:09.179> alright<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.810> put

don't have that electronic shift on the
fly<00:02:14.230> I've<00:02:14.890> got<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> manual<00:02:15.670> lever<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.180> pull

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
fly I've got the manual lever so pull

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.960 
fly I've got the manual lever so pull
that<00:02:16.690> bad<00:02:16.900> boy<00:02:17.140> back<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.670> four-wheel<00:02:18.670> drive

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
that bad boy back to four-wheel drive

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.259 
that bad boy back to four-wheel drive
and<00:02:19.300> now<00:02:19.600> we're<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.620> see<00:02:20.980> what<00:02:21.880> happens

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
and now we're going to see what happens

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.199 
and now we're going to see what happens
I<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.870> have<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.290> hubs<00:02:23.760> manually<00:02:24.760> locked<00:02:25.000> in

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
I do have the hubs manually locked in

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.880 
I do have the hubs manually locked in
since<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.540> don't<00:02:25.600> seem<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.989> have<00:02:26.079> that<00:02:26.140> consist

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
since I don't seem to have that consist

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.979 
since I don't seem to have that consist
of<00:02:26.950> at<00:02:27.040> all<00:02:27.190> on<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.519> I<00:02:27.760> only<00:02:28.269> have<00:02:28.540> manual

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
of at all on this I only have manual

of at all on this I only have manual
hubs

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.430 

I<00:02:35.670> can<00:02:36.330> see<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> have<00:02:36.600> what<00:02:36.960> appears<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.320> be<00:02:37.410> a

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
I can see I have what appears to be a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.330 
I can see I have what appears to be a

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.920 

I<00:03:12.769> definitely<00:03:13.489> need<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.700> replace<00:03:14.060> at<00:03:14.510> least<00:03:14.750> a

I definitely need to replace at least a

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
hub seal on this side I can see it's

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.960 
hub seal on this side I can see it's
just<00:03:16.760> sitting<00:03:17.060> out<00:03:17.269> loose<00:03:17.540> here<00:03:17.840> that's

just sitting out loose here that's

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.949 
just sitting out loose here that's
certainly<00:03:19.970> no<00:03:20.150> good<00:03:22.180> all<00:03:23.180> right<00:03:23.420> both<00:03:23.659> seals

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
certainly no good all right both seals

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.160 
certainly no good all right both seals
on<00:03:24.260> both<00:03:24.680> sides<00:03:25.099> seem<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.549> be<00:03:25.700> screwed

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.149 

great<00:03:29.170> looks<00:03:29.409> like<00:03:29.560> I'm<00:03:29.680> going<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:29.890> be<00:03:30.010> doing

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
great looks like I'm going to be doing

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.170 
great looks like I'm going to be doing
some<00:03:30.430> hub<00:03:30.580> work<00:03:30.760> here<00:03:31.030> in<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.360> future<00:03:33.180> so

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
some hub work here in the future so

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.940 
some hub work here in the future so
that's<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.510> state<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.049> f-250<00:03:35.560> at<00:03:35.830> the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
that's the state of the f-250 at the

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.039 
that's the state of the f-250 at the
moment<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.480> looks<00:03:37.480> like<00:03:37.629> I'll<00:03:37.750> be<00:03:37.780> coming

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
moment and looks like I'll be coming

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.009 
moment and looks like I'll be coming

hubs into place and I had still been
able<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.090> spin<00:03:58.299> it<00:03:58.560> spin<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.829> drive<00:04:00.310> shaft<00:04:00.549> or

able to spin it spin the drive shaft or

the u-joint rather on the shaft then

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.229 
the u-joint rather on the shaft then
absolutely<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.670> would<00:04:03.730> have<00:04:03.849> been<00:04:04.000> that

absolutely that would have been that
would<00:04:05.200> have<00:04:05.230> meant<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.470> my<00:04:05.620> hubs<00:04:05.799> were<00:04:05.980> were

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
would have meant that my hubs were were

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.949 
would have meant that my hubs were were
basically<00:04:06.640> shot<00:04:06.910> at<00:04:07.180> least<00:04:07.269> that<00:04:07.569> one<00:04:07.720> side

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
basically shot at least that one side

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.289 
basically shot at least that one side
was<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.379> should<00:04:09.310> not<00:04:09.459> be<00:04:09.489> able<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.849> spin<00:04:10.120> that

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
was I should not be able to spin that

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.170 
was I should not be able to spin that
the<00:04:11.290> other<00:04:12.190> thing<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.519> checked<00:04:12.790> if<00:04:12.879> you<00:04:12.970> notice

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
the other thing I checked if you notice

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.089 
the other thing I checked if you notice
there<00:04:13.299> was<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.510> wanted<00:04:13.720> twisted<00:04:14.409> the<00:04:14.620> drive

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
there was I wanted twisted the drive

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.340 
there was I wanted twisted the drive
shaft<00:04:15.340> if<00:04:15.760> my<00:04:15.940> drive<00:04:16.239> shaft<00:04:16.269> had<00:04:16.750> spun<00:04:17.049> and

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
shaft if my drive shaft had spun and

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.199 
shaft if my drive shaft had spun and
maybe<00:04:17.919> everything<00:04:18.310> ins<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.639> you<00:04:18.880> know<00:04:18.970> the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
maybe everything ins and you know the

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.909 
maybe everything ins and you know the
the<00:04:19.539> two<00:04:21.240> hubs<00:04:22.240> inside<00:04:22.690> had<00:04:22.870> spun<00:04:23.139> then<00:04:23.770> that

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
the two hubs inside had spun then that

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.260 
the two hubs inside had spun then that
could<00:04:24.039> have<00:04:24.160> pointed<00:04:24.430> me<00:04:24.520> toward<00:04:24.850> the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
could have pointed me toward the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.570 
could have pointed me toward the
transfer<00:04:25.720> case<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:27.070> don't<00:04:27.280> seem<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.520> have

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
transfer case so I don't seem to have

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.520 
transfer case so I don't seem to have
any<00:04:27.729> problem<00:04:28.000> with<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.150> transfer<00:04:28.539> case<00:04:28.750> on<00:04:29.169> I

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
any problem with the transfer case on I

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.290 
any problem with the transfer case on I
think<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.250> next<00:04:30.520> thing<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.729> want<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:30.940> do<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.150> get

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
think the next thing I want to do is get

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.870 
think the next thing I want to do is get
this<00:04:31.389> thing<00:04:31.450> up<00:04:31.690> in<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.870> air<00:04:31.900> actually<00:04:32.370> I

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880
