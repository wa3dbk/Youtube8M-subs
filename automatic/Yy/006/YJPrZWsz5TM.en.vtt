 the sighting of ufo in florence in 1954 is one of the most evident cases in the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.719
 Italian history of sightings of unidentified objects with witnesses

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.529
 on television one the world of ufology 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:27.379

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.550
 the homo duo 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.590
 the event lasted about 15 minutes 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.030
 the direction from which the objects came was from the northwest of the farmhouses 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.519
 to then continue towards south-east and in the direction of rovezzano 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.690
 the formation of these UFOs consisted of 3 blocks each of which had 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.570
 different features

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.280
 characterized by a shape that recalls that of the drops 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.750
 closed the formation of flat discs of white and 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.320
 bright

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.370
 giorgi bertini, head of the nation 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.460
 a few minutes later, the second event took place 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.970
 sighting over the skies of the municipal stadium during the match 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.730

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.330
 of the second half 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.130

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.909

 sticky so-called siliceous cotton pro also angel hair 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 formed by elements such as boron silicon 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.860
 I am still uncertain about the identity of the phenomenon which counts about 270 cases 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.370
 documented by the national UFO center which was followed by many 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.569
 hypothesis including a special web 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.239
 produced from a migrating arachnid chemical residues of textile processing 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.960
 natural atmospheric phenomenon 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.960
 fragments of a particular radar ticker 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.230
 the event covered by the media 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.970
 the event was highlighted the following day by the various publications 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.230
 newspapers of the time 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.559
 among which the nation is the Sunday of the courier 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:47.219
 the fact was also resumed years later in various transmissions between the 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.329
 such as boyager and the crossroads the treaty on bari books dedicated to ufology as well 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.699
 on many sites - in the sector 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.230
 1954 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.480
 they have dorgali 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.899
 ufology 1954 can be considered the golden year of ufology 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:08.249
 in the 1950s 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:19.909
 1951 1952 1953 in 1955 adding up all the sightings you get a total 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.329
 lower than those of the sun 1954 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.319
 among other striking cases on 21 October 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.639
 a few days before the Florentine case, 20 UFOs flew over the Italian forum in Rome 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.269
 the few witnesses were a rainy night after the sighting of the capital of the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.639
 Tuscan declared that the flying objects described by the newspapers were 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.799
 similar to those seen by them 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.819
 this could lead to the first sighting in two different locations 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.470
 of the same ufo what ever happened up to the present day
