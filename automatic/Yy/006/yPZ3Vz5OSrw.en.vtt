South<00:01:46.440> Florida<00:01:46.619> roughly<00:01:47.429> in<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.700> early<00:01:48.030> 1980s

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
South Florida roughly in the early 1980s

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.809 
South Florida roughly in the early 1980s
and<00:01:49.050> I<00:01:49.560> would<00:01:49.709> say<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:49.979> started<00:01:50.399> noticing

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
and I would say they started noticing

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.520 
and I would say they started noticing
more<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.989> within<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.349> last

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
more and more of them within the last

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.800 
more and more of them within the last
ten<00:01:52.830> years<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.550> park<00:01:53.819> itself<00:01:54.539> has

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
ten years because the park itself has

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.070 
ten years because the park itself has
been<00:01:55.429> extracting<00:01:56.429> pythons<00:01:56.940> for<00:01:57.569> the<00:01:57.660> last<00:01:57.840> ten

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
been extracting pythons for the last ten

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.330 
been extracting pythons for the last ten
years<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.380> think<00:01:58.560> they've<00:01:58.679> pulled<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.099> about

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
years I think they've pulled out about

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.729 
years I think they've pulled out about
they<00:01:59.789> pulled<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.090> over<00:02:00.420> 1,800<00:02:01.140> pythons<00:02:01.470> from

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
they pulled out over 1,800 pythons from

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.350 
they pulled out over 1,800 pythons from
the<00:02:01.860> park<00:02:02.099> which<00:02:02.700> sounds<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.149> rather

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the park which sounds like a rather

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.300 
the park which sounds like a rather
small<00:02:03.630> number<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.619> consider<00:02:04.950> most

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
small number but when you consider most

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.130 
small number but when you consider most
of<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.580> park<00:02:05.819> isn't<00:02:06.000> accessible<00:02:06.509> by<00:02:06.840> foot

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
of the park isn't accessible by foot

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
of the park isn't accessible by foot
that's<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.250> very<00:02:08.459> small<00:02:08.819> percentage<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that's a very small percentage that

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690 
that's a very small percentage that
they're<00:02:09.660> actually<00:02:09.840> able<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.679> trap<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.550> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
they're actually able to trap in to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.410 
they're actually able to trap in to
catch<00:02:12.140> coiled<00:02:13.250> one

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
fear of tracking the snakes was going

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.830 
fear of tracking the snakes was going
into<00:03:15.590> these<00:03:15.739> environments<00:03:16.280> with

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
into these environments with

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.000 
into these environments with
professionals<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.019> scientists<00:03:18.560> who<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.890> know

professionals and scientists who I know

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.890 
professionals and scientists who I know
handle<00:03:19.459> them<00:03:19.579> on<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> daily<00:03:20.000> basis<00:03:20.510> so<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.690> knew

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.660 
handle them on a daily basis so I knew
that<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.079> would<00:03:21.260> never<00:03:21.440> our<00:03:22.100> team<00:03:22.370> would<00:03:22.489> never

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
that I would never our team would never

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.819 
that I would never our team would never
be<00:03:22.850> in<00:03:22.940> any<00:03:23.120> kind<00:03:23.359> of<00:03:23.420> trouble<00:03:23.829> which

be in any kind of trouble which

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.860 
be in any kind of trouble which
definitely<00:03:25.190> put<00:03:25.549> me<00:03:25.579> at<00:03:25.790> ease<00:03:25.820> hmm<00:03:26.540> I've

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
definitely put me at ease hmm I've

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.810 
definitely put me at ease hmm I've
always<00:03:27.140> been<00:03:27.470> really<00:03:27.530> afraid<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.220> snakes<00:03:28.310> and

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.340 
so this piece was kind of an opportunity
to<00:03:31.310> see<00:03:31.549> how<00:03:31.970> far<00:03:32.239> outside<00:03:32.450> my<00:03:32.840> own<00:03:32.870> comfort

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
to see how far outside my own comfort

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.440 
to see how far outside my own comfort
zone<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.680> could<00:03:33.859> step<00:03:34.160> while<00:03:34.790> still<00:03:35.030> reporting

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
zone I could step while still reporting

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.810 
zone I could step while still reporting
the<00:03:35.540> story<00:03:35.600> I'm<00:03:36.500> gonna<00:03:36.620> try<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.829> hold<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.070> but

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
the story I'm gonna try to hold it but

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.180 
the story I'm gonna try to hold it but
man<00:03:37.970> when<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.209> went<00:03:38.390> down<00:03:38.540> there<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.260> did<00:03:40.070> not

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
man when I went down there I I did not

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.340 
man when I went down there I I did not
want<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:40.609> got<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:41.060> wanted<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.840> touch<00:03:41.989> them<00:03:42.230> but

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
want it I got I wanted to touch them but

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.020 
want it I got I wanted to touch them but
I<00:03:42.410> was<00:03:42.530> still<00:03:42.709> too<00:03:42.920> scared<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.280> touch<00:03:43.519> them<00:03:43.820> and

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
I was still too scared to touch them and

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.490 
I was still too scared to touch them and
it's<00:03:44.180> pretty<00:03:44.390> obvious<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:45.049> some<00:03:45.320> of<00:03:45.410> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
it's pretty obvious in some of the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.250 
it's pretty obvious in some of the
footage<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:46.180> our<00:03:47.180> camera<00:03:47.390> guy<00:03:47.720> got<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:48.109> me

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
footage that our camera guy got of me

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.080 
footage that our camera guy got of me
because<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:48.920> think<00:03:48.980> there's<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.400> moment<00:03:49.609> where

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
because I think there's a moment where

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.810 
because I think there's a moment where
I'm<00:03:50.420> nervously<00:03:51.250> rocking<00:03:52.250> back<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:52.579> forth

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
I'm nervously rocking back and forth

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.759 
I'm nervously rocking back and forth
with<00:03:53.390> just<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.810> sight<00:03:54.079> of<00:03:54.109> one<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.650> these
