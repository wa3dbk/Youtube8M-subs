00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.169
 all boys are rich for 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.869
 last typical Italy and we are more today 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.000
 with the waste player mohamed salah man 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.429
 of the match player who is doing 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.920
 really great since he arrived 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.410
 Florentine style and earns this one 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.180
 man of the match card thanks to 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.550
 two goals scored against Juventus 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.589
 away from home at the juventus stadium 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.750
 let's talk about this player right away 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:47.409
 I loved it and I have to do 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.850
 now like American youtubers o 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.500
 Brits who say buy this 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.659
 player and then the price will be the stars 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.729
 no oh well but I can assure you that it is 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.670
 really fun then we leave 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.589
 suffered from pero 78 then passed into 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.670
 plus two even from its version 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.070
 nif and then to a control bell 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.850
 ball which is a feature 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.009
 fantastic because the ball is always 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.259
 attached to the foot even when doing the 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.500
 its galloping that we will see later then 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.980
 great then we take speed 94 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.480
 on paper very high value with 93 of 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.260
 acceleration the first step is 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.170
 devastating 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.330
 it's a nice 95 of maximum speed that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.720
 when it goes into the open field it is impregnable 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.510
 to 1 89 of agility therefore to understand well 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.240
 how it is very agile and then also a nice one 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.140
 balance 83 which I liked a 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.300
 bag 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.310
 especially because it has only 61 strength 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.720
 physical, however, did not fall the first shoulder 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.280
 I have to tell the truth 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.610
 so this is a feature that is 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.000
 excellent for room being enough 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.600
 magrolino is a little bit low only 175 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.700
 then as a dribble we have an 86 on 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.670
 card with 88 pure dribbling 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 fantastic with four star skills 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.360
 so you can do all the writes e 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.100
 you want and can also use 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.060
 agility and ball control for 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.769
 leave to the opponents then to a 72 of 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.179
 passage that as a feature 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.180
 could be like a value 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.580
 little bit low but I liked them 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.159
 especially the long passages 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.860
 because it only has 68 but it seemed 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:24.020
 at least 75 76 and then the shorts 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.750
 76 of them all know how to do a little bit 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.440
 and so it's fine and then to a 71 division 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.870
 that maybe a value that helps him 63 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.670
 of aggressiveness but always at least 70 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.950
 because he immediately went to repair the ball 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.440
 once lost it did not remain there static 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.780
 how do some wings and then we talk about the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.790
 throw 71 on the card that I think the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.200
 value that feels more like an upgrade 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.810
 because I used his version 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.700
 nyt so to some fun 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.209
 week ago and I saw that the shot is 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.430
 improved a lot at 81 power per 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.870
 shot that feels everything pulls enough 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.080
 strong for a player like him 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.140
 quite thin and then to a nice long one 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.360
 shot that on the card is only 55 ma 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.750
 I used it more than sometimes it is 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.989
 quite liked it sure is better 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.860
 the effect 65 values ​​not too high though 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.900
 trust me they are not so bad in the game 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.850
 pulls definitely better than the outside 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.390
 but certainly not the best effect 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.250
 evil unfortunately a means against but 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.950
 it is not really a hundredth meeting 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.260
 hundred and to the finalization only 74 like 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.750
 value but I do not put it among the cons 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.790
 because we say that it gets there so much 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.590
 so many times in the area that more than a few 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.200
 time puts it in so let's say a 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.540
 6 out of 10 in area sails puts in and from 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.110
 off it goes well when the shot comes out of the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.100
 Sunday 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.380
 enter header we say enough 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.440
 an account because only 60 either 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.330
 then managed to do four 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.700
 weak foot stars really a great one 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.860
 value because both for passages and for 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.870
 tiri goes great with the four 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.390
 stars seemed not to say 5 though 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.910
 four acceptable stars and then how 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.910
 medium high work I would say that we are there 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.440
 he was always in position but I have to 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.239
 let's say as a positioning at a good 80 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.030
 so this helps this value 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:18.320
 but I have to make a clarification 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.169
 according to me use spd sorry data 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.210
 because in my opinion it is better as abi a 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.130
 sometimes I didn't always find him in position 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.260
 remained a little bit behind towards 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.180
 the midfield instead like ats maybe 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.770
 with your feet a little more in the middle of the field 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.280
 he played much much better then 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.750
 use it active which is much better 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.690
 nothing he even left so can 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.570
 back on playing right then 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.260
 excellent the punishments 69 as a value 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.720
 at least 75 must have it as a value because 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.850
 really they are very very beautiful 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.930
 acceptable rigors okay can do them 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.580
 a little all the review can end 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.290
 here maybe as a price now is a 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.990
 little bit high but I think it will come down 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.730
 but I have to say that it's really great 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.920
 price is there is certainly worth them 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.720
 what about live that ends here 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.670
