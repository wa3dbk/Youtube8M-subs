Miranda<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.189> would<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> big<00:01:41.790> loss

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
Miranda I think it would be a big loss

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.999 
Miranda I think it would be a big loss
for<00:01:42.180> them<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:43.200> don't<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.560> least<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.890> out

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
for them if they don't at least go out

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
for them if they don't at least go out
and<00:01:44.130> find<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.399> replacement<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.329> lose<00:01:45.509> him<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and find a replacement but to lose him I

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.190 
and find a replacement but to lose him I
think<00:01:45.869> he's<00:01:46.110> been<00:01:46.320> one<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.310> quietly

think<00:02:38.320> Colorado<00:02:38.590> will<00:02:39.280> start<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.640> make<00:02:39.760> a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
think Colorado will start to make a

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.310 
think Colorado will start to make a
couple<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.300> moves<00:02:40.510> we've<00:02:40.720> seen<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.930> little<00:02:41.140> bit

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
couple of moves we've seen a little bit

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.510 
couple of moves we've seen a little bit
they<00:02:41.440> already<00:02:41.650> shipped<00:02:41.950> out<00:02:42.190> home<00:02:42.370> our

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
they already shipped out home our

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.490 
they already shipped out home our
comings<00:02:42.850> down<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.120> Houston<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.630> think<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.350> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
comings down to Houston I think that and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.170 
comings down to Houston I think that and
they<00:02:44.560> also<00:02:44.710> got<00:02:44.890> rid<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.070> Conor<00:02:45.310> Casey<00:02:45.520> in<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
they also got rid of Conor Casey in the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.020 
they also got rid of Conor Casey in the
dry<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.010> re-entry<00:02:48.010> draft<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.700> think

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
dry and the re-entry draft so I think

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.000 
dry and the re-entry draft so I think
that<00:02:49.330> Oscar<00:02:49.690> pareja<00:02:50.050> will<00:02:50.230> start<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.590> remake

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
that Oscar pareja will start to remake

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.340 
that Oscar pareja will start to remake
that<00:02:51.070> team<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.850> way<00:02:51.970> he<00:02:52.390> wants<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.080> way<00:02:53.170> he

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
that team the way he wants it the way he

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.020 
that team the way he wants it the way he
wants<00:02:53.650> them<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.950> play<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.370> think<00:02:54.550> it's<00:02:54.850> going<00:02:54.910> to

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
wants them to play I think it's going to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.670 
wants them to play I think it's going to
be<00:02:55.120> more<00:02:55.690> of<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.900> style<00:02:56.260> where<00:02:56.470> you're<00:02:56.560> moving

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
be more of a style where you're moving

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.770 
be more of a style where you're moving
the<00:02:56.890> ball<00:02:57.040> around<00:02:57.100> as<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.820> universal<00:02:58.630> sign

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
the ball around as the universal sign

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.060 
the ball around as the universal sign
for<00:02:58.840> moving<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.260> ball<00:02:59.440> around<00:02:59.500> on<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.890> ground

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
for moving the ball around on the ground

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.530 
for moving the ball around on the ground
so<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.370> think<00:03:00.490> he'll<00:03:00.760> start<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.090> get<00:03:01.240> some<00:03:01.420> more

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
so I think he'll start to get some more

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.330 
so I think he'll start to get some more
players<00:03:01.840> like<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:03.040> don't<00:03:03.070> think

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
players like that and I don't think

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.400 
players like that and I don't think
Portland<00:03:03.700> are<00:03:03.880> done<00:03:04.060> we've<00:03:04.510> seen<00:03:04.810> some<00:03:05.050> tweets

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
Portland are done we've seen some tweets

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.040 
Portland are done we've seen some tweets
out<00:03:05.590> there<00:03:05.830> from<00:03:06.070> owner<00:03:06.340> Merritt<00:03:06.760> Paulson

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
out there from owner Merritt Paulson

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.210 
out there from owner Merritt Paulson
talking<00:03:08.050> about<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.500> he<00:03:08.650> might<00:03:08.860> have<00:03:09.040> some

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
talking about that he might have some

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.340 
talking about that he might have some
press<00:03:09.430> conferences<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.180> January<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.870> think

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
press conferences in January I think

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.450 
press conferences in January I think
there's<00:03:11.470> going<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.710> be<00:03:11.740> some<00:03:11.980> moves<00:03:12.160> up<00:03:12.340> in

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
there's going to be some moves up in

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.860 
there's going to be some moves up in

Portland as low a number of teams who

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.720 
Portland as low a number of teams who
