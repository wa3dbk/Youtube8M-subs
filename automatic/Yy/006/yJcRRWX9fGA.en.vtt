to myself a horse used to be in there
you<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.390> right<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.259> down<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.799> building<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
you know right on down to building a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.450 
you know right on down to building a
stall<00:01:45.420> next<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.409> my<00:01:46.590> house<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.310> and
