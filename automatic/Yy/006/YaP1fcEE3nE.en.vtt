00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.860
 today a video out in a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.750
 part of my garden 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.519
 so this video is mostly about my 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.400
 yesterday's detox day that was 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.340
 great I have to say a day of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.320
 mutilated smoothie toxin had been provided 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.880
 by tiffany an entrepreneur from 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.699
 montreal of the glaucous company 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.269
 lint.com is what I wanted to do 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.820
 it's a tour of this detox there 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.370
 with his products and tell you how 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.719
 I felt and I found that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.790
 great because I have not had any 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.739
 blood sugar problem in someone who 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 is very sensitive to sugar as well 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.129
 in many of you we had 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.370
 many people are sensitive to sugar 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.270
 and gpu this kind of hyper 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.180
 hypoglycemia that makes us find ourselves 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.710
 hyper excited then half an hour later 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.780
 to go to lie down during a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.480
 half hour three quarters of an hour I have not 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.699
 had this with 6 mutti so that's maybe 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.800
 sauce what I 'm going to put 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.110
 the emphasis in fact is to tell you that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.489
 this stocks that she's fine 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.979
 studied in terms of blood glucose 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.170
 the taste of the smoothie smells good 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.750
 textures are good but if you 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.360
 wait for dairy sweetie smoothie 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.799
 queen you're going to be very disappointed then in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 did the focus was on really 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.960
 obviously blood sugar but I think 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 the focus was on everything on the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.380
 nutrient content and there are drownings and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.119
 super foods and choi 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.390
 there are all kinds of alkali foods 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.759
 hyper nutrient nisand and that's it then 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.310
 it's a big 10 out of 10 then if I was 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.820
 able I would like sweet on ten that's 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.189
