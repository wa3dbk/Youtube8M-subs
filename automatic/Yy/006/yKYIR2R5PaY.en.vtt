the overview discharges to iOS devices

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.010 
the overview discharges to iOS devices
at<00:00:44.610> once<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.059> now<00:00:45.180> let's<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.480> into<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.780> pros

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
at once so now let's get into the pros

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.920 
at once so now let's get into the pros
the<00:00:46.590> first<00:00:46.829> pro<00:00:47.100> ways<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.940> sleek<00:00:48.210> simple

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the first pro ways it's a sleek simple

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.560 
the first pro ways it's a sleek simple
design<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.230> nothing<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.250> overkill<00:00:50.910> this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
design it's nothing really overkill this

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.760 
design it's nothing really overkill this
little<00:00:51.870> thing<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.170> obviously<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
little thing is obviously here to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.939 
little thing is obviously here to
support<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> iPad<00:00:54.120> since<00:00:54.480> well<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> iPads<00:00:55.770> on

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
support the iPad since well the iPads on

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.350 
support the iPad since well the iPads on
exactly<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.460> lightest<00:00:56.820> device<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.329> world

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
exactly the lightest device in the world

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270 
exactly the lightest device in the world
so<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.440> good<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:58.859> were<00:00:58.920> smart

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so it is good that they were smart

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.439 
so it is good that they were smart
enough<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> put<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.879> back<00:01:00.090> support

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
enough to put a little back support

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.110 
enough to put a little back support
there<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.680> wide<00:01:02.039> enough<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.460> fit<00:01:02.670> some

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
there this is wide enough to fit some

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.219 
there this is wide enough to fit some
cases<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.890> iOS<00:01:05.189> devices<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.810> front<00:01:07.110> I

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
cases on your iOS devices in the front I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.859 
cases on your iOS devices in the front I
should<00:01:07.439> say<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.000> minor<00:01:09.299> con<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
should say the back is a minor con is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
should say the back is a minor con is
that<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.140> cannot<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:10.650> iPad<00:01:11.070> docked

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that you cannot have your iPad docked

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.149 
that you cannot have your iPad docked

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
docks just fine with my case on there

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.240 
docks just fine with my case on there
which<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:27.930> awesome<00:01:28.439> cuz<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> know<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:28.950> means

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
charging times because that's really

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
charging times because that's really
hard<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.619> estimate<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:45.060> say<00:01:45.240> my

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
hard to estimate but I will say my
