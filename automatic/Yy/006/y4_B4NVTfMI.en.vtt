 the quick dialing of the mind or is it 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.769
 next power testing magical enters 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.810
 the phone option and without having to 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.420
 search among the Ticos the contacts of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.619
 mort a person that I call 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.350
 just here are phone we leave 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.030
 sunk the German number of these two 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.710
 which we have assigned you in the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.190
 speed dial for example on 8 yo 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.260
 I know that I have assigned with my cell phone is 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.180
 then take out that ended did not go 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.720
 good formwork marketing 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.670
 with exit bell without searching the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.060
 phone between my contacts again 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.290
 called quickly the compilation of the 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.510
 Rapid dialing can be developed 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.760
 ways the first and most simple giving 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.170
 the south configuration currently 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.440
 I'll go back to the configuration option 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.810
 speed dial 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.810
 and here it shows me for example what 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.020
 like that for example what numbers have 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.549
 been assigned to the speed dial is 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.220
 You can assign the numbers from 1 to 9 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.409
 only some that you have booked as 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.400
 voicemail and others for you 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.400
 can customize 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.390
 so basically here they have amounts 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.980
 already configured we can configure 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.040
 any other for example of 4 we give 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.350
 click that 4 we search within our 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.930
 contacts what 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.080
 that we then want to assign can be 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.729
 any of one's selections for 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.740
 can do a test where are the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.860
 my contacts from samsung phones 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.979
 that I already have good we will select 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.869
 any blood to those who are here 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.450
 he was already assigned with a new contact 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.860
 to speed dial another way to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.470
 assign a contact the speed dial 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.570
 it is suddenly it is leaving the button sunk 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.729
 of the number for example of 6 and left it 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.649
 sunken 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.540
 Well, he will tell me that there is no contact here 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.900
 assigned so he visibly accepts it 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.930
 and I go 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.670
 and he looked for it 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.890
 let's say we choose any of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.050
 these 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.180
 we click here we select which of 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.569
 these numbers we want to assign and if I 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.150
 I'm going here by configuration option 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.970
 quick we can see that he had already assigned 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.730
 also at 6 another contact with the sea 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.680
