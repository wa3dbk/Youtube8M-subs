process I will illustrate some of the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.070 
process I will illustrate some of the
functions<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.729> octagon<00:01:24.120> has<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
functions that the octagon has so the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.200 
functions that the octagon has so the
overall<00:01:28.350> time

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.160 

of<00:01:31.780> course<00:01:32.050> can<00:01:32.320> be<00:01:32.940> adjusted<00:01:33.940> but<00:01:34.660> also<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
of course can be adjusted but also the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.240 
of course can be adjusted but also the
amplitude<00:01:35.860> function

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.140 

as<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.150> hear<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.630> public<00:01:43.200> safe

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.570 

and<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:48.430> some<00:01:48.640> binding<00:01:49.330> or<00:01:49.540> sticky<00:01:49.810> materials

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
and for some binding or sticky materials

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.220 
and for some binding or sticky materials
there<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.610> an<00:01:51.820> interval<00:01:52.120> function<00:01:52.330> which<00:01:53.050> can

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
there is an interval function which can

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.420 
there is an interval function which can
be<00:01:53.350> programmed<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:55.800> which<00:01:56.800> helps<00:01:57.190> in<00:01:57.340> the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
be programmed in which helps in the

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:06.660 
be programmed in which helps in the
sipping<00:01:57.730> process<00:02:04.620> all<00:02:05.620> these<00:02:05.890> features<00:02:06.130> make
