00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
is much more accurate than the other

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
much better I mean just all the way

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.850 
much better I mean just all the way
around<00:00:42.800> then<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.219> back<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.440> looks

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
around then on the back it just looks

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.479 
around then on the back it just looks

it's<00:00:56.670> kind<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.940> hard<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.360> them<00:00:57.510> situated

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
it's kind of hard to get them situated

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.720 
it's kind of hard to get them situated
though<00:00:59.149> just<00:01:00.350> because<00:01:01.350> there's<00:01:01.949> some<00:01:02.399> at<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
