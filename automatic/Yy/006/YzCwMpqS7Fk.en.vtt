00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.420
 new video of minecraft 1.9 and in this 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.170
 occasion I will talk about the under 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.410
 gateway that is this good this is a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.769
 structure generated with bedrock with 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.769
 bed root 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.620
 It is a structure that is noticed from now 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.390
 that can not be destroyed or modified 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.630
 and this structure that can not be 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.930
 destroy and that can not be modified 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:33.230
 serves as a portal portal to where 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.780
 towards achievement work towards the dimension 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.500
 where we started the game we started 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.670
 minecraft then how does it work what 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.179
 you see 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.000
 to the elevated portal that will appear from 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:51.500
 random form in the dimension of the end 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.450
 it is raised ok then when it shoots 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.490
 he joins in giving but 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.790
 and fall right in the center 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.400
 you will be able to go out to lover when you need 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.990
 always one in there but there will not be 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.850
 problem to get it because you're 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.610
 in the film a is being altered ok 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.500
 see how it is given as it is implied 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 that one of the most treatments 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.190
 important that you will see what is more 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.110
 important would not the word be a 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.420
 very necessary enchantment that is going to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.909
 there's going to be the booty charm 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.500
 of looting for the sword because the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.750
 amount of nepal we need to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.030
 the pile of things is good for 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.700
 explore I have already told you the suspicion 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.770
 that you explore those islands with shots of 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.750
 terpel and to leave being able to leave 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.840
 either side with a bandage but because 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.390
 is this portal made this portal what 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.320
 they did because this is this is a 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.770
 very broad set of islands 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.770
 and then when a cup the dragon gets 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.770
 generates the portal to be able to return 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.080
 up there very nice 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.950
 but what happens if you walked away 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.320
 a lot of that portal 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.430
 if you went to a mountain a lot 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.740
 a lot of distance from that portal 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.500
 and what happens if one of those you forgot 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.830
 as if I'm where the portal was 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.400
 good what are you doing you have these 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.380
 floodgates this this dimensional pass to 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.110
 through this new structure you see it 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.450
 up there the avoiding throwing the ndr but 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.950
 you hit it or in the center you go back to the world 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.590
 two things to highlight do see first 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.650
 I really like the idea is very good 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.600
 idea because look like with this and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.290
 with other things, the 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.980
 exploration is greatly encouraged 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.260
 exploration of the end 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.269
 what voices do you spend time even why 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.500
 not making a house in the end would be very 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.599
 weird that in that good house in the end and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.030
 lived in the end but now you can like that 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.190
 what do you think can be done cute 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.190
 for a series of youtube live in the end 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.530
 but well I do not want to go 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.050
 is on the one hand is very good on the other 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.460
 side look where is the video is 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.240
 just above the portal 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.790
 classic of all life 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.040
 and it's on the island where it appears on the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.720
 dragon 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.900
 they put it there 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.600
 to put it and to show it or 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.780
 it can literally appear in any 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.780
 side 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.590
 it can appear there and be like objects 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.310
 that are floating and clogging the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.530
 fly from the Aragon leander or use 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.810
 as a fact to take into account truth a 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.600
 data to take into account but other information 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.700
 important to keep in mind that perhaps 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.590
 it also goes unnoticed that you look 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.480
 that the dragon walking is not 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.769
 and not just that they do not explode from the dragon 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.819
 but everything else is destroyed 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.920
 pillars 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.520
 you see the glass of the pillars that do not 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:01.130
 is then does it mean that these 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.940
 mini portals appear 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:10.140
 when the dragon was killed for the first time 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:14.190
 this is a question is something that 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.930
 we say it can be can be because it is not 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.450
 an important color data to have in 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.480
 account but good now we have these 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.480
 new structures in leander gateway and 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.670
 I hope you liked it I imagine 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.420
 that if so, leave your like and say that 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.810
 they seem to have a gateway and if our 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.820
 subscribed subscribe because because now 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.950
 if another video comes from bancafÃ© 1.9 and not 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.600
 I'm sure you do not want to lose yourself like that 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.070
 subscribe now and leave your 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.750
 Comment on what you think of the leander 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.190
 gateway and see you in a little while in a 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.190
 new video but chau
