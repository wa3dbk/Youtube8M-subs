alright we're looking at today is the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.280 
alright we're looking at today is the
Lenovo<00:00:10.860> s10<00:00:11.400> tune<00:00:12.360> out<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.540> s10<00:00:12.900> was<00:00:13.019> part<00:00:13.200> one

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
Lenovo s10 tune out the s10 was part one

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.690 
Lenovo s10 tune out the s10 was part one
of<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> most<00:00:13.559> popular<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.280> epics<00:00:14.519> when<00:00:14.610> it

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
of the most popular in epics when it

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.220 
of the most popular in epics when it
first<00:00:14.849> came<00:00:14.969> out<00:00:15.089> right<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> middle<00:00:15.960> when

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
first came out right in the middle when

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.420 
first came out right in the middle when
everything<00:00:16.680> first<00:00:16.830> started<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.220> netbooks

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
everything first started with netbooks

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.060 
everything first started with netbooks
but<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.690> redesign<00:00:19.260> now<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:19.619> still

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
but this is the redesign now it's still

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.250 
but this is the redesign now it's still
the<00:00:20.130> same<00:00:20.430> setup<00:00:21.119> they<00:00:21.300> didn't<00:00:21.510> want<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
the same setup they didn't want to you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.660 
the same setup they didn't want to you
know<00:00:22.289> evolution<00:00:22.890> eyes<00:00:23.130> they<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.460> wanted<00:00:23.609> to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
know evolution eyes they just wanted to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.040 
know evolution eyes they just wanted to
make<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.850> new<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.390> they<00:00:24.810> don't<00:00:24.960> have

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
make a new one because they don't have

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.179 
make a new one because they don't have
the<00:00:25.170> same<00:00:25.320> model<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.650> too<00:00:25.769> long<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.099> they

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the same model for too long so they

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.710 
the same model for too long so they
changed<00:00:26.460> little<00:00:26.939> things<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.599> there

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
changed little things here and there

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.660 
changed little things here and there
very<00:00:28.019> very<00:00:28.230> small<00:00:28.500> things<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.460> kind<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
very very small things and they kind of

also<00:01:09.600> upgraded<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> processor<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> little<00:01:10.830> bit

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
also upgraded the processor a little bit

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770 
also upgraded the processor a little bit
from<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.070> atom<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.610> 270<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> atom<00:01:12.600> and

from the atom and 270 to the atom and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.260 
from the atom and 270 to the atom and
280<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.040> still<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> four-wall<00:01:14.700> processor

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
280 now it's still a four-wall processor

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780 
280 now it's still a four-wall processor
it's<00:01:15.390> still<00:01:15.540> 1.6<00:01:16.140> gigahertz<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.280> does

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it's still 1.6 gigahertz but it does

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.280 
it's still 1.6 gigahertz but it does
operate<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> faster<00:01:18.720> front<00:01:18.930> side<00:01:19.080> bus

speeding that's gonna give you a little
bit<00:01:20.460> more<00:01:20.670> performance<00:01:21.259> especially<00:01:22.259> when

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
bit more performance especially when

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960 
bit more performance especially when
you're<00:01:22.650> plugging<00:01:22.830> things<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.250> USB<00:01:23.700> drives
