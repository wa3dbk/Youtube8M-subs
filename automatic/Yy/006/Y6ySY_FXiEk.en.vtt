00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.880
 hello everyone I show a small briefcase 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:20.329
 where I have a variety of games 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.169
 they are almost all metal and if it is not 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:26.269
 some metal and rope or even 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.939
 plastic as these can be 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.090
 I have already uploaded them and now what I'm going 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.090
 to show 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.460
 it is one that is very simple to make and 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.460
 I think that 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.260
 can do it any good been already 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.280
 has gone up on the internet but I 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 I show 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.100
 the way it is done is two 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.390
 prisoners 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.200
 the stirrups and clamps for 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.640
 cables or for ropes steel cables 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.930
 and then what you have to do is 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.830
 disarm it 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.270
 and this two its to be placed 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.859
 this form 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.859
 put the nuts again 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.660
 and return 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.100
 to leave him each with his two you 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.100
 sister 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.170
 the puzzle game consists of 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.590
 take out in these two pieces 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.710
 without loosening the nuts well this is the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.009
 that is uploaded and since here all 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.110
 we have to always add some 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.200
 Novelty since someone has uploaded it 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.680
 For the first time, I'm going to show you 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.440
 the what 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.320
 thinking about it, I managed to do 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:58.850
 I am the same game but adding 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.990
 quite more difficulty putting it 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:07.759
 4th year this is the original and this is 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:11.510
 a good variant, I hope it serves you 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.730
 to someone and we continue with the videos 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.580
 of puzzle games or puzzle 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.209
 puzzle thank you very much and until the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.209
