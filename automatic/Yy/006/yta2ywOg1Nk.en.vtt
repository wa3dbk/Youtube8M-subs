 i 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.220
 Kazakhstan occupies an extension five 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.610
 times greater than that of Spain and enjoy 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.410
 of a growing economy 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.779
 reinforce communications is key 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.160
 for a country that aspires to play a role 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.160
 relevant in the region 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.700
 with more than a decade of experience in 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.920
 the Asian country the railway company 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.950
 Talgo has witnessed the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.530
 transformation in kazakhstan everything started 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.450
 in 2001 with the sale of the first 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.120
 trains before bringing the san train 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.100
 Petersburg to amat and the first train that 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.570
 they bought 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 they brought a train here that were about 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.050
 four cars were doing 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.050
 tests 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.750
 18 days without a house until the tests 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.750
 they gave very good results 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.480
 the Kazakh railways were interested 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.060
 a lot for the train and from there 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.550
 began negotiations for the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.900
 signing a contract that the first one was 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.720
 the purchase of a train 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.280
 which is the one that currently circulates between 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.280
 almaty and even mind 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.630
 since then Talgo and the company 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.700
 Kazakhs public railways Tool 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.190
 park have maintained a collaboration 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.470
 narrow that crystallizes with the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.700
 establishment of a joint venture in 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.100
 2010 fruit of good development where the 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.630
 maintenance and service of these 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.740
 trains because a new order of 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.980
 420 passenger cars 420 cars 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.020
 cars with the 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.400
 singularity that these cars are 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.400
 manufactured in houses are 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.520
 it is from there that it starts 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.820
 with the idea of building the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.820
 factory that has something in astana 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.739
 in 2011 blaming legal talgo the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.989
 construction of this plant and enters 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.280
 functioning assuming several phases of 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.280
 the production of the trains 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.580
 the construction of the factory was a 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.390
 important challenge for something because it 's a 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.940
 of the first factories 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.560
 apart from the one we have in the USA 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.230
 that is built in a foreign country 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.020
 The factory has been designed based on the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.240
 technological process that Talgo has in 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.990
 Spain in other construction factories 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.970
 of passenger cars 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.160
 with the particularity is that we have 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.160
 had to adapt to this project 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.000
 where in kansas so well because the train 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.680
 It's a very long train of 35 cars and 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.330
 also to adapt to the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.790
 climatic conditions of this country 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.640
 Of course, the factory is working 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.880
 by stages that is to say trains 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.800
 cars forgive the cars come from 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:29.100
 Spain already manufactured even x percent and 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.370
 are finished here at home even with the 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.340
 time that the staff is already having 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.210
 better training because this factory in 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.210
 house are going to be doing more and more stages 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.880
 of manufacture that is to say will go increasing 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.300
 their participation in the termination of 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.300
 Cars 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.890
 the training of professionals 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.510
 local is crucial many of them are 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.329
 have trained for months in 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.950
 talgo facilities in Spain ' 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.110
 Right now we are in the process of 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.780
 develop the second phase of the plan 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.519
 training that is to do the training here 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.590
 in the factory of astana our 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.260
 specialists move to 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.500
 Astana facilities and supervise 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.539
 help and collaborate with professionals 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.440
 of hunting are to perform that second 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:24.669
 phase of the training already in situ with the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.669
 cars here in fighters so much 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.290
 today already been delivered six 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.570
 trains composed of 35 cars 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.910
 passengers a goal that is not always 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.000
 easy to meet because of the absence 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.060
 of suitable local suppliers something 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.750
 you need many companies to be able to 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.550
 manufacture then there are currently 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.010
 companies in spain that are manufacturing 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.940
 for the project of kazakhstan but which 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.830
 is the idea the idea is that these companies 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.110
 come the houses are and that the same 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.900
 they do Spain, they do it at home 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.930
 they are either 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.600
 them alone or either 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.479
 integrated with Kazakh companies within 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.300
 this industrial estate in which we 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.180
 we find 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.610
 we have some advantages to be an area 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.950
 special economic that any 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.870
 provider 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.030
 that you want to implant here could 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.730
 adhere to those advantages and surely 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.620
 can generate enough appeal 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.169
 so that companies that habitually 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:37.150
 they are working for something they can think 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.150
 implanted here in the country 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.889
 an invitation to keep in mind since 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:46.159
 The Spanish company is determined to 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.440
 stay in kazakhstan something has signed 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.030
 with the Kazakh railways a second 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.020
 project consisting of manufacturing 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.690
 of 600 three passenger cars the 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.210
 project is a bit different because 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.250
 Technically, it means a change in the design 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.800
 because now we are going to manufacture a wide box 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.500
 this is that we increase the 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.509
 width of the car in about 300 millimeters 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.100
 approximately to give more capacity 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.910
 to the 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.910
 the car does not 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.509
 this project valued at 400 82 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.120
 million euros ensures the future of 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.610
 talgo in the Asian country and constitutes 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.740
 an incomparable showcase to exhibit 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.370
 his know-how to other markets of the 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.300
 region since you canalize your part something 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.530
 It also aims to supply 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.169
 Passenger cars to all countries 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.870
 of the former Soviet republics of 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:45.930
 Turkmenistan Uzbekistan Kyrgyzstan 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.030
 they are very close countries besides 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.430
 recently in kazakhstan has entered 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.070
 in the customs union constituted by 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.660
 russia and belarus which in the next 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.050
 years will surely expand with 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.180
 new countries that will then open the 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.310
 competitive advantages of this factory to 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.800
 when supplying cars 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.530
 passengers with some tariffs 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.740
 preferential within this union 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.740
 customs
