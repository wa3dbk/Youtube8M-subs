00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.719
 barou morning team is very simple so 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.840
 first of all I start by brushing myself 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.840
 teeth 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.570
 then I will clean my face with 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.660
 a knife and salary solution 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.630
 L'oréal 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.160
 I also think about cleaning my neck there 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.300
 there are a lot of sacrifices to prove in 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.800
 the audience then my usual cream of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.600
 every day and it's the one of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.330
 chaining that I really love really 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.640
 because they are super good she has 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.160
 a texture that is very very soft and 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.190
 have more l inrap aragon the place that my 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.840
 skin is rather dry and sensitive 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.940
 I lay stretching to do well 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.100
 to penetrate the cream in the cup 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.570
 a brush my hair and my 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.570
 morning routine is over 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.680
 we pass the hand to my evening routine 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.690
 is his right - already to throw me 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.800
 flowers me I actually believe I'm brushing myself 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.800
 hair once in the evening 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.659
 I release my hair a little wind 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:18.189
 after years to remove it after 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.170
 I always remove my makeup with the 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.969
 micellar solution from l'oréal can 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.670
 be easy with two sheep to make 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.590
 every eye at the same time and otherwise 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.920
 sometimes when I have makeup more 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.329
 loaded is everything I use a 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.740
 jessy olé makeup remover will make it is 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.090
 long if much better 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.090
 the eyes game 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.260
 we undress and we go on ladle 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 and I actually wash my face under 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.530
 the shower and I use the branch no 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.730
 everything is horrifying 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.380
 clinic with the peach cleaner 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:58.320
 at jay cabbage I wash my hair 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.050
 with products from also so the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.450
 champion kids and is draws and the after 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.310
 shampoo for long hair like 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.100
 shower gel it will be clean in half 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.810
 wealth to shortages 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.540
 after when I finished washing myself down I 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 go out and I know I get dressed and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.820
 I apply moisturizer on 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.820
 the whole body 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.530
 and now I'm going to apply a 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.959
 mask and chaining which is called the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.760
 was going well and killer who is when 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.630
 even well enough I find that a product 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.370
 or cost about 1 0 and when 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.010
 not bad on the inside so you can 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.950
 to make it a stepping stone for Basque 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.930
 here is my head it was after having 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.970
 used the product is frankly there 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.340
 really is not bad he's just a 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.489
 little boring abdicated but the smell of the very 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.489
 good 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.540
 I'm back 15.8 or later and now I 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.360
 go reims and fissa and frankly 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.310
 it was a galley to stem all this 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.560
 because it'll be all right for my good 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.700
 and it clings to the soft skin and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.700
 June 13 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.980
 I admire my soft skin now I 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.709
 will apply this young person who comes from the 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.599
 naturally public mark which is a 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.000
 rotten everything and my heart I stings 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.769
 his faith in poetry danced my skin but 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.410
 frankly that they must not always 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.450
 much the one I read I find that 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.190
 it's the perfect combination with the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.099
 match like that it starts again mass 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.739
 that he misses and that that and I live 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.890
 then a cream around the eyes 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.569
 there his way and beats days but sometimes 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.489
 when I'm not lazy when I can 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.190
 I do not think it's better than nothing 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.400
 in m and in addition I like a lot of 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.400
 Serbian 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.460
 tale to finish I apply lip balm 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.560
 and this is my favorite 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.810
 I will be finished soon and I have not 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.260
 still never finished goal despite one 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.060
 see the finished video I hope you 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.120
