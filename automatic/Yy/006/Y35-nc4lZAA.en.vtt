from<00:04:39.030> their<00:04:39.330> books<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.650> so<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.070> can<00:04:41.430> take

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
from their books and so you can take

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.870 
from their books and so you can take
those<00:04:42.510> off<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.840> there<00:04:42.990> for<00:04:43.190> added<00:04:44.190> ease<00:04:44.520> of

entry and exit out of the shoe I was a

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.850 
entry and exit out of the shoe I was a
little<00:04:48.360> skeptical<00:04:48.660> of<00:04:48.870> that<00:04:48.930> system<00:04:49.320> when<00:04:49.800> I

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
little skeptical of that system when I

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.410 
little skeptical of that system when I
first<00:04:50.100> purchased<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.790> shoe

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420

the cable does not look to be that

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.830 
the cable does not look to be that
robust<00:04:56.580> however<00:04:57.580> as<00:04:57.790> I<00:04:57.820> said<00:04:58.090> I<00:04:58.120> wore<00:04:58.630> these

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
robust however as I said I wore these

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.680 
robust however as I said I wore these
for<00:04:58.900> a<00:04:59.170> year<00:04:59.470> and<00:04:59.650> have<00:05:00.040> found<00:05:00.480> them<00:05:01.480> to<00:05:01.630> be

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690

I've<00:05:33.830> purchased<00:05:34.130> the<00:05:34.460> shoes<00:05:34.729> I<00:05:35.169> put<00:05:36.169> those

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
I've purchased the shoes I put those

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.340 
I've purchased the shoes I put those
shoes<00:05:36.560> on<00:05:36.830> put<00:05:37.820> this<00:05:37.970> strap<00:05:38.780> where<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.050> wanted

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
shoes on put this strap where I wanted

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.939 
shoes on put this strap where I wanted
it<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:40.479> essentially<00:05:41.479> that<00:05:41.810> was<00:05:42.050> just<00:05:42.800> an

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
it and essentially that was just an

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.360 
it and essentially that was just an
initial<00:05:43.600> fitting<00:05:44.600> that<00:05:44.990> fitting<00:05:45.919> preference

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
initial fitting that fitting preference

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.870 
initial fitting that fitting preference
that<00:05:47.259> is<00:05:48.259> a<00:05:48.650> permanent<00:05:49.160> fixture<00:05:49.370> of<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.610> shoe

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
that is a permanent fixture of the shoe

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.260 
that is a permanent fixture of the shoe
I<00:05:50.120> do<00:05:51.110> ride<00:05:51.470> these<00:05:51.620> shoes<00:05:51.919> in<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.160> winter<00:05:52.280> and

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
I do ride these shoes in the winter and

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.659 
I do ride these shoes in the winter and
so<00:05:53.479> I<00:05:53.509> think<00:05:53.570> again<00:05:54.470> it's<00:05:54.949> just<00:05:55.310> kind<00:05:55.550> of<00:05:55.580> a

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
so I think again it's just kind of a

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.610 
so I think again it's just kind of a
testament<00:05:56.090> to<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.240> quality<00:05:56.360> of<00:05:56.630> the<00:05:56.750> shoe<00:05:57.020> the

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
testament to the quality of the shoe the

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.589 
testament to the quality of the shoe the
shoe<00:05:57.650> has<00:05:58.160> seen<00:05:58.430> water<00:05:59.330> snow<00:05:59.990> mud<00:06:00.650> sand<00:06:01.599> you

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
shoe has seen water snow mud sand you

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.060 
shoe has seen water snow mud sand you
name<00:06:02.810> it<00:06:03.020> I<00:06:03.259> put<00:06:04.190> the<00:06:04.340> shoe<00:06:04.550> through<00:06:04.820> it<00:06:06.070> I'll

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
name it I put the shoe through it I'll

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.790 
name it I put the shoe through it I'll
wear<00:06:07.340> a<00:06:07.550> thermal<00:06:08.479> boot<00:06:08.690> over<00:06:09.199> top<00:06:09.410> of<00:06:09.440> this

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
wear a thermal boot over top of this

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.950 
wear a thermal boot over top of this
with<00:06:10.070> a<00:06:10.099> pair<00:06:10.160> of<00:06:10.370> wool<00:06:10.550> socks<00:06:10.880> and<00:06:11.270> maybe<00:06:11.840> a

toe<00:06:12.199> warmer<00:06:12.560> and<00:06:13.490> that<00:06:13.669> keeps<00:06:13.970> my<00:06:14.180> feet<00:06:14.419> warm

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
toe warmer and that keeps my feet warm

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.330 
toe warmer and that keeps my feet warm
enough<00:06:15.020> for

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
enough for

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
well the huge advantage with this is

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.659 
well the huge advantage with this is
that<00:07:14.270> it<00:07:14.510> does<00:07:14.750> not<00:07:14.810> require<00:07:15.680> you<00:07:16.010> to<00:07:16.130> stop<00:07:16.460> and

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669 
that it does not require you to stop and

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:19.659

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
buckle system this very easily at the

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.300 
buckle system this very easily at the
top<00:07:25.450> of<00:07:25.480> my<00:07:25.840> cadence<00:07:26.140> can<00:07:26.640> give<00:07:27.640> it<00:07:27.730> a<00:07:27.790> turn<00:07:28.030> too
