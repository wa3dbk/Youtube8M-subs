00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that you have to play on and they're

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.310 
that you have to play on and they're
gonna<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.690> react<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.170> those

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
gonna see how you react in those

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.860 
gonna see how you react in those
situations<00:02:05.010> when<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.940> not<00:02:06.150> hand<00:02:06.420> selected

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
situations when it's not hand selected

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.859 
situations when it's not hand selected
every<00:02:07.080> position<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.549> think<00:02:09.060> travel<00:02:09.630> ball<00:02:09.750> is

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
every position so I think travel ball is

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.710 
every position so I think travel ball is
good<00:02:10.549> competition<00:02:11.549> is<00:02:11.640> good<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.030> them<00:02:12.150> but

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
good competition is good for them but

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.570 
good competition is good for them but
you<00:02:13.260> still<00:02:13.500> got<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.769> get<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.890> done<00:02:14.100> at<00:02:14.400> high

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
you still got to get it done at high

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.550 
you still got to get it done at high
school<00:02:14.850> as<00:02:15.450> far<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> recruiting<00:02:16.380> process

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
school as far as the recruiting process

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.220 
school as far as the recruiting process
I<00:02:16.890> think<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.549> think<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.480> more<00:02:18.720> important<00:02:19.140> to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
I think I think it's more important to

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.009 
I think I think it's more important to
play<00:02:19.440> high<00:02:19.680> school<00:02:19.709> ball<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:21.450> long<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:21.840> it's

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
play high school ball and long as it's

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.720 
play high school ball and long as it's
competitive<00:02:22.590> high<00:02:22.739> school<00:02:23.010> ball

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
competitive high school ball

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.670 
competitive high school ball
you<00:02:24.450> know<00:02:24.510> kids<00:02:24.989> are<00:02:25.080> going<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.230> get<00:02:25.410> seen

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
you know kids are going to get seen

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.380 
you know kids are going to get seen
they're<00:02:25.890> going<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.100> get<00:02:26.250> recognized<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.239> they

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
they're going to get recognized if they

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.550 
they're going to get recognized if they
can<00:02:27.570> play<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.410> know<00:02:28.500> based<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.160> ability<00:02:29.670> but

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
can play you know based on ability but

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.080 
can play you know based on ability but
you<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.769> whole<00:02:31.799> travel<00:02:32.459> ball<00:02:32.610> versus

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
you know the whole travel ball versus

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.440 
you know the whole travel ball versus
high<00:02:33.239> school<00:02:33.510> ball<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:35.299> think<00:02:36.299> high<00:02:36.420> school

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
high school ball I think high school

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.840 
high school ball I think high school
ball<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.989> more<00:02:37.170> important<00:02:37.650> because<00:02:37.980> it's

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
ball is more important because it's

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.910 
ball is more important because it's
structure<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.410> lot<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.650> parents

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
structure you get a lot of parents

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.870 
structure you get a lot of parents
pulling<00:02:41.280> their<00:02:41.400> kids<00:02:41.640> out<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.810> put<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.380> play

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
pulling their kids out to put to play

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.280 
pulling their kids out to put to play
you<00:02:44.880> know<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.209> travel<00:02:45.599> ball<00:02:45.720> or<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.020> home

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
you know in the travel ball or a home

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.550 
you know in the travel ball or a home
school

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.440 
school
we'll<00:02:46.650> type<00:02:46.860> settings<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.790> don't<00:02:48.239> think

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
we'll type settings I don't think

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.809 
we'll type settings I don't think
they're<00:02:48.599> getting<00:02:48.810> as<00:02:49.140> much<00:02:49.459> exposure<00:02:50.459> just

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
they're getting as much exposure just

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.120 
they're getting as much exposure just
because<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> competitiveness<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:52.130> truly

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
because of the competitiveness I truly

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.350 
because of the competitiveness I truly
believe<00:02:53.370> there's<00:02:53.610> there<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.060> place<00:02:54.330> for

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
believe there's there is a place for

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.839 
believe there's there is a place for
both<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.959> actually<00:02:55.319> do<00:02:55.620> coach<00:02:55.920> travel<00:02:56.400> baseball

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
both I actually do coach travel baseball

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.880 
both I actually do coach travel baseball
and<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.540> highly<00:02:57.870> competitive<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.739> kids

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
and it's highly competitive the kids

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.650 
and it's highly competitive the kids
play<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.099> number<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.520> games<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.000> they<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
play a number of games and they the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.880 
play a number of games and they the
positive<00:03:01.080> end<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.530> they're<00:03:01.680> playing
