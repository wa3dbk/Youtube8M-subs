phone stops working and the screens all
messed<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.800> then<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> go<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.399> way<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
messed up and then you go this way and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.990 
messed up and then you go this way and
it's<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:04.049> reverse<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.820> annoying

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
it's like reverse it's just so annoying

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
it's like reverse it's just so annoying
but<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.200> having<00:01:07.290> problems

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
but you know if you're having problems

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
but you know if you're having problems
with<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.090> talk<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.540> verizon

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
with that you know talk to your verizon

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.750 
with that you know talk to your verizon
right<00:01:11.640> whereas<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.330> person<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:14.250> normal

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
right whereas in person and it's normal

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.700 
right whereas in person and it's normal
I<00:01:14.970> guess<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.930> doesn't<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.380> me<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
I guess because it doesn't for me and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.130 
I guess because it doesn't for me and
another<00:01:17.310> person<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.820> know<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.380> I'm<00:01:19.549> to<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
another person I know so I'm to do this

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.990 
another person I know so I'm to do this
I've<00:01:22.140> had<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> freeze<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.280> always<00:01:23.640> solve<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
I've had a freeze and I always solve it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.570 
I've had a freeze and I always solve it
by<00:01:24.150> removing<00:01:24.540> battery<00:01:24.990> cover<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:26.430> do
