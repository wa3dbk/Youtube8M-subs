00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
have a jump onto the seat when I was

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.109 
have a jump onto the seat when I was
going<00:02:03.930> down<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.229> hill<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:05.460> ball<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:05.970> foot

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
going down the hill the ball of my foot

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.609 
going down the hill the ball of my foot
is<00:02:06.300> on<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.450> floor<00:02:06.750> when<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> sit<00:02:07.229> down<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
is on the floor when I sit down the

is on the floor when I sit down the
suspension<00:02:08.190> compresses<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.790> little<00:02:09.119> bit<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.649> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
suspension compresses a little bit so it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.520 
suspension compresses a little bit so it
does<00:02:11.100> help<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.630> decide<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.110> keep<00:02:13.260> hold

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
does help but if I decide to keep hold

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.870 
does help but if I decide to keep hold
of<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.709> bike<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.100> probably<00:02:14.340> would<00:02:14.610> fit<00:02:14.850> a

it<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:51.060> tires<00:02:51.360> are<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> more<00:02:52.560> road<00:02:52.860> orientated

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
it the tires are a more road orientated

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.950 
it the tires are a more road orientated
tire<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.120> he<00:02:54.180> was<00:02:54.300> telling<00:02:54.600> me<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:54.870> I

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
tire and he was telling me that if I

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.190 
tire and he was telling me that if I
wanted<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.350> go<00:02:55.530> off-road<00:02:56.930> masochistic<00:02:57.930> to

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
wanted to go off-road masochistic to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.470 
wanted to go off-road masochistic to
drier<00:02:58.470> lanes<00:02:58.800> or<00:02:59.010> gravel<00:02:59.460> and<00:03:00.060> start<00:03:00.330> going

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
drier lanes or gravel and start going

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.720 
drier lanes or gravel and start going
into<00:03:00.810> anything<00:03:01.020> muddy<00:03:01.550> apparently<00:03:02.550> it'll

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
into anything muddy apparently it'll

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.720 
into anything muddy apparently it'll
clog<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.180> tread<00:03:03.390> upon<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.690> tires

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
clog the tread upon the tires

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.309 
clog the tread upon the tires
so<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.120> need<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.510> get<00:03:06.629> some<00:03:06.870> more<00:03:07.019> off-road

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
so I need to get some more off-road

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.229 
so I need to get some more off-road
orientated<00:03:08.129> tires<00:03:08.370> if<00:03:08.609> I<00:03:08.700> want<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:08.879> do<00:03:08.969> more<00:03:09.209> of

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
orientated tires if I want to do more of

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.870 
orientated tires if I want to do more of
that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
that

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.150 
that
he<00:03:11.240> also<00:03:11.420> mentioned<00:03:12.140> which<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.800> agree<00:03:13.130> with

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
he also mentioned which I agree with

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.250 
he also mentioned which I agree with
actually<00:03:13.730> it's<00:03:14.150> almost<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.570> bit<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.840> shame<00:03:15.050> to

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
actually it's almost a bit of a shame to

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.480 
actually it's almost a bit of a shame to
take<00:03:15.440> something<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.040> off<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.280> road

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
take something like this off the road

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.420 
take something like this off the road
because<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.910> is<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.120> such<00:03:17.390> nice<00:03:17.660> condition

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
it's very very clean if there's actually

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.470

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
really thin on the walk around I'm

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.499 
really thin on the walk around I'm
surprised<00:05:04.039> how<00:05:04.340> comfortable<00:05:04.819> it<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.060> actually

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
surprised how comfortable it is actually

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.930 
surprised how comfortable it is actually
and<00:05:06.470> then<00:05:06.590> again<00:05:06.830> I<00:05:06.860> do<00:05:07.069> ride<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.430> turo<00:05:07.610> no

and then again I do ride the turo no
with<00:05:08.090> a<00:05:08.120> plank<00:05:08.479> as<00:05:08.750> a<00:05:08.780> seat<00:05:09.110> I<00:05:09.580> am<00:05:10.580> surprised

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
with a plank as a seat I am surprised

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.860 
with a plank as a seat I am surprised
it's<00:05:11.690> actually<00:05:12.139> very<00:05:12.319> very<00:05:12.560> comfortable

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.480 

there's<00:05:17.350> not<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.530> lot<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.800> say<00:05:17.949> about<00:05:17.980> it<00:05:18.220> really

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
there's not a lot to say about it really

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.100 
there's not a lot to say about it really
oh<00:05:18.669> just<00:05:18.850> thought<00:05:19.000> I'd<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.389> I'd<00:05:19.810> show<00:05:20.080> off

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
oh just thought I'd the I'd show off

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.560 
oh just thought I'd the I'd show off
that<00:05:20.410> I've<00:05:20.500> just<00:05:20.680> got<00:05:20.889> myself<00:05:21.040> a<00:05:21.400> a<00:05:21.639> very

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
that I've just got myself a a very

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.909 
that I've just got myself a a very
yellow<00:05:22.960> bike<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.840> I<00:05:25.930> suppose<00:05:26.290> it<00:05:26.500> might<00:05:26.650> do<00:05:26.889> a

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
yellow bike and I suppose it might do a

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.310 
yellow bike and I suppose it might do a
V<00:05:27.790> log<00:05:28.000> doing<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.330> bit<00:05:28.449> of<00:05:28.479> off-roading<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.199> you

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
V log doing a bit of off-roading and you

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.800 
V log doing a bit of off-roading and you
might<00:05:29.470> even<00:05:29.500> see<00:05:29.919> me<00:05:30.130> doing<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.270> Sven<00:05:31.600> and

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
might even see me doing a Sven and

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.950 
might even see me doing a Sven and
