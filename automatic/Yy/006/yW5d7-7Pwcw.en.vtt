door here and the rest of the bezel to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.710 
door here and the rest of the bezel to
allow<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.259> good<00:01:40.500> airflow<00:01:40.799> right<00:01:41.369> there<00:01:41.720> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
allow for good airflow right there I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
allow for good airflow right there I
should<00:01:43.259> use<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.619> moment<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> go<00:01:44.040> over<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
should use this moment to go over the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.929 
should use this moment to go over the
dimensions<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.880> guess<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.880> across<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
dimensions I guess so we have across the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.190 
dimensions I guess so we have across the

you will need to remove the panel that
is<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.730> inside<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.390> we'll<00:03:13.510> get<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.660> closer

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
is on the inside and we'll get a closer

but<00:03:15.940> basically<00:03:16.180> they've<00:03:16.690> put<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.140> there<00:03:17.350> in

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
but basically they've put that there in

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.710 
but basically they've put that there in
case<00:03:17.680> you're<00:03:17.830> not<00:03:17.950> going<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.459> use<00:03:18.640> top<00:03:18.940> fans<00:03:19.330> to

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
case you're not going to use top fans to

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.710 
case you're not going to use top fans to
increase<00:03:20.290> your<00:03:20.769> sound<00:03:21.250> deadening<00:03:21.720> moving

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
increase your sound deadening moving

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.690 
increase your sound deadening moving
along<00:03:23.019> now<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.530> bottom<00:03:24.040> we<00:03:24.220> have<00:03:24.250> some

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
along now to the bottom we have some

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.370 
along now to the bottom we have some
rubberized<00:03:25.090> feet<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.660> raise<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.019> up<00:03:26.110> off<00:03:26.350> the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
rubberized feet to raise it up off the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
more of that sound deadening material

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.550 
more of that sound deadening material
that<00:03:41.950> lines<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.340> entire<00:03:42.790> case<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.900> dampen<00:03:44.380> any
