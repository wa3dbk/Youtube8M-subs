 It is very well known 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.250

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.990
 also the percentages transitions that still whip and cape other 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.500
 the manchego 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.230
 it's very heavy 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.910
 kilo Cooperators place to another 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.100
 p that expression that makes it 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.810
 we will see how not 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.020
 an image moving 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.630
 in this transition and also changes them 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.740
 also for example the other 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.250
 we keep something 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.660
 this folder how are they going to meet 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.270
 pitched petrocat understands that it will have another 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.130
 efe 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.440
 those different addicts a little bit us bitter by eta 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 with another style man 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.100
 mapping almost every country in which the criminal pattern the kmt 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.190
 rightly controlled he said no 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.700
 and good 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.129
 everything ended up almost intact when offering our industries 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:17.319
 I train with her we bring three to any kind of program to do 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.199
 this 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.249
 and well we do not hide wish they replaced eight encounters 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.249
 What would be the opposite direction? 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.219
 those who decide to discard that the modified social that brings everything an icon 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.229
 new 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:33.409
 this phase have been waiting 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.809
 I think it's amortizing and I'm just addicted mario juárez 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.219
 today that the game ends faster both lopez matters as the one that is going to 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:41.579

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.379
 you have explained that being all book the singer and that hawks adapt 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.759
 fia moya 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.720
 this what we will need to 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.569
 jia change the patience 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.739
 counters 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.249
 percent 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.909
 with the modification 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.430
 we are going to suffer a lot those memories I claim 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.710
 the Chinese like all the unions will have to see 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.589
 the ministry some cases 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.779
 and all eight in hopkins caracas here we are going to write the fact that 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.090
 will grind 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.149
 in this case it has been done at this point to start 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.299
 but good here as he wrote that opposite sense the team 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.669
 just like now 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.249
 because she yes in the homofobia location enrique pacheco 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.759
 because to look for a speech 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.720

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.990
 let's see the remove the location of kunduz and trenti stand or what 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.279

 to see this content 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:45.670
 for blind not 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.969
 here 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.959
 among other points the first sword efe create a backup that sense 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.469
 because the state we are all cst 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.349
 and copy 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.499
 oquelí and now I love you we do not know that this hurts 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.549
 feels uncle copies 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.899
 percent and has gone northeast what is the security itself this witness counted 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:09.039
 delegate 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.089
 because the 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:11.619
 in case something happens 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.319
 more easily 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.609
 unit but that's not 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.079
 all this does not mean anything bad croquettes 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.159
 now 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.620
 a windows no no the sea what is 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.000
 glaad this sense counted l what we have done is to say names 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.099
 we are with that sense point of the entity 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.099
 xx 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:38.370
 to be like this 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.309
 so that ue uu 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:40.539
 multiple problems 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.270
 now we truly do the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.680
 this figure can be stressful 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.629
 I'm more tired 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:50.650
 i 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.039
 in the first hour the fact that we lose on Monday 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.039
 a man of 67 years 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:02.379
 ii - after defeating this crisis demands a rigor presence of being another 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.589
 in information 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:09.019
 we were copies these witnesses point the mayor label is everything an icon and everything 

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:10.789
 that 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.069
 and the best sail in port that sense 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.180
 tocqueville now 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.490
 if we want 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.979
 save what they say 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.309
 to which we changed the name to the original 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:27.309
 we could not erase part that we did very well 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.279
 We will accept that the beginning 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.129
 by the way dread team restart 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:37.529
 i this is not like that 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.629
 now I was caught monster 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.339
 with the changes 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.129
 everything has changed 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:50.039
 i the bikers and we act with dialectic this concept is placed in its turn 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.879
 The decision was agreed upon 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.289
 in this sense 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.300
 that we put to study what inc 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.100
 now seven for example if you want to rule out evils if you did not like the 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.499
 Explicit brawling style crashed against the ere
