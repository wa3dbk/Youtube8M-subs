you know that you've activated this one

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.090 
you know that you've activated this one
as<00:01:17.689> well<00:01:17.869> it<00:01:18.080> might<00:01:18.229> be<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.409> little<00:01:18.680> tricky<00:01:19.070> to

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
as well it might be a little tricky to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.740 
as well it might be a little tricky to
get<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:19.460> one<00:01:19.670> I<00:01:19.820> had<00:01:19.939> to<00:01:20.060> wiggle<00:01:20.360> around<00:01:20.479> a

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
get this one I had to wiggle around a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.630 
get this one I had to wiggle around a
little<00:01:20.869> bit<00:01:21.080> just<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.680> actually<00:01:22.100> activate<00:01:22.520> it

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
little bit just to actually activate it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.100 
little bit just to actually activate it
so<00:01:22.670> if<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:22.939> don't<00:01:23.119> get<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.420> just<00:01:23.450> by<00:01:23.750> looking

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
so if you don't get it just by looking

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.660 
so if you don't get it just by looking
straight<00:01:24.350> at<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.650> move<00:01:24.830> around<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.430> then<00:01:25.520> you

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
straight at it move around and then you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.609 
straight at it move around and then you
should<00:01:25.729> get<00:01:26.119> it<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:26.750> for<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.049> last<00:01:27.259> one<00:01:27.409> you

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
should get it so for this last one you

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:28.810 
should get it so for this last one you
want<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.829> make<00:01:27.979> your<00:01:28.100> way<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.549> title
