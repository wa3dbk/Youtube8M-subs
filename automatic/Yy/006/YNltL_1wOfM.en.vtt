it with my blue hair wig just kind of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.289 
it with my blue hair wig just kind of
combing<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.030> through<00:01:07.130> with<00:01:08.130> my<00:01:08.430> toothbrush

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
combing it through with my toothbrush

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.200 
combing it through with my toothbrush
here<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:12.510> paint<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.979> water<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:14.700> paint

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
here the paint on the water down paint

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.760 
here the paint on the water down paint
it's<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.659> acrylic<00:01:16.110> paint<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> water

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it's just acrylic paint in the water

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.230 
it's just acrylic paint in the water
there's<00:01:17.130> nothing<00:01:17.520> fancy<00:01:17.939> here

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
there's nothing fancy here

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:28.270 
there's nothing fancy here
and<00:01:18.650> just<00:01:19.650> comb<00:01:19.950> comb<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.759> through<00:01:21.860> your<00:01:22.860> hair

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.670 

it's<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.340> difficult<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.390> tell<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it's really difficult to tell with the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's really difficult to tell with the
dark<00:01:31.950> hair<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.720> anything<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.840> even<00:01:34.079> happening

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
dark hair if anything is even happening

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.460 
dark hair if anything is even happening
I<00:01:34.680> can't<00:01:35.100> tell<00:01:35.490> at<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:37.070> if<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.670> red<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.090> even

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
I can't tell at all if the red is even

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.090 
I can't tell at all if the red is even
in<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.170> I'm<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.409> gonna<00:01:43.530> dip<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.890> in

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
in that kind of I'm just gonna dip it in

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.340 
in that kind of I'm just gonna dip it in
there<00:01:45.049> let's<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.320> how<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.649> works

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
there let's see how this works

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.190 
there let's see how this works
dip<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> paint<00:01:50.420> water<00:01:51.420> down<00:01:51.689> paint<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
dip it in the paint water down paint and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.810 
dip it in the paint water down paint and
then<00:01:53.240> comb<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
then comb it

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.230 
then comb it
the<00:01:56.820> combing<00:01:57.240> part<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> important<00:01:58.170> because<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
the combing part is important because it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.899 
the combing part is important because it
makes<00:02:00.240> sure<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.960> hair<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:02.130> paint<00:02:02.520> gets

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
makes sure that the hair the paint gets

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.289 
makes sure that the hair the paint gets
through<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.329> all<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.600> layers<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> hair

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
through to all the layers of the hair

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.170 
through to all the layers of the hair
yeah<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.200> don't<00:02:08.009> really

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:24.100 

see<00:02:11.720> this

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:35.830 

working<00:02:24.920> out<00:02:25.070> here

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.430 

I'm<00:02:36.840> dipping<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> water<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.930> then

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
I'm dipping it in the water and then

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.090 
I'm dipping it in the water and then
with<00:02:40.620> my<00:02:40.800> fingers<00:02:41.220> I'm<00:02:41.520> kind<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:42.860> running<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
with my fingers I'm kind of running the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.010 
with my fingers I'm kind of running the
water<00:02:44.310> through<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.090> if<00:02:45.330> maybe<00:02:45.510> that'll

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
water through it to see if maybe that'll

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.160 
water through it to see if maybe that'll
help<00:02:46.050> get<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.500> more<00:02:46.710> concentrated<00:02:47.990> onto<00:02:48.990> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
help get it more concentrated onto the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.780

head like scalped somebody like I don't
know<00:03:12.600> until<00:03:12.900> it's<00:03:13.050> done<00:03:13.350> it's<00:03:14.070> small<00:03:14.550> it's<00:03:14.790> a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
know until it's done it's small it's a

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.480 
know until it's done it's small it's a
small<00:03:14.940> amount<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.570> hair<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.950> probably

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
small amount of hair so it probably

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.620 
small amount of hair so it probably
won't<00:03:17.820> take<00:03:17.940> like<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:19.770> full<00:03:20.040> six<00:03:20.460> hours<00:03:20.880> or<00:03:21.210> 24

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
won't take like the full six hours or 24

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.600 
won't take like the full six hours or 24
hours<00:03:21.960> like<00:03:22.170> what<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.380> usually<00:03:22.650> do<00:03:23.070> or<00:03:23.400> what<00:03:23.580> I

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
hours like what I usually do or what I

hours like what I usually do or what I
waited<00:03:23.850> for<00:03:24.210> before<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.460> don't<00:03:26.550> have<00:03:26.730> to

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
waited for before so I don't have to

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.550 
waited for before so I don't have to
wait<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.300> long<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:33.050> really<00:03:34.050> want<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.350> to

bright red it's not gonna be the same
color<00:03:55.080> red<00:03:55.380> like<00:03:55.709> if<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:56.790> dyed<00:03:57.000> your<00:03:57.270> hair<00:03:57.330> red

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
but we're just trying to see if maybe we

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.979 
but we're just trying to see if maybe we
can<00:04:01.590> tint<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.310> little<00:04:02.489> bit<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.870> has

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
can tint it a little bit so that it has

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.190 
can tint it a little bit so that it has
a<00:04:04.020> hint<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.560> red<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.750> have<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.780> feeling

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
a hint of red to it I have a feeling

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.050 
a hint of red to it I have a feeling
that<00:04:07.319> if<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.590> are<00:04:07.800> gonna<00:04:07.950> do<00:04:08.160> dark<00:04:08.550> wig<00:04:08.760> so

that's about all you're gonna get out of

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.060 
that's about all you're gonna get out of
the<00:04:10.650> dark<00:04:10.860> wig<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.340> like<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.300> tinting<00:04:12.750> job<00:04:13.070> so

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
the dark wig is like a tinting job so

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.530
