hello again everyone I'm O'Neal Williams

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.129 
hello again everyone I'm O'Neal Williams
of<00:00:10.260> oniel<00:00:10.800> outside<00:00:11.429> television<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.450> I'm<00:00:12.900> here

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
of oniel outside television and I'm here

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.189 
of oniel outside television and I'm here
to<00:00:13.259> tell<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.650> about<00:00:13.679> CBA's<00:00:14.670> Buckhorn<00:00:15.660> rifle

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
to tell you about CBA's Buckhorn rifle

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.070 
to tell you about CBA's Buckhorn rifle
now<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> Buckhorn<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.300> would<00:00:18.510> be<00:00:18.720> called

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
now the Buckhorn is what would be called

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.490 
now the Buckhorn is what would be called
a<00:00:19.970> conventional<00:00:20.970> inline<00:00:21.510> muzzle<00:00:22.050> loader<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a conventional inline muzzle loader and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.250 
a conventional inline muzzle loader and
that's<00:00:23.189> because<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.180> functionally<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
that's because it is functionally of the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.859 
that's because it is functionally of the
same<00:00:25.500> design<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.789> very<00:00:27.029> first<00:00:27.390> modern

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
same design as the very first modern

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019 
same design as the very first modern
inline<00:00:28.320> guns<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:29.010> were<00:00:29.189> introduced<00:00:29.760> back

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
inline guns which were introduced back

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.049 
inline guns which were introduced back
in<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> mid<00:00:30.660> 1990s<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:32.340> these<00:00:32.489> were<00:00:32.730> guns

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
in the mid 1990s now these were guns

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.620 
in the mid 1990s now these were guns
that<00:00:33.390> changed<00:00:34.260> muzzleloading<00:00:35.010> forever

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
that changed muzzleloading forever

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.750 
that changed muzzleloading forever
providing<00:00:36.630> an<00:00:36.780> easier<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.590> use<00:00:37.890> alternative

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
providing an easier to use alternative

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.139 
providing an easier to use alternative
to<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> traditionally<00:00:40.350> styled<00:00:40.680> guns<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to the traditionally styled guns the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.510 
to the traditionally styled guns the
Buckhorn<00:00:42.570> action<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.829> quite<00:00:44.190> simple

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
Buckhorn action is really quite simple

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.110 
Buckhorn action is really quite simple
it<00:00:45.480> uses<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> spring<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.890> bolt<00:00:47.190> type<00:00:47.579> design

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
it uses a spring and bolt type design

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.529 
it uses a spring and bolt type design
when<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> boat<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.410> pulled<00:00:49.950> back<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:51.180> then

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
when the boat is pulled back it's then

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
when the boat is pulled back it's then
locked<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.110> position<00:00:52.260> over<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> loaded

locked in position over the loaded

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.180 
locked in position over the loaded
spring<00:00:53.660> when<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> safety<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.410> released<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
spring when the safety is released and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.580 
spring when the safety is released and
the<00:00:56.280> trigger<00:00:56.520> pulled<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.690> boat<00:00:57.930> slams

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the trigger pulled the boat slams

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.639 
the trigger pulled the boat slams
forward<00:00:59.190> strikes<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.210> primer<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.410> gun

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
forward strikes the primer and the gun

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.640 
forward strikes the primer and the gun
then<00:01:02.100> fires<00:01:02.719> while<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.019> system<00:01:04.290> is

certainly not new it's still very
applicable<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.790> today's<00:01:09.119> muzzleloader<00:01:10.110> hunt

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
applicable for today's muzzleloader hunt

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.219 
applicable for today's muzzleloader hunt
for<00:01:10.890> several<00:01:11.280> reasons<00:01:11.729> really<00:01:11.990> because<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
for several reasons really because the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.800 
for several reasons really because the
guns<00:01:13.439> design<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.430> simple<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.270> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
guns design is so simple it is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.010 
guns design is so simple it is
relatively<00:01:16.560> inexpensive<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.430> Bruce<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.060> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
relatively inexpensive to Bruce and this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320 
relatively inexpensive to Bruce and this
makes<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.650> Buckhorn<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.580> most<00:01:20.850> affordable

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
makes the Buckhorn the most affordable

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.890 
makes the Buckhorn the most affordable
of<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.710> CBA's<00:01:23.250> rifles<00:01:23.850> retailing<00:01:24.720> for

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
about one hundred and fifty dollars

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.020 
about one hundred and fifty dollars
because<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.080> action<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:29.130> open<00:01:29.700> breech

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
because this action is an open breech

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.830 
because this action is an open breech
design<00:01:30.770> meaning<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.340> charge<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.270> open
