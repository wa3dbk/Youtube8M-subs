00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.340
 Hello, I show you how to do it today 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.080
 the earrings the wires you saw 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.290
 in the preview they are of virgins 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.510
 very simple a style in porto novo e 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.359
 are suitable let's say it's not much for 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.369
 summer because copper with a crystal 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.769
 I like very much I see very summery like 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.740
 how pairing we need 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:32.290
 very few things we need the thread 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:35.530
 of copper this 1.2 mm of the drops of 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.649
 glass in this case I'm using will use 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:43.120
 in these drop accepted 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:45.640
 cups right mister fatah these 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.879
 cups here I call them to cease e 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.160
 then if I can take the other sail 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.289
 moved because I solve the drawer 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.609
 here it is and it is a cover a 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 little flower then we need pliers 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:05.400
 and a copper-colored copper manhole cover 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.659
 to be able to engage our own 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.380
 pearl drop 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.649
 now the first step is to cut 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.020
 in two pieces of copper wire 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:20.039
 in this case I togato a piece of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.289
 about 10 11 centimeters and you can 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.659
 do it of different sizes depending on the 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.820
 necessity and also depending on the measure 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.799
 of wire you use 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.539
 I advise you not to go under 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.579
 millimeter 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.619
 unless you then want to hammer it 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.950
 because otherwise it would remain a little 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.299
 too soft and likely to deform 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.069
 but if you go down in a 0 90 hammer it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.069
 because INRAN and peculiarities that a 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.349
 Once it is hammered it then hardens 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:52.170
 you always see for the same reason 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:54.959
 I advise you not to exceed a millimeter 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.880
 and a half because then they become a little bit 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.640
 massive also difficult then from 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.970
 explain value yourself and see though 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.240
 you the one you have at home I align 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.390
 the first part of this recchino alle 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.260
 two pieces of thread while using pliers a 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.100
 The round nose in his own hand 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.290
 the end and I make a curl is already 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.079
 I tell you that I am doing quite a bit of 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.090
 struggling to do it now 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.170
 this came to me a little wrong then 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.170
 I have to close it 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.609
 and here is the first the first step 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.010
 so a curl will do the same thing 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:38.680
 also from the other side e 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.920
 I will always do it in the same way then 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.819
 I want them to say they have it 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:51.610
 same verse so I take the side 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:54.730
 opposite I line them up again the thread 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:02.040
 it's a draw I didn't notice 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.040
 first and do another rizzolo 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.930
 obviously this is too big and 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.840
 together myself I can not do it 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.940
 here I do it first one and then 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.500
 the other one can also do so with 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.139
 the foresight to hold the pliers 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.639
 always at the same height if you have 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.900
 afraid of making a mistake, make yourself a sign 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.900
 with the permanent marker 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.489
 after what i do the earring is 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.920
 slightly asymmetrical on itself 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.420
 so it will have a shorter part is one 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.099
 longer part 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.819
 we have the little bit left 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:40.620
 said things in the meantime the musts the covers 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:46.030
 I hold about a third in abundance 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:49.090
 of the earring in fist the thread with the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.829
 vie colli coliche and I bring it my own 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.900
 the end in its own most part 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:59.639
 wide and with the other hand in the direction of the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.889
 so curl of the outside part 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:08.169
 I push the copper wire like this 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:11.349
 to have this effect just a bit 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:16.090
 drop if you don't like it to stay that way 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:18.940
 straight simply with pliers it 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.330
 board a little bit and this is the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.940
 shape you need to get with the thread of 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.550
 copper I do the same thing from the other 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.550
 then he takes her in hand 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.240
 and diego 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.430
 broadly the two curls must 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.539
 to be at this distance precisely 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.630
 obviously you say oh well but not at all 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.110
 so we have two earrings perfectly 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.150
 identical 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.789
 it will simply be enough when we assemble it 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.940
 to hook the nun in this 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.310
 so the part then let's say prettier 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.910
 of the earring is composed of ours 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.400
 pearl that net drop on the leg 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.320
 a nun no brother one 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.449
 cup excuse the la perla and la 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.370
 this cup then this basket 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:24.030
 here in filigree I see my nail 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:27.680
 I cut the excess I make my drawer 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:35.430
 my my drawer to hook them 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:38.509
 then with a pair of pliers I open the hook e 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:42.150
 then I do it with the other is bent over 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:44.810
 I have already prepared the first pearl for 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.810
 save time 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.940
 here it is 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.310
 then I take my finished nacelles 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.610
 forgot to pull out of the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.830
 bag we think a skin in 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.140
 around I didn't find them should forces 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.930
 to have them for you I feel but really really 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:11.210
 these in particular I bought him on 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:13.880
 ebay looking arinze puc 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.000
 if I'm not mistaken , if you are looking 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.940
 they having fuchs come out the 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.340
 monachelle or haring phoenix 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.070
 fielding I can't pronounce it forgive 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.100
 I'm really a goat with English 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.470
 however finishes for earrings and these 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.610
 this is where my rich are finished 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:36.980
 montreux a lot also the other lately 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.650
 ne tutorial mipa but we have a lot 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.530
 precisely the foresight to mount it in 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.420
 differently because otherwise there 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.420
 They are both in the same direction 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:51.550
 and there are those who can please but I don't like it 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:54.080
 and here it is and not if you feel I'm finished 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.210
 very simple but in my opinion very nice 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.480
 obviously you can further 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.820
 enrich them with other pearls with others 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.560
 spring onions you can make 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:08.120
 windings with a thinner thread 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.740
 it's up to you to decide the le 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.570
 finishes if you want then the 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.810
 enrichments you want to put there 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.970
 I only showed the basis of 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.740
 continue to fall so I close here the 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.910
 video tutorial and see you at the next 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.570
 video 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.570
 hello to all
