figures now their tops and their bottoms
can<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.289> interchangeable<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.489> come

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
can be interchangeable so they come

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.040 
can be interchangeable so they come
apart<00:00:32.940> they<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.270> magnets<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> middle

apart they have magnets in the middle

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.170 
apart they have magnets in the middle
and<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.530> then<00:00:34.649> choose<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.610> top<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and you can then choose which top and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.490 
and you can then choose which top and
which<00:00:36.270> bottom<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> want<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.200> your

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
which bottom you want out of your

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.950 
which bottom you want out of your
collection<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.489> each<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> these<00:00:39.000> Skylanders

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
swap force figures have a double name so

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.619 
swap force figures have a double name so
maybe<00:00:42.120> Magna<00:00:42.870> force<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.530> wash<00:00:44.160> buckler<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
maybe Magna force or wash buckler and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.930 
maybe Magna force or wash buckler and
that<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> name<00:00:46.500> indicates<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.579> top

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that the name indicates what the top

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.290 
that the name indicates what the top
half<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> bottom<00:00:48.600> half<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:50.090> now<00:00:51.090> by

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
half and the bottom half can do now by

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.939 
half and the bottom half can do now by
switching<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:51.899> around<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.469> essentially

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
switching them around you essentially

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.850 
switching them around you essentially
create<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.910> own<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.719> own<00:00:54.750> Skylanders<00:00:55.410> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
create your own your own Skylanders so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
create your own your own Skylanders so
to<00:00:55.920> mix<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.640> those<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.120> maybe<00:00:57.329> would<00:00:57.600> end<00:00:57.840> up

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
to mix up those you maybe would end up

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.549 
to mix up those you maybe would end up
with<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> top<00:00:59.219> from<00:00:59.699> Magna<00:01:00.239> force<00:01:00.510> magna<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
with the top from Magna force magna and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.570 
with the top from Magna force magna and
then<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.940> bottom<00:01:03.559> from<00:01:04.559> wash<00:01:04.860> buckler<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.489> you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
then the bottom from wash buckler so you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.060 
then the bottom from wash buckler so you
have<00:01:05.700> Magna<00:01:06.180> Butler<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.650> way

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
have Magna Butler so that in that way

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.300 
have Magna Butler so that in that way

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839 
developers and is interesting to hear

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:36.899 
developers and is interesting to hear
that<00:05:35.199> they<00:05:35.650> had<00:05:35.860> they<00:05:36.039> had<00:05:36.250> a<00:05:36.279> hand<00:05:36.669> in

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
that they had they had a hand in

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.149 
that they had they had a hand in
developing<00:05:37.089> the<00:05:37.960> engine<00:05:38.409> that's<00:05:38.589> been<00:05:38.710> used

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
developing the engine that's been used

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.579 
developing the engine that's been used
for<00:05:39.310> Skylanders<00:05:40.029> and<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.930> seems<00:05:41.229> like<00:05:41.469> the

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:41.589 
for Skylanders and it seems like the

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.290 
for Skylanders and it seems like the
visuals<00:05:42.099> and<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.490> sort<00:05:42.729> of<00:05:42.759> the<00:05:42.849> quality<00:05:43.270> and

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
visuals and the sort of the quality and

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.939 
visuals and the sort of the quality and
the<00:05:43.449> resolution<00:05:44.020> of<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.169> game<00:05:44.199> this<00:05:44.500> year<00:05:44.560> has

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
the resolution of the game this year has

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.040 
the resolution of the game this year has
been<00:05:44.979> upped<00:05:45.400> particular<00:05:45.969> on<00:05:46.029> the<00:05:46.120> 360<00:05:46.659> and<00:05:46.900> the

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
been upped particular on the 360 and the

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.659 
been upped particular on the 360 and the
PlayStation<00:05:47.199> version<00:05:47.979> to<00:05:48.099> be<00:05:48.219> interesting<00:05:48.550> to

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
PlayStation version to be interesting to

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.640 
PlayStation version to be interesting to
see<00:05:48.849> whether<00:05:49.539> they<00:05:49.750> can<00:05:49.810> match<00:05:50.139> that<00:05:50.169> on<00:05:50.529> the

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
see whether they can match that on the

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.950 
see whether they can match that on the
Wii<00:05:50.770> because<00:05:51.069> with<00:05:51.279> those<00:05:51.550> platforms<00:05:51.960> really

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
Wii because with those platforms really

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.540 
Wii because with those platforms really
upping<00:05:53.349> upping<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.860> ante<00:05:54.129> in<00:05:54.159> terms<00:05:54.279> of

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
upping upping the ante in terms of

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.700 
upping upping the ante in terms of
graphics<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.180> visuals<00:05:55.569> and<00:05:55.750> sound<00:05:56.020> I<00:05:56.289> think

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
graphics and visuals and sound I think

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.409 
graphics and visuals and sound I think
it<00:05:56.919> could<00:05:57.099> be<00:05:57.279> that<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.520> Wii<00:05:57.729> version<00:05:58.150> we<00:05:58.270> know

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
it could be that the Wii version we know

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.209 
it could be that the Wii version we know
will<00:05:58.599> suffer<00:05:58.990> a<00:05:59.020> little<00:05:59.110> bit<00:05:59.409> again<00:06:00.069> we're

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.219 
will suffer a little bit again we're

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.200 
will suffer a little bit again we're
going<00:06:00.310> to<00:06:00.400> be<00:06:00.520> seeing<00:06:01.050> shared<00:06:02.050> screen

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
going to be seeing shared screen

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.820 
going to be seeing shared screen
cooperative<00:06:04.210> play<00:06:04.479> not<00:06:05.229> matching<00:06:05.620> Disney

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
cooperative play not matching Disney

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.320 
cooperative play not matching Disney
infinity<00:06:05.949> who've<00:06:06.370> gone<00:06:06.550> for<00:06:06.789> a<00:06:06.819> split<00:06:07.089> screen

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
infinity who've gone for a split screen

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.110 
infinity who've gone for a split screen
and<00:06:07.599> also<00:06:07.960> online<00:06:08.199> for<00:06:09.189> player<00:06:09.490> play<00:06:09.789> as<00:06:09.969> well

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
and also online for player play as well

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.390 
and also online for player play as well
so<00:06:10.569> it<00:06:10.689> seems<00:06:10.990> like<00:06:11.169> activision<00:06:11.979> may<00:06:12.069> be<00:06:12.129> doing

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
so it seems like activision may be doing

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.159 
so it seems like activision may be doing
what<00:06:12.550> they<00:06:12.669> have<00:06:12.969> done<00:06:13.180> with<00:06:13.300> Treyarch<00:06:13.900> and

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
what they have done with Treyarch and

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.920 
what they have done with Treyarch and
Infinity<00:06:14.650> Ward<00:06:14.919> and<00:06:15.219> so<00:06:15.789> having<00:06:16.029> an<00:06:16.270> alternate

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
Infinity Ward and so having an alternate

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.629 
Infinity Ward and so having an alternate
years<00:06:17.409> and<00:06:17.680> terms<00:06:17.830> of<00:06:17.919> developers<00:06:18.310> so<00:06:18.430> this

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
years and terms of developers so this

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.950 
years and terms of developers so this
year<00:06:18.849> we're<00:06:18.969> seeing<00:06:19.089> Vicarious<00:06:19.569> Visions<00:06:19.629> and

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
year we're seeing Vicarious Visions and

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.959 
year we're seeing Vicarious Visions and
I<00:06:19.990> suspect<00:06:20.469> toys<00:06:21.039> for<00:06:21.219> Bob<00:06:21.460> may<00:06:21.669> well<00:06:21.849> be

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
I suspect toys for Bob may well be

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.659 
I suspect toys for Bob may well be
working<00:06:22.180> on<00:06:22.509> a<00:06:22.779> version<00:06:23.289> of<00:06:23.620> Skylanders<00:06:24.430> that

working on a version of Skylanders that

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:25.379 
working on a version of Skylanders that
will<00:06:24.759> be<00:06:24.849> coming<00:06:25.089> out<00:06:25.180> on<00:06:25.210> the

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
will be coming out on the

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.629 
will be coming out on the
next-generation<00:06:26.189> PlayStation<00:06:27.189> 4<00:06:27.430> in<00:06:27.550> the

next-generation PlayStation 4 in the

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.790 
next-generation PlayStation 4 in the
next<00:06:27.849> Xbox<00:06:28.120> so<00:06:28.689> be<00:06:28.839> instant'<00:06:29.110> to<00:06:29.199> see<00:06:29.349> how<00:06:29.740> that

pans<00:06:30.099> out<00:06:30.339> but<00:06:31.180> by<00:06:31.300> doing<00:06:31.360> that<00:06:31.689> I<00:06:31.839> think

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
pans out but by doing that I think

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.480 
pans out but by doing that I think
you're<00:06:32.229> able<00:06:32.379> to<00:06:32.620> see<00:06:32.770> that<00:06:32.889> there's<00:06:33.129> more

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
you're able to see that there's more

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.639 
you're able to see that there's more
time<00:06:34.210> for<00:06:34.719> them<00:06:34.810> to<00:06:34.930> spend<00:06:35.139> on<00:06:35.289> developing

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:35.649 
time for them to spend on developing

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:37.559 
time for them to spend on developing

not<00:06:41.289> to<00:06:41.409> mention<00:06:41.560> the<00:06:41.770> we<00:06:41.860> released<00:06:42.129> figures

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
not to mention the we released figures

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.790 
not to mention the we released figures
and<00:06:43.270> there's<00:06:43.509> a<00:06:43.599> big<00:06:43.840> investment<00:06:44.319> in<00:06:44.529> both<00:06:44.680> the

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
and there's a big investment in both the

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.239 
and there's a big investment in both the
creativity<00:06:45.569> in<00:06:46.569> studio<00:06:47.229> time<00:06:47.590> not<00:06:48.009> just<00:06:48.159> on

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:48.249 
creativity in studio time not just on

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:50.429 
creativity in studio time not just on
the<00:06:48.370> figures<00:06:48.729> but<00:06:48.879> on<00:06:49.029> the<00:06:49.120> game<00:06:49.240> itself<00:06:49.599> so<00:06:49.749> by

00:06:50.429 --> 00:06:50.439 
the figures but on the game itself so by

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:52.230 
the figures but on the game itself so by
having<00:06:50.590> this<00:06:50.800> sort<00:06:50.949> of<00:06:51.099> split<00:06:51.460> team<00:06:51.789> approach

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
having this sort of split team approach

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.149 
having this sort of split team approach
to<00:06:52.719> the<00:06:52.810> game<00:06:52.960> I<00:06:53.259> think<00:06:53.710> we'll<00:06:53.800> be<00:06:53.889> seeing<00:06:54.129> more

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:54.159 
to the game I think we'll be seeing more

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:57.119 
to the game I think we'll be seeing more
content<00:06:54.909> be<00:06:55.270> forthcoming<00:06:55.659> the<00:06:56.409> game<00:06:56.590> itself<00:06:56.889> I

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.129 
content be forthcoming the game itself I

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:59.070 
content be forthcoming the game itself I
think<00:06:57.460> it<00:06:57.639> definitely<00:06:58.029> felt<00:06:58.180> more<00:06:58.389> polished<00:06:58.840> I

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
think it definitely felt more polished I

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.439 
think it definitely felt more polished I
think<00:06:59.620> the<00:06:59.800> the<00:07:00.099> swap<00:07:00.430> force<00:07:00.699> characters<00:07:01.180> adds

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449 
think the the swap force characters adds

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:03.809 
think the the swap force characters adds
a<00:07:01.689> lot<00:07:02.319> more<00:07:02.379> creative<00:07:02.770> playing<00:07:03.279> also<00:07:03.550> away
