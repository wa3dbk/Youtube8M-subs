did<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.699> lot<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:35.970> research<00:00:36.380> certain<00:00:37.380> traits<00:00:37.710> can

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
did a lot of research certain traits can

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.459 
did a lot of research certain traits can
lie<00:00:38.219> dormant<00:00:38.280> for<00:00:38.850> generations<00:00:39.510> suddenly<00:00:40.170> we

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
lie dormant for generations suddenly we

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
lie dormant for generations suddenly we
can<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> child<00:00:41.430> who's<00:00:41.670> got<00:00:41.820> red<00:00:42.000> hair<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
can have a child who's got red hair and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.940 
can have a child who's got red hair and
we<00:00:42.510> don't<00:00:42.690> quite<00:00:42.930> know<00:00:42.989> where<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> came<00:00:43.890> from

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
we don't quite know where it came from

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.090 
we don't quite know where it came from
it<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> mix<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.540> different<00:00:46.410> genes<00:00:46.620> or<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
it can be a mix of different genes or it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220 
it can be a mix of different genes or it
can<00:00:47.280> come<00:00:47.460> from<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.820> family<00:00:48.450> member<00:00:48.540> from<00:00:49.020> way

back the latest DNA tests are able to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.220 
back the latest DNA tests are able to
determine<00:00:53.390> where<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.570> came<00:00:54.809> from

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
determine where we came from

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.779 
determine where we came from
literally<00:00:56.210> on<00:00:57.210> four<00:00:57.690> different<00:00:57.899> levels<00:00:58.789> Asian

European Native American and African now

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.109 
European Native American and African now
we<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> test<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.460> find<00:01:05.759> out<00:01:05.910> what

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
we can have a test and find out what

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.100 
we can have a test and find out what
percentage<00:01:06.660> of<00:01:06.810> each<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.259> these<00:01:08.060> races<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.869> are

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
percentage of each of these races we are

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.460

racial<00:01:10.920> purity<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.610> very<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.210> rare<00:01:12.470> authors

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
racial purity is very very rare authors

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.149 
racial purity is very very rare authors
often<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.670> germ<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:16.020> story<00:01:16.409> from<00:01:16.740> real
