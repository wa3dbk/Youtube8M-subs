00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.210
 Skin cancer has the same process 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.670
 than other types of cancer 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.030
 where for different reasons it doubled 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.830
 the cells with errors in the DNA 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.050
 this cell duplicates 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.930
 uncontrollably by stay and receive 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.260
 anomalous signs together they go to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.240
 form the cellular matrix this matrix goes 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.430
 to fulfill the function of support and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.770
 provide the cell through the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.460
 connection that exists between one hundred 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.940
 skeleton and matrix 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.550
 basal cell carcinoma particularly 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.350
 it's a growth cancer l do not know 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.260
 develops from the cells 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.359
 basal on the surface of the skin 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.210
 Normal view can be perceived 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:56.980
 reddish spots and even a lump 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.980
 in the area in more advanced cases 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.910
 in normal cells 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.780
 they express proteins on their surface 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.770
 called antigens 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.990
 these act as an identity mark 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.539
 and in the case of the cells of a 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.359
 person are recognized as their own by 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.399
 the immune system preventing the 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.620
 own cells are attacked and 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.720
 eliminated 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.240
 if the immune system meets 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.780
 antigens that are not themselves receive 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.910
 warning signs which will generate 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.300
 a reaction I will put those antigens 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.330
 invaders 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.060
 the tumor cells express antigens 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.100
 on its cell surface as well as on 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.860
 secretions 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.159
 the tumor antigens are recognized 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.509
 as strange by the immune system 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.880
 because when normal cells 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.520
 they become cancer cells 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.119
 some of the antigens change or they 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.119
 muta 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.929
 excessive exposure to radiation 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.200
 ultraviolet whose main source is the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.080
 sunlight the degree of exposure to this 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.040
 radiation depends on the intensity of the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.310
 light of exposure time is to say 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.670
 the skin has been protected people 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.060
 who live in areas where they are exposed 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.450
 all year round in intense sunlight 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.209
 It is more risky to be a long time 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.330
 the weather for work reasons or 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.480
 fun without protecting yourself with clothes 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.180
 and sun protection increases the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.459
 risk lamps and booths 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.489
 tanning machines are other sources of 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.390
 ultraviolet radiation that can cause 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.739
 an increased risk of developing cancer 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.739
 of non-melanoma skin 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.610
 Exposure to certain products 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.150
 chemicals such as arsenic tar 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.550
 industrial the uia the paraffin and certain 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.730
 types of oils 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.580
 exposure to radiation as the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.790
 produced by radiotherapy the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.060
 serious injuries or inflammations or 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.610
 prolonged skin a gene that 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.770
 commonly found mutated in 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.430
 basal cell cancers is the gene 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.200
 patch which is part of the life of 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.250
 signaling 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.440
 from within the cells this way is 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.140
 crucial for development before the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.769
 birth and it's important in some 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.769
 adult cells 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.810
 basalioma requires treatments for 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.580
 prevent damage and to avoid its 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.790
 increase 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.860
 surgery the dermatologist has been 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.350
 extirpated the basalioma of form 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.500
 ambulatory and under local anesthesia in 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.780
 an operation first removes the 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.690
 tumor and then it examines the edges of 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.880
 skin stipa to see if there is no need 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.330
 perform a second operation 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.890
 radiotherapy if there is a situation 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.170
 particular or the advanced age of 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.840
 Patient does not allow activation 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.590
 surgery of the basalioma can be 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.970
 perform a direct irradiation of the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.730
 injury 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.670
 compared to surgery 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.610
 aesthetic results are better but the 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.880
 radiotherapy has a greater risk of 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.060
 the tumor reoccurs cryotherapy 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.300
 the xxvi or therapy is an option 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.820
 therapy in small basalioma 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.670
 superficially especially for 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.190
 tumors in the eyelids and in the elderly 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.840
 cryotherapy is the freezing of tissue 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.020
 of the tumor with liquid nitrogen 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.780
 photodynamic therapy is about the 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.449
 application of active principles 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.449
 sensitive to light in the tumor tissue
