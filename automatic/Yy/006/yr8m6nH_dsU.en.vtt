00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi guys and youtube girls in this 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.589
 video tutorial I will teach you how to do 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.280
 this beautiful decoration using 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.639
 home materials let's start with this 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.220
 tutorial what we will need will be 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.960
 scissors with shapes that can 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.510
 get anywhere 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.260
 these are heads to put it in 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.750
 these scissors is worth here in the form and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.140
 scissors with the whole shape 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.960
 and then a false and transparent nail 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.170
 white or your own nail 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.519
 pintauñas that you like more 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.670
 and the good floor to do this technique 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.590
 The first thing we will do is paint 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.600
 our nail with 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.890
 two layers or one depends on how the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 color of the clear I have used this 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.450
 pintauñas that is from Buruaga in 2002 and is 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.170
 like a purple but it has a touch of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.250
 purpurin 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.500
 to make the clouds I will use this from 1938 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.620
 of voyeurs that comes in the same pack 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.680
 It has a pattern 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.480
 these 2 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.300
 these other two 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.940
 and finally these two 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.280
 good 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.290
 let's use good me in my case I'll 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.290
 use scissors 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.570
 party 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.430
 We think we are cutting a bit of tape 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.450
 insulator or floor 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.990
 and with our scissors we will give you a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.990
 cut 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.190
 there has to be something like that I do not know 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.880
 if you see it good once our 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.610
 base is 100% dry what we are going to do 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.950
 we are going to paste the tape as we 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.360
 like I'm going to put it in the middle 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.360
 and a little diagonally 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.180
 once we have stuck it we are going to 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.099
 apply the color that we like 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.350
 and I'm going to make it a cotton 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:37.550
 that I do not know 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.610
 Spot nothing and good as you can see this 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.070
 enamel 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.730
 I do not know if you see it also has a bit of 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.730
 brilliantine 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.900
 and it's also very clear from what you 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.900
 we will give two layers 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.100
 we wait for it to dry for the second 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.230
 cap 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.480
 as given the second layer and we should 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.110
 remove the floor this is going to be the 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.390
 final result and well then well you can 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.129
 do in many ways more with the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.760
 different scissors 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.960
 You can also buy in stores 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.490
 internet or manicure 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.490
 in special molds 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.480
 and instead of doing the landlords if 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.020
 they prefer and well this has been all for 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.020
