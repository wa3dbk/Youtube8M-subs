00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.590
 at dupont pioneer we use the 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.300
 tic picks method and the road by 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.800
 the university of wisconsin nearly failed to 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.440
 closely seen the quality of alfalfa for 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.350
 to be but the date of co I have the stick 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.900
 pixi who was shown it is free 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.030
 in fiber ndf then the relative value 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.170
 food on the stick by cons 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.070
 see it in English it's the relative 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.290
 vario girl so at first 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.500
 it's really about determining in the 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.980
 field in which we are a space 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.429
 to measure in Picard is representative 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.339
 so I have my square foot I will take 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.620
 for example the space here I leave them 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.030
 fall 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.920
 and then there now the first step 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.519
 it's to determine the maturity of the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.069
 alfalfa 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.510
 so that does not mean it's going to be the 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.039
 shortest longest is really the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.620
 stem that will have the most maturity 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.769
 elevated in maturity one speaks of the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.499
 vegetative stage vegetative stage 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.720
 there is no button or flowers on 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.150
 sheep stage there is at least one 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.850
 button on the stem and then the stadium 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.170
 flowers at least one woman on the stem 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.500
 so in the example it is enough that I have 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.009
 taken there is no flower it's obvious 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.719
 going to see more beautiful on the rod here 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.610
 I really have a stadium buttons like 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.610
 I said we follow skin to the length for 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.289
 this for this one so now that 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.350
 I found my stage of maturity that 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.600
 is stage sheep on the piz tic 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.149
 I really have a graduation on each 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.340
 side concerning the vegetative stage the 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.810
 stage button and the stage flowers so 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.979
 now that we have determined our stack 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.200
 button I take my stick vis-Ã -vis the 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.460
 graduation to the button and there I go 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.159
 take the longest stem for 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.119
 perform my measurement so in the example 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.820
 here the measurement could perform with the 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.270
 rod here and it's really important to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.659
 put the p6 tic on the ground in the bottom I 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.590
 that side of the collar and alfalfa and then of 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.289
 measure the stem 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.789
 but stop before the leaves so 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.850
 if I stop before the leaves 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.420
 can see here that my length has given me 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.590
 that would be here 38 points 7% dmtf of 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.470
 edf fiber or 160 worth of foods 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.870
 relative it's important to repeat 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.670
 exercise at least five times 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.890
 singing in order to have a more average 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.739
 representative the food value 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.090
 narrated this is an index to standardize 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.280
 the quality of the hay 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.519
 it is based on consumption 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.650
 volunteer from my tercis ingested from 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.750
 I feel in animals this 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.750
 public procedure will not take into account 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.069
 changes due to haymaking at the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.040
 harvesting and storage 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:52.180
 there must be a loss of 20 to 30 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.760
 points due to mechanical procedures for 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.250
 the dairy cow we search in 140 and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.700
 160 so we have to add 20 to 30 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.700
 points 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.620
 so what should I read for a 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.299
 representative value that would 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.590
 really a quality forage at 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.900
 the buyer would be between 170 and 180 - the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.970
 more mechanical losses is not happy 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.970
 that every day the weather is fine 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.799
 is a loss in 3 and 5-point value 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.280
 relative food for a first 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.079
 race 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.459
 if you have questions 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.530
 additional do not hesitate to 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.530
 consult your pioneer representative
