fantastic product to keep us as the
number<00:00:32.439> one<00:00:32.619> in<00:00:32.980> ear<00:00:33.340> stereo<00:00:33.850> Bluetooth

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
number one in ear stereo Bluetooth

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.780 
number one in ear stereo Bluetooth
product<00:00:34.750> in<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.470> market<00:00:35.860> there's<00:00:36.580> a<00:00:36.610> couple

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
product in the market there's a couple

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.760 
product in the market there's a couple
of<00:00:36.940> things<00:00:37.060> that<00:00:37.300> we've<00:00:37.420> done<00:00:37.500> first<00:00:38.500> of<00:00:38.650> all

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
of things that we've done first of all

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.730 
of things that we've done first of all
if<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:39.010> look<00:00:39.130> at<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.460> size<00:00:39.880> of<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.330> device

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
if you look at the size of the device

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.860 
if you look at the size of the device
we've<00:00:41.740> really<00:00:42.610> crammed<00:00:42.970> in<00:00:43.180> as<00:00:43.329> much<00:00:43.570> as<00:00:43.720> we

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
we've really crammed in as much as we

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.700 
we've really crammed in as much as we
possibly<00:00:43.900> can<00:00:44.560> into<00:00:45.220> this<00:00:46.030> small<00:00:46.480> form-factor

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
possibly can into this small form-factor

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.340 
possibly can into this small form-factor
so<00:00:48.460> for<00:00:48.910> example<00:00:49.360> here<00:00:49.540> we<00:00:49.570> have<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.870> battery

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
so for example here we have the battery

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.620 
so for example here we have the battery
now<00:00:51.130> the<00:00:51.220> battery<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.910> really<00:00:52.420> what

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
now the battery is really what

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.470 
now the battery is really what
determines<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.860> size<00:00:54.160> of<00:00:54.399> the<00:00:54.520> headset<00:00:54.940> and

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
determines the size of the headset and

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.510 
determines the size of the headset and
quite<00:00:55.720> honestly<00:00:55.899> you<00:00:56.560> can't<00:00:56.800> get<00:00:56.980> a<00:00:57.010> batteries

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
quite honestly you can't get a batteries

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.389 
quite honestly you can't get a batteries
smaller<00:00:57.820> than<00:00:58.090> this<00:00:58.239> in<00:00:58.540> a<00:00:59.440> stereo<00:00:59.920> bluetooth

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
smaller than this in a stereo bluetooth

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.100 
smaller than this in a stereo bluetooth
device<00:01:00.760> now<00:01:01.030> this<00:01:01.180> will<00:01:01.360> give<00:01:01.480> around<00:01:01.809> five

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
device now this will give around five

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.609 
device now this will give around five
hours<00:01:02.140> talktime<00:01:02.770> which<00:01:03.460> is<00:01:03.640> okay<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:05.110> this

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
hours talktime which is okay but this

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.059 
hours talktime which is okay but this
year<00:01:05.979> we're<00:01:06.759> launching<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.869> case<00:01:08.200> with<00:01:08.950> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
itself why is that important because any

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.280 
itself why is that important because any
wearable<00:02:17.890> device<00:02:18.190> such<00:02:18.489> as<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.700> headset<00:02:19.290> is

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
wearable device such as a headset is

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.100 
wearable device such as a headset is
going<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.709> used<00:02:21.269> close<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.510> your<00:02:22.720> skin

going to be used close to your skin
which<00:02:23.709> will<00:02:24.099> perspire<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.630> was<00:02:25.720> also

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
which will perspire but it was also

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.530 
which will perspire but it was also
going<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.290> be<00:02:26.440> used<00:02:26.849> outside<00:02:27.849> where<00:02:28.269> there's

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
going to be used outside where there's

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.920 
going to be used outside where there's
the<00:02:28.900> chance<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.470> rain<00:02:30.660> getting<00:02:31.660> onto<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
the chance of rain getting onto the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.050 
the chance of rain getting onto the
headset<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.620> people<00:02:33.190> have<00:02:33.280> found<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.849> as

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
headset and people have found that as

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.570 
headset and people have found that as
soon<00:02:34.300> as<00:02:34.510> sweat<00:02:34.900> or<00:02:35.530> water<00:02:35.890> gets<00:02:36.280> into<00:02:36.489> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
soon as sweat or water gets into the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.729 
soon as sweat or water gets into the
headset<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.180> stops<00:02:37.750> working<00:02:38.019> so<00:02:38.380> we<00:02:38.500> really

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
headset it stops working so we really

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.800 
headset it stops working so we really
believe<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:39.040> having<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.700> coating<00:02:40.180> is

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
believe that having that coating is

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.420 
believe that having that coating is
going<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.200> improve<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.680> product<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.220> year

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
going to improve the product this year

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.270 
going to improve the product this year
so<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:43.209> three<00:02:43.480> things<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.900> remember<00:02:44.140> are<00:02:44.500> the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
so the three things to remember are the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:59.820 
so the three things to remember are the
size<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:47.170> power<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:49.480> coating

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.890
