difference for the Peugeot 207 set up on

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.350 
difference for the Peugeot 207 set up on
this<00:01:15.540> loose<00:01:15.840> surface<00:01:16.290> event<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:17.640> gravel<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
this loose surface event on gravel to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.990 
this loose surface event on gravel to
get<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> grip<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.729> try<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.790> move

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
get the grip you have to try and move

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.160 
get the grip you have to try and move
the<00:01:21.180> stones<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.659> underneath<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> tire

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the stones from underneath the tire

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.510 
the stones from underneath the tire
that's<00:01:22.350> why<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.770> these<00:01:22.890> big<00:01:23.130> Nobles<00:01:23.430> on

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that's why we have these big Nobles on

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.270 
that's why we have these big Nobles on
the<00:01:23.580> tires<00:01:23.790> also<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:25.290> making<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> wheel

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the tires also in making the the wheel

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
the tires also in making the the wheel
smaller<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:27.360> make<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.810> profile<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> tire

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
smaller to make the profile of the tire

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.719 
smaller to make the profile of the tire
bigger<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.950> obviously<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> grip<00:01:29.640> if

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
bigger and obviously to get the grip if

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.069 
bigger and obviously to get the grip if
we<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.090> put<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> smaller<00:01:30.600> brakes<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
we have to put the smaller brakes on the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.510 
we have to put the smaller brakes on the
car<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.409> well<00:01:31.530> would<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> use<00:01:32.280> bigger

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
car as well would like to use bigger

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.950 
car as well would like to use bigger
brakes<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.119> tarmac<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.689> stop<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
brakes like we do on tarmac to stop the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.350 
brakes like we do on tarmac to stop the
car<00:01:34.110> quicker<00:01:34.759> but<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.270> reason

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
car quicker but it's for this reason

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.880 
car quicker but it's for this reason
that<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> wheels<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.229> smaller<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> use

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that the wheels are smaller but the use

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.609 
that the wheels are smaller but the use
smaller<00:01:38.610> brakes<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.750> reinforced<00:01:40.259> inside

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
smaller brakes it's reinforced inside

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.250 
smaller brakes it's reinforced inside
all<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.490> fiber<00:01:41.700> glass<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.090> Kevlar

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
all of this fiber glass and Kevlar

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.530 
all of this fiber glass and Kevlar
so<00:01:43.760> that's<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.820> big<00:01:44.970> difference<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.450> we

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
so that's a big difference because we

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.640 
so that's a big difference because we
need<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.720> protect<00:01:45.870> them<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.320> bottom<00:01:46.560> of

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
need to protect them at the bottom of

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.410 
need to protect them at the bottom of
the<00:01:46.740> car<00:01:46.950> against<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:48.030> rocks<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the car against the rocks in the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.480 
the car against the rocks in the
compressions<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.290> might<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.680> towards

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
compressions that we might get towards

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.910 
compressions that we might get towards
the<00:01:50.580> engine<00:01:51.230> so<00:01:52.230> here<00:01:52.440> we<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.560> extra

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the engine so here we have extra

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.580 
the engine so here we have extra
protection<00:01:53.370> here<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.810> mud<00:01:54.990> flaps<00:01:55.230> as<00:01:55.410> well

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
protection here the mud flaps as well

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.320 
protection here the mud flaps as well

pressure<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.590> know<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.740> think<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.460> result<00:02:20.820> is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030

there<00:02:21.330> we're<00:02:21.900> just<00:02:22.050> got<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.350> get<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> bit<00:02:22.710> of

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
there we're just got to get a bit of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.020 
there we're just got to get a bit of

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
running really strong in Belgium so I

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.580 
running really strong in Belgium so I

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
think yeah put all up to the back online

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.960 
think yeah put all up to the back online

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
pop it on the person when we thought we

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.500 
pop it on the person when we thought we
got<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.570> puncher<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.050> we<00:03:11.230> backed<00:03:11.740> up<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> bit<00:03:12.040> but

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
got a puncher so we backed up a bit but

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.170 
got a puncher so we backed up a bit but
ok<00:03:13.510> maybe<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.810> little<00:03:13.840> bit<00:03:14.110> too<00:03:14.230> much<00:03:14.350> there<00:03:15.180> now

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
ok maybe a little bit too much there now

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.460 
ok maybe a little bit too much there now

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
of an unknown has it worked on that

birthday

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
birthday

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.110 
birthday
yeah<00:03:22.510> but<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:23.410> did<00:03:23.650> actually<00:03:23.830> work<00:03:24.130> but<00:03:24.400> the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
yeah but that did actually work but the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.120 
yeah but that did actually work but the
first<00:03:25.300> stage<00:03:25.570> was<00:03:25.690> very<00:03:25.810> very<00:03:26.140> fast<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:27.040> a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
first stage was very very fast and a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.520 
first stage was very very fast and a
high<00:03:27.280> top<00:03:27.520> speed<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.970> think<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.500> we've<00:03:29.500> chosen

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
high top speed I think that we've chosen

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.650 
high top speed I think that we've chosen
the<00:03:29.980> shortest<00:03:30.670> ratio<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.180> car<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.540> it

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
the shortest ratio in the car and it

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.020 
the shortest ratio in the car and it
will<00:03:31.750> be<00:03:31.810> good<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.050> this<00:03:32.110> major<00:03:32.320> tomorrow<00:03:33.030> with

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
will be good in this major tomorrow with

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.730 
will be good in this major tomorrow with
three<00:03:34.240> stages<00:03:34.540> complete<00:03:35.140> it's<00:03:35.320> time<00:03:35.410> to

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
three stages complete it's time to

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.920 
three stages complete it's time to
return<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.310> port<00:03:36.550> side<00:03:36.760> service<00:03:37.120> area<00:03:37.690> and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
return to the port side service area and
