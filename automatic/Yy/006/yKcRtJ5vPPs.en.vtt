processing<00:01:39.900> unit<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:41.040> phone<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.729> made<00:01:41.970> by

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
processing unit on this phone is made by

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.020 
processing unit on this phone is made by
power<00:01:42.479> vr<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:44.119> G<00:01:45.680> 6430<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:47.820> that's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
power vr on G 6430 and I think that's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.850 
power vr on G 6430 and I think that's
the<00:01:48.149> same<00:01:49.189> GPU<00:01:50.189> unit<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.880> iphone<00:01:51.390> 5s<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.229> on

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the same GPU unit on iphone 5s but on

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.319 
the same GPU unit on iphone 5s but on
this<00:01:53.070> phone<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:54.079> slightly<00:01:55.079> faster<00:01:56.600> speeds

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
this phone it's a slightly faster speeds

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.219 
this phone it's a slightly faster speeds
ok<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> back<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.170> back<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.960> turn

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
ok now the back is back on and it's turn

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.249 
ok now the back is back on and it's turn
this<00:02:04.380> baby<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> first<00:02:05.850> time<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.990> sea

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this baby on for the first time the sea

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:17.479 
this baby on for the first time the sea
boot<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.759> go

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.809 

and<00:02:18.489> rolling<00:02:18.970> asus<00:02:21.870> there<00:02:22.870> again<00:02:23.170> Intel<00:02:24.010> as<00:02:24.670> I

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
and rolling asus there again Intel as I

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.380 
and rolling asus there again Intel as I
said<00:02:25.150> it's<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.569> 22<00:02:26.019> nanometer<00:02:26.819> FinFET<00:02:27.819> process

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
said it's a 22 nanometer FinFET process

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.720 
said it's a 22 nanometer FinFET process
so<00:02:28.720> really<00:02:29.260> no<00:02:29.410> it's<00:02:30.099> a<00:02:30.310> very<00:02:30.670> good<00:02:30.760> cpu<00:02:32.730> this

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
so really no it's a very good cpu this

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.619 
so really no it's a very good cpu this
guy's<00:02:33.970> perfected<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.810> FinFET<00:02:35.319> process<00:02:36.629> while

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
guy's perfected the FinFET process while

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.720 
guy's perfected the FinFET process while

actually<00:02:43.060> do<00:02:43.209> not<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.660> true<00:02:43.989> FinFET

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
actually do not have the true FinFET

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.979 
actually do not have the true FinFET
this<00:02:44.950> has<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> proof<00:02:45.579> infant<00:02:46.000> now<00:02:46.690> it's<00:02:46.840> on
