00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
impressions of it it's actually not all

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.490 
impressions of it it's actually not all
that<00:00:35.520> different<00:00:36.059> from<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> Moto<00:00:36.420> 360<00:00:36.989> aside

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that different from the Moto 360 aside

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.780 
that different from the Moto 360 aside
from<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> shape<00:00:38.070> which<00:00:38.250> I'll<00:00:38.370> talk<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.579> in

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
from the shape which I'll talk about in

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.840 
from the shape which I'll talk about in
a<00:00:38.910> second<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> 280<00:00:40.379> by<00:00:40.590> 280<00:00:41.070> resolution

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
a second so it's a 280 by 280 resolution

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.970 
a second so it's a 280 by 280 resolution
it<00:00:42.180> comes<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.629> black<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.290> white<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
it comes in black or white it's the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.950 
it comes in black or white it's the
stainless<00:00:44.489> steel<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.969> terms<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> size

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
stainless steel in terms of size

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.330 
stainless steel in terms of size
obviously<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.469> don't<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> biggest<00:00:47.039> risk

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
obviously I don't have the biggest risk

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
obviously I don't have the biggest risk
in<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> world<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> similar<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
in the world but it's kind of similar in

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.049 
in the world but it's kind of similar in
size<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.680> pebble<00:00:50.070> steel<00:00:50.250> I'd<00:00:50.489> say<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> little

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
size to a pebble steel I'd say a little

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.680 
size to a pebble steel I'd say a little
bit<00:00:51.210> bigger

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
bit bigger

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.630 
bit bigger
it<00:00:51.899> obviously<00:00:52.020> has<00:00:52.410> bezel<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> top<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it obviously has bezel on the top on the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
it obviously has bezel on the top on the
bottom<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> square<00:00:54.840> form<00:00:55.140> factor<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
bottom but it's a square form factor and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.020 
bottom but it's a square form factor and
it<00:00:55.829> looks<00:00:55.949> really<00:00:56.160> similar<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.579> pebble<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
it looks really similar to a pebble so

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.069 
it looks really similar to a pebble so
with<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> SmartWatch<00:00:57.570> something<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
people are gonna wonder about is the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.099 
people are gonna wonder about is the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
always on for 36 hours so it doesn't

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.410 
always on for 36 hours so it doesn't
seem<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.090> bad

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
seem all that bad

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.390 
seem all that bad
of<00:01:15.930> course<00:01:16.170> raising<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.100> wrist

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.310 
of course raising it up with your wrist
we'll<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.970> screen<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.509> activate<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
we'll get that screen to activate so it

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
we'll get that screen to activate so it
gets<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> lot<00:01:19.650> brighter<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.220> it'll<00:01:20.670> show<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
gets a lot brighter and it'll show you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.149 
gets a lot brighter and it'll show you
you<00:01:21.090> notifications<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> basically<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:23.040> we

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you notifications and basically when we

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.649 
you notifications and basically when we
were<00:01:23.189> using<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.700> watch<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> retail

like<00:01:57.570> retail<00:01:58.229> mode<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.560> working<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:58.860> fine

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
like retail mode is working just fine

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.260 
like retail mode is working just fine
but<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.460> you're<00:01:59.579> gonna<00:01:59.700> check<00:01:59.909> out<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> watch

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
but if you're gonna check out a watch

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.730 
but if you're gonna check out a watch
like<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:01.259> gonna<00:02:01.350> check<00:02:01.530> out<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
like this you're gonna check out the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.020 
like this you're gonna check out the
functionality<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.369> how<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.670> connects<00:02:03.000> to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
functionality and how it connects to

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.459 
functionality and how it connects to
your<00:02:03.119> phone<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:03.960> saw<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.290> it's

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
your phone so that's what we saw so it's

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.270 
your phone so that's what we saw so it's
a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.619> bit<00:02:04.770> unclear<00:02:04.950> at<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.189> point

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
a little bit unclear at this point

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.310 
a little bit unclear at this point
whether<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.939> watch<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.570> using<00:02:06.899> all<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.200> your

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
whether the watch is using all of your

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.020 
whether the watch is using all of your
phone<00:02:07.500> sensors<00:02:07.799> or<00:02:08.190> if<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.340> has<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.700> bunch<00:02:08.940> of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
phone sensors or if it has a bunch of

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.150 
phone sensors or if it has a bunch of
sensors<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.509> its<00:02:09.629> own<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.110> has<00:02:10.259> no<00:02:10.619> physical

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
sensors of its own it has no physical

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.190 
sensors of its own it has no physical
buttons<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:11.849> what

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
buttons but what

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.380 
buttons but what
have<00:02:12.379> as<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> nine<00:02:12.860> axis<00:02:13.400> gyroscope

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
have as a nine axis gyroscope

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.479 
have as a nine axis gyroscope
accelerometer<00:02:15.010> basically<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.190> be<00:02:16.280> able<00:02:16.310> to

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
accelerometer basically to be able to

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.309 
accelerometer basically to be able to
tell<00:02:16.670> when<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:17.269> raise<00:02:17.599> it<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:17.930> that's<00:02:18.140> when

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
tell when you raise it and that's when

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.600 
tell when you raise it and that's when
it'll<00:02:18.500> brighten<00:02:18.769> itself<00:02:19.129> and<00:02:19.340> you'll<00:02:19.430> be<00:02:19.550> able

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
it'll brighten itself and you'll be able

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.520 
it'll brighten itself and you'll be able
to<00:02:19.760> see<00:02:19.849> all<00:02:19.970> your<00:02:20.060> notifications<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.379> UI

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
to see all your notifications and the UI

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
but other than that they made it sound

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.880 
but other than that they made it sound
like<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.840> pedometer<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.590> all<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.769> other

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
like the pedometer and all the other

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.800 
like the pedometer and all the other
sensors<00:02:25.280> will<00:02:25.790> come<00:02:25.970> from<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.360> sensors<00:02:26.690> in

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
sensors will come from the sensors in

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.270 
sensors will come from the sensors in
your<00:02:26.930> phone<00:02:27.170> which<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.800> getting<00:02:27.980> away<00:02:28.099> at

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
your phone which is getting away at

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.860 
your phone which is getting away at
Bluetooth<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:28.940> coming<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.269> at<00:02:29.360> 229

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
Bluetooth so really coming in at 229

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.290 
Bluetooth so really coming in at 229
this<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.440> less<00:02:30.739> than<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.010> pebble<00:02:31.280> steel<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:32.239> has

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
this is less than a pebble steel it has

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.000 
this is less than a pebble steel it has
a<00:02:32.420> lot<00:02:32.690> more<00:02:32.840> functionality<00:02:32.989> if<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.560> was<00:02:33.709> pebble

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
a lot more functionality if I was pebble

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.229 
a lot more functionality if I was pebble
right<00:02:34.130> now<00:02:34.280> I'd<00:02:34.459> be<00:02:34.580> very<00:02:34.730> concerned<00:02:35.150> about

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
right now I'd be very concerned about

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.940 
right now I'd be very concerned about
this<00:02:35.450> kind<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.750> stuff<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.170> Android<00:02:36.709> wear<00:02:36.890> is

this kind of stuff and Android wear is

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.949 
this kind of stuff and Android wear is
getting<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.400> lot<00:02:37.670> more<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.239> spotlight<00:02:38.569> with
