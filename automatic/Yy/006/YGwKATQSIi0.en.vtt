00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
maybe an edge in speed what do you think

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.260 
maybe an edge in speed what do you think
about<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.619> well<00:01:44.070> he<00:01:44.490> may<00:01:44.640> run<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.970> terms<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
about that well he may run in terms of

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
backpedaling but only to escape some

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.870 
backpedaling but only to escape some
pressure<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.220> when<00:01:47.310> he's<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.549> trouble<00:01:47.850> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
pressure and when he's in trouble I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.010
