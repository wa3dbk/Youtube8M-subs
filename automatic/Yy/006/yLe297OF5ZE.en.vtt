00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.510
 I do not know 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.510
 and anything I tell you 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.230
 to add but Chinese 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.690
 I prefer 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.750
 the effort to honesty 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.820
 with with the urge to want 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.820
 and want to stay here 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.030
 with that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.030
 Now it has been like this 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.350
 and understanding the understanding of the choice 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.350
 what this is d 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.230
 eleven 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.320
 and who knows if it reaches us 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:13.280
 but if nobody knows more than to play 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.190
 and the important thing was today 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.570
 then I'm going to the important thing is the final 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.060
 of cup but 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.430
 until before this like up 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.560
 at 5 in the afternoon or seven at night what 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.710
 important was hey and so we had 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.630
 raised with three parties 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.810
 very important but this was the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.180
 important after nobody knows 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.970
 the difference the difference because in the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.850
 second we no longer arrive it is very difficult not 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.720
 have won and have the triumph and 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.060
 have it and have it and it goes 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.450
 you try to get the most out of 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.460
 that goal but do not forget we continue 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.510
 biting exactly the same exactly 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.190
 same 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.070
 If I see it dark list but believe me 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.320
 that tomorrow dawns 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.360
 and there's a lot to rescue today 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.760
 very much to rescue and much that no longer 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.820
 can 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.400
 commit the mistakes that I made but yes 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.319
 yes there is a lot to rescue me 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.260
 I like it a lot now 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.629
 what he says now I insist that this 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.090
 it has to be 11 or they are if they have to 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.860
 I'm not talking about I'm not talking about quality 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.650
 something that needs to be put 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.870
 all the time all the minutes all 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.140
 the plays all the actions torton 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.210
 the whole team the team the team is 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.380
 well psychically so upset 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.140
 because they make a lot of effort and do not 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.880
 they carry nothing I do not use the cup pays for 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.370
 lift nothing I use the cup to make 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.170
 cup champions that's the purpose 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.660
 of the cup tournament is not something else no 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.450

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.890
 serves that is the village shirt and the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.320
 t-shirt of the people to everyone is the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.930
 you have to put it well that is no no more 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.820
 where you play them or so I'm sorry 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.200
 joan maybe in the last cause your way 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.510
