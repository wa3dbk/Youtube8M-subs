asp.net dynamic data entity website and
I<00:01:16.380> will<00:01:16.590> name<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.829> as<00:01:17.810> Microsoft<00:01:18.810> magic<00:01:19.530> web

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
I will name it as Microsoft magic web

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.240 
I will name it as Microsoft magic web
app<00:01:19.859> and<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:22.350> will<00:01:22.469> say<00:01:22.590> ok<00:01:24.710> in<00:01:25.710> solution

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
app and I will say ok in solution

Explorer I get many different folders
and<00:01:30.840> files<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.560> XYZ<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.570> need<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.719> to<00:01:33.869> worry

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
and files and XYZ I need not to worry

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.410 
and files and XYZ I need not to worry
about<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.679> of<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.820> told<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.210> there

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
about that as of now as I told you there

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.380 
about that as of now as I told you there
are<00:01:36.539> five<00:01:36.990> steps<00:01:37.499> that<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> need<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.159> perform

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
are five steps that you need to perform

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.289 
are five steps that you need to perform
the<00:01:39.390> first<00:01:39.719> thing<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.259> adding<00:01:41.070> entity<00:01:42.060> data

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the first thing is adding entity data

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.039 
the first thing is adding entity data
model<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:44.119> things<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.570> did<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.960> our

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
model the things that we did in our

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.469 
model the things that we did in our
earlier<00:01:46.320> video<00:01:46.789> so<00:01:47.789> I<00:01:47.820> need<00:01:47.999> to<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.240> click

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
earlier video so I need to right click

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.840 
earlier video so I need to right click
and<00:01:48.829> say<00:01:49.829> add<00:01:50.819> new<00:01:51.479> item<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:56.460> am<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and say add new item and I am going to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.459 
and say add new item and I am going to
add<00:01:57.090> a<00:02:00.409> do<00:02:01.409> dotnet<00:02:01.890> entity<00:02:02.549> data<00:02:02.729> model<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
add a do dotnet entity data model and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:12.979 
add a do dotnet entity data model and
I'll<00:02:04.469> name<00:02:04.859> it<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:07.670> organization

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:23.849 

model<00:02:16.170> add<00:02:19.140> next<00:02:21.629> next<00:02:22.629> I'm<00:02:23.379> going<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.680> select

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
model add next next I'm going to select

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:32.429 
model add next next I'm going to select
both<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.340> tables<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:25.590> page<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:31.720> creating

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
both the tables a page that is creating

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.559 
both the tables a page that is creating
an<00:02:32.590> EDM<00:02:34.019> entity<00:02:35.019> data<00:02:35.230> model<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:36.329> second<00:02:37.329> step

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
an EDM entity data model the second step

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.509 
an EDM entity data model the second step
that<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:38.200> need<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.470> perform<00:02:38.739> is<00:02:41.340> adding<00:02:42.340> the

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
that I need to perform is adding the

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.629 
that I need to perform is adding the
namespace<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:46.470> Microsoft<00:02:48.389> magic

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
namespace that is Microsoft magic

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:57.089 
namespace that is Microsoft magic
whether<00:02:52.379> copied<00:02:53.379> is<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:55.379> and<00:02:56.379> add<00:02:56.709> this

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
whether copied is and and add this

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.409 
whether copied is and and add this
namespace<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:58.659> the<00:02:58.810> global<00:02:59.260> file<00:02:59.620> and<00:03:00.419> I'll

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419 
namespace in the global file and I'll

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:11.539 
namespace in the global file and I'll
say<00:03:03.389> using<00:03:04.829> Microsoft<00:03:05.829> magic<00:03:06.760> feather<00:03:09.389> and

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
say using Microsoft magic feather and

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.349 
say using Microsoft magic feather and
the<00:03:12.549> third<00:03:13.060> step<00:03:13.389> that<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.689> need<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.049> perform<00:03:14.560> is

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
the third step that I need to perform is

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.629 
the third step that I need to perform is
uncomment<00:03:16.359> a<00:03:16.569> single<00:03:17.049> line<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.290> code<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:18.220> I

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
uncomment a single line of code that I

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.860 
uncomment a single line of code that I
have<00:03:18.909> that<00:03:19.359> is<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:20.500> register<00:03:21.310> roots<00:03:21.870> static

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
have that is in register roots static

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.219 
have that is in register roots static
method<00:03:23.229> and<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:24.430> line<00:03:24.669> of<00:03:24.849> code<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.269> default

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:26.229 
method and the line of code is default

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.240 
method and the line of code is default
MoDOT<00:03:27.010> register<00:03:27.690> context<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.379> uncomment<00:03:30.099> this

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
MoDOT register context so uncomment this

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.030 
MoDOT register context so uncomment this
and<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:33.040> place<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.459> your<00:03:34.269> data<00:03:34.840> context<00:03:35.379> type<00:03:35.709> I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
and in place of your data context type I

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.770 
and in place of your data context type I
am<00:03:36.989> going<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.199> write<00:03:38.620> my<00:03:39.180> context<00:03:40.180> class<00:03:40.419> that

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
am going to write my context class that

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.330 
am going to write my context class that
is<00:03:40.900> nothing<00:03:41.019> but<00:03:41.169> organization<00:03:42.129> entities<00:03:43.260> and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
is nothing but organization entities and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.849 
is nothing but organization entities and
I<00:03:45.340> will<00:03:45.459> write<00:03:45.609> my<00:03:45.879> context<00:03:46.329> blocks<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:46.900> the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
I will write my context blocks and the

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.339 
I will write my context blocks and the
last<00:03:48.099> step<00:03:48.549> that<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:49.180> need<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.419> perform<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.199> is

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
last step that I need to perform that is

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.119 
last step that I need to perform that is
fifth<00:03:50.650> step<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.280> set<00:03:52.169> scaffold<00:03:53.169> all<00:03:53.379> table
