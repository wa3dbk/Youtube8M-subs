 thus wasting calorie counting that 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.700
 makes you fat is whether you like 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.310

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.399

 breakfast and yes when doing the family 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.639
 Maybe I'm guessing with a soup 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.210
 and with a salad so that the first one 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.920

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.940
 not directly on the reasons are 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.710
 finished things that can then crashes 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.729
 tuck you enjoy the first, is 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.350
 probably not so much pure 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.630
 if there are so much soup and 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.430

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.170
 refrain want mixed there 180 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.209
 then do that and get in 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.280
 pay attention to what is really important 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.709
