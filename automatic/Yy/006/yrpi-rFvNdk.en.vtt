00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.839
 hi the voices today 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.699
 I was able to go out despite a little wind 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.650
 see a little hot it feels good 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.000
 to be in the green 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.480
 so as I told you in a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.760
 previous video a woman small series 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.359
 fishing techniques and others so let go 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.610
 doing a threat here is one to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.950
 his bad luck so I was looking for a 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.120
 few materials there I fell I 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.000
 will show you in a small area 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.989
 very nice that's not it if you have 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.190
 see well but towards the fund aabar enough 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.199
 stuffed with bamboo your heart it was not 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.610
 last year it pushed so I 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.699
 I'm happy it makes me material 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.760
 it's not bad then the nice side so I 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.989
 I did not know that corner well I admit 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.870
 this is not to displease me 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.330
 so I installed a little bit a little 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.140
 summary camp let's say so here we go 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.549
 manas the beginning because it's a little 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:21.320
 long to manufacture so here is the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:25.400
 brick at 105.8 ij a bamboo ring 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.509
 deep a branch where are gathered 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.970
 all the other branches we will say 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.259
 in front of you well put together very solid 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.310
 then I'll cut the pop it's gone 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:49.610
 there I still have to invent 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:53.380
 I will go up in a group after the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.340
 editing is relatively simple 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.689
 here I used bamboo not 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.189
 only I came across a small 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.189
 bamboo plantation so here it is more 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:05.240
 easy that but after you can 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:08.330
 use which plugs need not that this 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.670
 is not bigger yachts about the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.140
 diameter what are you talking about 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.920
 barely centimeters the diameter of 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.580
 branches is the most important after 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.400
 it is the stringing will say good there it is necessary 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.510
 that it's still pretty solid 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.830
 certainly this nacelle is made for 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.840
 catch small fodder fish 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.239
 keep and know one eels see 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.360
 it gives pretty much what 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.590
 inside it gives that good there you 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.269
 go tell me but at one time without it has 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.760
 passed through 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.340
 yes that's for sure he's going through 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.650
 so b I'm going to do a little bit of 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.170
 how to say a seam that we go pzk 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.590
 sewing today he does not find the word 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.859
 exact so I'm going who do you see all 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.310
 the drops of jets by so it gets 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.319
 get rid of their leaves 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.579
 now the thread in As 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.290
 all self to form a kind of 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:09.500
 baskets then there I have left that to 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.440
 do the structure itself is almost 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.709
 finished I still have the central cone 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.459
 the funnel is that it is very 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.459
 complicated to do 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.880
 it takes a little bit of time but 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.330
 it's fun it's fun to do 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.070
 then it's a trap that works 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.380
 here we are ahead of all types 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.940
 fast or slow river or even the 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.930
 lake 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.580
 I tested of course and once she 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.140
 is over you will remain more than at the 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.630
 balance with water do not forget the task 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.700
 and because I know a good one 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.020
 servant who once forgot about the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.380
 task and who was forced to go the 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.950
 search 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.690
 not very very very friendly so 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.160
 this is once she's finished well at 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.950
 bottom by year to commit a bait for 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.320
 attract fodder fish kind of 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.060
 bread of death his bad luck to finally this 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.560
 that you want to take they 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.470
 rather prefer minced meat 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.920
 not dependent on uncooked chickens 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.850
 piece of steak 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.720
 finally what you come from the meat 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.630
 what does it really work well that the 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.870
 trap me it's a trap that is when 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:20.320
 even relatively old these are the 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:24.710
 prehistoric men used it not badly 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.830
 so here for now I leave you 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.930
 I will do it again a small video 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.300
 as the progress of the 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.640
 work of course introduce yourself when 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.890
 even the final result tehran that the 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.530
 time does not get too bad it was 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:44.540
 on my head 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.160
 cloudy for me okay I took my bow 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.430
 so at worst I quickly installed you 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.970
 mustard and that's it for this is a star 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.210
 I leave you the do-it-yourselfers 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:59.229
 we find ourselves in a few moments 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.229
 later the books of the woods
