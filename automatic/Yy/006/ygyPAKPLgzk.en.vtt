everyone<00:00:10.620> has<00:00:10.980> heard<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.340> Garmin<00:00:11.820> now<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
everyone has heard of Garmin now in the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.970 
everyone has heard of Garmin now in the
past<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.870> used<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.139> design<00:00:13.440> kits<00:00:13.710> like<00:00:13.920> this

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
past I used to design kits like this

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.369 
past I used to design kits like this
which<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.670> 496<00:00:15.630> which<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:15.990> essentially

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
which was the 496 which was essentially

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.460 
which was the 496 which was essentially
based<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.740> marine<00:00:17.430> GPS<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.869> sailing<00:00:19.230> ships

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
based on marine GPS so for sailing ships

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470 
based on marine GPS so for sailing ships
and<00:00:19.740> boats<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.699> yachts<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.060> all<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.300> kind

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and boats and yachts and all that kind

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.700 
and boats and yachts and all that kind
of<00:00:21.510> thing<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.750> then<00:00:21.810> they<00:00:21.930> stuffed<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.560> some

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
of thing and then they stuffed in some

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.410 
of thing and then they stuffed in some
aviation<00:00:23.160> software<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.730> off<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.939> went<00:00:23.970> but

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
aviation software and off you went but

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660 
aviation software and off you went but
things<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.260> changed<00:00:25.289> they've<00:00:26.039> now<00:00:26.250> built

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
things have changed they've now built

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.810 
things have changed they've now built

why<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.540> much<00:00:33.660> better<00:00:34.340> in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> past

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
why is it so much better in the past

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.370 
why is it so much better in the past
we've<00:00:35.940> always<00:00:36.120> had<00:00:36.360> relatively<00:00:37.140> small

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
we've always had relatively small

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.290 
we've always had relatively small
screens<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> lot<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.489> people<00:00:38.760> struggle<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
screens so a lot of people struggle to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
screens so a lot of people struggle to
read<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:39.870> say<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.500> can't<00:00:40.920> really<00:00:41.129> yeah<00:00:41.730> I

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
read it or say I can't really yeah I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
read it or say I can't really yeah I
can't<00:00:42.329> really<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> information<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
can't really take the information and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.119 
can't really take the information and
understand<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.399> my<00:00:44.520> chart<00:00:45.059> where<00:00:45.809> I'm<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
understand on my chart where I'm at so

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.270 
understand on my chart where I'm at so
what<00:00:47.340> we've<00:00:47.460> done<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:48.559> taken<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
what we've done now is taken all of the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
what we've done now is taken all of the
technology<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.940> reliability<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.660> we've

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
technology and reliability that we've

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
technology and reliability that we've
had<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.140> past<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.860> put<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.160> into<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
had in the past and put it into a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.459 
had in the past and put it into a
dedicated<00:00:53.610> system<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> large<00:00:55.140> screen

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
dedicated system with a large screen

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.979 
dedicated system with a large screen
format<00:00:55.980> which<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.390> basically<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> ultimate

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
format which is basically the ultimate

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
format which is basically the ultimate
side<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.739> we're<00:00:58.890> after<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.820> show<00:01:00.030> me

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
side of what we're after so show me

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.459 
side of what we're after so show me
what's<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.449> here<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
what's on here because you know as a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.170 
what's on here because you know as a
pilot<00:01:01.920> I've<00:01:02.129> got<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.430> knee<00:01:02.489> ball<00:01:02.789> down<00:01:03.000> there

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
pilot I've got my knee ball down there

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.000 
pilot I've got my knee ball down there
I've<00:01:03.300> got<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.690> don't<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.350> how<00:01:04.470> many<00:01:04.680> pieces<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
I've got I don't know how many pieces of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.920 
I've got I don't know how many pieces of
paper<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.549> scribbly<00:01:05.909> lines<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.360> all

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
paper with scribbly lines all over all

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
paper with scribbly lines all over all
getting<00:01:07.229> very<00:01:07.470> messy<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> basically

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
getting very messy this is basically

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.520 
getting very messy this is basically
designed<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> take<00:01:09.360> away<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.689> messes<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
designed to take away that messes now it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
designed to take away that messes now it
is<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.340> also<00:01:11.610> there<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.820> highlight

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
is in it's also there to highlight

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.830 
is in it's also there to highlight
information<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.680> need<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.850> glance<00:01:15.119> so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
information that you need at a glance so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
information that you need at a glance so
that<00:01:15.990> you're<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.530> trying<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.119> establish

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
that you're not trying to establish

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.210 
that you're not trying to establish
where<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> are<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> chart<00:01:19.380> against<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
where you are on the chart against the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
where you are on the chart against the
unit<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.729> well<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.299> nearly<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.689> Southampton

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
unit it's well I'm nearly at Southampton

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.590 
unit it's well I'm nearly at Southampton
that's<00:01:22.920> where<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> am<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.430> my<00:01:23.490> chart<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.450> what

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
that's where I am on my chart so what

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.990 
that's where I am on my chart so what
we've<00:01:24.750> got<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> ability<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.500> show

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
we've got is the ability to show

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.670 
we've got is the ability to show
aircraft<00:01:27.000> information<00:01:27.570> such<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:27.840> direction

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
aircraft information such as direction

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.410 
aircraft information such as direction
needed<00:01:29.009> or<00:01:29.340> bearing<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> your

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
needed or bearing to get to your

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.890 
needed or bearing to get to your
waypoint<00:01:31.159> airspeed<00:01:32.159> altitude<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
waypoint airspeed altitude and this is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.719 
waypoint airspeed altitude and this is
all<00:01:34.020> based<00:01:34.259> upon<00:01:34.439> GPS<00:01:34.979> information<00:01:35.549> by<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
all based upon GPS information by the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.510 
all based upon GPS information by the
way<00:01:35.880> now<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.290> ultimate<00:01:37.619> thing<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.950> having<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
way now the ultimate thing is having the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.270 
way now the ultimate thing is having the
big<00:01:38.670> style<00:01:38.939> chart<00:01:39.650> now<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.890> does<00:01:41.040> look<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
big style chart now it does look a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.710 
big style chart now it does look a
little<00:01:41.490> bit<00:01:41.640> messy<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> screen<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.689> a

nice<00:01:51.149> thing<00:01:51.180> what<00:01:51.450> we've<00:01:51.570> done<00:01:51.720> with<00:01:51.869> this

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
nice thing what we've done with this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
nice thing what we've done with this
system<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.820> have<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> ability<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.479> any<00:01:54.600> one

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
system is have the ability at any one

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.440 
system is have the ability at any one
time<00:01:54.860> just<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> hot<00:01:56.790> cursor

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
time just to have the hot cursor

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.060 
time just to have the hot cursor
highlighted<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.229> from<00:01:58.710> there<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:58.979> can

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
highlighted and from there we can

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.679 
highlighted and from there we can
quickly<00:01:59.280> scroll<00:01:59.640> through<00:01:59.909> any<00:02:00.060> airspace<00:02:00.509> that

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
quickly scroll through any airspace that

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.600 
quickly scroll through any airspace that
you<00:02:00.780> might<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.200> currently<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.710> you'll<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you might be currently in you'll see the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.160 
you might be currently in you'll see the
different<00:02:02.939> levels<00:02:03.149> where<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.659> starts<00:02:04.079> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
different levels where it starts to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.289 
different levels where it starts to
where<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.350> finishes<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.880> again<00:02:06.090> check

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
where it finishes you can again check

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.609 
where it finishes you can again check
that<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.630> chart<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.110> sometimes<00:02:07.439> it's

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
that with your chart but sometimes it's

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.919 
that with your chart but sometimes it's
quite<00:02:07.770> difficult<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.250> flight<00:02:08.599> to<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.780> where

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
quite difficult in flight to see where

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.210 
quite difficult in flight to see where
it<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.289> mean<00:02:10.530> most<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.860> pre-flight

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
it is I mean most of the pre-flight

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.680 
it is I mean most of the pre-flight
panel<00:02:11.370> would<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.760> taken<00:02:12.030> care<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.360> but

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
panel would have taken care of that but

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.890 
panel would have taken care of that but
it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it's

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.720 
it's
nice<00:02:13.019> on-the-fly<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.310> able<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.459> see<00:02:14.610> what

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
nice on-the-fly to be able to see what

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.800 
nice on-the-fly to be able to see what
we're<00:02:14.849> doing<00:02:14.939> from<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.390> only<00:02:15.569> slight

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
we're doing from here the only slight

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.149 
we're doing from here the only slight
thing<00:02:16.019> there<00:02:16.170> okay<00:02:16.439> so<00:02:16.680> you've<00:02:16.829> got<00:02:16.860> these

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
thing there okay so you've got these

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.350 
thing there okay so you've got these
things<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.459> can<00:02:17.640> select<00:02:18.000> them<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.239> all<00:02:18.329> that

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
things I can select them and all that

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.839 
things I can select them and all that
but<00:02:18.689> my<00:02:19.170> biggest<00:02:19.470> concern<00:02:19.890> would<00:02:20.159> be<00:02:20.370> not

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
but my biggest concern would be not

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.250 
but my biggest concern would be not
seeing<00:02:21.239> something<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:21.780> chart<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.110> not

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
seeing something on the chart and not

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.839 
seeing something on the chart and not
seeing<00:02:22.530> something<00:02:22.769> on<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.159> and<00:02:23.280> about<00:02:23.670> to

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
seeing something on here and about to

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.729 
seeing something on here and about to
fly<00:02:24.030> into<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.420> without<00:02:24.540> having<00:02:24.810> noticed<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.500> is

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
fly into it without having noticed it is

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.259 
fly into it without having noticed it is
it<00:02:25.920> gonna<00:02:26.069> help<00:02:26.280> me<00:02:26.400> out<00:02:26.430> yeah<00:02:26.939> but<00:02:27.060> what<00:02:27.150> its

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
to come up with an information on the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.210 
to come up with an information on the
screen<00:02:33.840> saying<00:02:34.379> you're<00:02:34.709> approaching<00:02:35.129> the

screen saying you're approaching the
airspace<00:02:35.579> with<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.329> you<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.569> interrogate

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
airspace with that you can interrogate

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.899 
airspace with that you can interrogate
the<00:02:37.200> airspace<00:02:37.470> immediately<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.310> see<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.819> you

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
the airspace immediately and see if you

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.819 
the airspace immediately and see if you
need<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> change<00:02:39.359> your<00:02:39.540> course<00:02:39.720> or<00:02:40.019> altitude

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
need to change your course or altitude

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.860 
need to change your course or altitude
in<00:02:41.519> order<00:02:41.909> to<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.180> encroach<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.689> type<00:02:42.840> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
in order to not encroach that type of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.429 
in order to not encroach that type of
air

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
air

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
people in to fly and that's what we're

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.849 
people in to fly and that's what we're
trying<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.959> do<00:02:49.049> with<00:02:49.200> full<00:02:49.319> flaps<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.650> see<00:02:49.799> me

all the time inspiring people a lot of
people<00:02:52.379> are<00:02:52.470> going<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.620> say<00:02:52.769> well<00:02:52.889> a<00:02:53.099> v8<00:02:53.400> is

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
people are going to say well a v8 is

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.399 
people are going to say well a v8 is
really<00:02:53.909> difficult<00:02:54.090> you've<00:02:54.480> got<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.989> do<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.290> on

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
really difficult you've got to do it on

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.960 
really difficult you've got to do it on
the<00:02:55.530> maps<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.920> whole<00:02:56.099> time<00:02:56.370> you've<00:02:56.549> got<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
the maps the whole time you've got to

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.520 
the maps the whole time you've got to
work<00:02:57.150> out<00:02:57.359> your<00:02:57.480> rules<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.959> thumb<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.349> things

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
work out your rules of thumb and things

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.990 
work out your rules of thumb and things
like<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.829> we<00:02:59.220> know<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.430> you've<00:02:59.760> got<00:02:59.970> to

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
like this we know that you've got to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.360 
like this we know that you've got to
keep<00:03:00.239> your<00:03:00.389> map<00:03:00.569> in<00:03:00.780> there<00:03:00.989> but<00:03:01.349> how<00:03:01.560> useful<00:03:02.010> is

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
keep your map in there but how useful is

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.369 
keep your map in there but how useful is
is<00:03:02.519> how<00:03:02.970> much<00:03:03.000> more<00:03:03.540> pleasure<00:03:03.900> can<00:03:04.139> you<00:03:04.230> get

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
is how much more pleasure can you get

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.069 
is how much more pleasure can you get
out<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.590> flying<00:03:04.799> with<00:03:05.069> this<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.609> think<00:03:06.450> as<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
out of flying with this I think as a

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.629 
out of flying with this I think as a
younger<00:03:07.409> pilot<00:03:07.889> they're<00:03:08.129> all<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.609> same

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
younger pilot they're all the same

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.179 
younger pilot they're all the same
relatively<00:03:09.420> fewer<00:03:09.720> hours<00:03:10.139> rather<00:03:10.799> than<00:03:11.099> the

my flight on the chart do your normal
10-mile<00:03:58.829> legs<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.250> how<00:03:59.400> you're<00:03:59.609> doing<00:03:59.879> with

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
10-mile legs or how you're doing with

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.640 
10-mile legs or how you're doing with
then<00:04:00.569> when<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.810> go<00:04:00.930> in<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.199> do<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.440> flight

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
then when you go in you do the flight

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.259 
then when you go in you do the flight
planning<00:04:01.919> on<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.310> system<00:04:02.669> before<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.090> leave

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
planning on the system before you leave

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.089 
planning on the system before you leave
so<00:04:03.569> you<00:04:03.599> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.169> say<00:04:04.349> right<00:04:04.530> at<00:04:04.799> that<00:04:05.040> point

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
so you you can say right at that point

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.330 
so you you can say right at that point
would<00:04:05.760> be<00:04:05.790> over<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> river<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.379> road<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.889> can

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
would be over a river in a road you can

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.219 
would be over a river in a road you can
now<00:04:08.459> accurately<00:04:08.669> put<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.209> waypoint<00:04:09.389> on<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.229 
now accurately put a waypoint on the

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.379 
now accurately put a waypoint on the
system<00:04:10.620> for<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.370> create<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.819> flight<00:04:12.209> plan

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
system for that and create a flight plan

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.569 
system for that and create a flight plan
so<00:04:13.290> you've<00:04:13.470> done<00:04:13.680> your<00:04:13.739> flight<00:04:14.040> planning<00:04:14.430> you

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
so you've done your flight planning you

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.279 
so you've done your flight planning you
know<00:04:14.790> from<00:04:15.209> practice<00:04:15.569> that<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.870> should<00:04:16.079> miss

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
know from practice that you should miss

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.080 
know from practice that you should miss
all<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.530> airspace<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.760> you're<00:04:17.880> doing

all the airspace that you're doing

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.729 
all the airspace that you're doing
you've<00:04:18.539> got<00:04:18.720> all<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.959> frequencies<00:04:19.470> written

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
you've got all the frequencies written

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.620 
you've got all the frequencies written
down<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.699> never<00:04:20.880> know<00:04:21.029> you<00:04:21.090> might<00:04:21.329> get<00:04:21.510> the

but<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.580> try<00:04:38.790> finding<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.210> frequency<00:04:39.690> of<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:39.840> vor

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
but you try finding a frequency of a vor

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.500 
but you try finding a frequency of a vor
or<00:04:40.320> something<00:04:40.830> when<00:04:41.820> you're<00:04:41.940> flying<00:04:42.150> flights

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
or something when you're flying flights

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.510 
or something when you're flying flights
it<00:04:42.750> would<00:04:43.080> be<00:04:43.230> like<00:04:43.470> I've<00:04:43.890> got<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.160> quickly<00:04:44.340> get

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
it would be like I've got to quickly get

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.130 
it would be like I've got to quickly get
my<00:04:44.700> chart<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.210> do<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.390> but<00:04:45.690> you're<00:04:45.780> not<00:04:45.870> doing

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
my chart and do it but you're not doing

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.050 
my chart and do it but you're not doing
so<00:04:46.680> what<00:04:46.860> we<00:04:46.980> have<00:04:47.160> with<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.730> ability

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
so what we have with this is the ability

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.360 
so what we have with this is the ability
at<00:04:48.210> any<00:04:48.300> one<00:04:48.510> time<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:49.440> be<00:04:49.470> able<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.830> find<00:04:50.280> the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
at any one time to be able to find the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:58.239 
at any one time to be able to find the
frequency<00:04:50.550> dial<00:04:51.480> into<00:04:51.600> radio<00:04:52.050> North<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.470> go
