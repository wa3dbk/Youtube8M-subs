00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.759 

the<00:00:09.480> art<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.780> make<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.080> interactive

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
the art I make is interactive

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.680 
the art I make is interactive
installation<00:00:11.550> work<00:00:11.820> or<00:00:12.030> that's<00:00:12.179> one<00:00:12.480> way<00:00:12.630> to

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
installation work or that's one way to

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.799 
installation work or that's one way to
describe<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.530> because<00:00:14.429> what<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.120> does<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.660> it

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
describe it because what it does is it

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.620 
describe it because what it does is it
takes<00:00:16.020> input<00:00:16.320> about<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.220> space<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.449> this

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
takes input about the space so in this

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.359 
takes input about the space so in this
instance<00:00:18.869> or<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.710> instances<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.220> use

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
instance or in a lot of instances I use

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.240 
instance or in a lot of instances I use
a<00:00:20.400> video<00:00:20.640> camera<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.240> watch<00:00:21.630> people<00:00:22.170> moving<00:00:22.410> in

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
a video camera to watch people moving in

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.640 
a video camera to watch people moving in
a<00:00:23.369> space<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.850> then<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.539> write<00:00:24.689> software<00:00:25.320> that

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
a space and then I write software that

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.120 
a space and then I write software that
generates<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.550> visual<00:00:26.849> output<00:00:27.420> based<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:28.130> input

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
generates a visual output based on input

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.759 
generates a visual output based on input
and<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.359> feels<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.900> when<00:00:31.349> you're<00:00:31.590> in

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and so what it feels like when you're in

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.620 
and so what it feels like when you're in
an<00:00:31.890> installation<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.059> visuals<00:00:33.510> are

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
an installation is that the visuals are

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.530 
an installation is that the visuals are
just<00:00:33.899> responding<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.829> body<00:00:35.040> very

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
just responding to your body very

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.760 
just responding to your body very
seamlessly<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:36.960> interactive<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
seamlessly so it's interactive in a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.069 
seamlessly so it's interactive in a
sense<00:00:38.309> that's<00:00:38.910> always<00:00:39.180> changing<00:00:39.480> based<00:00:39.899> on

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
sense that's always changing based on

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.250 
sense that's always changing based on
what's<00:00:40.290> happening<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> space<00:00:42.260> everything

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
what's happening in the space everything

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
what's happening in the space everything
that<00:00:43.610> happens<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> projection<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.360> based

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that happens in the projection is based

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.900 
that happens in the projection is based
on<00:00:46.020> movements<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.860> generally<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.520> start<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
on movements so generally if you start a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.610 
on movements so generally if you start a
work<00:00:48.059> there's<00:00:48.300> nothing<00:00:48.480> there<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.320> there's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
work there's nothing there or there's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.939 
work there's nothing there or there's
kind<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.980> base<00:00:50.219> there<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.770> elements<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
kind of a base there of elements in the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.520 
kind of a base there of elements in the
system<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.760> their<00:00:53.940> own<00:00:53.969> behaviors<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
system that have their own behaviors so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
system that have their own behaviors so
really<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> piece<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.780> almost

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
really when I make a piece it's almost

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.110 
really when I make a piece it's almost
like<00:00:58.320> creating<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> whole<00:00:58.949> environment<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
like creating a whole environment so I

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.520 
like creating a whole environment so I
think<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:00.719> different<00:01:00.899> visual

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
think of all these different visual

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.650 
think of all these different visual
marks<00:01:01.920> also<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.059> animated

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
marks also have a kind of animated

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.440 
marks also have a kind of animated
behavior<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:05.250> then<00:01:05.400> other<00:01:05.610> rules<00:01:05.939> about<00:01:06.240> how

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
behavior and then other rules about how

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
behavior and then other rules about how
they<00:01:06.659> might<00:01:06.840> react<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.619> when<00:01:07.890> they

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
they might react like when they

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.450 
they might react like when they
intersect<00:01:08.670> where<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> person<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:10.130> in<00:01:11.130> some

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
intersect where a person is or in some

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
intersect where a person is or in some
cases<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.270> attract<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.049> your

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
cases they like attract to your

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
cases they like attract to your
trajectory<00:01:13.460> or<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.610> there's<00:01:14.760> all

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
trajectory or you know there's all

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.100 
trajectory or you know there's all
different<00:01:14.909> kinds<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.420> rules<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> write

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
different kinds of rules that I write

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.590 
different kinds of rules that I write
about<00:01:16.320> how<00:01:16.770> these<00:01:17.009> marks<00:01:17.340> react<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.420> things

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
about how these marks react to things

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.560 
about how these marks react to things
but<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.619> there's<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.610> number<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.270> different

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
but then there's a number of different

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.749 
but then there's a number of different
behaviors<00:01:22.080> later<00:01:22.320> together<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.250> create<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
behaviors later together to create the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.000 
behaviors later together to create the
composition<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> piece

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.530 

so<00:01:32.010> one<00:01:32.190> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.430> earliest<00:01:32.910> interactive

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
so one of the earliest interactive

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.970 
so one of the earliest interactive
installations<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.380> created<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
installations I created was a

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.890 
installations I created was a
collaboration<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.760> Romeo<00:01:36.150> assitive<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
collaboration with Romeo assitive and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.360 
collaboration with Romeo assitive and
the<00:01:36.960> piece<00:01:37.110> was<00:01:37.290> called<00:01:37.410> Tex<00:01:37.770> train<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
the piece was called Tex train and

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.180 
the piece was called Tex train and
that's<00:01:38.940> one<00:01:39.120> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.300> more<00:01:39.480> literal

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
that's one of the more literal

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
that's one of the more literal
installations<00:01:41.190> so<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.490> cameras<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.030> wall

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
installations so the cameras in the wall

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
installations so the cameras in the wall
so<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> projection

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
so that what you see in the projection

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.530 
so that what you see in the projection
is<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> big<00:01:44.610> black<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.120> white<00:01:45.210> video

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
is like a big black and white video

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.960 
is like a big black and white video
mirror<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.200> yourself<00:01:46.620> and<00:01:46.800> there<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.700> letters

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
mirror of yourself and there are letters

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.120 
mirror of yourself and there are letters
raining<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:49.979> actually

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
raining down and that you can actually

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010 
raining down and that you can actually
catch<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.030> body<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> letters<00:01:51.870> are

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
catch with your body and the letters are

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.870 
catch with your body and the letters are
a<00:01:52.050> poem<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.710> eventually<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.640> read

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
a poem so eventually you can read

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.640 
a poem so eventually you can read
certain<00:01:54.420> words<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.900> probably<00:01:55.200> never<00:01:55.410> read

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
certain words you probably never read

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.110 
certain words you probably never read
the<00:01:55.770> whole<00:01:55.920> poem<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.400> you<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> idea<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
the whole poem but you get the idea that

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.700 
the whole poem but you get the idea that
it's<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.420> random<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.080> there's<00:01:58.260> something

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
it's not random that there's something

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.109 
it's not random that there's something
here<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.190> sort<00:01:59.400> of<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.490> outside<00:02:00.060> your

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
here that's sort of just outside your

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:11.550 
here that's sort of just outside your
grass

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.559 

another<00:02:12.560> piece<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.100> did<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:13.880> really<00:02:14.330> like

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
another piece I did that I really like

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.420 
another piece I did that I really like
is<00:02:14.870> called<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.380> good<00:02:15.590> time<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:16.160> actually<00:02:16.250> a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
is called the good time it's actually a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.730 
is called the good time it's actually a
whole<00:02:16.580> series<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.110> piece<00:02:18.380> your

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
whole series and in that piece your

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.680 
whole series and in that piece your
movement<00:02:19.280> in<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.490> space<00:02:19.760> fragments

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
movement in the space fragments

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.620 
movement in the space fragments
pre-recorded<00:02:21.590> video<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.459> as<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:22.940> move<00:02:23.180> you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
pre-recorded video so as you move you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.800 
pre-recorded video so as you move you
start<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.319> video<00:02:24.440> moving<00:02:25.100> or<00:02:25.370> rewinding<00:02:26.360> but

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
start the video moving or rewinding but

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.380 
start the video moving or rewinding but
only<00:02:26.989> in<00:02:27.380> certain<00:02:27.770> parts<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.640> screen<00:02:28.880> but

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
only in certain parts of the screen but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.320 
only in certain parts of the screen but
so<00:02:29.510> my<00:02:29.660> idea<00:02:29.930> was<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.370> subdivide<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.850> actual

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
so my idea was to subdivide the actual

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.300 
so my idea was to subdivide the actual
playback<00:02:32.870> from<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.440> video<00:02:33.680> frame<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.100> place

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
playback from the video frame and place

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.160 
playback from the video frame and place
smaller<00:02:34.640> units<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:35.630> creates<00:02:36.050> this

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
smaller units so that creates this

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.320 
smaller units so that creates this
really<00:02:36.440> strange<00:02:37.069> rippling<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.760> warping<00:02:38.150> of

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
really strange rippling and warping of

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:55.180 
really strange rippling and warping of
time<00:02:38.600> as<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.110> move<00:02:39.290> around<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.010> space<00:02:54.190> so

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
time as you move around in a space so

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.330 
time as you move around in a space so
these<00:02:55.430> are<00:02:56.200> ink<00:02:57.200> drawings<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:57.980> charcoal

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
these are ink drawings and charcoal

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.890 
these are ink drawings and charcoal
drawings<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:58.970> made<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.540> eventually

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
drawings that I made that eventually

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.680 
drawings that I made that eventually
became<00:03:00.530> part<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.160> untitled<00:03:01.519> six<00:03:02.030> project

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
became part of the untitled six project

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.890 
became part of the untitled six project
so<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.319> knew<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.310> wanted<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.850> have<00:03:05.030> some<00:03:05.330> elements

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
so I knew I wanted to have some elements

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.199 
so I knew I wanted to have some elements
that<00:03:05.930> appear<00:03:06.470> along<00:03:06.950> people's<00:03:07.400> trajectories

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
that appear along people's trajectories

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.630 
that appear along people's trajectories
and<00:03:08.420> those<00:03:08.750> these<00:03:09.050> are<00:03:09.170> also<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.650> elements

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
and those these are also the elements

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.190 
and those these are also the elements
that<00:03:10.700> start<00:03:10.910> growing<00:03:11.300> into<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.600> big<00:03:11.780> blobs

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
that start growing into the big blobs

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.949 
that start growing into the big blobs
and<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:13.340> was<00:03:13.519> trying<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.910> make<00:03:14.060> them<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.840> know

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
and I was trying to make them you know

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.900 
and I was trying to make them you know
computationally<00:03:15.739> on<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.040> computer<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:16.820> I

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
computationally on the computer and I

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.789 
computationally on the computer and I
just<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.420> turns<00:03:17.690> out<00:03:17.900> it's<00:03:18.110> much<00:03:18.350> easier<00:03:18.739> to

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
just it turns out it's much easier to

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.539 
just it turns out it's much easier to
get<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.190> kind<00:03:19.400> of<00:03:19.459> variation<00:03:20.920> just<00:03:21.920> using<00:03:22.280> ink

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
get the kind of variation just using ink

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.430 
get the kind of variation just using ink
for<00:03:22.940> me<00:03:23.090> anyway<00:03:23.540> than<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.900> try<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.140> figure<00:03:24.320> out

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
for me anyway than to try to figure out

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.680 
for me anyway than to try to figure out
how<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.709> do<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.120> mathematically<00:03:26.120> or<00:03:26.299> using

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
how to do that mathematically or using

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.720 
how to do that mathematically or using
something<00:03:26.870> like<00:03:27.079> Photoshop<00:03:27.320> so<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.070> scan<00:03:28.489> these

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
something like Photoshop so I scan these

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.520 
something like Photoshop so I scan these
in<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.360> then<00:03:29.450> pick<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.870> ones<00:03:30.079> that<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.320> want

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
in and then pick the ones that I want

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.440 
in and then pick the ones that I want
that<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.950> think<00:03:31.190> look<00:03:31.400> good<00:03:31.549> in<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.880> piece<00:03:32.150> and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
that I think look good in the piece and

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.600 
that I think look good in the piece and
then<00:03:32.900> those<00:03:33.110> are<00:03:33.140> manipulated<00:03:34.040> in<00:03:34.160> terms<00:03:34.400> of

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
then those are manipulated in terms of

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.490 
then those are manipulated in terms of
the<00:03:35.120> color<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.780> their<00:03:35.900> size<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.410> their

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
the color and their size and their

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.280 
the color and their size and their
orientation<00:03:37.280> with<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.970> software<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:39.140> runs

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
orientation with the software that runs

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:48.790 
orientation with the software that runs
the<00:03:39.650> piece

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.050 

some<00:03:49.800> of<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.100> newer<00:03:50.310> Commission's<00:03:50.820> I've<00:03:50.940> been

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
some of the newer Commission's I've been

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.560 
some of the newer Commission's I've been
working<00:03:51.330> on

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
working on

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.300 
working on
don't<00:03:51.720> use<00:03:51.930> projection<00:03:52.530> they're<00:03:52.680> using<00:03:52.980> LED

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
don't use projection they're using LED

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.820 
don't use projection they're using LED
lights<00:03:53.520> more<00:03:53.850> in<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.210> sculptural<00:03:54.780> form<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
lights more in a sculptural form and

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.470 
lights more in a sculptural form and
I've<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.070> been<00:03:56.160> brainstorming<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.940> lot<00:03:56.970> about

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
I've just been brainstorming a lot about

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.630 
I've just been brainstorming a lot about
what<00:03:57.750> does<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:57.900> mean<00:03:58.500> for<00:03:58.830> how<00:03:58.980> we<00:03:59.040> consider

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
what does that mean for how we consider

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.990 
what does that mean for how we consider
light<00:04:00.090> in<00:04:00.450> our<00:04:00.630> world
