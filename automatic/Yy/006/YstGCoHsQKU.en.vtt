00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.240
 open 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.260
 maybe we'll call him retarded 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.909
 now we are going to some new products that 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.909
 no but what does 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 I look at a book we can burn it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 that makes slow delayed I will save you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.660
 I'm going for you , I'm really going to save you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.720
 I'll get you out of there to the forum now we're going 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.790
 to spend the modes let's go I wanted 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.890
 pass me this the penguins that not yet 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.650
 I had seen nothing let's go see here 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.940
 we can install trees we draw sticks 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.440
 A) Yes 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.360
 and so 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.120
 and now to be like that 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.370
 and I can use it as a tool to remove 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.370
 the trees you see that pretty 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.630
 perfect but now I think it made me 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.910
 missing a key let's draw a 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:30.430
 normal and current key as well 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.960
 yes and so 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.470
 That 's right and we're going 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.470
 It is done 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.230
 the key and stuck perfect to host 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.110
 this we go a little more outside and 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.500
 we freeze 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.640
 we go here we freeze we go by 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.760
 here 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.450
 we break this now make a good ax 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.450
 made of nothing 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.770
 if I had something to draw better but 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.690
 I speak 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.690
 I have to draw with a mouse 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.760
 and now there is the barrier 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.210
 now if it freezes we miss and 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.290
 good good 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.750
 we bought it 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.440
 we are going now 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.650
 here it was here we take the cha we follow 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.730
 we go like this 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.730
 as the key 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.420
 A) Yes 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.530
 we go 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.170
 let's go here fast 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.770
 fast fast fast 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.770
 we go 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.180
 let's see there 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.310
 a penguin freezes but does not matter 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.310
 hence he dies 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:18.130
 there is another 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:22.150
 It will not be that good either 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.080
 It was necessary to cut trees, let's see if 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.080
 we can make a long 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:34.210
 you need a much more powerful payments 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:37.949
 I have to do it fast, come on, it's 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.949
 you are and man 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.550
 but it breaks it breaks 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.899
 well in the king penguins have saved 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:50.190
 from that for them and destroys the 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:53.220
 rapid 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.070
 the damn ones who are new dwarfs of 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.290
 Elves 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.290
 Hobbits does not destroy it 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.030
 very good very well 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.820
 now with an ax 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.540
 they will be saved 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.540
 OK 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.599
 break fast 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.000
 it's good to congratulate 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.800

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.800
