 work with a red dog 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.649
 I do 150 research parents who me 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.270
 passionate search for blood is 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.920
 work with my dog have my

 dog work because every 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.140
 search for charente and find 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.399
 the animal injured four mules below 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.500
 of an animal was killed here yala had 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.720
 pieces of guts it's a ball of 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.690
 think a walk hand you that pulls you from 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.160
 mirador there that brought together 130 beautiful 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.160
 mobility distance in the show last night 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.600
 at the level the blood the blood each 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.280
 research is a bet the obstacles that 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.920
 stand on the trail of game are 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.110
 many for the dog and his driver 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.970
 fence length of the course 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.590
 scrub smells multiple all 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.700
 conjugates to divert attention from 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.010
 dog here 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.780
 the smell alone is not enough even if he 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.700
 remains decisive in the success of 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.710
 search to the animal when he takes a 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.170
 ball 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.750
 the pain the fear all that will him 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.520
 to arrive later it leaves an odor 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.440
 particular behind him and that the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.180
 storing wine cellar he walks with the fragrance 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.590
 so he often led in the air for that 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.610
 it includes all the above and the wind 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.600
 of face so he always warns 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.230
 at sight the little eye to a boy in his 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.820
 research 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.800
 the dog can sometimes leave the track 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.460
 it even happens with dogs 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.460
 experienced 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.240
 the success rate is by the way 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.220
 40% and it's in difficult times 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.410
 of course that the experience of 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.240
 driver comes into play know iran 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.320
 his dog understand the times when they 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.690
 doubt in his research 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.490
 put it back on track it's where 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.110
 all the science of the driver a 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.450
 science rewarded here after a course 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.190
 to put me there 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:19.990
 here it is here the pig is good 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:20.200
 boys yes it's good but if you want 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.980
 Yes 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.810
 aaron nice there is a dog and the bottom 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.640
 of the turn it's a team of dogs and 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.290
 award winning work for me too 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.420
 from time to time or take a look 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.590
 here and knows that it is for 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.690
 to please as well as the dog and 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.040
 working do not believe that the dog 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.450
 only works for a reward 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.990
 someone there his reward and 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.140
 caresses and it's the pleasure of me 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.360
 find this animal as serge 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.310
 entringer hyacinthe nini is also 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.780
 driver to earn national unity 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.880
 for use of red dogs 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.200
 despite his long experience in 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.180
 search for game with his own 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.180
 dog each exit is a discovery 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.069
 every time I mean research 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.379
 it's not an infused science and we do not 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.390
 do not stay on an idea we know 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.670
 we all know we all learn 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.430
 whenever each time there has been 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.060
 a search with another driver 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.160
 systematically to France is a 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.510
 permanent school 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.370
 the boar will be given to hunters 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.320
 who shot him down the driver and his 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.120
 dog will not benefit 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.010
 except the pride of having found the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.030
 game do not leave any dying beast 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.830
 in nature 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.020
 this is the very purpose of research at 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.520
 blood practiced by the people of lucre so 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.000
 this technique has existed since 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.830
 Middle Ages 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.169
 she did not reappear in France until 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.729
 early 80s from germany 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.560
 she first seduced the hunters 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.180
 of Alsace and moselle to extend 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.320
 little by little to the whole territory 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.240
 national 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.220
 today they are over 600 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.560
 drivers in France a real plus for 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.940
 the world of rifle hunting will be there 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.830
 it will be better because they are 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.949
 volunteers so people coming 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.080
 free in hunts power 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.940
 find the wounded game and the more they 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.750
 are many - will be solicited because 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.120
 today we must still 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.680
 a lot of intervention in the year 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.750
 takes a lot of kilometers and do it 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.630
 in a voluntary way so more there will be 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.020
 world - it will be heavy for them and better 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.789
 it will be 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.889
 and the faster we will be in research 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.389
 of our subjects well but it's for 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.070
 the national forestry office the 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.690
 Lucre drivers participate 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.669
 also and in several forms to the 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.690
 good management of woodlands have 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.820
 need to know the animals that 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.919
 will be drawn in a way because we 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.830
 follow our our population tracking 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.560
 there to always keep 7:07 this 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.300
 balance forest forest game and other 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.810
 from the ethical point of view this is to 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.910
 the hunter's duty to search for a 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.199
 animal that may have been hurt in their 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.060
 find shorten his suffering 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.870
 normally a self track an offer 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.729
 from one kilometer to km2 is done with that 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.740
 only 25 centilitres of 100 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.000
 other serge missions form of 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.310
 new drivers and their dogs 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.680
 an artificial track of 1200 meters 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.720
 will be created and wild boar blood 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.630
 will be spread all along the labels 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.010
 placed out of sight of the driver 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.810
 will be used to find their bearings if the track and 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.810
 lost by the animal in formation 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.949
 after what you do there seems like 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.540
 that you mainly mark this 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.940
 place why create one 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.040
 artificial opposites have laid it's a 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.830
 where the animal after its first 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.510
 injury comes to rest the quack 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.520
 mark them ask to find their 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.920
 opponents lucien driver since five 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.930
 years kalou his dog a young dachshund 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.500
 17 months and in his first year of 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.570
 training 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.130
 although this young male and already found 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.650
 game wounded by shooting 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.690
 hunters the realities of the ground do not 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.360
 are not always easy to manage with 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.670
 three accomplices fresh dainville was 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.550
 passed then the top 2 3 who accuse him 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:48.540
 of blood that prone of rain must have been fresh 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.040
 he is lost and they seek the 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.020
 champion making his series back 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.520
 tommy everything to take back the track 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.750
 look at risk what he lost the 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.370
 track of oneself because one at an angle 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.440
 right or and that's nothing the dog has 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.890
 still seem to want to work 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.110
 always 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:05.580
 so they look for the track he has 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.440
 lost it comes back after 50 minutes of 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.300
 search kalou and his master have 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.640
 back up the artificial track to the 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:16.500
 boar's skin a year will be 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.270
 necessary to kalou and his master for 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.430
 to be operational they will come as well 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.380
 join the 90 dog drivers 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.490
 of blood during a party of nothing in the 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.490
 80s the
