00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.510
 Good day, by android auto and carplay 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.380
 have not yet appeared and now wants to be 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.870
 and where to go 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.910
 one of the solutions parrot asteroid smart 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.130
 multimedia system for cars 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.619
 what is this thing 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.869
 from rocks for most of us will 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.570
 convenient to hear that this is the forefather android 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.029
 auto but itâ€™s not exactly so 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.039
 so at least for the reason that the asteroid 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.529
 can connect to iphone android and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.540
 windows phone and even old nokia 60 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.160
 series and in general any devices that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.680
 support hands-free and able 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.690
 handing out mobile internet will come to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.940
 the same with android auto for example 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.370
 brains of the system this is your phone she doesn't 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.260
 works autonomously with carplay the same 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.660
 and here all brains are inside 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.489
 asteroid smart can be called a tablet with 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.890
 powerful multimedia stuffing days 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.500
 technical namely multimedia although 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 tablet yet call extreme it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.559
 such a big box which 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.390
 is inserted into almost any 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.000
 car instead of local recorders 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.979
 and for car owners it will be nice 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.229
 hear that this is format 21 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.640
 it is easily inserted in both old and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.189
 in a new car and where not so much 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 places well and at the moment our systems 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.900
 just such a car is installed 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.850
 peugeot 408 and before you surprise 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.759
 what can this system discuss immediately 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.659
 minus ugly looks on old it 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.299
 really minus 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.689
 practically the only thing but not the most 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.810
 important therefore we move on and so 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.420
 specifications 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.810
 asteroid smart has a screen diagonal of 6 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.030
 and 2 inch resolution of 800 by 480 pixels 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.450
 there are 8 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.180
 cpu here to you about 3630 operational 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.399
 memory 512 megabytes weak but 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.619
 It works tolerably It works 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.729
 fancy radio on android 2 and 3 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.579
 he is very much customized 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.130
 the system is almost completely redone 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.860
 design is very controversial but a lot 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.140
 cool chips first you can install 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.420
 almost any application here is 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.070
 asteroid market there exclusively 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.649
 authorized android applications for 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.840
 of this system but of course you can optionally 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.360
 put any while file here woman 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.149
 and shook 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.250
 why is it used android 2 and 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.200
 3 so old 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.630
 I explain firstly he is not demanding 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.490
 although this is not an excuse for android version 2 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.130
 and 3 is now the latest version 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.650
 for embedded devices why 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.540
 because the old android is much 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.480
 less restrictions than the fourth or 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.970
 the fifth version is easier to say everything and 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.750
 more screw here and what 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.270
 screwed 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.709
 let's start with voice control this one 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.390
 of the most necessary functions 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.430
 yes if your phone is connected by 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.130
 bluetooth and they call you then you can click 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.140
 on the button to take but if the hands are busy we 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.110
 generally more pleasant to answer voices 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.550
 just say accept or reject 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.950
 accepted and the conversation immediately begins 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.410
 by the way if the phone supports and je 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.700
 vois here it works set 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.680
 here comes such a microphone with 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.900
 noise reduction set here 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.390
 we are with sound beauty great quality 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.450
 on the radio itself there are many behind 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.220
 connectors among the interesting 3 yusb port 20 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.260
 you can connect usb modem 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.150
 by the way supported by the altar and for 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.799
 Russian operators have all 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.049
 There is inside the tablet inserted and everything 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.209
 earned immediately 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.130
 connects to the back and gps antenna can 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.810
 plug in external hard disk drive 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.750
 rear view camera yes even with a mouse 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.980
 keyboard and there is another usb for ipod 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.440
 iphone ipad 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.150
 it has 2 amps power 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.700
 also on the back all 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.250
 necessary audio video outputs for what 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.200
 it needs a standard player has one 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.330
 an interesting opportunity would be 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.760
 useless just watch movies though 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.250
 in difficult moments and it is useful where 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.260
 more important is the output to an external monitor and if 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.840
 headrests have such monitors 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.910
 you can turn on the video and it's only a pity 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.250
 that the standard player supports small 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.290
 number of codecs and formats but for 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.480
 this is well sim true to output with 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.030
 it is impossible to go any further 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.670
 voice control is practically that 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.940
 You can turn on by voice 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.730
 mail write or turn on music 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.060
 voice control 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.209
 music music 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.209
 Yury Antonov 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.969
 In general, the music application itself is convenient 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.590
 you can initially select music from 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.870
 internal memory with flash cards from 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.210
 hard disk site under from application 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.180
 dark if it is installed versions or 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.219
 radio and everything is determined automatically 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.099
 very convenient at will according to the list 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.960
 performers watch every source 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:45.750
 By the way, voice control works without 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.060
 Internet connections can be listened to and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.250
 mail voice and sm with answer too 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.409
 everything is perceived in a voice no worse than 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.080
 latest dictation from google 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:57.360
 what else interesting has 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.180
 Built-in navigator igul for Europe and 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.789
 Yandex navigator with a license but the most 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.789
 interesting about the city here is the whole map 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.789
 Russia and CIS countries are already loaded offline 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.250
 same with the license and here still in the presence 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.979
 android 4 similar functions would be 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.810
 impossible to implement or harder so 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.689
 that i will probably explain to you why here 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.550
 2 and 3 among other chips device 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.039
 constant system update and 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.969
 interesting function virtual super bass 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.490
 version 2 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.560
 if you have a decent audio system in 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.270
 wheelbarrow then lovers listen well 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.870
 music will appreciate the ability to customize 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.289
 sound and how much it all costs 38,000 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.900
 rubles 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.969
 much or little it is even with the current 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.069
 the position of the ruble is quite a small amount 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.050
 for a full-fledged car system 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.699
 I can say for this money I will hang 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.740
 here the tablet is really nothing but 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.250
 navigation apps and movies are no longer 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.879
 will receive 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.310
 and on the conclusion of such a total cons of unconditional 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.129
 the design is not the most beautiful and not even the most 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.529
 powerful system is not powerful at all but the pros 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.339
 what obviously it is not android auto 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.250
 do it yourself 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:04.259
 but it is probably even more convenient to something 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.520
 besides it is more universal because 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.219
 you can put asteroid smart 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.750
 almost any car yet 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.939
 cheap and not in my words 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.589
 subjectivity because among similar 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:16.490
 systems so far asteroid smart 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.490
 wins
