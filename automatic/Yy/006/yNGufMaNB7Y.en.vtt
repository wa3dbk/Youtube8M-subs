00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.629
 we want the black model of the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.730
 jabra move here again two 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.080
 minutes in front of the camera can not do that 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 There is a lot to show there 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.370
 Headphones are more likely to be on your ear 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.630
 but a glimpse of soon 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.950
 the accessories and the controls 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.859
 should be in it 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.449
 to the scope of delivery there is not much 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.189
 to say once have that jack cable 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.140
 It agrees on one side and one 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.710
 with the usb to the micro USB cable to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.109
 load 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.859
 Otherwise look at the headphones there 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.380
 Let's get back to the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.060
 operating elements the profession belongs to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 every case to the visually more beautiful 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.059
 bluetooth headphones 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.559
 we see that above with fabric 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.120
 clamped on the side we have so 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.140
 two ribbon cable inside are 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.300
 relatively flexible 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.890
 he has a good contact pressure on the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.030
 head if we all the thing here 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.219
 a little further open because we are in 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.649
 then you have a relatively big head 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.680
 even when fully dressed loud 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.390
 speaker earbuds here is this 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.680
 cable not on voltage that is always 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.120
 very nice and is with some 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.070
 manufacturers like to forget 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 otherwise in there are the labeled 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.469
 which side we turn to which one 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.449
 were left right 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.329
 You can both pull it out 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.710
 my big 58 head fits on it who 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.150
 already my cap has bought the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.250
 He knows what he's up to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.810
 sizes and I like that 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 little bit less than that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.080
 maximum length apart 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.400
 Let 's take a look at the controls 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 the right side in the picture we have 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.939
 down the micro usb port here if i have 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.590
 there with the finger a bit further 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.299
 on top of it is the on off switch of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.950
 at the same time for coupling with new ones 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.810
 That means if I use the devices 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.270
 whole thing yes , he connects 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.189
 with the last known device in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.009
 In this case, my iphone logs 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.759
 then also briefly in the headphones in it and 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.500
 which the whole thing a bit 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.390
 pressed longer leave here upwards 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.009
 Pull this switch I'll come back 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.909
 in the holiday mode rhine can me with 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.909
 earn other devices 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.930
 on the other side we have the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.460
 klinken port as soon as a cable pure 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.200
 plugged in is yes 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.280
 as I said 1 is the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.810
 Bluetooth connection completely 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.369
 disabled on top of it we have here 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.530
 volume button and this 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.780
 multifunction buttons that is now one 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.909
 a bit extensive, let me just say it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.320
 the most important things with the fashion 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.119
 function key in the middle we can 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.489
 accept and hang up incoming calls 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.729
 if you press on it then he chooses the 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.620
 number he last 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.360
 so chose that serves at the same time 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.349
 as a repetition you press one 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.640
 little longer to get started now siri 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.769
 is not playing any music right now and it's running 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.379
 no calls then can be with the 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:28.120
 louder and quieter keys the current 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:29.230
 distance query plays music then can 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.760
 to make you louder and quieter 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.580
 or the keys a bit 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.890
 longer pressed just keeps a song 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.250
 forward or a song backwards 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.250
 jump
