00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.590
 has fueled many speculations in 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.080
 around her 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.720
 according to some players to the river 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.170
 bruno arise it is necessary that the player 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.110

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.960
 survival mode in the game radio mode 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.320

 Laughing the brain usually plants traps 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.100
 Break glass torches and even blocks 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.500
 in single player mode 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.290
 or if you do not want to see the gasparzinho 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.680
 wandering around your game try to 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.060
 get a girlfriend or just 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.190
 play moderately 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.010
 the first report of the appearance of the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.650
 describes a situation in which the 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.240
 player was having fun 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.430
 quietly in single player mode 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.040
 when he saw something moving in the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.590
 fog that forms when playing with 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.450
 the minimum compensation that was 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.330
 a lot with the other player 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.090
 right away he was very surprised at last 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.700
 I was on a solo map but until he 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.360
 begin to reflect on this figure 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.330
 stranger had disappeared after the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.420
 started the bizarrices inside the game 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.540
 was an item disappearing constructions arising 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.300
 you're out of tori 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.580
 emerging traps and searching for 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.070
 helped on the web sphere he discovered that 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.890
 there was a player who wore the same 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.400
 corner and that he had the nickname to go 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.750
 or braille and 2nd forum was the nic of brother 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.540
 deceased of not playing with gasparzinho 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.060
 since then several other 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.730
 stories around this beautiful 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.640
 some say fillon denote and died 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.060
 drowned and would have been added to the game 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.700
 as a tribute though mojang deny the 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.310
 existence of the brain river whenever there is 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.620
 some great update they place 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.710
 the list of modifications that IHRU 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.210
 brain was removed but after all it is only 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.530
 a legend or myth is real 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.820
 unfortunately for the worshipers of 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.400
 urban legends 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.980
 it is clear that this is only a good 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.419
 clip folder or not 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.850
 op jokes aside the images of the 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.890
 alleged appearances of brain 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.830
 clearly changed images in the 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.380
 photoshop and the author of the game already 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.040
 He said in several interviews that do not 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.680
 have much less dead living brothers 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.650
 but what led us to make this video 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.080
 is that this legend has turned so fast in the 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.930
 network that countless people began to 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.229
 see river brain and find that anything 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.050
 that happened in the game was his fault 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.690
 the story became so famous that until 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.479
 made a song to laugh the braille 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.520
 by the way, many players claim 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.470
 that on a single musical disc that is 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.160
 broken number 11 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.120
 you can hear an individual almost talking and 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.240
 no braille 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.210
 according to them the recording was interrupted 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.590
 and the game happy days case with river 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.660
 brain river green 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.780
 It was a joke of the developer. 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.720
 that entered the wave of the players but even 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.970
 not being in the game officially the fans 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.940
 of the work gave a way to transform 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.490
 the legend into something palpable and created the 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.729
 Brain template in which player can 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.430
 invoke the feared monster through a 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.010
 totem that is made with 2 gold blocks 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.860
 a specific modcom block the face of the 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.150
 river brain and a nerd rock in the tube and up 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.180

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.570
 classic ring to be living the legend
