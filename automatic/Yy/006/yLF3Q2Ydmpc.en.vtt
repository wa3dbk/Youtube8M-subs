 good morning guys today I will show you how 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.999
 clean speed up your mac there are 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.259
 many factors that can slow the 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.879
 your computer 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.879
 too many applications open to the same 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:17.040
 time too little ram and of course i 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.950
 too many duplicates that waste space on 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.960
 your hard disk so the first thing that 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.450
 you should do is close all the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.240
 applications one thing you could 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.850
 find it useful to restart your computer 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.860
 regularly many applications too 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.620
 after they are closed they still occupy 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.590
 memories are a restart of the computer can 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.290

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.870
