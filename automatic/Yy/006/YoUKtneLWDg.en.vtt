00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.989
 see the link in the description or 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.569

 we are all the same with new ones 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:48.139
 the tanks are the only minus this program 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.799
 the fact that the tanks are not spinning stupid 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.439
 caterpillars 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.329
 dory the only negative and so here too 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:57.829
 the most so let's 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:00.439
 so change the paint here buttons 13 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:05.019

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:08.019

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.720
 tell me slowly but to 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.629
 the fact that the tank goes slowly in general so that 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.060
 fix it press f4 and here as in 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:37.159
 let the old tanks at the rank of Chemistry 750 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.060
 so in general right now I am doing this 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:46.579
 configuration so back and get up so 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:49.989
 Well, let's check it 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.790
 must stand up sheep not slept 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.120

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.129
 let's try dorigo i really 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.439
 reared up here like that 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.909
 making fun of so much to be reborn 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:09.040
 click on the button r english and we 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.069
 teleport on the same tanks for something 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.109
 the place where we broke up 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.630
 By the way, this program will be very useful. 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.639
 those who have such as garages 70 and 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:24.310
 wants to ride m3 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:26.830
 and here is a shorter program for you in 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.759
 general, all thanks for watching and I think 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.280
 everyone understood how the program works here 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.130
 if anyone incomprehensibly write me 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.440
