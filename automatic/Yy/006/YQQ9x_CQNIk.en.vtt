00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
problems with that so we got the real

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.210 
problems with that so we got the real
big<00:01:39.000> openings<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.500> deep<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> don't

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
big openings the pretty deep so I don't

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.190

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
thing I did notice how was different

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.550 
thing I did notice how was different
about<00:02:17.129> this<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.760> naked<00:02:18.390> skin<00:02:18.569> case<00:02:18.840> make<00:02:19.530> a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
about this this naked skin case make a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.589 
about this this naked skin case make a
case<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.190> was<00:02:21.060> different<00:02:21.209> from<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> other

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
case that was different from the other

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.570 
case that was different from the other
one<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.319> has<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> little<00:02:23.069> bit<00:02:23.250> more<00:02:23.519> of

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
one is that it has a little bit more of

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.610 
one is that it has a little bit more of
a<00:02:23.700> there's<00:02:24.330> more<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.690> gap<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:24.930> between<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
a there's more of a gap in between the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.960 
a there's more of a gap in between the
case<00:02:25.799> in<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.040> phone<00:02:26.220> like<00:02:26.430> there's<00:02:26.580> more<00:02:26.730> room

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
case in the phone like there's more room

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.150 
case in the phone like there's more room
before<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.349> older<00:02:28.560> naked<00:02:28.709> case<00:02:29.010> was

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
before the the older naked case was

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.490 
before the the older naked case was
really<00:02:29.430> snug<00:02:29.819> but<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.900> kind<00:02:31.019> of<00:02:31.110> pinch<00:02:31.349> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
really snug but I can kind of pinch the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.900 
really snug but I can kind of pinch the
sides<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> phone<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.220> could<00:02:32.489> feel<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.700> had

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
sides of the phone I could feel it had

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.759 
sides of the phone I could feel it had
to<00:02:33.090> some<00:02:33.269> play<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.500> bad<00:02:34.620> thing

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
to some play in it and so the bad thing

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.960 
to some play in it and so the bad thing
about<00:02:34.799> there<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.220> there's<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.819> means

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
about there is that there's that means

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.190 
about there is that there's that means
there's<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> little<00:02:36.299> more<00:02:36.540> room<00:02:36.720> between<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
there's a little more room between the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.110 
there's a little more room between the
phone<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.620> case<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:38.190> sometimes<00:02:38.879> I'll

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
phone and the case and so sometimes I'll

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.819 
phone and the case and so sometimes I'll
get<00:02:39.269> dust<00:02:39.569> or<00:02:39.930> particles<00:02:40.409> or<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.680> stuff

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
get dust or particles or just stuff

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.920 
get dust or particles or just stuff
that's<00:02:41.010> inside<00:02:41.129> of<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.549> really<00:02:41.849> easily<00:02:42.030> it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
that's inside of it really easily it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.089 
that's inside of it really easily it
gets<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.260> there<00:02:43.379> because<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.739> case<00:02:43.920> isn't

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
gets in there because the case isn't

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.240 
gets in there because the case isn't
real<00:02:44.340> snug<00:02:44.579> it<00:02:44.730> hard<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:46.230> I've<00:02:46.950> also<00:02:47.129> heard

with the original iphone it was aluminum
which<00:04:06.480> was<00:04:06.690> an<00:04:06.810> issue<00:04:06.959> it's<00:04:07.260> not<00:04:07.319> that<00:04:07.530> easy<00:04:07.829> to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
which was an issue it's not that easy to

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.939 
which was an issue it's not that easy to
scratch<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.400> up<00:04:08.639> but<00:04:09.510> um<00:04:09.690> let<00:04:10.680> me<00:04:10.709> show<00:04:10.919> you

here obviously now it's a plastic back

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.170 
here obviously now it's a plastic back
it's<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> lot<00:04:13.739> easier<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:14.069> scratch<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.989> so

cases that haven't scratched up and the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.050 
cases that haven't scratched up and the
reason<00:05:09.130> is<00:05:09.250> doing<00:05:09.400> this<00:05:09.490> because<00:05:09.669> of<00:05:09.970> this

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
reason is doing this because of this

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.030

edge right here one of this edge on this

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.340 
edge right here one of this edge on this
side<00:05:12.220> is<00:05:12.400> real<00:05:12.580> sharp<00:05:12.910> so<00:05:13.840> as<00:05:13.960> you're<00:05:14.110> slightly

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
back iphone probably didn't be able to

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.270 
back iphone probably didn't be able to
notice<00:06:42.729> it<00:06:42.880> but<00:06:43.750> I<00:06:43.810> can<00:06:44.020> definitely

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
for the discretion of the back and maybe

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.499 
for the discretion of the back and maybe
a<00:06:57.039> little<00:06:57.130> bit<00:06:57.340> of<00:06:57.430> the<00:06:57.669> gap<00:06:58.090> between<00:06:58.240> the

00:06:58.499 --> 00:06:58.509 
a little bit of the gap between the

think it's an awesome case i love the

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.450 
think it's an awesome case i love the
fact<00:07:02.229> that<00:07:02.500> it<00:07:02.680> is<00:07:02.740> protected<00:07:02.979> with<00:07:03.310> the

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
plastic it's probably a little bit maybe

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.930
