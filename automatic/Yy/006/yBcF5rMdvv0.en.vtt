fingers on the sticks and you push the

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.030 
fingers on the sticks and you push the
stick<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:31.519> you're<00:03:31.700> pushing<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.329> that<00:03:32.600> I

stick so you're pushing it like that I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.380 
stick so you're pushing it like that I
think<00:03:34.040> that's<00:03:34.370> how<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.579> yet<00:03:34.790> like<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:35.329> you

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
think that's how it yet like this so you

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.259 
think that's how it yet like this so you
hold<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.690> here<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.380> push<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.739> sticks<00:03:37.269> that's

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
hold it here and push the sticks that's

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.550 
hold it here and push the sticks that's
the<00:03:38.420> easiest<00:03:38.690> way<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.930> do<00:03:39.110> that's<00:03:39.230> how<00:03:39.350> I<00:03:39.380> did

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
the easiest way to do that's how I did

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.729 
the easiest way to do that's how I did
it<00:03:39.650> last<00:03:39.680> time<00:03:40.120> all<00:03:41.120> right<00:03:41.239> now<00:03:42.079> try<00:03:42.140> not<00:03:42.620> to

it last time all right now try not to
touch<00:03:42.890> this<00:03:43.130> because<00:03:43.459> if<00:03:43.579> you<00:03:43.670> touch<00:03:43.850> these

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
touch this because if you touch these

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.759 
touch this because if you touch these
sticks<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.630> put<00:03:44.750> this<00:03:44.840> upside<00:03:45.200> down<00:03:45.350> all<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
sticks and put this upside down all the

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.110 
sticks and put this upside down all the
buttons<00:03:46.069> will<00:03:46.190> fall<00:03:46.400> out<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:46.760> might<00:03:46.910> lose

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
want to add in the new sticks like so

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.009 
want to add in the new sticks like so
make<00:04:13.670> sure<00:04:13.700> see<00:04:14.090> there's<00:04:14.239> like<00:04:14.359> four<00:04:14.599> dots<00:04:14.840> on

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
make sure see there's like four dots on

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.800 
make sure see there's like four dots on
it<00:04:15.049> make<00:04:15.319> sure<00:04:15.349> arm<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:17.120> dots<00:04:17.389> are<00:04:17.630> like

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
it make sure arm the dots are like

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.349 
it make sure arm the dots are like
facing<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.530> correct<00:04:18.859> way<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.850> dot<00:04:20.090> one

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
facing the correct way so the dot one

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.890 
facing the correct way so the dot one
dot<00:04:20.389> should<00:04:20.750> be<00:04:20.840> facing<00:04:21.130> like<00:04:22.690> forward<00:04:23.690> one

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
dot should be facing like forward one

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.300 
dot should be facing like forward one
should<00:04:24.199> be<00:04:24.289> facing<00:04:24.560> left<00:04:24.889> and<00:04:25.099> right<00:04:25.360> okay<00:04:26.360> so

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
should be facing left and right okay so

put them back on first you just want to
put<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.510> vibrations<00:05:12.139> in<00:05:12.320> and<00:05:12.560> to<00:05:13.130> put<00:05:13.280> the

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
put the vibrations in and to put the

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.159 
put the vibrations in and to put the
vibrations<00:05:13.970> in<00:05:14.180> i'll<00:05:14.389> put<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.750> rubbers<00:05:15.020> back

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
vibrations in i'll put the rubbers back

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.170 
vibrations in i'll put the rubbers back
on<00:05:15.349> later<00:05:15.949> yeah<00:05:18.699> it's<00:05:19.699> going<00:05:19.789> to<00:05:19.880> be<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:20.030> way

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
your so try not to touch the sticks and

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.300 
your so try not to touch the sticks and
the<00:05:23.510> rubbers<00:05:23.870> because<00:05:24.199> it<00:05:24.349> like<00:05:24.889> really<00:05:25.039> hard

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
the rubbers because it like really hard

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.100 
the rubbers because it like really hard
to<00:05:25.460> put<00:05:25.610> back<00:05:25.789> on<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.180> it<00:05:26.720> really<00:05:26.960> gets

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
to put back on and it really gets

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:35.170 
to put back on and it really gets
complicated<00:05:28.090> all<00:05:29.090> right<00:05:32.800> now<00:05:33.849> you<00:05:34.849> just<00:05:35.030> want

just wait a second i want to put the

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.010 
just wait a second i want to put the
vibrations<00:05:43.400> in<00:05:43.550> here<00:05:43.760> alright<00:05:44.330> so<00:05:44.810> now<00:05:44.960> you

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
vibrations in here alright so now you

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.020 
vibrations in here alright so now you
just<00:05:45.260> put<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.620> vibrations<00:05:46.130> in<00:05:46.250> you<00:05:46.490> simply

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
just put the vibrations in you simply

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.890 
just put the vibrations in you simply
just<00:05:47.060> put<00:05:47.750> inside<00:05:47.990> this<00:05:48.139> slots<00:05:48.500> here<00:05:49.810> so<00:05:50.810> you

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
just put inside this slots here so you

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.999 
just put inside this slots here so you
can<00:05:51.050> do<00:05:51.139> the<00:05:51.229> other<00:05:51.349> one<00:05:52.300> all<00:05:53.300> right<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:54.860> they

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
can do the other one all right and they

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.770 
can do the other one all right and they
shouldn't<00:05:55.340> be<00:05:55.400> moving<00:05:55.880> a<00:05:56.150> lot<00:05:56.360> when<00:05:56.509> you<00:05:56.599> put

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
shouldn't be moving a lot when you put

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.769 
shouldn't be moving a lot when you put
them<00:05:56.870> in<00:05:56.960> then<00:05:57.590> you<00:05:57.740> put<00:05:57.919> some<00:05:58.630> this<00:05:59.630> party<00:06:00.080> are

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
them in then you put some this party are

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:02.920 
them in then you put some this party are
like

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
like

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:09.640 
like
so<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:04.990> turn<00:06:05.990> around<00:06:06.130> is<00:06:07.130> there<00:06:07.310> then<00:06:07.750> no<00:06:08.750> sugar

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
so I turn around is there then no sugar

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.610 
so I turn around is there then no sugar
all<00:06:10.520> right<00:06:12.520> okay<00:06:13.520> so<00:06:13.940> should<00:06:14.180> go<00:06:14.780> out<00:06:15.050> of<00:06:15.169> make

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
all right okay so should go out of make

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.719 
all right okay so should go out of make
sure<00:06:15.800> when<00:06:15.919> you<00:06:16.009> turn<00:06:16.190> it<00:06:16.220> over<00:06:16.430> you're

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
sure when you turn it over you're

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.430 
sure when you turn it over you're
holding<00:06:17.060> it<00:06:17.180> should<00:06:17.960> look<00:06:18.050> something<00:06:18.110> like

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
holding it should look something like

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.240 
holding it should look something like
that<00:06:19.509> okay<00:06:20.509> and<00:06:21.259> now<00:06:21.380> the<00:06:21.440> vibrations<00:06:22.039> just

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
that okay and now the vibrations just

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.370 
that okay and now the vibrations just
can't<00:06:22.430> are<00:06:22.550> not<00:06:22.729> okay<00:06:23.979> now<00:06:24.979> to<00:06:25.039> put<00:06:25.280> it<00:06:25.400> back<00:06:25.520> on

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
can't are not okay now to put it back on

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.719 
can't are not okay now to put it back on
you<00:06:27.380> actually<00:06:27.560> got<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:27.919> watch<00:06:28.039> the<00:06:28.190> springs<00:06:28.550> if

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
you actually got to watch the springs if

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.219 
you actually got to watch the springs if
you<00:06:28.820> put<00:06:29.030> it<00:06:29.120> on<00:06:29.180> you<00:06:29.300> could<00:06:29.449> squash<00:06:30.080> the

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
you put it on you could squash the

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.890 
you put it on you could squash the
springs<00:06:30.560> you<00:06:31.460> want<00:06:31.610> to<00:06:31.699> push<00:06:31.910> the<00:06:31.940> way<00:06:32.870> I

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
springs you want to push the way I

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.659 
springs you want to push the way I
better<00:06:33.080> put<00:06:33.229> it<00:06:33.289> this<00:06:33.380> way<00:06:33.590> you<00:06:34.370> should<00:06:34.400> make

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
better put it this way you should make
