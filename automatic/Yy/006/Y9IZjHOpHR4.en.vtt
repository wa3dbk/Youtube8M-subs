 hello, modest Flavors from the kitchen armful loves 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.800
 in this section we have a beautiful sherbet sweet recipe 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.200
 We will learn the construction of "Semolina Finger Dessert" 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.200
 But let's take a look at the list of materials before you want 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.480
 half a pack of margarine 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.800
 1 teacup of oil 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.960
 2 eggs 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.760
 half cup powdered sugar 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.520
 1 packet of vanilla 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.000
 1 packet of baking powder 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.520
 and as much flour as possible 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.080
 For the above; 1 cup semolina 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.840
 for sherbet; 3 cup powdered sugar 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 3 cups of water 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.280
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.000
 yes we know the necessary materials, we can knead dough 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.800
 Now we have margarine which we keep at room temperature ... 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 half a cup of powdered sugar ... 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.840
 Our 2 eggs ... 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.120
 now we're starting to mix it with your fingertips just to get some sugar 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 now we add our oil 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 let's mix some more 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.920
 and adding flour 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.720
 baking soda on flour 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.440
 and vanilla 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.320
 and continue to add flour until you collect 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 Now we're okay. 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.480
 We said we have 1 glass of water 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.480
 leaving on a flat plate 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.880
 from the dough we take as many pieces of walnut as usual 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.880
 before we roll 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.520
 then we are making this way to give the finger shape 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.240
 and roll in 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.920
 we don't grease and leave paper to the baking tray 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.200
 we made our last finger 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.440
 In the meantime, our oven is heated to 190 degrees, we now give the oven 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
 we gave the dessert to the oven 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
 We prepare the sherbet now 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.680
 warm sweet, warm sherbet 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.240
 Add 3 cups of water and 3 cups of powdered sugar into a saucepan 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.240

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.120
 our sugar melted began to boil 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.120
 at this stage we add lemon juice 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.120
 We are boiling for 10 minutes this way 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.760
 irmili 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.040
 and we waited for half an hour, in a warm state 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 Our sifters are likewise warm 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.000
