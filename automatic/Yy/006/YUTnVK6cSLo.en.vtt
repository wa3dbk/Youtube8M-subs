00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.230

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.450
 good sport for me more toys 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.900

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.440
 as the one who is not called as such 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.290
 an idol of Chilean football as of 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.540

 that the stadium is full like there 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.320
 more than a football game I think that 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.700
 this is a humanitarian issue 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.860
 solidary 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.710
 sometimes we are making jokes but 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.210
 the life of a person is at stake 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.670
 extended the invitation to journalists 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.820
 they have a very important part in this 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.190
 so that tomorrow that Thursday there 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.890
 let's have full stadium 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:37.340

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.340
 recovery resolved and that remains 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.220
 the idol of all those who a 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.190
 Roberto, I say 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.110
 why 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.350
 I do not know if to say of success but the positive 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.420
 that I was in the coach career 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.030
 I lived with him one of the experiences 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.670
 most impactful that a 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.350
 professional with obtaining the title 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.390
 of colo colo the year 86 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.920
 and I until that moment that had been a 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.620
 active player for a long time never 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.140
 there was an archer cuts like back by 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.840
 red round in that championship and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.650
 later in a liberating cup 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.360
 in two games that were played in Brazil 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.060
 One with San Paulo and another with Guaraní 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.580
 for my draw at 0 and the last san paolo 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.350
 game to one of de colo colo but what 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.080
 Roberto did there I did not see him again 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.640
 in none any way we're 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.590
 that's why we're so happy because 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.280
 we are facing one of the most archers 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.230
 great history of Chilean soccer 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.260
 technically a gifted 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.230
 what follows one of you from your 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.709
 colleagues, you sent me one thing 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.720
 with the internet now and once I can 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.030
 make three goals the pride to the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.420
 made three goals playing the by aviation 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.900
 I was very young and I was playing with the voice 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.020
 but only anecdotes that I tell you master of 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.890
 love 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.780
 to cheer up a bit of doing it positive 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.550
 after this the historical one thanked the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.320
 people and the whole organization while 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.660
 his relatives watched excitedly 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.150
 One side I think the main thing 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.770
 a person has you can have all 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.889
 the things of the world because he has no health 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.659
 these and complicated 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.470
 independent any situation 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.350
 personal 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.610
 professional that one may have lived 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.610
 difficult or title 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.000

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.970
 he has his time there was time 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.090
 from crying with joy there was time to 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.080
 cry of sadness but the important thing is 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.180
 know how to get up 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.009

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.009
 by the independent fire any 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.550

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.750

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.860
 things things the rest of your day you 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.969
