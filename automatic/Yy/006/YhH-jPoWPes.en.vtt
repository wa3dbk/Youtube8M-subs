the food source so take a look and see

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.809 
the food source so take a look and see
what<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.239> think<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:47.739> starting<00:00:48.039> by<00:00:48.249> zesting

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
what you think I'm starting by zesting

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.020 
what you think I'm starting by zesting
this<00:00:49.120> lemon<00:00:49.920> i'm<00:00:50.920> using<00:00:51.249> this<00:00:51.339> micro<00:00:51.789> plane

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
this lemon i'm using this micro plane

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.239 
this lemon i'm using this micro plane
here<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:53.469> i<00:00:53.499> don't<00:00:53.679> think<00:00:53.859> you<00:00:53.920> need<00:00:54.039> to<00:00:54.100> use

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
here but i don't think you need to use

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:55.649 
here but i don't think you need to use
one<00:00:54.459> of<00:00:54.489> these<00:00:54.639> you<00:00:54.850> don't<00:00:54.969> need<00:00:55.059> to<00:00:55.120> be<00:00:55.269> too

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
one of these you don't need to be too

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.849 
one of these you don't need to be too
exact<00:00:56.229> with<00:00:56.499> it<00:00:56.649> but<00:00:56.859> the<00:00:56.979> idea<00:00:57.370> is<00:00:57.459> to<00:00:57.579> get<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
exact with it but the idea is to get the

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.619 
exact with it but the idea is to get the
topmost<00:01:00.339> layer<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.940> lemon<00:01:01.359> where<00:01:01.510> the

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
topmost layer of lemon where the

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.890 
topmost layer of lemon where the
essential<00:01:02.139> oils<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.789> peeler<00:01:04.210> located<00:01:04.750> and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
essential oils of the peeler located and

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.810 
essential oils of the peeler located and
where<00:01:05.019> it's<00:01:05.140> not<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:05.619> wet<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.130> will<00:01:06.549> cause

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
where it's not so wet that will cause

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.310 
where it's not so wet that will cause
the<00:01:07.530> sugar<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:10.210> clump<00:01:10.450> up<00:01:10.630> when<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.900> put<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.200> in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
the sugar to clump up when you put it in

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.070 
the sugar to clump up when you put it in
the<00:01:11.470> blender<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.920> mix<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.240> it's<00:01:13.390> also<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.810> very

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
the blender to mix and it's also a very

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.120 
the blender to mix and it's also a very
strong<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:15.190> long-lasting<00:01:15.760> sent<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.920> won't

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
strong and long-lasting sent so it won't

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.550 
strong and long-lasting sent so it won't
evaporate<00:01:18.370> like<00:01:19.120> Oran<00:01:19.570> or<00:01:19.720> like<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.200> juice<00:01:20.410> of

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
evaporate like Oran or like the juice of
