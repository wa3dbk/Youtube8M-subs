well<00:00:14.070> together<00:00:14.250> I've<00:00:14.490> been<00:00:14.610> using<00:00:14.759> it

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
well together I've been using it

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.060 
well together I've been using it
together<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:16.520> first<00:00:17.520> off<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.210> dome<00:00:18.449> shape

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
together and first off it's a dome shape

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.710 
together and first off it's a dome shape
which<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.220> great<00:00:20.400> because<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.029> use<00:00:21.300> your

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
which is great because when you use your

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.750 
which is great because when you use your
powders<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:22.980> flat<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.550> start

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
powders if it's flat then you start

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.400 
powders if it's flat then you start
dipping<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> middle<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.750> start<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
dipping in the middle and you start to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.529 
dipping in the middle and you start to
see<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> pan<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> bottom<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
see the pan at the bottom but if it's a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.060 
see the pan at the bottom but if it's a
dome<00:00:27.810> shape<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.199> kind<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.439> dip<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> middle

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
dome shape you kind of dip in the middle

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.189 
dome shape you kind of dip in the middle
and<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.250> kind<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.460> work<00:00:29.550> your<00:00:29.609> way<00:00:29.820> down<00:00:30.199> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
and you kind of work your way down so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.750 
and you kind of work your way down so
it's<00:00:31.349> great<00:00:31.560> that's<00:00:31.710> Campinas<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.899> also<00:00:33.899> I

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
it's great that's Campinas and also I

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.340 
it's great that's Campinas and also I
don't<00:00:35.760> use<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> regular<00:00:36.420> powder<00:00:36.930> brush<00:00:37.170> with

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
don't use a regular powder brush with

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.900 
don't use a regular powder brush with
this<00:00:37.469> because<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.190> tend<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.489> get<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> lot<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
this because I tend to get a lot of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.760 
this because I tend to get a lot of
Fallout<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> sides<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.200> feel<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.680> I'm

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770
