00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
fingers and messing it up a bit now step

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.600 
fingers and messing it up a bit now step
number<00:01:36.720> three<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.530> braids<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.400> going

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
number three is the braids so I'm going

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.460 
number three is the braids so I'm going
to<00:01:38.700> take<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> small<00:01:39.270> section<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> left<00:01:40.259> side

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to take a small section on the left side

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.469 
to take a small section on the left side
underneath<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.340> bump<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.329> just

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
underneath the bump and then I'm just

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.149 
underneath the bump and then I'm just
going<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> take<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.290> regular<00:01:43.740> braid<00:01:43.979> this

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
going to take it and regular braid this

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.440 
going to take it and regular braid this
section<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> way<00:01:45.000> down

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
section all the way down

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.270 
section all the way down
once<00:01:46.020> you've<00:01:46.170> rated<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> whole<00:01:46.710> thing<00:01:46.979> you're

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
once you've rated the whole thing you're

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
once you've rated the whole thing you're
going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> take<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.030> wrap<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.509> around<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.930> back

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
going to take it wrap it around the back

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.200 
going to take it wrap it around the back
and<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:50.070> we're<00:01:50.250> gonna<00:01:50.369> wrap<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.670> actually

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and then we're gonna wrap it actually

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.120 
and then we're gonna wrap it actually
underneath<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:52.079> twists<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.710> use<00:01:52.920> to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
underneath the twists that we use to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
underneath the twists that we use to
create<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.579> bump<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.240> everything<00:01:54.689> looks<00:01:54.840> like

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
create the bump so everything looks like

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.400 
create the bump so everything looks like
it's<00:01:55.200> wrapping<00:01:55.649> into<00:01:55.829> each<00:01:56.070> other

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.170

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
now I'm going to take a section that's

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.730 
now I'm going to take a section that's
right<00:02:01.540> above<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.930> braid<00:02:02.290> that<00:02:02.410> we<00:02:02.560> just

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
right above the braid that we just

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.740 
right above the braid that we just
created<00:02:03.160> and<00:02:03.670> I'm<00:02:03.790> just<00:02:04.000> gonna<00:02:04.120> do<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.390> normal

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
created and I'm just gonna do a normal

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.570 
created and I'm just gonna do a normal
French<00:02:05.230> braid<00:02:05.500> so<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:05.950> want<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.190> separate<00:02:06.520> it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
French braid so you want to separate it

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.940 
French braid so you want to separate it
into<00:02:06.850> three<00:02:07.060> separate<00:02:07.900> strands<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.530> then<00:02:08.740> add

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
into three separate strands and then add

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.670 
into three separate strands and then add
hair<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.310> both<00:02:09.700> sides<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.420> we're<00:02:11.290> going<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.530> be

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
hair to both sides and we're going to be

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.350 
hair to both sides and we're going to be
directing<00:02:12.130> this<00:02:12.250> French<00:02:12.520> braid<00:02:12.790> towards<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
sections and just do a regular braid all

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.650 
sections and just do a regular braid all
the<00:02:50.380> way<00:02:50.560> down<00:02:50.820> part<00:02:51.820> of<00:02:51.880> this<00:02:52.000> hairstyle<00:02:52.270> that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
the way down part of this hairstyle that

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.970 
the way down part of this hairstyle that
I<00:02:52.720> really<00:02:53.020> really<00:02:53.290> like<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.710> that<00:02:53.740> it's

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
I really really like is that it's

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.680 
I really really like is that it's
asymmetrical<00:02:54.820> giving<00:02:55.210> it<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:55.510> bohemian

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
asymmetrical giving it that bohemian

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
feel so once that braid is done I'm

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.480 
feel so once that braid is done I'm
going<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.690> bring<00:02:59.020> it<00:02:59.140> back<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.560> actually<00:03:00.220> put

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
going to bring it back and actually put

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.550 
going to bring it back and actually put
it<00:03:00.520> across<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.420> twists<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.080> created

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
it across the twists that we created

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.040 
it across the twists that we created
just<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.100> tie<00:03:03.400> everything<00:03:03.640> together<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.540> this

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
just to tie everything together and this

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.840 
just to tie everything together and this
is<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.380> finished<00:03:05.860> result<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.400> look<00:03:06.640> number

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850
