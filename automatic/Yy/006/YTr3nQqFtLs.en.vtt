on a grand scale the philosophy of these

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.199 
on a grand scale the philosophy of these
kinds<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.260> games<00:03:31.319> differs<00:03:32.280> between<00:03:32.489> command

TA<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.390> see<00:03:36.570> planetary<00:03:37.019> annihilation<00:03:37.230> is

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
TA and I see planetary annihilation is

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.199 
TA and I see planetary annihilation is
basically<00:03:38.190> being<00:03:38.400> kind<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.790> more<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
basically being kind of more the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.449 
basically being kind of more the
spiritual<00:03:40.019> successor<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.070> total

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
spiritual successor to the to the total

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.979 
spiritual successor to the to the total
annihilation<00:03:41.579> kind<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.329> side<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.840> things

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
annihilation kind of side of things

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.410 
annihilation kind of side of things

whenever I mention that game to anybody

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.360 
whenever I mention that game to anybody
they're<00:03:45.840> like<00:03:46.079> yorktown<00:03:46.950> total<00:03:47.220> annihilation

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
they're like yorktown total annihilation

worked<00:05:04.130> on<00:05:04.190> RTS<00:05:04.490> games<00:05:04.790> in<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.000> past<00:05:05.210> we<00:05:05.720> also

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
worked on RTS games in the past we also

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.840 
worked on RTS games in the past we also
have<00:05:05.990> a<00:05:06.050> coffee<00:05:06.260> machine<00:05:06.410> on<00:05:07.040> coffee<00:05:07.430> machines

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
have a coffee machine on coffee machines

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.520 
have a coffee machine on coffee machines
that<00:05:08.090> helps<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.450> really<00:05:08.810> good<00:05:08.960> coffee<00:05:09.110> machine

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
that helps a really good coffee machine

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.450 
that helps a really good coffee machine
actually

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
actually

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.870 
actually
I<00:05:12.139> think<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.259> best<00:05:13.560> beer<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.699> go<00:05:14.850> with

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
I think the best beer to go with

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.320 
I think the best beer to go with
planetary<00:05:15.539> annihilation<00:05:15.840> is<00:05:16.590> an<00:05:17.160> IPA<00:05:17.520> maybe

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
planetary annihilation is an IPA maybe

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.779 
planetary annihilation is an IPA maybe
even<00:05:18.509> an<00:05:18.660> imperial<00:05:19.169> IPA<00:05:19.470> something<00:05:20.400> strong

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
even an imperial IPA something strong

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.640 
even an imperial IPA something strong
and<00:05:20.819> hoppy<00:05:21.210> as<00:05:21.569> you<00:05:21.810> watch<00:05:21.990> your<00:05:22.169> planet<00:05:22.470> burn

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
and hoppy as you watch your planet burn

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.230 
and hoppy as you watch your planet burn
the<00:05:23.039> feature<00:05:23.310> I'm<00:05:23.460> most<00:05:23.610> excited<00:05:23.699> about<00:05:24.000> is

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
the feature I'm most excited about is

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.029 
the feature I'm most excited about is
pretty<00:05:24.449> simple<00:05:24.690> it's<00:05:24.930> annihilating<00:05:25.800> planets

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
pretty simple it's annihilating planets

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.600 
pretty simple it's annihilating planets
hence<00:05:29.039> the<00:05:29.310> name<00:05:29.460> planetary<00:05:30.419> and<00:05:30.720> inhalation

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
hence the name planetary and inhalation

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.950 
hence the name planetary and inhalation
yeah<00:05:32.610> I<00:05:32.639> thought<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.120> say<00:05:33.300> is<00:05:33.360> annihilating

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
yeah I thought to say is annihilating

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.320 
yeah I thought to say is annihilating
planets<00:05:34.349> you<00:05:35.280> think<00:05:35.460> that's<00:05:35.610> your<00:05:35.759> the<00:05:36.150> best

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
planets you think that's your the best

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.689 
planets you think that's your the best
feature<00:05:36.569> night<00:05:37.050> can<00:05:37.470> I<00:05:37.530> use<00:05:37.560> that<00:05:37.860> one<00:05:38.009> can<00:05:38.610> you

real sexy project from a publisher's

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.790

point<00:05:54.539> of<00:05:54.630> view<00:05:54.780> this<00:05:55.080> is<00:05:55.199> not<00:05:55.380> something<00:05:55.650> that
