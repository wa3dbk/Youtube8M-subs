00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 so how to break into that one thinks to 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.770
 school I skipped somewhere after already 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.389
 Well then that I will live I get knowledge 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.639
 who give nothing at all i mean i 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.219
 I do not know knowledge is about to from 1 to 5 class 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.890
 in my opinion they were a hundred times more useful than 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.529
 knowledge from grade 5 to grade 11 because you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.740
 you learn biology you start to teach this 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.439
 biology and those start telling pestle 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.609
 and stamen how does it happen there 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.980
 I do n’t know birds and cows 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.110
 everything else is very important without 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.960
 this cannot be lived on biology for only 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.840
 I'll give you how to do it like 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.520
 how do you just find a woman i do 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.530
 her so that she just sighed and gasped 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 it will not tell you because it is 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.590
 unethical 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.329
 it is not recognized by our state need 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.700
 just some kind of nonsense that anyone ever 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.800
 not needed on this dialogue result then 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.390
 have you just slaughtered on these items 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.280
 I scored I'm honestly pleased because 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.870
 what I saved something to say did not play 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.780
 dota and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.309
 well came came to the success of someone than and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.320
 and pistils and stamens that is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.979
 look like any healthy person 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.090
 but these you tell you biology 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.520
 about a man and a woman 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 happiness of this I received this knowledge from well 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.850
 there due to what i was looking for by 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.820
 the fact that he talked with people who are there 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.579
 300 3 children 4 children there is not the point 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.250
 important 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.270
 Gleb went to a fight to tell you about 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.229
 man woman 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.719
 you are and the woman you do it and 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.820
 you have these 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.670
 you have children appear you appear 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.729
 happy and satisfied and the children are the most 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.549
 important and happy and satisfied children in 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.990
 including mom and dad is the key to success 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.780
 strong state 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.899
 that is, how does it work if the husband goes 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 to work happy in the morning and he 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.119
 naturally will be glad that is him 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.399
 there will be a male energy then all 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.789
 ok if there bouche you to read 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.890
 my wife is not in the mood to interfere with work 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.409
 then dodik than superior spent to 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.659
 the fact that America is releasing an apple 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.459
 Japan produces a Toyota and we that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.799
 We release nothing because of our principle 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.150
 Well, with this so-so spline new in terms of 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.060
 intelligent over someone else doesn’t matter 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.890
 then woman woman mood she 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.019
 makes 10 more times more than men 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.400
 that is, there are actually a lot of hidden 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.140
 talents that is, it can be delicious 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.630
 cook she already cook so what 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.480
 a man will go home and not some 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.310
 mistresses because homemade food is so 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.630
 here everyone knows yes there grandparents it 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.739
 the most delicious thing at all is 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.200
 woman at home sti 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.450
 Well , as many housewives but we 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.250
 These, they, too, on biology there is no well 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.350
 let's say though it is necessary but 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.720
 just why is this parallel if you have 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.319
 pretty child and he studies well he 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.600
 comes into school he begins to study science 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.609
 becomes talented and basically everything 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.160
 can not happen to the fact that it is not the ruble 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.130
 worth not one buck will cost 50 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.269
 rubles 1 ruble will cost 50 bucks for 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.700
 why can this happen 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.209
 if we start to miss such here 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.190
 phones some cool internet 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.959
 if we do there and what is there in 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.910
 Europe does generally tell 7 weights 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.950
 super washing machines from you drive through 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.540
 foliage that is here if we take off and 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.239
 everyone will be happy and happy with them 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.030
 everything will be fine but instead we 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.480
 open biology textbooks that we are there 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.380
 see i don't know i believe that dna is there 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.930
 a rip case 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.310
 this is ribo-nucleic acid 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.400
 which is performed by you on the basis of 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.160
 complementarity all dumbfounded I dreamed 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.290
 this knowledge get your life 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.570
 he learned his time what we have there with 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.700
 the teacher had a hard grater and in half an hour 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.010
 that she understood me that actions 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.770
 the type i wear i won't teach it i better 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.750
 better I'd stay for the second year or 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.240
 I will cure it from school I will not end 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.010
 she said don't ask here just come on 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.100
 so you make it a useful thing there 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.380
 you can’t write a presentation 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.450
 put there from the reticulum and no longer 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.700
 will be hand in hand what have i become what is Putin 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.010
 bullshit olya dna it's here behind the inside 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.980
 acid there pistil and stamen lyalyal i 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.130
 just started doing a presentation for those 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.290
 people who write these things here 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.510
 in this case, wrote something about the soil in 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.240
 I ended up there and the tables are all 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.950
 the rest of the teacher was natural 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.080
 pretty it was just unreal 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.660
 happy because I kind of helped her 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.060
 take prizes on well on these here 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.160
 olympiads that were there for not 2 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.050
 occupied and they were pleased and I was pleased 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.910
 because I did not delirium that to me 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.010
 in life is not to in life, I just come in handy 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.380
 did the president but I just helped 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.510
 make a presentation and then did 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.220
 the presentation already had skills like 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.500
 I do the following presentation 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.020
 understood how to make tables if not that 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.190
 I need to touch the shovel 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.740
 write so as to negotiate with people 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.360
 here and then after there the enemy worked like that 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.630
 and at the end like this I was at school in 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.150
 last days I just sat and 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.860
 well i just sat and finishes it useful 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.590
 thing for educators and this is ten times 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.970
 professions than you will learn things 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.430
 who you do not like they jump in school 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.900
 alge how with traction helpful if that 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.850
 could this one of the most useful 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.190
 items until you leave there 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.960
 some cosine sine duck to leave 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.060
 it's all algebra it is like in life 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.520
 Few where applicable but before that I do not know 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.669
 easy about algebra like you believed 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.010
 one formula saw the second formula 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.080
 saw the fifth tenth formula if you're there 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.940
 I do not know just do 5 problems all 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.650
 you automatically decide everything but at least 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.800
 rouge decided with a gun I will allow 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.780
 I passed the exam in the Urals and from such 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.960
 items where there is no formula where just 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.500
 there is a shorter kind of literature there 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.390
 there are 15 books and there are 25 books you need 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.700
 all read them find there hidden 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.440
 meanings so further tell there what 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.610
 happened in every moment I once 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.590
 looked talking 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.639
 yes this is for you guys life is very 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.469
 I wish you success so much 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.969
 plan let's go back to the game and see 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.990
 here generally happens while on 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.189
 international 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.990
 we don't have yes I helped the teacher squall me 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.580
 pulled and believe me then we were 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:07.189
 on the same wavelength, she herself did not expect that 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.360
 so you can easily make everything agree 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:10.250
 need to negotiate by the way if you 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.039
 learn to negotiate early 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.810
 childhood you believe contract skill 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.430
 contract 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.659
 diplomat contracts he gave us always 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.659
 useful at all in any case
