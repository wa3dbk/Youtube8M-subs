 for everyone how are awards 1 video my 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.099
 name is ling zhang and I will teach you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.160
 how to perfectly call with calista 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.440
 with just one key because with 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.660
 calista is because calista works 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.449
 different from the others, sometimes it's because of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.760
 passion now this key that I'm going to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.439
 teaching not only appropriates its passive but 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.420
 we will also move to the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.099
 where you choose with the mouse and is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.840
 only one key 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.600
 well here we are already in the game and 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.490
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.340
 select the key with which we want 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.950
 hack let's squeeze escape we're going 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.050
 where it says quick access let's go down 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.320
 a little bit and where movement says 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.690
 player we select motion click 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.340
 with the player's attack and together 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.500
 we select the key with which 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.330
 we want to change in my case the son the 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.490
 because it's the one I 'm comfortable with 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.520
 with and now the only thing I have to do 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.290
 is to put my finger on the key and the mouse 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.530
 where I want to move next and 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.020
 a- squeeze to nothing without the right click 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.910
 without left click simply the key 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.860
 so or attack what is closest and 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.240
 then I move to where I want to 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.860
 example here here and I have backward no 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.140
 there is no problem left to right 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.800
 I move from the last organ there is no 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.610
 problem and then backwards it's forward 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.610
 there is no problem 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.250
 and all that was literally only with the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.159
 key without right click without clicking 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.409
 left without nothing just the key and the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.720
 mouse where I want to move then 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.079
 what it will do is that with the key goes 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.850
 to attack what is closer and will 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.299
 move where the mouse is next 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.299
 to attack 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.030
 here another example just attack 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.220
 depleted and I'm out I can not remember 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.560
 that in killed and I move even with my 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.400
 hand back I move skills 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.890
 and when I want to sula in Tripoli and 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.530
 attacked I move up with my hand and this 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.670
 only with the key nothing else then only with 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.670
 a key nothing more 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.690
 only with a key with the key and 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.230
 putting hands where I want 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.190
 move after attacking and well that
