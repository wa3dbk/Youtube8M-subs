wall with a gap underneath it's and

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.820 
wall with a gap underneath it's and
maybe<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.150> just<00:00:09.750> need<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.050> shove<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.530> red

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
maybe I just need to shove this red

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.320 
maybe I just need to shove this red
block<00:00:11.070> through<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.849> hole

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
block through that hole

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.270 
block through that hole
now<00:00:12.780> can<00:00:12.960> i<00:00:13.019> push<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.259> from<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.650> side<00:00:13.860> no<00:00:14.099> it

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
now can i push it from this side no it

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.310 
now can i push it from this side no it
appears<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.820> can't<00:00:15.120> can<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.750> pressure<00:00:15.990> from<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
appears I can't can I pressure from the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.620 
appears I can't can I pressure from the
other<00:00:16.440> side<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:17.460> looks<00:00:17.640> like<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.180> only<00:00:18.300> push

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
other side it looks like I can only push

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.320 
other side it looks like I can only push
it<00:00:18.750> along<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.109> axis<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:20.279> almost<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:20.760> you

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
it along this axis it's almost as if you

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210 
it along this axis it's almost as if you
can<00:00:21.570> customize<00:00:22.170> which<00:00:22.439> direction<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.189> want

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
can customize which direction you want

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.630 
can customize which direction you want
to<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.519> able<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.820> push<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.060> blocks<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:25.640> just

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
to be able to push the blocks in just

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.150 
to be able to push the blocks in just
get<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.420> right<00:00:28.019> what's<00:00:28.380> next<00:00:28.859> well<00:00:29.039> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
get up there right what's next well it

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.890 
get up there right what's next well it
appears<00:00:29.369> there's<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.789> red<00:00:30.029> block<00:00:30.330> there<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
appears there's a red block there but I

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.389 
appears there's a red block there but I
can't<00:00:31.260> push<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.590> from<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.980> side<00:00:32.189> because

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
can't push it from that side because

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.729 
can't push it from that side because
there's<00:00:32.730> no<00:00:32.850> block<00:00:33.090> down<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:33.540> maybe<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.559> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
there's no block down there maybe if I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.680 
there's no block down there maybe if I
jump<00:00:35.070> over<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.820> stand<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.420> block

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
jump over here I can stand in this block

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.619 
jump over here I can stand in this block
and<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.350> push<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.770> from<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:38.219> yes<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:39.000> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
and just push it from here yes I can and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.270 
and just push it from here yes I can and
would<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.960> look<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.800> even<00:00:41.040> push

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
would you look at that I can even push

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.670 
would you look at that I can even push
it<00:00:41.430> while<00:00:41.610> running<00:00:41.940> what<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> robust<00:00:43.260> system

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
it while running what a robust system

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.119 
it while running what a robust system
and<00:00:44.390> on<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.629> next<00:00:46.020> puzzle<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:46.980> we

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and on to the next puzzle so here we

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.369 
and on to the next puzzle so here we
have<00:00:47.399> another<00:00:47.550> red<00:00:48.030> block<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.539> another<00:00:49.050> hole

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
have another red block and another hole

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.990 
have another red block and another hole
in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.649> wall<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:49.860> obviously<00:00:50.520> I'm<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.670> gonna

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
in the wall so obviously I'm just gonna

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.110 
in the wall so obviously I'm just gonna
jump<00:00:51.629> over<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.230> push<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.430> hang<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
jump over here push that I hang on I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.910 
jump over here push that I hang on I
won't<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.840> able<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> jump<00:00:55.320> over<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.680> two

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
won't be able to jump over that two

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.520 
won't be able to jump over that two
block<00:00:56.160> gap<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.610> push<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> red<00:00:57.360> block<00:00:57.690> how<00:00:58.440> am

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530

block gap and push the red block how am
I<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> make<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.010> bit<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> floor<00:00:59.670> there<00:00:59.969> I

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
I going to make a bit of floor there I

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.180 
I going to make a bit of floor there I
could<00:01:00.719> use<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> blue<00:01:01.289> block<00:01:01.620> I'm<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.070> going

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
could use that blue block I'm just going

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.399 
could use that blue block I'm just going
to<00:01:02.280> jump<00:01:02.520> over<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> ninja<00:01:03.600> shove

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
to jump over here like a ninja shove

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.920 
to jump over here like a ninja shove
that<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> way<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.360> back<00:01:06.540> over

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930

that in the way and then get back over
onto<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.409> block<00:01:07.820> looks<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.330> use

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
onto that block looks like I can use

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.630 
onto that block looks like I can use
multiple<00:01:09.780> blocks<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.590> create<00:01:10.770> parkour

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640

I've<00:01:36.990> got<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> command<00:01:37.710> block<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.100> this

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I've got a command block for this

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.370 
I've got a command block for this
command<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.659> see<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.229> an

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
command in it and as you can see it's an

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.130 
command in it and as you can see it's an
execute<00:01:40.950> detective<00:01:41.610> command<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.810> means

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
execute detective command this means

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.560 
execute detective command this means
that<00:01:43.320> all<00:01:43.710> players<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.579> server<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.270> at

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that all players in a server it will at

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
that all players in a server it will at
their<00:01:45.810> exact<00:01:46.140> location<00:01:46.710> from<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.220> following

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
their exact location from the following

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.270 
their exact location from the following
command<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.869> doing<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.320> searching

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
command so what it's doing is searching

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.510 
command so what it's doing is searching
for<00:01:50.579> wool<00:01:51.270> 11<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.229> blue<00:01:52.470> wall<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
for wool 11 which is blue wall and it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.639 
for wool 11 which is blue wall and it
will<00:01:53.610> clone<00:01:54.000> whatever<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.990> front<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.409> them

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
will clone whatever is in front of them

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.490 
will clone whatever is in front of them
one<00:01:55.920> block<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> z<00:01:56.520> axis<00:01:56.630> -<00:01:57.630> two<00:01:57.899> blocks<00:01:58.320> in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
one block on the z axis - two blocks in

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.160 
one block on the z axis - two blocks in
front<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.829> them<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.340> z<00:01:59.549> axis<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> then

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
front of them on the z axis and then

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.380 
front of them on the z axis and then
with<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.799> move<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.549> will<00:02:02.759> delete<00:02:03.090> whatever

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
with the move it will delete whatever

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240 
with the move it will delete whatever
was<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:03.960> block<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.380> front<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.799> them<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
was one block in front of them so it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.550 
was one block in front of them so it
takes<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:06.000> block<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.390> front<00:02:06.420> puts<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.380> two

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
takes one block in front puts it two

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.680 
takes one block in front puts it two
blocks<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:08.009> front<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.369> deletes<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.330> was<00:02:09.479> one

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
blocks in front and deletes what was one

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.630 
blocks in front and deletes what was one
block<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.050> front<00:02:10.080> making<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.129> look<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
block in front making it look like the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.520 
block in front making it look like the
blue<00:02:12.030> wool<00:02:12.239> has<00:02:12.420> actually<00:02:12.810> moved

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
blue wool has actually moved

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.730 
blue wool has actually moved
and<00:02:13.860> it's<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> same<00:02:14.610> here<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:15.570> -<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and it's the same here just - on the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.570 
and it's the same here just - on the
z-axis<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.850> positive<00:02:18.420> x-axis<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.580> -

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
z-axis this is positive x-axis and -

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.090 
z-axis this is positive x-axis and -
x-axis<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.900> course<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.230> can<00:02:22.380> replace<00:02:22.740> any

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
x-axis and of course you can replace any

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.300 
x-axis and of course you can replace any
of<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.730> blocks<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.390> I'm<00:02:24.900> about<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.290> do<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:25.440> so

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
of the blocks as I'm about to do now so

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.610 
of the blocks as I'm about to do now so
for<00:02:26.490> example<00:02:26.940> let's<00:02:27.150> say<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.360> delete<00:02:27.780> wool<00:02:28.080> 14

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
for example let's say I delete wool 14

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680 
for example let's say I delete wool 14
which<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.040> red<00:02:29.310> wool<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.820> replaced<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.450> with

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
which is red wool and replaced that with

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.990 
which is red wool and replaced that with
stone<00:02:30.959> zero<00:02:31.380> which<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:32.010> means<00:02:32.220> normal<00:02:32.670> stone

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
stone zero which just means normal stone

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.840 
stone zero which just means normal stone
then<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.050> can<00:02:34.530> come<00:02:34.709> down<00:02:34.860> here<00:02:34.920> put<00:02:35.430> down<00:02:35.459> some

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
then I can come down here put down some

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.760 
then I can come down here put down some
stone<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.330> start<00:02:36.930> pushing<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.380> stone<00:02:37.620> around

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
stone and start pushing the stone around

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.130 
stone and start pushing the stone around
it<00:02:38.160> only<00:02:38.340> works<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.000> axis<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.660> set<00:02:39.990> it

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
it only works in the axis that I set it

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.220 
it only works in the axis that I set it
to<00:02:40.170> work<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:42.270> can<00:02:42.450> customize<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
to work in so you can customize the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.640 
to work in so you can customize the
block<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.610> direction<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.200> commands

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
block and the direction so the commands

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.130 
block and the direction so the commands
