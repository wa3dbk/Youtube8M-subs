arrived just preparing so it won't be
any<00:02:03.240> worse<00:02:03.830> what<00:02:04.830> should<00:02:05.010> they<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.100> about

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
any worse what should they think about

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
any worse what should they think about
when<00:02:05.790> they're<00:02:05.880> taping<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.450> their<00:02:06.630> feet<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
when they're taping up their feet for a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.100 
when they're taping up their feet for a
long<00:02:07.530> hike<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.330> maybe<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.570> they<00:02:09.720> get

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
long hike like this maybe that they get

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.070 
long hike like this maybe that they get
the<00:02:10.229> tape<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.590> stick<00:02:11.480> that's<00:02:12.480> very<00:02:12.720> good

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the tape to stick that's very good

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.450 
the tape to stick that's very good
so<00:02:13.950> use<00:02:14.280> long<00:02:14.520> tapes<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:16.590> best<00:02:16.860> advice<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.430> that

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
so use long tapes my best advice is that

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.220 
so use long tapes my best advice is that
you<00:02:17.610> tape<00:02:17.910> your<00:02:17.940> feets<00:02:18.480> before<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.080> get

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
you tape your feets before you get

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:55.770 
you tape your feets before you get
problems

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.840
