00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hello, we continue to build our 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.980
 as if you see a robot, nothing is yet 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:15.660
 changed in terms of boards yet 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.850
 added name is this weekend after 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.830
 Holidays managed to write a small 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.490
 program for testing 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.680
 The following modes are light sensors. 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.210
 and 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.680
 something that no one is now sealed sensor 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.430
 there is a proximity sensor so to speak 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.250
 such three small modes made for 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:48.989
 order to show how it all works 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:50.039
 Now I am including the work of its mega studied 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.000
 green led 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.850
 finds what the duty mode is 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.750
 nose first function 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:05.700
 there is a heap of the first button as you see when 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.340
 a certain threshold that is what sensor 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.549
 Lighting lights its LED then 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.570
 there is how much it is red sensor 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.780
 LED is blue well if its 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.290
 deploy still lights green 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.040
 Light-emitting diode 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.040
 as you can see the rear light sensor 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.290
 since nothing so complicated 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:35.680
 just kind of show what information 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:41.579
 from the light sensor board is transmitted 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.579
 ships to the central management board 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.280
 next function which show body 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:54.700
 the proximity sensor is already working here 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.789
 you will be shown a tick box 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.770
 flew something i set this distance 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:08.009
 somewhere around 20 centimeters here I 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.009
 I'm starting to get closer to the robot 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.330
 so to speak when approaching too 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.610
 close he gets scared drives back 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.610
 I will demonstrate this kind of flour 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.690
 as you can see drives off as if 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.980
 what you see so little tupit 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.450
 kosyachok a small program on this his 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.240
 correct the sun well, and the first part 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.470
 did the same as a magazine robot 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:51.660
 spy is to run after the light now 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.660
 just here after show on the table to 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.700
 I'll show you how he just told me. 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.730
 I am now the light is on the left 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.730
 side he will turn around and go to the light 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:21.790
 the principle is also understood as a spy robot 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.470
 riding for the light that is looking at 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.330
 which side is the light in that 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.480
 side turns her principle 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.269
 I tried timati is ok 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.450
 unfold where there is light I am there 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.220
 quietly rolls along the corridors small 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.070
 obstacles it is not a hindrance 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:49.350
 polynomials go quietly them 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:53.850
 jump here are such small 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.580
 say checkers are made for these holidays 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:01.690
 next chuu at home should not earn 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:07.200
 this will appear in front of the sensors to not exactly 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:10.209
 I can say when I wait for the parcel with 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.420
 parts that ordered well and 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:19.160
 the next thing I'm going to do is the controller 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.290
 batteries that will be responsible for 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.630
 state control charge 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.190
 batteries 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.510
 I think it will be a separate hole boards 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.240
 which will be included in the wire break 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.990
 food and thought maybe 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.290
 somewhere on the fee will bring here though 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.680
 Basically, I have a place in the spread divider 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:47.130
 voltage which should become so 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.090
 tell battery voltmeter which 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.930
 must signal and translate 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.979
 Robot so sleep if battery 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.979
 is in critical condition 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.270
 either there may be later on 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.270
 function so that he himself moved to 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:13.190
 charger 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:13.190
 became on charging robots until all
