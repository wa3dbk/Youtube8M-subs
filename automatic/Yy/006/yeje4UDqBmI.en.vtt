00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello dear friends are you looking 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.580
 danila kulesh channel today I 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:21.060
 I'll tell you how to save your iphone from 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:23.760
 drowning so let's go so the first thing 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.859
 need to do this at the bottom of the iphone 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.410
 There are two screws that need to be neat 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.269
 unscrew after that come very 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.790
 it is important a moment in which few 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.680
 pays attention cogs very 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.280
 small so keep them visible 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.140
 next place for the next step you 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.170
 need a hairstyle with fastening 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.610
 any fit even the essence of the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.079
 that you need to pull the front 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.510
 display frame 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.309
 from the metal case of the smartphone for 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.170
 this need to suck the sucker 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.360
 as close as possible to the home button and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.640
 slowly pull out the screen while holding 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.770
 body hand do it neatly 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.079
 since the camera side is 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.660
 connecting cable can break it 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.640
 it is best to hold the top altogether 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.740
 piece of plastic with your finger so that at the moment 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.409
 when play will be removed from the enclosure 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.930
 the loop did not break as much as you like 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.509
 try to sell the unassembled iphone but 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.490
 the water inside will still be a lot of water 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.049
 need to neatly brother napkin but for 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.450
 it's not enough anyway 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.670
 there is a second important point to dry 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.650
 a hairdryer is absolutely not a hair dryer 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.380
 give air flow with a temperature of about 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.640
 60 degrees such a drying can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 melt contacts 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 instead of a hair dryer, you need ordinary rice 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.780
 take a bigger pot and sprinkle but 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.299
 rice recommended to immerse Morton in 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 the croup as far as possible the trick is that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.740
 Fig perfectly absorbs water decreases 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.960
 humidity do not regret the flight and fall asleep 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.380
 stained un he thoroughly than more 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.180
 the rice the faster the dry device 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.100
 if you still do not have a screwdriver 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.409
 iphone can be immersed in cereal and not 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.689
 disassembled with a SIM card slot 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.640
 unit to dry in five to ten hours 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.560
 if the phone is not disassembled better 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.049
 hold it in rice a little longer 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.210
 after drying, carefully dig up 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.340
