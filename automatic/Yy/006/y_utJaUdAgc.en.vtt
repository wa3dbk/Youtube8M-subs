this is a demonstration on how to

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.970 
this is a demonstration on how to
convert<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.929> mirrored<00:00:03.929> drive<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:04.799> has

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
convert a mirrored drive that has

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.220 
convert a mirrored drive that has

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
metadata at the beginning to a standard

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.770 
metadata at the beginning to a standard
drive<00:00:07.440> it<00:00:07.620> will<00:00:07.710> be<00:00:07.799> operate<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.639> them<00:00:08.790> first

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
drive it will be operate to them first

the drive that we're having that we want

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.020 
the drive that we're having that we want
to<00:00:12.960> set<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:14.070> drive<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.759> particular

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
to set that drive on this particular

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
to set that drive on this particular
system<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> second<00:00:16.109> I'm<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.410> we've

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
system is a second I'm here we've

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.980 
system is a second I'm here we've
selected<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.880> see<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> partition

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
selected that you see in the partition

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.269 
selected that you see in the partition
template<00:00:19.350> here<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.710> shows<00:00:19.859> no<00:00:20.130> data

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
template here it shows no data

thing<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.119> want<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.660> want<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.990> scan

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
thing we want to do is you want to scan

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.390 
thing we want to do is you want to scan
this<00:00:25.590> drive<00:00:25.830> find<00:00:26.869> first<00:00:27.869> metric<00:00:28.400> switch

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
this drive find first metric switch

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
this drive find first metric switch
light<00:00:29.609> down<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.119> button<00:00:30.390> an<00:00:30.570> MBR<00:00:30.869> again

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
light down here it's button an MBR again

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.740 
light down here it's button an MBR again
so<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.369> ok<00:00:32.730> offset<00:00:32.910> plate

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
so we can see here that ok offset plate

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.709 
so we can see here that ok offset plate
you<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.290> an<00:00:34.410> MBR<00:00:35.120> stop<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.300> game<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.570> don't

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
you have an MBR stop this game we don't

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.110 
you have an MBR stop this game we don't
gain<00:00:36.870> any<00:00:37.050> longer<00:00:37.670> next<00:00:38.670> thing<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:38.879> want<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.059> go

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
gain any longer next thing we want to go

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
gain any longer next thing we want to go
to<00:00:39.149> uncheck<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.750> partition<00:00:40.500> sector<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to uncheck this partition sector and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
to uncheck this partition sector and
make<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> active<00:00:41.790> sector<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:43.230> take

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
make it the active sector in it you take

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.889 
make it the active sector in it you take
it<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.770> double<00:00:44.520> click<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.329> is

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it and double click on it as you see is

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
it and double click on it as you see is
now<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> acts<00:00:46.829> are<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> template<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:48.000> an

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
now the acts are in the template it's an

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.700 
now the acts are in the template it's an

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
main thing of all this is that the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.950 
main thing of all this is that the
relative<00:00:55.980> sectors<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:57.030> change<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.539> match<00:00:57.719> to

relative sectors we change to match to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.310 
relative sectors we change to match to

since we have a kit and feedback hundred
twenty<00:01:03.359> eight<00:01:03.449> sectors<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.830> is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
twenty eight sectors so what you do is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.429 
twenty eight sectors so what you do is
you<00:01:05.040> 128<00:01:05.700> or<00:01:05.880> whatever<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> LBA<00:01:06.840> offset<00:01:07.290> is

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
you 128 or whatever the LBA offset is

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
you 128 or whatever the LBA offset is
and<00:01:07.680> add<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> relatives<00:01:08.850> occurs<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and add the relatives occurs in this
