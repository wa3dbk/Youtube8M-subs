seem to have been repaired all at the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.810 
seem to have been repaired all at the
same<00:01:07.740> time<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.159> think<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.520> might<00:01:08.670> have

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
same time I think they might have

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
same time I think they might have
actually<00:01:09.350> I've<00:01:10.350> been<00:01:10.380> repaired<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
actually I've been repaired when the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
actually I've been repaired when the
guitar<00:01:11.310> was<00:01:11.430> built<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.909> these<00:01:12.060> cracks

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
guitar was built and these cracks

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.700 
guitar was built and these cracks
happened<00:01:12.840> while<00:01:13.049> while<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.590> was<00:01:13.680> being

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
happened while while it was being

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.260 
happened while while it was being
constructed<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.700> don't<00:01:14.880> seem<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> be

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
constructed and they don't seem to be

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.840 
constructed and they don't seem to be
any<00:01:15.299> others<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:16.290> these<00:01:16.470> years<00:01:16.680> later<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.340> it's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
any others all these years later so it's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.660 
any others all these years later so it's
everything<00:01:18.420> seems<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.930> stable<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.830> this

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
everything seems to be stable and this

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.570 
everything seems to be stable and this
is<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> sounds<00:01:21.509> like
