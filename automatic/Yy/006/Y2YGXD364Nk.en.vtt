00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.980
 Oriental 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.829
 talking about the east coast and fashion 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.100
 sana also remains very light for 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.850
 maxwell xavi suite of vegetables with a 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.000
 recipe 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.920
 I am already from vegetables a broker three cups 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.470
 of dragon teeth and the first ones in 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.570
 red cut into strips unsa boeing a 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.760
 carrot cut on half cup cane 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.980
 of soy sauce the cornstarch scoop 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.989
 a cup of four vegetable broth 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.489
 tablespoons of vegetable oil salt if it is 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.920
 necessary , most likely not what 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.580
 be because with soy sauce we are 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.150
 super super super julian san juan hay 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.590
 to cut the scallion laterally to 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.379
 that adopts the characteristics of 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.930
 real cup sweet white and green 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.030
 hear or snow until the tail 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.650
 broccoli and carrot are previously 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.659
 bleached which means they have been 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.489
 gone through boiling water so that 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.110
 have as an adoption line 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.750
 I'm going to start with the red pepper 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.180
 cut into strips of oil that is already 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.590
 hot hopefully if you have a wok like the 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.390
 pan that I have here that is a bit 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.180
 deeper and serves for us 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.220
 let's have the fire as alive as possible 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.350
 remember that I always want them 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.299
 all with super strong fire so 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.190
 if you have to try to invite him 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.740
 it's worth more data if you do not have a bot go 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.170
 to patronato because 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.880
 well hey the carrot we also do 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.579
 the same in just subscribed there you 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.799
 you see and at the same time we add the 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.369
 broccoli look at the super colors 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.079
 attractions that we have here is going to 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.079
 cost a couple of minutes for it to 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.850
 put crispy euros as turgescent 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.020
 for while we see how Juan Jura walks 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.579
 I hear we're not nearly ready 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.159
 magdaleno because it's the same what 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.439
 let's add now you have to have the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.740
 part as they sting quote that gives the 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.840
 scallion this flavor stronger this if 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.220
 you want to do it with meat with chicken 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.649
 you could also but our proposal 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.649
 today is one kilo per year 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.280
 is super we go then to the middle you 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.430
 we make a hole and run inside 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.730
 very well all the aromas begin 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.730
 to mix make this dish something 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.250
 irresistible that rich when we miss 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.120
 the soy sauce looks we are about to 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.200
 add the last vegetable that was with 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.489
 him and we added him at the last minute because 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.040
 the cooking genre needs the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.680
 properties is very straight straight 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.840
 slender there we continue crying what 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.269
 more you can in these minutes and on fire 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.389
 very very very strong now well in what 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.579
 I like soy sauce, half kitten 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.099
 that is going to give him pleasure and also he is going to 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.750
 heal clear so they are and now 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.030

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.920
 mayor but of course then a cup 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.430
 of broth that was previously dissolved 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.410
 then the last cooking steps but 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.510
 so that it does not remain as liquid as 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.760
 They have served the food and it looks like 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.800

 give more body to this stew that is low 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.800
 in calories and high 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.880
