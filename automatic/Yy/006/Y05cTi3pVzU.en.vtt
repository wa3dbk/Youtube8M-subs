00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 addresses from around the world since 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.230
 he separated from that he separated since he 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.740
 separated in mali from the formation of one 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.559
 direction was the rumor the rumble of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.630
 that finally the group would be solved 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.160
 We totally do it here because it's 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.619
 that it was very likely that this was the case and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.300
 there were numerous rumors that indicated 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.670
 how good they were going to launch a new album 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.029
 which is the one they had signed by 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.990
 contract but that after this record 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.640
 surely it would take everyone their 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.470
 way alone that yes it is 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
 probably good in a good future 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.090
 so they can record songs again 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.930
 together that 's how it seems they are confirmed 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.430
 the one direction in martos will separate 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.140
 definitely focusing on your 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.780
 race in the race each in 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.879
 lonely have said that this is not for 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.410
 nothing negative but good is what 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.559
 that many groups have done that is 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.210
 also explore your side as soloists or 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 under have each been seen by his side 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.379
 and then if in the future they do it again 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.890
 music together or porn we will also have 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.890
 that to follow together 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.250
 they're going to take a break, so to speak 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.530
 one year apart if they are 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.940
 specific if they say a one-year break 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.100
 means that good after that 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.540
 year will probably sit down and see if 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.670
 editing the music as any 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.160
 version for definitely dissolves 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.150
 the group as training what yes that 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.040
 know is that his fifth job 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.500
 record will come next month of 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.690
 November not having rotated because 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.580
 obviously in March it will be resolved 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.780
 what is going to be the disc promotion 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.250
 since good to move forward in a second 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.840
 single or a third with its respective 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.900
 video clip and until you get to the removal 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.570
 of the disc there will be no tour 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.670
 for the first time the four together this 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.560
 disc that the truth that I do not know you 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.230
 but this first one that is called admits 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.080
 as it seems that I started to like 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.760
 more are separated or what a pity are many 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.680
 being much more little in this last 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.730
 disco seems to be no but let's see 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.610
 how are they to the fifth record work 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.260
 and it may be the last of the gration glove 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.360
 say our opinion to see what 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.310
 it seems this dissolution this recess of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.200
 the 4000 edition as training as 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.090
 quartet as a quintet if you are 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.770
 Wishing to listen to new solitary music 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.869
 you already know that it is good is trying on 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.670
 his hard debut album of this election that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.410
 I was already before does ago 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.850
 time preparing his records in 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.110
 lonely when in color do with 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.940
 other stars and others is that already 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.290
 they were thinking about their project too 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.030
 lonely in a little bit he sent us 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.130
 review this as I say it 's nothing 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.080
 negative is not that they are wet is not 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.000
 one with others but that well, yes 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.320
 it is good to explore each one change in 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.480
 solitary there is a group called big 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.880
 band that do solo projects 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.930
 then they take out albums together what makes 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.680
 they go much faster 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.569
 maybe take out 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.609
 lonely at six or seven months to 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.439
 each one and how together then two of 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.780
 they make a joint album of all 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.790
 those still in duo would be pretty good that 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.010
 they have those waters leaving us a lot 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.349
 others would be pioneers in the West not 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.400
 making these kinds of proposals and so 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.510
 you have to pass the format what's going 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.639
