00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
ones in a cafe window and initially was

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.540 
ones in a cafe window and initially was
going<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:43.050> be<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> sparkling<00:01:43.770> lights<00:01:43.830> in<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550

window but then I saw this cab go by in
the<00:01:48.030> footage<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.540> was<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.750> well<00:01:48.930> maybe<00:01:49.020> that'd

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the footage I was like well maybe that'd

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.180 
the footage I was like well maybe that'd
be<00:01:49.380> cool<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.509> we've<00:01:51.630> been<00:01:51.750> finding<00:01:52.740> some<00:01:52.950> shots

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
be cool so we've been finding some shots

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.040 
be cool so we've been finding some shots
we<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.610> few<00:01:53.850> ideas<00:01:53.940> down<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:54.960> my

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
we have a few ideas down so we have my

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.359 
we have a few ideas down so we have my
shot<00:01:55.259> list<00:01:55.290> when<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> start<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> mirror

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
shot list when I start in the mirror

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:05.180 
shot list when I start in the mirror
we've<00:01:56.640> built<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.000> step<00:02:03.710> Johnny<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.830> think<00:02:05.039> this

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
we've built the step Johnny I think this

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.919 
we've built the step Johnny I think this
thing<00:02:05.399> weighs<00:02:05.580> more<00:02:05.820> than<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.360> small<00:02:07.110> child<00:02:08.929> so

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
thing weighs more than a small child so

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.630 
thing weighs more than a small child so
you<00:02:10.440> guys<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.039> hear<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.519> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you guys you can really hear in the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.250 
you guys you can really hear in the
mirror<00:02:11.880> looking<00:02:12.269> off<00:02:12.420> sheet<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.989> glittery

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
mirror looking off sheet and glittery

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.840
