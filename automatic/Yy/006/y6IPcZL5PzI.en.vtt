00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
accurate enough and to be honest the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.350 
accurate enough and to be honest the
whole<00:02:05.490> game<00:02:05.670> was<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.969> little<00:02:06.149> bit

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
whole game was just a little bit

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.719 
whole game was just a little bit
uninspiring<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.039> magic<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.610> they

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
uninspiring it like that magic that they

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.190 
uninspiring it like that magic that they
had<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
16-bit era and that's why this game

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.059 
16-bit era and that's why this game

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
game and that's a bit of a weird thing

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.150 
game and that's a bit of a weird thing
to<00:03:08.390> say<00:03:08.540> consider<00:03:09.079> don't<00:03:09.260> put<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.500> up<00:03:09.530> like<00:03:09.890> top

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
to say consider don't put it up like top

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.339 
to say consider don't put it up like top
of<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.340> list<00:03:10.519> for<00:03:10.790> most<00:03:11.360> disappointing<00:03:12.110> game

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
of the list for most disappointing game

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.349 
of the list for most disappointing game
now<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.069> reason<00:03:13.370> why<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.489> put<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.730> there<00:03:14.000> is

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
now the reason why I put it there is

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.970 
now the reason why I put it there is
because<00:03:14.569> around<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.230> time<00:03:15.470> when<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:15.709> came

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980
