 then leavening theatrical interior one thing 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.479
 in addition to using chopped walnuts and 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.190

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.599

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.360
 that of my gas should come 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:30.150

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.919
 in the cured mud of jam like 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:38.729
 you want to put whose plot to bake 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:41.460
 at 180 degrees for 40 50 minutes verified 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.250

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.380
 in the oven we prepared at home for 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:50.389

 taken 100 g of dark chocolate 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.909
 I melt in a bain-marie 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.070
 but a small saucepan is enough 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.810
 put it in a bowl put it there 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.260

 as you can see the jam is 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:17.700
 gone to the skies avoiding the cake 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.950
