00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the way right now and exhibition is a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.830 
the way right now and exhibition is a
good<00:00:46.920> thing<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.309> know<00:00:47.879> Elaine<00:00:48.360> did<00:00:48.539> hell<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
good thing I know Elaine did hell of a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.760 
good thing I know Elaine did hell of a
job<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:50.010> was<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> very<00:00:50.430> successful<00:00:50.730> team

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
job here this was a very successful team

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.459 
job here this was a very successful team
so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.430> everybody<00:00:53.850> wants<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.480> say<00:00:55.260> he's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so I think everybody wants to say he's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959 
so I think everybody wants to say he's
going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.280> Elaine<00:00:56.579> didn't<00:00:56.879> do

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
going to do this when Elaine didn't do

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
going to do this when Elaine didn't do
that<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.840> don't<00:00:58.469> look<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.039> way<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that and I don't look at it that way I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.250 
that and I don't look at it that way I
think<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> number<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.840> things<00:01:00.930> we're

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
think there's a number of things we're

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
think there's a number of things we're
doing<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.620> Elaine<00:01:01.829> did<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:03.120> talked<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
doing that Elaine did as we talked to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.859 
doing that Elaine did as we talked to
the<00:01:03.660> team<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.760> he's<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> very<00:01:06.180> good<00:01:06.450> coach<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the team so he's a very good coach it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.520 
the team so he's a very good coach it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
all teams name I think it'll be a little

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.170 
all teams name I think it'll be a little
bit<00:01:38.189> weird<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.700> him<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.060> i'm<00:01:39.119> sure

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
bit weird to see him there but i'm sure

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
think that he's yelling at me so like

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.880 
think that he's yelling at me so like
people<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.189> voice<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.700> pretty<00:01:44.820> distinct<00:01:45.890> so

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
people that voice is pretty distinct so
