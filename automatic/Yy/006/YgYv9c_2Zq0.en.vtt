00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.580 
is kind of a tough color two minutes yes
and<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.180> need<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.450> one<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:37.660> find<00:02:37.900> it's<00:02:38.230> not<00:02:38.320> easy

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
and I need you one to find it's not easy

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.530 
and I need you one to find it's not easy
to<00:02:38.739> find<00:02:38.950> because<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.489> think<00:02:39.549> it's<00:02:39.910> hard<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.239> get

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
to find because I think it's hard to get

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.360 
to find because I think it's hard to get
the<00:02:40.690> dye<00:02:40.870> right<00:02:43.440> hackles<00:02:44.440> are<00:02:44.590> very<00:02:44.980> hard<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
the dye right hackles are very hard and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.680 
the dye right hackles are very hard and
we'll<00:02:45.459> talk<00:02:45.640> about<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.060> when<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.239> get<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.600> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
we'll talk about that when we get to the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.949 
we'll talk about that when we get to the
hackle<00:02:47.049> on<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.290> fly<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> find<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.920> claret<00:02:48.250> and

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
hackle on this fly to find a claret and

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.670 
hackle on this fly to find a claret and
the<00:02:49.959> in<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.769> that<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.570> colors<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.590> know

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
the in the that the colors you know

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.350 
the in the that the colors you know
there's<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.890> lot<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.100> variation<00:02:54.820> in<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.000> colors

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
there's a lot of variation in the colors

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.970 
there's a lot of variation in the colors
and<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.540> think<00:02:55.570> because<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.320> difficulty<00:02:56.950> in

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
and I think because of the difficulty in

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.479 
and I think because of the difficulty in
dyeing<00:02:57.310> this<00:02:57.549> particular<00:02:57.880> color<00:02:59.160> but<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.310> is

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
dyeing this particular color but this is

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.729 
dyeing this particular color but this is
a<00:03:00.519> classic<00:03:00.910> summer<00:03:01.420> steelhead<00:03:01.690> color<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.470> the

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
a classic summer steelhead color and the

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.070 
a classic summer steelhead color and the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
guy should have it in his box just it's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:21.640 
guy should have it in his box just it's

the<00:04:24.870> only<00:04:25.050> hackle<00:04:26.039> I<00:04:26.099> actually<00:04:26.310> could<00:04:26.669> find<00:04:27.000> in

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
the only hackle I actually could find in

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.080 
the only hackle I actually could find in
Clara<00:04:27.750> too<00:04:28.080> which<00:04:28.380> was<00:04:28.530> kind<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.830> interesting

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.279 

they're<00:04:33.090> nice<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.479> work<00:04:33.630> with<00:04:33.690> though<00:04:33.960> and

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
they're nice to work with though and

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.570 
they're nice to work with though and
they're<00:04:34.380> just<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.740> right<00:04:34.949> length<00:04:35.190> they're

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
they're just the right length they're

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.550 
they're just the right length they're
the<00:04:35.820> right<00:04:35.909> length<00:04:36.210> they<00:04:36.449> have<00:04:36.630> a<00:04:36.659> stiff<00:04:37.199> shaft

the right length they have a stiff shaft

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.350 
the right length they have a stiff shaft
in<00:04:37.949> them<00:04:38.070> that's<00:04:38.370> gonna<00:04:38.520> hold<00:04:38.789> up<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.210> some

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
in them that's gonna hold up to some

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.390 
in them that's gonna hold up to some
wear<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:39.599> tear<00:04:39.979> you<00:04:40.979> can<00:04:41.070> see<00:04:41.220> how<00:04:41.340> that

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
wear and tear you can see how that

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.670 
wear and tear you can see how that
hackle<00:04:41.940> just<00:04:42.150> naturally<00:04:42.720> has<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.080> curve<00:04:43.320> to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
hackle just naturally has the curve to

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.080 
hackle just naturally has the curve to
it<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.979> goes<00:04:44.159> back<00:04:44.490> so<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:44.820> don't<00:04:44.940> have<00:04:45.030> to

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
it that goes back so you don't have to

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.270 
it that goes back so you don't have to
fight<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.960> get<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.289> nice<00:04:46.530> collar<00:04:46.919> style

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
fight it to get that nice collar style

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.990 
fight it to get that nice collar style
