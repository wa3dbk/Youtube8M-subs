pickles<00:01:23.790> legs<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:25.440> trick<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> make

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
pickles legs the trick here is to make

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.749 
pickles legs the trick here is to make
one<00:01:27.479> set<00:01:27.810> slightly<00:01:28.320> smaller<00:01:29.100> than<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.610> other

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
one set slightly smaller than the other

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.999 
one set slightly smaller than the other
set<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.560> make<00:01:31.950> these<00:01:32.250> nice<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.030> smooth<00:01:34.009> once

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
set so make these nice and smooth once

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.669 
set so make these nice and smooth once
you<00:01:35.190> have<00:01:35.429> them<00:01:35.580> made<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.569> can<00:01:36.960> create<00:01:37.319> a

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
you have them made we can create a

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.270 
you have them made we can create a
sausage<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.819> pickles<00:01:39.270> long<00:01:39.720> neck<00:01:40.170> give<00:01:41.009> this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
sausage for pickles long neck give this

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
sausage for pickles long neck give this
a<00:01:41.340> good<00:01:41.819> roll<00:01:42.209> and<00:01:42.539> make<00:01:43.289> sure<00:01:43.319> it<00:01:43.890> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
a good roll and make sure it is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.690 
a good roll and make sure it is
consistent<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.030> straight<00:01:46.369> when<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.550> are

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
consistent and straight when we are

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.510 
consistent and straight when we are
happy<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.810> create<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.440> head<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.310> our

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
happy we can create a head for our

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.290 
happy we can create a head for our
pickles<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> create<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> sphere<00:01:53.340> about<00:01:54.000> half

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
pickles so create a sphere about half

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.410 
pickles so create a sphere about half
the<00:01:54.569> size<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.319> body<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.970> then<00:01:56.970> create

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the size of the body and then create

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.020 
the size of the body and then create
another<00:01:57.810> sphere<00:01:58.259> about<00:01:58.950> half<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.310> size

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
another sphere about half that size

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.400 
another sphere about half that size
again<00:02:01.069> gently<00:02:02.069> press<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.640> small<00:02:03.209> sphere<00:02:03.720> onto

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
again gently press the small sphere onto

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.249 
again gently press the small sphere onto
the<00:02:04.530> medium<00:02:05.009> sphere<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:06.240> will<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.750> pickles

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the medium sphere this will be pickles

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.999 
the medium sphere this will be pickles
head<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.920> muzzle<00:02:08.869> now<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:09.929> fashioned<00:02:10.740> two

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
head and muzzle now we fashioned two

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.510 
head and muzzle now we fashioned two
small<00:02:11.430> cones<00:02:12.020> flatten<00:02:13.020> them<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> bit<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.650> apply

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
small cones flatten them a bit and apply

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.540 
small cones flatten them a bit and apply
them<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.120> side<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.870> head<00:02:16.220> they<00:02:17.220> will

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
them to the side of the head they will

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.890 
them to the side of the head they will
be<00:02:17.760> pickles<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.950> now<00:02:19.950> we<00:02:20.010> create<00:02:20.730> two<00:02:21.090> slightly

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
be pickles is now we create two slightly

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.800 
be pickles is now we create two slightly
smaller<00:02:22.560> cones<00:02:22.950> attach<00:02:23.880> these<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.569> top<00:02:24.780> of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
smaller cones attach these to the top of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.949 
smaller cones attach these to the top of
their<00:02:25.020> head<00:02:25.260> these<00:02:25.980> will<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.700> pickles<00:02:27.240> funny

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
their head these will be pickles funny

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.100 
their head these will be pickles funny
little<00:02:28.230> horns<00:02:29.090> when<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.300> head<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.540> complete

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
little horns when the head is complete
