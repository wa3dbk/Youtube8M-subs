you can feel the vibration but it's not
it's<00:01:12.150> still<00:01:12.689> cool<00:01:12.930> learning<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.130> music<00:01:14.580> if

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it's still cool learning the music if

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.850 
it's still cool learning the music if
you<00:01:14.939> went<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.119> concerts<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:16.080> know<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.619> can't

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you went to concerts you know you can't

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.399 
you went to concerts you know you can't
see<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.060> stuck<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:19.820> yeah

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
see them I know that it's stuck but yeah

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.950 
see them I know that it's stuck but yeah
looking<00:01:23.540> yeah

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
looking yeah

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.649 
looking yeah
would<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> rather<00:01:25.820> fall<00:01:26.820> off<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.240> moon<00:01:27.420> or

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
would you rather fall off the moon or

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.090 
would you rather fall off the moon or
you<00:01:27.780> eat<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> plate<00:01:32.630> full<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> Keio<00:01:34.020> plate<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you eat a plate full of Keio plate and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.440 
you eat a plate full of Keio plate and
you<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> paper<00:01:35.790> plate<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.270> know

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
you just as a paper plate you know

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.380 
you just as a paper plate you know
I'll<00:01:36.810> eat<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.369> glass<00:01:38.640> plate<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
I'll eat it but if it's a glass plate I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.749 
I'll eat it but if it's a glass plate I
think<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.960> might<00:01:40.140> want<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.409> fall<00:01:40.590> off<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.950> moon

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.600 

like<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.210> gravity<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.829> jump<00:01:47.220> off<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
like it's gravity you just jump off the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.429 
like it's gravity you just jump off the
moon<00:01:47.790> yeah<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> guess<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.840> don't<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.229> fall

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
moon yeah I guess you don't just fall

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.580 
moon yeah I guess you don't just fall
off<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.920> moon<00:01:50.100> well<00:01:50.310> that'd<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.549> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> cool

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
off the moon well that'd be kind of cool

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
off the moon well that'd be kind of cool
so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> fall<00:01:53.130> off<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.549> moon<00:01:53.729> rather<00:01:54.210> than

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so I fall off the moon rather than

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.090 
so I fall off the moon rather than
eating<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> plate<00:01:54.899> don't<00:01:55.170> fall<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.710> move<00:01:55.890> man

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
eating a plate don't fall to move man

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.249 
eating a plate don't fall to move man
would<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.520> rather<00:01:56.820> die<00:01:57.360> instantly<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.049> live

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
would you rather die instantly or live

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.850 
would you rather die instantly or live
forever<00:01:59.540> this<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.840> hard<00:02:01.079> question<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.649> me

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
forever this is a hard question for me

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.920 
forever this is a hard question for me
yeah<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.399> was<00:02:02.640> thinking<00:02:02.969> about<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.630> saw

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
yeah I was thinking about that one I saw

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.320 
yeah I was thinking about that one I saw
it<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.350> uh<00:02:04.649> um<00:02:05.990> if<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.469> had<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:08.399> choose

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it I was like uh um if I had to choose

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.130 
it I was like uh um if I had to choose
I<00:02:09.710> think<00:02:10.710> I<00:02:10.860> would<00:02:11.010> choose<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.850> die<00:02:12.420> instantly

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
I think I would choose to die instantly

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.540 
I think I would choose to die instantly
because<00:02:13.530> living<00:02:13.950> forever

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
because living forever

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.660 
because living forever
like<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.720> seems<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.320> long<00:02:16.770> time<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:19.670> I'm

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
like that seems like a long time and I'm

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.120 
like that seems like a long time and I'm
not<00:02:20.820> trying<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.120> live<00:02:21.270> forever<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.050> earth

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.630 

cool<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.580> because<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.390> got<00:02:30.540> shot<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.640> don't
