00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the loyalty points but I do believe

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.180 
the loyalty points but I do believe
there<00:02:09.360> are<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.780> reward<00:02:09.899> people<00:02:10.190> more

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
there are going to reward people more

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.520 
there are going to reward people more
points<00:02:11.610> at<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:11.940> time<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.420> say<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.750> instead

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
points at with time I say like instead

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.650 
points at with time I say like instead
capping<00:02:13.890> at<00:02:13.980> 15,000<00:02:14.640> canoga<00:02:15.090> even<00:02:15.480> higher

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
capping at 15,000 canoga even higher

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.270 
capping at 15,000 canoga even higher
than<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.900> again<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.980> kind<00:02:17.100> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
than that again so I think it kind of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.380 
than that again so I think it kind of
going<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:18.270> back<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.720> normal<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:21.030> i<00:02:21.209> can<00:02:21.240> say

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
going to go back to normal if i can say

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.330 
going to go back to normal if i can say
that<00:02:21.780> word<00:02:22.020> after<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.440> while<00:02:22.680> hopefully<00:02:22.980> will

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
that word after a while hopefully will

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.650 
that word after a while hopefully will
at<00:02:23.490> least<00:02:23.640> because<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.450> kind<00:02:24.630> of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
at least because this is kind of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.600 
at least because this is kind of
ridiculous<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:25.200> my<00:02:25.230> own<00:02:25.440> opinion<00:02:25.650> also<00:02:26.520> with

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
ridiculous in my own opinion also with

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.820 
ridiculous in my own opinion also with
the<00:02:26.700> services<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.330> know<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.830> 200,000

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
the services you know like 200,000

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.670 
the services you know like 200,000

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
points for a 50-percent bank spaces and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.190 
points for a 50-percent bank spaces and
like<00:02:31.830> 300<00:02:32.400> points<00:02:32.520> there<00:02:32.790> now<00:02:33.270> coins<00:02:33.900> i<00:02:34.050> mean

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
like 300 points there now coins i mean

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.830 
like 300 points there now coins i mean
which<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:34.739> it's<00:02:35.580> cheap<00:02:35.940> records<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.690> for

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
which is it's cheap records but for

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.470 
which is it's cheap records but for
loyalty<00:02:37.140> points<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.800> just<00:02:38.100> like<00:02:38.450> over<00:02:39.450> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.330 
loyalty points it's just like over a
year<00:02:39.540> probably<00:02:39.959> just<00:02:40.470> saving<00:02:41.040> up<00:02:41.190> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
year probably just saving up and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.830 
year probably just saving up and
everything<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:41.790> really<00:02:42.060> hope<00:02:42.209> they<00:02:42.390> can<00:02:42.600> make

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
everything so really hope they can make

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.660 
everything so really hope they can make
this<00:02:43.020> better<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.530> haven't<00:02:44.010> found<00:02:44.190> how<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.459> can

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.420 
expensive i said it way too much now so
I'm<00:04:24.659> just<00:04:25.080> going<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.289> switch<00:04:25.500> topic<00:04:25.890> but<00:04:26.280> this

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
I'm just going to switch topic but this

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.500 
I'm just going to switch topic but this
is<00:04:26.580> basically

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
is basically

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.150 
is basically
it's<00:04:28.110> fair<00:04:28.440> enough<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.740> know<00:04:28.830> it's<00:04:29.010> pretty

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
it's fair enough you know it's pretty

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.800 
it's fair enough you know it's pretty
cool<00:04:29.430> with<00:04:29.610> like<00:04:29.790> updated<00:04:30.390> stuff<00:04:30.690> and

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
cool with like updated stuff and

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.020 
cool with like updated stuff and
everything<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.140> let<00:04:31.290> merge<00:04:31.530> together<00:04:31.880> so<00:04:32.880> it's

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
everything I let merge together so it's

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.340 
everything I let merge together so it's
not<00:04:33.120> kind<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.420> the<00:04:33.540> same<00:04:33.720> shop<00:04:34.050> in<00:04:34.230> two

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
not kind of the same shop in two

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.340 
not kind of the same shop in two
versions<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.190> game<00:04:35.570> so<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.840> kind<00:04:37.140> of<00:04:37.170> like

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
versions and the game so I kind of like

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.840 
versions and the game so I kind of like
that<00:04:37.380> how<00:04:37.620> can<00:04:37.770> i<00:04:37.830> merge<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.190> together<00:04:38.460> even

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
that how can i merge it together even

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.280 
that how can i merge it together even
though<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.060> in-game<00:04:39.330> shop<00:04:39.570> is<00:04:39.780> now<00:04:39.930> kind<00:04:40.170> of

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
though the in-game shop is now kind of

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.890 
though the in-game shop is now kind of
useless<00:04:40.590> but<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.610> guess<00:04:42.060> that's<00:04:42.090> just<00:04:42.480> how<00:04:42.660> it

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
useless but I guess that's just how it

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.470 
useless but I guess that's just how it
is<00:04:42.930> there<00:04:43.710> also<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.460> new<00:04:44.700> items<00:04:45.180> in<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.450> game
