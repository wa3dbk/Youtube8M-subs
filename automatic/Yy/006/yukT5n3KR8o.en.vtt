00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.160 
most likely be an updated combo guide
and<00:00:14.820> I'll<00:00:14.910> make<00:00:15.089> sure<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.420> link<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.750> so

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
and I'll make sure to link to it so

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.540 
and I'll make sure to link to it so
without<00:00:16.410> further<00:00:16.619> ado<00:00:16.980> let's<00:00:17.190> get<00:00:17.310> started

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
without further ado let's get started

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.480 
without further ado let's get started
first<00:00:18.330> off<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> relatively<00:00:19.260> simple<00:00:19.490> 32%

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
first off is a relatively simple 32%

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.370 
first off is a relatively simple 32%
combo<00:00:20.850> now<00:00:21.029> make<00:00:21.359> sure<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.630> practice<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.199> F

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
combo now make sure you practice the F

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.080 
combo now make sure you practice the F
for<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:22.920> inputs<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> punch<00:00:23.970> is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
for two inputs and the punch is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.519 
for two inputs and the punch is
following<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.570> because<00:00:24.869> you're<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.320> see

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
following it because you're going to see

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.920 
following it because you're going to see
a<00:00:25.560> lot<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.010> today<00:00:26.189> next<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> 54%

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
a lot of that today next up is a 54%

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.990 
a lot of that today next up is a 54%
uppercut<00:00:28.740> combo<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.340> you'll<00:00:29.580> notice<00:00:29.849> now

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
uppercut combo and you'll notice now

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
uppercut combo and you'll notice now
there's<00:00:30.240> three<00:00:30.480> instances<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> F<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.710> two

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
there's three instances of the F or two

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.500 
there's three instances of the F or two
input<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.550> might<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> timing<00:00:33.360> down

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
input you might not get the timing down

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.090 
input you might not get the timing down
the<00:00:33.750> right<00:00:33.870> away<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.620> practice<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the right away but just practice a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.620 
the right away but just practice a
little<00:00:35.190> bit<00:00:35.430> then<00:00:35.640> you'll<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
little bit then you'll get it for the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.360 
little bit then you'll get it for the
first<00:00:36.660> f4<00:00:37.320> -<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> little

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
first f4 - you have to do it a little

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.130 
first f4 - you have to do it a little
bit<00:00:38.579> later<00:00:38.820> than<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> might<00:00:39.450> expect<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
bit later than you might expect so you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.660 
bit later than you might expect so you
have<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> wait<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> body<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.070> drop<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
have to wait for the body to drop and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.160 
have to wait for the body to drop and
then<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> next<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:42.989> them

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
then for the next or you have to do them

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.100 
then for the next or you have to do them
sooner<00:00:43.559> now<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> 56%<00:00:45.149> combo<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
sooner now we have a 56% combo and the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.690 
sooner now we have a 56% combo and the
only<00:00:46.289> difference<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.219> ends<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
only difference is that it ends in a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.549 
only difference is that it ends in a
special<00:00:48.030> move<00:00:48.180> instead<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.660> Africa<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
special move instead of in Africa so

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.110 
special move instead of in Africa so
again<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> struggle<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.640> F<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.940> two

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
again if you struggle with the F for two

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
again if you struggle with the F for two
inputs<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> van<00:00:51.989> van<00:00:52.199> van<00:00:52.440> punches<00:00:52.860> try

this helps us mix things up and you also
notice<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.830> previous<00:01:08.189> combos<00:01:08.549> are

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
notice that the previous combos are

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.100 
notice that the previous combos are
really<00:01:08.880> good<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.210> pushing<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> opponent

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
really good for pushing the opponent

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440 
really good for pushing the opponent
into<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> corner<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.760> sort<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.060> get

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
into the corner so you can sort of get

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.820 
into the corner so you can sort of get
your<00:01:12.570> opponent<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> corner<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> then

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
your opponent in the corner and then

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
your opponent in the corner and then
maintain<00:01:14.280> pressure<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.760> them<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.810> combo

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
maintain pressure on them now this combo

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
maintain pressure on them now this combo
is<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.350> slight<00:01:16.530> variation<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> 36%<00:01:18.210> combo

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.149 
is a slight variation of the 36% combo
you<00:01:18.600> saw<00:01:18.780> earlier<00:01:18.960> notice<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:19.860> are<00:01:19.979> two
