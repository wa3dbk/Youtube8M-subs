00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.850 
tournament I think a tournament in
Russia

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
Russia

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.590 
Russia
different<00:01:47.280> than<00:01:47.430> playing<00:01:47.580> in<00:01:47.880> North<00:01:48.090> America

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
different than playing in North America

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.420 
different than playing in North America
and<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.470> matter<00:01:49.710> i<00:01:49.800> think<00:01:49.980> it's<00:01:50.100> different

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and that matter i think it's different

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.390 
and that matter i think it's different
than<00:01:50.550> playing<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.940> sweden<00:01:51.270> finland<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:51.780> feels

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
than playing in sweden finland and feels

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.760

confident and comfortable in russia and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.510 
confident and comfortable in russia and

that's<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.200> good<00:02:04.229> thing<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.620> they<00:02:04.860> they

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that's a good thing because they they
