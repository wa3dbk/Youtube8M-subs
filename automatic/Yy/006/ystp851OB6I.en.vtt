00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
helmets the first helmet is the vanguard

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.290 
helmets the first helmet is the vanguard
helmet<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.890> see<00:00:26.189> I'm<00:00:26.609> wearing<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
helmet as you can see I'm wearing it

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.900 
helmet as you can see I'm wearing it
it's<00:00:27.599> taken<00:00:27.990> my<00:00:28.109> hair<00:00:28.320> off<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.490> helmet<00:00:29.670> is

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it's taken my hair off but the helmet is

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.250 
it's taken my hair off but the helmet is
invisible<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:32.040> other<00:00:32.279> problem<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:34.020> I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
invisible and the other problem was if I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.100 
invisible and the other problem was if I
go<00:00:34.469> along<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.160> put<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:37.710> hedge<00:00:38.670> Knight

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
go along and put on the hedge Knight

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:51.229 
go along and put on the hedge Knight
armor<00:00:44.390> got<00:00:45.390> too<00:00:45.719> many<00:00:45.870> things<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:49.969> helmet<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
armor got too many things the helmet I

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
armor got too many things the helmet I
have<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.340> correct<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:55.100> mod

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
have is not the correct one the mod

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.090 
have is not the correct one the mod
author<00:00:56.280> could<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.629> hedge<00:00:57.780> Knight

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
author could not get the hedge Knight

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
author could not get the hedge Knight
helmet<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.219> fit<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.850> orcs<00:01:00.149> head<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.989> he<00:01:01.079> simply

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
helmet to fit the orcs head so he simply

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.490 
helmet to fit the orcs head so he simply
replaced<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> orc<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.629> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
replaced it just for the orc with this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.210 
replaced it just for the orc with this
model<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.110> due<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> fact<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
model so it's due to the fact that the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.700 
model so it's due to the fact that the
orcs<00:01:08.580> head<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.060> too<00:01:09.330> big<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.840> must<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.500> because

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
orcs head is too big it must be because

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
orcs head is too big it must be because
orcs<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.400> quite<00:01:11.610> obviously<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> cleverest

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
orcs are quite obviously the cleverest

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.800 
orcs are quite obviously the cleverest
and<00:01:13.320> best<00:01:13.619> looking<00:01:13.890> race<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.340> Skyrim<00:01:14.820> yes<00:01:15.630> they

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and best looking race in Skyrim yes they

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.950 
and best looking race in Skyrim yes they
are

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
are

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.300 
are
I<00:01:16.880> know<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.030> gonna<00:01:18.240> cause<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.720> comments

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
I know that's gonna cause some comments

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
I know that's gonna cause some comments
so<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.210> need<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.900> look<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.350> these

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
so what we need to do is look at these

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700 
so what we need to do is look at these
helmets<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.479> different<00:01:24.479> race<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
helmets as a different race so that is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.120 
helmets as a different race so that is
what<00:01:25.830> I'm<00:01:25.920> gonna<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> show<00:01:28.130> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
what I'm gonna do I'm going to show the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.130 
what I'm gonna do I'm going to show the
race<00:01:29.340> menu<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> console<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.750> change<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
race menu in the console and change to a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.710 
race menu in the console and change to a
Nord<00:01:35.210> there<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.299> go

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
Nord there we go

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.480 
Nord there we go
that<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.640> me<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.909> Nord<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.220> see

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that is me as a Nord so as you can see

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.830 
that is me as a Nord so as you can see
very<00:01:41.729> sort<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> simplistic<00:01:42.990> helmet<00:01:43.680> design

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
very sort of simplistic helmet design

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
very sort of simplistic helmet design
very<00:01:45.840> medieval<00:01:46.439> looking<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.820> does

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
very medieval looking and really does

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.060 
very medieval looking and really does
actually<00:01:48.299> suit<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> armor<00:01:49.229> very<00:01:49.590> very<00:01:49.920> well

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
actually suit the armor very very well

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
actually suit the armor very very well
indeed<00:01:50.520> probably<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> lot<00:01:51.630> better<00:01:51.689> than<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
indeed probably a lot better than the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.350 
indeed probably a lot better than the
helmet<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.860> doesn't<00:01:53.159> look<00:01:53.280> quite<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.670> evil

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
helmet and it doesn't look quite as evil

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.280 
helmet and it doesn't look quite as evil
as<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.840> orc<00:01:55.470> helmet<00:01:55.950> version<00:01:56.310> does<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.020> this

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
as the orc helmet version does so this

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.719 
as the orc helmet version does so this
yes<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.829> could<00:01:59.040> actually<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.369> quite<00:01:59.399> an

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
yes you could actually be quite an

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.240 
yes you could actually be quite an
honorable<00:02:00.119> Knights<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.689> helmet<00:02:01.049> on

honorable Knights with this helmet on

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.600 
honorable Knights with this helmet on
honestly<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.990> like<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.200> orc<00:02:04.350> version

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
honestly I like the orc version

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.470 
honestly I like the orc version
still<00:02:07.610> very<00:02:08.119> nice<00:02:08.390> Alma<00:02:08.840> very<00:02:09.200> nice<00:02:09.440> Armour

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
and now if I look at the Vanguard armor

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.880 
and now if I look at the Vanguard armor
with<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.650> helmet<00:02:16.130> as<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.790> see<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:18.530> got

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
with the helmet as you can see it's got

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.970 
with the helmet as you can see it's got
a<00:02:19.220> very<00:02:19.819> heavy<00:02:20.209> looking<00:02:20.630> helmet<00:02:21.110> covered<00:02:21.800> by<00:02:21.950> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
a very heavy looking helmet covered by a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.699 
a very heavy looking helmet covered by a
sort<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.310> cowl<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.390> faceplate<00:02:23.989> is<00:02:24.170> lifted

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
sort of cowl but the faceplate is lifted

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.030 
sort of cowl but the faceplate is lifted
up<00:02:24.830> which<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.580> pretty<00:02:26.360> cool<00:02:26.510> actually<00:02:27.040> there

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
when I looked at the armor shock trooper

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.870 
when I looked at the armor shock trooper
armor<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.480> pretty<00:03:08.840> terrifying<00:03:09.880> very

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
armor this is pretty terrifying very

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.170 
armor this is pretty terrifying very
very<00:03:11.269> good<00:03:15.370> now<00:03:16.370> one<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.880> other<00:03:17.000> questions

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
very good now one of the other questions

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.500 
very good now one of the other questions
that<00:03:17.600> came<00:03:17.930> up<00:03:18.170> was<00:03:18.590> if<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.519> are<00:03:19.640> using<00:03:19.970> the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
that came up was if you are using the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.479 
that came up was if you are using the
existing<00:03:20.750> armors<00:03:21.380> should<00:03:21.799> you<00:03:21.950> uninstall

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
existing armors should you uninstall

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.120 
existing armors should you uninstall
them<00:03:22.850> before<00:03:23.209> installing<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:24.319> pack<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:26.109> I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
them before installing this pack and I

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.520 
them before installing this pack and I
basically<00:03:28.130> would<00:03:28.700> say<00:03:28.970> probably<00:03:29.750> yes

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
basically would say probably yes

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.430 
basically would say probably yes
but<00:03:31.250> there<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.549> a<00:03:31.579> downside<00:03:31.910> as<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.720> can<00:03:32.870> see<00:03:33.200> I

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
but there is a downside as you can see I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.129 
but there is a downside as you can see I
was<00:03:34.400> actually<00:03:34.549> wearing<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.209> Warchief<00:03:35.690> armor

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
when I saved this game and when I load

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.080 
when I saved this game and when I load
it<00:03:38.359> up<00:03:38.600> because<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:39.170> removed<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.579> Warchief

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
it up because I removed the Warchief

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.550

generally speaking although it's

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.960 
generally speaking although it's
possible<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:40.290> keep<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.860> original<00:04:41.310> mods<00:04:41.520> in<00:04:41.760> I

possible to keep the original mods in I

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.770 
possible to keep the original mods in I
would<00:04:42.900> recommend<00:04:43.380> against<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:43.980> and<00:04:44.270> I<00:04:45.270> would

would recommend against it and I would

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.110 
would recommend against it and I would
suggest<00:04:46.290> if<00:04:46.890> you<00:04:47.040> really<00:04:47.520> want<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.790> keep<00:04:47.970> those

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
suggest if you really want to keep those

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.690 
suggest if you really want to keep those
