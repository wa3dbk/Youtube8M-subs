if<00:07:10.660> Charlotte<00:07:11.140> lost<00:07:12.150> actually<00:07:13.150> yeah<00:07:13.570> oh<00:07:13.600> is<00:07:14.020> it

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
if Charlotte lost actually yeah oh is it

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.270 
if Charlotte lost actually yeah oh is it
got<00:07:14.290> eliminated<00:07:14.500> because<00:07:14.890> I<00:07:14.950> just<00:07:15.160> realized

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 
got eliminated because I just realized

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.610 
got eliminated because I just realized
charlotte<00:07:15.820> lost<00:07:16.030> the<00:07:16.240> Wizards<00:07:16.630> still<00:07:17.440> would

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
charlotte lost the Wizards still would

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.210 
charlotte lost the Wizards still would
be<00:07:17.710> tied<00:07:17.950> with<00:07:17.980> them<00:07:18.400> and<00:07:19.530> I<00:07:20.530> guess<00:07:20.890> Charlotte

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220 
be tied with them and I guess Charlotte

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.460 
be tied with them and I guess Charlotte
