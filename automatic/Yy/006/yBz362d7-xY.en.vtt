my logic so I'm gonna sing poke around
we<00:01:22.830> leader<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.189> velcro<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:24.119> sounds

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
we leader for the velcro now that sounds

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.789 
we leader for the velcro now that sounds
nice<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:25.020> ferrothorn<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
nice that ferrothorn is not going to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.859 
nice that ferrothorn is not going to
enjoy<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> fiery<00:01:26.549> dance<00:01:26.790> that's<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.119> sure<00:01:27.240> um<00:01:27.479> I

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
enjoy a fiery dance that's for sure um I

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.980 
enjoy a fiery dance that's for sure um I
think<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> main<00:01:28.950> problem<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
think the main problem here is the the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.890 
think the main problem here is the the
crow<00:01:31.259> back<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.100> Milo<00:01:32.280> sick<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.509> in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
crow back in the the Milo sick so in

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.230 
crow back in the the Milo sick so in
order<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.590> counter<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> crow<00:01:35.579> bad<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.000> need

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
order to counter the crow bad I need

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.359 
order to counter the crow bad I need
something<00:01:36.390> counted<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.840> both<00:01:36.960> actually<00:01:37.409> can

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
something counted in both actually can

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.340 
something counted in both actually can
store<00:01:38.610> after<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.299> really<00:01:39.689> i<00:01:39.930> don't

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
store after you that not really i don't

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.310 
store after you that not really i don't
think<00:01:40.619> stars<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.369> too<00:01:41.670> well<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
think stars you can do that too well a

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.109 
think stars you can do that too well a
dragonite<00:01:43.320> maybe<00:01:43.590> caches<00:01:44.549> ice<00:01:44.700> cream<00:01:44.939> get<00:01:45.090> a
