and keep adding all the one so you get

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.150 
and keep adding all the one so you get
like<00:00:59.810> a<00:00:59.870> very<00:01:01.989> sponge<00:01:04.059> kind<00:01:05.059> of<00:01:05.150> shape<00:01:05.449> though

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
like a very sponge kind of shape though

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:18.120 
like a very sponge kind of shape though
keep<00:01:07.160> on<00:01:07.340> adding<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.760> water

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.100 

keep<00:01:19.130> working<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.610> though<00:01:19.880> until<00:01:20.870> they<00:01:20.960> give

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
keep working you though until they give

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.070 
keep working you though until they give
this<00:01:21.760> elastic<00:01:23.860> but<00:01:24.860> no<00:01:25.010> lumps<00:01:25.340> in<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.520> as<00:01:25.700> well

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
this elastic but no lumps in it as well

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.290

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
it's sort of like checking the bottle

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.030 
it's sort of like checking the bottle
the<00:01:29.450> dose<00:01:29.660> so<00:01:29.840> there<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.080> no<00:01:30.260> lumps<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.680> flour

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.100 

and<00:01:34.040> just<00:01:34.070> with<00:01:34.490> your<00:01:34.580> hand

and just with your hand
keep<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.700> attachment<00:01:38.390> from<00:01:38.540> whenever<00:01:39.410> it

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
keep the attachment from whenever it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.460 
keep the attachment from whenever it
sticks<00:01:40.450> until<00:01:41.450> they<00:01:41.690> get<00:01:41.810> smaller<00:01:42.259> than

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
sticks until they get smaller than

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.670 
sticks until they get smaller than
elastic<00:01:45.610> then<00:01:46.610> keep<00:01:46.850> working<00:01:47.030> your<00:01:47.360> dough

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
elastic then keep working your dough

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.710 
elastic then keep working your dough
removing<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.800> from<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:49.070> side<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.479> plate

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
removing it from the side of the plate

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.219 
removing it from the side of the plate
so<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:51.380> don't<00:01:51.649> have<00:01:51.770> any<00:01:51.950> lots<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.550> flour<00:01:53.229> now

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
so we don't have any lots of flour now

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.109 
so we don't have any lots of flour now
after<00:01:54.500> you've<00:01:54.649> done<00:01:54.860> just<00:01:55.520> transfer<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:58.119> little
