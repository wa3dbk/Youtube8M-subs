00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.710
 we put an end to our journey 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.480
 for the north of the peninsula in this 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.250
 eighteenth stage of the return between 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.890
 locations of aguilar de campoo and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.689
 Valladolid quiet stage of 186 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.849
 kilometers with a single danger the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.860
 wind a favorable race for 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.390
 sprinters that despite everything will notice 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.460
 the accumulated fatigue after two weeks 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.610
 of round and three hard days of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.610
 Montana 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.390
 I was opening a fantastic hole 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.390
 Stage madness awaits you 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.579
 the runners have reduced to the march 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.600
 something could be getting ready has been 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.600
 produced the break 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.570
 the peloton has slowed down the 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.520
 equipment represented in the leak 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.379
 obviously they are not going to fine tune a depends on 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.379
 others organize to hunt 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.420
 things are heating up in the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.420
 head of the group 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.040
 the group does not seem very worried in 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.310
 follow some escapees have reduced the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.310
 rhythm 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.110
 some teams are pulling the group 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.330
 to reduce the difference with the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.320
 escaped is the price of not having 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.320
 put anyone in the leak 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.220
 the pace is very high the peloton is 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.610
 heading and at any time could 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.610
 break 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.450
 has launched a devastating attack to leave 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.069
 alone the break has not been the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.599
 everyone's taste and the squad has 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.599
 stepped up to hunt them 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.760
 and a small group is trying 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.140
 separate from the peloton little by little the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.500
 squad is approaching the 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.300
 escaped only 15 km adventure 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.370
 comes to an end the escaped have been 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.020
 hunted by the group that has increased the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.070
 going in the peloton is going to be complicated 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.070
 get away in these conditions 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.900
 the finish line is approaching the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.470
 runners have passed the banner of 10 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.170
 to the last 8 km goal the tension grows 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.440
 another attack this one that could be the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.440
 good 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.370
