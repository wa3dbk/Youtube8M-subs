right where they live we build living

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
right where they live we build living
ecosystems<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.739> inside<00:00:35.130> people's<00:00:35.489> homes

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.549 
ecosystems that go inside people's homes
and<00:00:35.910> help<00:00:36.180> them<00:00:36.360> grow<00:00:36.540> fresh<00:00:36.899> food<00:00:37.140> year-round

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
and help them grow fresh food year-round

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.590 
and help them grow fresh food year-round
for<00:00:37.950> their<00:00:38.070> families<00:00:38.460> our<00:00:38.969> goal<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.420> to

for their families our goal is to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.389 
for their families our goal is to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
connect people back to their roots the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.799 
connect people back to their roots the
great<00:00:41.610> thing<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.120> people<00:00:42.149> are<00:00:42.600> already

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
great thing is that people are already

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
great thing is that people are already
shifting<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.590> direction<00:00:43.800> things<00:00:44.370> like

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
shifting in this direction things like

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.670 
shifting in this direction things like
farmers<00:00:44.969> markets<00:00:45.390> around<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.930> especially

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
farmers markets around here especially

farmers markets around here especially
in<00:00:46.980> Austin<00:00:47.399> where<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.670> are<00:00:47.789> right<00:00:47.969> now<00:00:48.379> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
in Austin where we are right now the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.869 
in Austin where we are right now the
notion<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.860> caring<00:00:50.190> about<00:00:50.280> where<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:50.700> food

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
notion of caring about where your food

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.490 
notion of caring about where your food
comes<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> how<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.930> grown<00:00:52.230> is

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
comes from and how it was grown is

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.709 
comes from and how it was grown is
becoming<00:00:52.980> more<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.309> more<00:00:53.370> popular<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.539> we're

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
becoming more and more popular so we're

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.720 
becoming more and more popular so we're

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
one more tool that people can use to to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:15.490

it's how cities grow and to design
better<00:01:59.610> cities<00:01:59.940> we<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.330> it's<00:02:00.450> important<00:02:00.780> to

we live in the 21st century I also

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.500 
we live in the 21st century I also
realized<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.370> 21st<00:02:43.700> century<00:02:44.240> we

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
realized that in the 21st century we

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.660

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
can't continue to design using only

non-renewable materials of course we all

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.660 
non-renewable materials of course we all
