students<00:01:31.170> who<00:01:31.320> fully<00:01:32.189> engage<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.939> working

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
students who fully engage with working

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.910 
students who fully engage with working
with<00:01:33.360> younger<00:01:33.659> students<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.619> about

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
with younger students and it's about

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.340 
with younger students and it's about
participation<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.420> thinking<00:01:37.020> yes<00:01:37.200> this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
participation but also thinking yes this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.990 
participation but also thinking yes this
is<00:01:37.500> something<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.920> want<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> I'm

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
choosing to do and I think that that's

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.319 
choosing to do and I think that that's
the<00:01:41.040> thing<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.340> been<00:01:41.610> Richmond<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the thing that's been Richmond is the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.840 
the thing that's been Richmond is the
fact<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.869> part<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.290> local<00:01:43.710> area<00:01:44.369> sort

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
fact that it's part of a local area sort

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.539 
fact that it's part of a local area sort
of<00:01:44.909> program<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:46.040> when<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.250> AA<00:01:47.280> school

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
of program and when the AA school

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.270 
of program and when the AA school
program<00:01:48.000> moves<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.659> we'll<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.439> students

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
program moves on we'll have students

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
program moves on we'll have students
actually<00:01:50.490> able<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.970> sustain<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.960> not

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
actually able to sustain that it's not

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.899 
actually able to sustain that it's not
about<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> staff<00:01:53.100> enthusiasm

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
about just the staff enthusiasm

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.639 
about just the staff enthusiasm
inspiring<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> students<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> fact

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
inspiring the students with the fact

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.770 
inspiring the students with the fact
that<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.189> six<00:01:56.640> film<00:01:56.880> students<00:01:57.390> actually

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that we have six film students actually

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.260 
that we have six film students actually
learning<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.040> teach<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> students<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
learning to teach of the students and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.480 
learning to teach of the students and
then<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> motivation<00:02:01.619> factor<00:02:02.040> kicks<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.460> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
then the motivation factor kicks in that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.219 
then the motivation factor kicks in that
we<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.850> young<00:02:03.030> students<00:02:03.450> thinking<00:02:03.810> yeah

we have young students thinking yeah

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.630 
we have young students thinking yeah

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
future so it's developing that skill and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.309 
future so it's developing that skill and
that<00:02:07.740> part<00:02:07.979> is

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
that part is

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.169 
that part is
pation<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.950> who<00:02:09.459> knows<00:02:09.640> where<00:02:09.849> that<00:02:09.879> might

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
pation and who knows where that might

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.149 
pation and who knows where that might
lead<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.659> mostly<00:02:11.049> minus<00:02:11.499> 2r<00:02:11.709> ugly<00:02:11.980> they're
