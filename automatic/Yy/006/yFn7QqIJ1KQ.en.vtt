this picture so I'll share that and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.240 
this picture so I'll share that and
maybe<00:00:15.599> we'll<00:00:15.929> pick<00:00:16.230> up<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.529> few<00:00:16.710> things<00:00:16.770> in

maybe we'll pick up a few things in

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.790 
maybe we'll pick up a few things in
general<00:00:17.670> about<00:00:17.760> composition<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.869> why<00:00:19.740> this

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
general about composition and why this

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.189 
general about composition and why this
is<00:00:20.460> not<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> great<00:00:21.029> photo<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.779> could<00:00:21.900> work<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
is not a great photo but it could work a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.279 
is not a great photo but it could work a
little<00:00:22.289> bit<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:23.250> was<00:00:23.460> taken<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> 5d<00:00:25.019> Mark

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
little bit this was taken with a 5d Mark

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.040 
little bit this was taken with a 5d Mark
2<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.480> 24<00:00:27.480> millimeter<00:00:27.930> F<00:00:28.170> 1<00:00:28.470> point<00:00:28.769> 4<00:00:29.070> lens<00:00:29.400> at

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.080 
2 and 24 millimeter F 1 point 4 lens at
1600<00:00:31.050> ISO<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.940> one

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
1600 ISO and as you can see here one

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.990 
1600 ISO and as you can see here one
45th<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.809> second<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.460> pointing<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
45th of a second that I was pointing the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.459 
45th of a second that I was pointing the
camera<00:00:36.180> down<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> little<00:00:36.960> bit<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.320> can

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
camera down a little bit you can

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
camera down a little bit you can
actually<00:00:37.649> see<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> cheated<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> perspective

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
actually see I cheated the perspective

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.420 
actually see I cheated the perspective
right<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.260> corner<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
right here in this corner you can see it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.400 
right here in this corner you can see it
that<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.149> cheating<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> perspective<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that I was cheating the perspective and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.220 
that I was cheating the perspective and
pointing<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> camera<00:00:44.129> down<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.820> little<00:00:45.059> bit<00:00:45.300> so

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
pointing the camera down a little bit so

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
pointing the camera down a little bit so
from<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> composition<00:00:47.370> standpoint<00:00:47.879> everybody

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
from a composition standpoint everybody

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
from a composition standpoint everybody
knows<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> rule<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.170> thirds<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.890> hate<00:00:50.460> calling

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
knows the rule of thirds I hate calling

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.520 
knows the rule of thirds I hate calling
it<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> hate<00:00:51.690> saying<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.289> rule

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it that and I hate saying it's a rule

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.299 
it that and I hate saying it's a rule
but<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.670> image<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.890> better<00:00:56.039> or

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
but this image you know for better or

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.099 
but this image you know for better or
worse<00:00:56.340> there's<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.239> lot<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.539> rule<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.840> thirds

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
worse there's a lot of rule of thirds

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.729 
worse there's a lot of rule of thirds
going<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.579> let's<00:00:59.760> talk<00:01:00.000> about<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
going on and and let's talk about that

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.090 
going on and and let's talk about that
the<00:01:02.670> curb<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.690> pretty<00:01:04.140> much<00:01:04.439> right<00:01:04.739> along

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the curb here is pretty much right along

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.359 
the curb here is pretty much right along
that<00:01:05.280> top<00:01:05.580> third<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.510> most<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.650> detail<00:01:08.159> in

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that top third so most of your detail in

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.980 
that top third so most of your detail in
the<00:01:08.640> entire<00:01:08.970> image<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.810> where<00:01:09.960> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the entire image and actually where I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.230 
the entire image and actually where I
focused<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> upper<00:01:11.520> third<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
focused is right in the upper third of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200 
focused is right in the upper third of
the<00:01:12.810> image<00:01:13.080> which<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.970> typical<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.180> it's

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the image which is a typical but it's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.450 
the image which is a typical but it's
right<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> rule<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> thirds<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
right there on the rule of thirds the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.149 
right there on the rule of thirds the
other<00:01:17.580> thing<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.060> these<00:01:19.159> diagonal

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
other thing is that these diagonal

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.020 
other thing is that these diagonal
dynamic<00:01:20.759> lines<00:01:21.060> end<00:01:21.590> abruptly<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:23.580> there

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
dynamic lines end abruptly right there

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.719 
dynamic lines end abruptly right there
on<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.720> first<00:01:25.110> third<00:01:25.500> coming<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.280> from<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
on that first third coming in from the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.859 
on that first third coming in from the
left<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.659> we've<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.560> got<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.659> typical<00:01:30.659> but

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
left so we've really got a a typical but

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
left so we've really got a a typical but
certainly<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.439> rule<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.920> thirds<00:01:32.189> composition

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
certainly a rule of thirds composition

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.240 
certainly a rule of thirds composition
here<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.900> let's<00:01:34.110> take<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.350> look<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.740> these

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
here so let's take a look at these

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.469 
here so let's take a look at these
diagonal<00:01:35.970> leading<00:01:36.270> lines<00:01:37.880> diagonal<00:01:38.880> lines<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
diagonal leading lines diagonal lines is

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.960 
diagonal leading lines diagonal lines is
something<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.619> hardwired<00:01:41.310> into<00:01:41.759> our

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
something that's like hardwired into our

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.310 
something that's like hardwired into our
brains<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.930> evolutionary<00:01:43.799> biology

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
brains it's evolutionary biology

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.080 
brains it's evolutionary biology
diagonal<00:01:46.320> lines<00:01:46.530> mean<00:01:46.829> energy<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:48.030> do

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
diagonal lines mean energy they do

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.889 
diagonal lines mean energy they do
something<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.049> us<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.450> science

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
something to us it's just science

horizontal lines mean one thing to us in

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.630 
horizontal lines mean one thing to us in
nature<00:01:57.719> from<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> predatory<00:01:58.770> response<00:01:58.979> and

nature from the predatory response and
diagonal<00:02:00.630> lines<00:02:00.810> mean<00:02:01.140> another<00:02:01.380> thing<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.070> one

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
diagonal lines mean another thing so one

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.760 
diagonal lines mean another thing so one
thing<00:02:03.090> that's<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.719> general<00:02:04.229> rule<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.649> you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
thing that's a general rule that you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.520 
thing that's a general rule that you
could<00:02:04.920> take<00:02:05.159> with<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:06.290> diagonal<00:02:07.290> lines

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
could take with you is diagonal lines

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.820 
could take with you is diagonal lines
mean<00:02:07.860> energy<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:09.170> horizontal<00:02:10.170> lines<00:02:10.440> are

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
mean energy and horizontal lines are

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.199 
mean energy and horizontal lines are
more<00:02:11.160> soothing<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.760> common

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
more soothing in common

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.080 
more soothing in common
so<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.530> high-energy<00:02:14.219> diagonal

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so we have this high-energy diagonal

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.240 
so we have this high-energy diagonal
line<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.510> they<00:02:15.569> all<00:02:15.719> kind<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.079> lead<00:02:16.469> right

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
line and they all kind of lead right

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.819 
line and they all kind of lead right
here<00:02:17.670> ultimately<00:02:18.269> those<00:02:19.170> lines<00:02:19.469> are<00:02:19.650> going

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
here ultimately those lines are going

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.509 
here ultimately those lines are going
here<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.049> from<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.200> composition<00:02:22.859> standpoint

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
here so from a composition standpoint

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.059 
here so from a composition standpoint
there's<00:02:24.120> really<00:02:24.390> nothing<00:02:25.019> on<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.530> left<00:02:25.920> side

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
there's really nothing on this left side

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.429 
there's really nothing on this left side
here<00:02:26.879> but<00:02:27.390> I'm<00:02:27.480> okay<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.019> because

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
here but I'm okay with that because

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.250 
here but I'm okay with that because
there's<00:02:28.829> enough<00:02:29.219> here<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:30.030> kind<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.689> carry<00:02:31.049> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
there's enough here to kind of carry the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.690 
there's enough here to kind of carry the
composition<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:33.019> we<00:02:34.019> have<00:02:34.349> our<00:02:34.799> leading<00:02:35.340> lines

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
composition so we have our leading lines

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.869 
composition so we have our leading lines
and<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.659> also<00:02:36.840> have<00:02:37.230> two<00:02:37.560> strong<00:02:38.010> going<00:02:38.639> across

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
and we also have two strong going across

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.750 
and we also have two strong going across
the<00:02:39.180> entire<00:02:39.510> frame<00:02:40.189> horizontal<00:02:41.189> lines<00:02:41.430> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
the entire frame horizontal lines and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.170 
the entire frame horizontal lines and
these<00:02:42.030> are<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.959> on<00:02:43.409> a<00:02:43.439> lot<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.099> ways<00:02:44.280> anchoring

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
these are and on a lot of ways anchoring

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.929 
these are and on a lot of ways anchoring
the<00:02:45.299> image<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.409> is<00:02:46.590> your<00:02:46.739> payoff<00:02:47.159> just

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
the image and this is your payoff just

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.179 
the image and this is your payoff just
from<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.209> purely<00:02:48.599> form<00:02:49.109> standpoint<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.010> have

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
from a purely form standpoint you have

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.530 
from a purely form standpoint you have
strong<00:02:50.519> diagonals<00:02:52.310> driving<00:02:53.310> into<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:54.349> solid

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
strong diagonals driving into a solid

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.009 
strong diagonals driving into a solid
parallel<00:02:59.090> horizontal<00:03:00.090> line<00:03:00.329> that's<00:03:00.810> what

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
parallel horizontal line that's what

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.539 
parallel horizontal line that's what
this<00:03:01.139> picture<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.739> all<00:03:01.919> about<00:03:02.189> it's<00:03:02.370> very

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
this picture is all about it's very

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.550 
this picture is all about it's very
simply<00:03:02.939> put<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.510> then<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.169> have<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.319> couple

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
simply put and then you have a couple

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.800 
simply put and then you have a couple
extra<00:03:04.799> little<00:03:05.219> things<00:03:05.519> going<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.450> just

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
extra little things going on to just

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.470 
extra little things going on to just
kind<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.109> push<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.469> along<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.010> eat<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.430> again<00:03:09.090> I

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
kind of push it along and eat it again I

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.899 
kind of push it along and eat it again I
don't<00:03:09.599> like<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.230> concept<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.829> cropping<00:03:11.129> here

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
don't like the concept of cropping here

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.509 
don't like the concept of cropping here
I<00:03:11.939> don't<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.329> cropping<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:12.959> third<00:03:13.560> out<00:03:13.859> so

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
I don't like cropping this third out so

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.180 
I don't like cropping this third out so
this<00:03:14.939> one<00:03:15.269> line<00:03:15.510> here<00:03:16.019> keeps<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:16.979> in<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.099> game

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
this one line here keeps you in the game

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.800 
this one line here keeps you in the game
and<00:03:17.669> keeps<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.150> heading<00:03:18.449> in<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.659> right

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and keeps you heading in the right

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.539 
and keeps you heading in the right
direction<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.650> keeps<00:03:19.979> you<00:03:20.099> kind<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.370> from

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
direction this keeps you kind of from

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.879 
direction this keeps you kind of from
leading<00:03:21.000> out<00:03:21.150> or<00:03:21.840> leaving<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.379> image<00:03:22.650> from

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
leading out or leaving the image from

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.520 
leading out or leaving the image from
from<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.519> angle<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.599> also<00:03:24.750> have<00:03:25.109> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
from this angle and you also have the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.210 
from this angle and you also have the
railing<00:03:25.979> here<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.959> triangle<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.650> also

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
railing here in this triangle that also

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.520 
railing here in this triangle that also
kind<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:29.639> push<00:03:29.909> you<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.209> here<00:03:30.659> so<00:03:31.139> everything's

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
kind of push you in here so everything's

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.449 
kind of push you in here so everything's
kind<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:32.090> bringing<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.829> right<00:03:34.829> into<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.250> same

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
kind of bringing you right into the same

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.330 
kind of bringing you right into the same
place<00:03:35.760> here's<00:03:36.689> just<00:03:36.959> my<00:03:37.169> messy<00:03:37.650> everything

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
place here's just my messy everything

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.830 
place here's just my messy everything
all<00:03:38.519> at<00:03:38.549> once<00:03:38.699> to<00:03:39.209> make<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.389> look<00:03:39.659> like<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
all at once to make it look like I

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.240 
all at once to make it look like I
really<00:03:40.199> thought<00:03:40.379> it<00:03:40.530> through<00:03:42.079> but<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.349> really

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
really thought it through but I really

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.099 
really thought it through but I really
is<00:03:44.370> true<00:03:44.699> I<00:03:44.849> mean<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.389> this<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.750> where<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
is true I mean that this is where the

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.229 
is true I mean that this is where the
the<00:03:46.409> whole<00:03:46.590> picture<00:03:46.919> is<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.579> pushing<00:03:48.120> you

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
the whole picture is is pushing you

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.369 
the whole picture is is pushing you
towards<00:03:49.729> is<00:03:50.729> it<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.030> great<00:03:51.209> image<00:03:51.540> no<00:03:51.930> it's<00:03:52.229> not

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
towards is it a great image no it's not

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.929 
towards is it a great image no it's not
really<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> great<00:03:52.889> picture<00:03:53.129> but<00:03:53.519> it's

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
really a great picture but it's

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.300 
really a great picture but it's
interesting<00:03:54.239> enough<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.049> when<00:03:55.859> you<00:03:55.949> look<00:03:56.129> at

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
interesting enough and when you look at

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.030 
interesting enough and when you look at
it<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.549> might<00:03:56.729> look<00:03:56.909> twice<00:03:57.209> it's<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.949> know

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
it you might look twice it's you know

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.849 
it you might look twice it's you know
there's<00:03:59.879> pattern<00:04:00.329> there<00:04:00.720> shape<00:04:01.079> there's<00:04:01.439> form

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
there's pattern there shape there's form

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.729 
there's pattern there shape there's form
and<00:04:02.189> there's<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.209> little<00:04:03.359> bit<00:04:03.569> of<00:04:03.599> energy<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:04.319> in

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
and there's a little bit of energy in in

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.469 
and there's a little bit of energy in in
the<00:04:04.859> composition<00:04:05.549> there's<00:04:05.819> not<00:04:06.000> much<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.389> a

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479
