00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.180
 we were with rafael nadal let's see 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.330
 who told us tennis number 1 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.330
 world 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.680
 there is an awareness of intimacy to your 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.690
 rivals do not believe you can not ask 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.680
 I have not expected anything but I do not think 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.680
 intimidate 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.099
 boy thank you for showing me the dream 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:42.260
 the fia says in account john carlin 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.210
 effectively rafa is transformed into the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.070
 court that is not the same inside that 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.640
 outside the most inclusive this one suggests 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.200
 wars 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.440
 Rafael is fearful outside the court of 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.480
 draft if not I'm not the bravest of the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.030
 world off the track again the other 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.880
 artist sometimes so little but I think that 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.760
 the image that people perceive of me 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.469
 inside the track 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.110
 I think if they knew me real life 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.979
 it would change completely because the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.350
 track because people see me as someone 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.049
 I mean passionate as someone is 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.570
 really so very energetic was to the 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:21.180
 track because I am a person more or less 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.180
 quiet that enjoys life 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.410
 and have the feeling of a good line 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.800
 last calm and the image is 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.800
 intimidating there is awareness is natural is 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.980
 in the circuit as we all know each other 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.550
 I am a pretty normal person 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.550
 quiet 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:56.490
 like me at the time of the jump quality 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.530
 good 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.530
 I do not remember 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.299
 to become better that are the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.360
 best in its category and in my case it 's 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.640
 the same obviously general case as the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.730
 case of land fafa is unique in 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.380
 the world system but it provokes with me 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.230
 deaf then when I remember when it is 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.250
 Party continues to play with the 2023 24 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.640
 years is 25 since it can still end as 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.640
 not everything is evolutionary guayanilla 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.180
 if it had not been rafa suddenly 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.640
 number one no no I really do not feel is 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.230
 that I believe that thanks to getting with 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.960
 our generation with rafa 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.990
 will not be worth james murray i think my tennis 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.490
 has evolved and even that is what 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.590
 better tennis player thanks to them I think that 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.330
 if I'm really going to be in the other 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.200
 generation would not have been so too 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.300
 Tennis player goes for the story of 17 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.280
 years so that for what reason is the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.080
 player who wins the most has achieved 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.080
 history that is your goal that is your goal 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.690
 is the day to day the corporal and all my 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.740
 career has gone on day to day week to 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.560
 week year after year and good the record of 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.210
 love, I've always seen it very far away 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.210
 I still see it very far 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.319
 I did not think 227 years as having 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.160
 got everything then got me 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.920
 come I'll try to keep giving it 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.860
 actions through work and hopefully 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.680
 that in the future, I would say in the 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.510
 next you can still have options 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.770
 to compete for problems 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.140
 important when my career ends 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.060
 Well, we'll see where I've been 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.920
 the truth thank you very much thank you was a 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.920
 virus that thanks to a pleasure 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.830
 is the enormous humility of the number one 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.720
 number three in the world that makes them the most 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.220
 big plus the rafa nadal my land 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.320
 where week to week has to 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.950
 keep winning that answered me some 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.950
 time friends
