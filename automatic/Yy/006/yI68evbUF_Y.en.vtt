Kyocera<00:00:06.660> hydro<00:00:08.179> icon<00:00:09.179> now<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.380> these<00:00:11.280> cases

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
Kyocera hydro icon now on these cases

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.010 
Kyocera hydro icon now on these cases
they<00:00:12.450> are<00:00:13.190> these<00:00:14.190> your<00:00:14.309> combo<00:00:14.580> pieces<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.509> it's

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
they are these your combo pieces so it's

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.990 
they are these your combo pieces so it's
not<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.440> case<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.130> stand<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
not just a case but it's a stand it's a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.929 
not just a case but it's a stand it's a
holster<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> belt<00:00:18.990> clip<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.500> everything

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
holster and a belt clip it's everything

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.529 
holster and a belt clip it's everything
now<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.689> video<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:23.210> this<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.330> pretty

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
now on this video you this is pretty

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.339 
now on this video you this is pretty
much<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.470> case<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> about<00:00:26.910> put<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:28.080> clips

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
much the case this is about put it clips

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
much the case this is about put it clips
on<00:00:28.560> both<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.189> way<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.179> go

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
on both this way and then you can go

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.359 
on both this way and then you can go
ahead<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.570> turn<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.470> clips<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.890> this

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
ahead and turn it and it clips on this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.770 
ahead and turn it and it clips on this
way<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.079> put<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.469> two<00:00:34.680> weights<00:00:34.890> and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
way so you can put on two weights and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.049 
way so you can put on two weights and
right<00:00:36.780> over<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:38.129> slide<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.790> off

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
right over here you can slide this off

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.060 
right over here you can slide this off
and<00:00:41.360> this<00:00:42.360> part<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.440> sort<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
and this part right here it sort of is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.500 
and this part right here it sort of is
made<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.120> soft<00:00:45.710> material<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
made out of like this soft material and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.940 
made out of like this soft material and
so<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.690> your<00:00:48.840> piece<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.170> actually<00:00:49.500> inside

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
so when your piece is actually inside

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.650 
so when your piece is actually inside
your<00:00:50.520> screens<00:00:50.789> not<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.360> scratched

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
your screens not going to get scratched

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.180 
your screens not going to get scratched
so<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.199> helps<00:00:52.320> protect<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.039> screen

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
so this just helps protect the screen

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.290 
so this just helps protect the screen
and<00:00:53.850> again<00:00:54.539> right<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> belt<00:00:55.469> clip

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
and again right here is the belt clip

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.189 
and again right here is the belt clip
and<00:00:57.300> right<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:59.480> case<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> case

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and right here is the case now the case

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.959 
and right here is the case now the case
it's<00:01:01.469> made<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.010> two<00:01:02.070> layers<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> material

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it's made up of two layers of material

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.030 
it's made up of two layers of material
there<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> first<00:01:04.260> layer<00:01:04.530> which<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
there is the first layer which is a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.580 
there is the first layer which is a
plastic<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.869> second<00:01:07.470> layer

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
plastic and then there is a second layer

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.370 
plastic and then there is a second layer
which<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.850> silicon<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> go

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
which is the silicon so I'm going to go

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.359 
which is the silicon so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.070> quick<00:01:11.250> show<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:13.369> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
ahead and just really quick show you the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.190 
ahead and just really quick show you the
first<00:01:14.640> layer<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> silicon<00:01:16.170> material

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
first layer this is the silicon material

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.530 
first layer this is the silicon material
it's<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.159> flexible<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.790> soft<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.390> like

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
it's really flexible and soft just like

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.359 
it's really flexible and soft just like
any<00:01:18.720> other<00:01:18.900> silicone<00:01:19.439> case<00:01:19.680> we're<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
any other silicone case we're going to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
any other silicone case we're going to
go<00:01:20.490> ahead<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.820> slide<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.689> phone<00:01:22.080> right
