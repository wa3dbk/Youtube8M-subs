so<00:02:43.690> i<00:02:43.720> am<00:02:43.900> going<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.110> speculate<00:02:44.380> it's<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.800> little

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
so i am going to speculate it's a little

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.410 
so i am going to speculate it's a little
bit<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.160> kind<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.340> theorycrafting<00:02:45.550> but<00:02:46.240> this

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
bit of kind of theorycrafting but this

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.090 
bit of kind of theorycrafting but this
seems<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.750> make<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.990> most<00:02:47.140> sense<00:02:47.350> i<00:02:47.620> would

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
seems to make the most sense i would

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100 
seems to make the most sense i would
imagine<00:02:48.190> given<00:02:48.790> these<00:02:48.970> are<00:02:49.150> an<00:02:49.270> exotic<00:02:49.720> item

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
imagine given these are an exotic item

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.750 
imagine given these are an exotic item
that<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.860> would<00:02:50.980> then<00:02:51.130> use<00:02:51.370> these<00:02:51.580> in

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
that you would then use these in

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.980 
that you would then use these in
conjunction<00:02:52.210> with<00:02:52.300> an<00:02:52.450> item<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:52.810> say<00:02:52.960> for

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
conjunction with an item so say for

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.900 
conjunction with an item so say for
example<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.680> know<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:53.950> where<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.460> knucklehead

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
example you know I where the knucklehead

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.220 
example you know I where the knucklehead
radar<00:02:55.210> I<00:02:55.300> really<00:02:55.570> like<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.050> really

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
radar I really like that it's a really

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.780 
radar I really like that it's a really
cool<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.440> can<00:02:56.620> help<00:02:56.740> me<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.460> would<00:02:57.640> perhaps

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
cool I can help me and I would perhaps

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.250 
cool I can help me and I would perhaps
want<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.120> carry<00:02:58.300> that<00:02:58.360> over<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.080> dark

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
want to carry that over to the dark

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.870 
want to carry that over to the dark
below<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.770> actually<00:03:00.160> have<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.430> as<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.610> viable

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
below and actually have it as a viable

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.730 
below and actually have it as a viable
piece<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.360> gear<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.960> could<00:03:02.110> then<00:03:02.260> use<00:03:02.290> when

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
piece of gear that I could then use when

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.040 
piece of gear that I could then use when
X<00:03:02.920> level<00:03:03.100> 32<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.670> still<00:03:04.150> have<00:03:04.300> an<00:03:04.390> endgame<00:03:04.660> set

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
X level 32 and still have an endgame set

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.870 
X level 32 and still have an endgame set
so<00:03:05.590> if<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.070> then<00:03:06.250> imagine<00:03:06.460> you<00:03:06.700> have

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
so if you then imagine you have

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.580 
so if you then imagine you have
something<00:03:07.210> like<00:03:07.240> an<00:03:07.510> exotic<00:03:07.780> farmer<00:03:08.350> showed

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
something like an exotic farmer showed

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.500 
something like an exotic farmer showed
you<00:03:09.250> then<00:03:09.400> use<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.970> conjunction<00:03:10.090> with

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
you then use that in conjunction with

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.150 
you then use that in conjunction with
your<00:03:10.810> armor<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.680> would<00:03:11.770> then<00:03:11.860> either<00:03:11.950> do

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
your armor and it would then either do

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.800 
your armor and it would then either do
one<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.340> two<00:03:12.430> things<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:13.000> would<00:03:13.120> either<00:03:13.330> add<00:03:13.600> an

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
one of two things it would either add an

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.900 
one of two things it would either add an
additional<00:03:14.530> slot<00:03:14.830> on<00:03:15.040> your<00:03:15.310> operatory

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
additional slot on your operatory

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.310 
additional slot on your operatory
therefore<00:03:16.540> allowing<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.020> spend<00:03:17.260> some

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
therefore allowing you to spend some

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.290 
therefore allowing you to spend some
more<00:03:17.560> shots<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.340> now<00:03:18.459> afraid<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.880> level<00:03:18.970> 32

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
more shots so now afraid it to level 32

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.970 
more shots so now afraid it to level 32
or<00:03:19.720> return<00:03:20.290> ative<00:03:20.470> lee<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.709> will<00:03:20.860> just

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
or return ative lee it will just

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.920 
or return ative lee it will just
outright<00:03:21.340> level<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.730> up<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.970> level<00:03:22.090> 32<00:03:22.390> you

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
outright level it up to level 32 you

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.300 
outright level it up to level 32 you
know<00:03:23.020> for<00:03:23.170> example<00:03:23.230> if<00:03:23.530> you've<00:03:23.650> maxed<00:03:23.980> out<00:03:24.100> a

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
know for example if you've maxed out a

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.460 
know for example if you've maxed out a
all<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.300> these<00:03:25.450> perhaps<00:03:25.630> what<00:03:25.959> you'll<00:03:26.080> see<00:03:26.260> is

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
all of these perhaps what you'll see is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.229 
all of these perhaps what you'll see is
a<00:03:26.800> little<00:03:27.130> slot<00:03:27.370> that's<00:03:27.730> add<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.090> end

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
a little slot that's add it to the end

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.580 
a little slot that's add it to the end
so<00:03:28.420> you'll<00:03:28.570> then<00:03:28.690> go<00:03:28.840> through<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.080> usual<00:03:29.260> pace

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
so you'll then go through the usual pace

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.530 
so you'll then go through the usual pace
you<00:03:29.770> know<00:03:29.860> upgraded<00:03:30.430> offense<00:03:30.700> upgrade<00:03:31.450> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
you know upgraded offense upgrade the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.850 
you know upgraded offense upgrade the
last<00:03:31.690> three<00:03:31.870> slots<00:03:32.080> with<00:03:32.260> all<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.410> shards<00:03:32.650> and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
last three slots with all the shards and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.050 
last three slots with all the shards and
then<00:03:33.130> maybe<00:03:33.370> there'll<00:03:33.550> be<00:03:33.580> an<00:03:33.730> additional

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
then maybe there'll be an additional

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.820 
then maybe there'll be an additional
slot<00:03:34.300> which<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.540> then<00:03:34.690> put<00:03:34.930> an<00:03:35.110> exotic<00:03:35.560> karma

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
slot which you then put an exotic karma

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.530 
slot which you then put an exotic karma
shot<00:03:36.070> in<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.670> then<00:03:36.760> when<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:36.940> put<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.300> here

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
shot in and then when you put it in here

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.940 
shot in and then when you put it in here
then<00:03:37.720> pushed<00:03:37.930> up<00:03:38.080> little<00:03:38.380> 32<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.830> know<00:03:38.920> I

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
then pushed up little 32 you know I

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.990 
then pushed up little 32 you know I
don't<00:03:39.160> know<00:03:39.220> exactly<00:03:39.580> how<00:03:39.730> it's<00:03:39.820> going<00:03:39.940> to

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
don't know exactly how it's going to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000 
don't know exactly how it's going to
work<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.480> think<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.840> idea<00:03:40.870> being<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.560> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
work but I think the idea being that the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.650 
work but I think the idea being that the
exotic<00:03:42.340> are<00:03:42.489> mashhad<00:03:42.790> will<00:03:43.090> be<00:03:43.180> used<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.480> push

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
exotic are mashhad will be used to push

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.900 
exotic are mashhad will be used to push
exotics<00:03:44.170> from<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.650> vanilla<00:03:44.980> game<00:03:45.160> up<00:03:45.580> to

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
exotics from the vanilla game up to

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.330 
exotics from the vanilla game up to
level<00:03:46.030> 32<00:03:46.360> for<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.930> dog<00:03:47.110> below<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:48.130> same

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
level 32 for the dog below the same

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.040 
level 32 for the dog below the same
would<00:03:48.489> then<00:03:48.610> be<00:03:48.760> said<00:03:48.940> for<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.180> weapons<00:03:49.540> so

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
would then be said for the weapons so

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
would then be said for the weapons so
for<00:03:50.230> example<00:03:50.290> if<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.650> have<00:03:50.770> something<00:03:50.950> like

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
for example if you have something like

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.020 
for example if you have something like
the<00:03:51.220> icebreaker<00:03:51.580> I<00:03:51.760> mean<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:51.970> appreciate

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
the icebreaker I mean I appreciate

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.610 
the icebreaker I mean I appreciate
weapons<00:03:52.690> are<00:03:52.780> slightly<00:03:52.959> different<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:53.530> know

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
weapons are slightly different you know

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.750 
weapons are slightly different you know
they're<00:03:53.770> not<00:03:53.860> actually<00:03:53.980> based<00:03:54.280> on<00:03:54.459> your<00:03:54.550> light

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
they're not actually based on your light

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.400 
they're not actually based on your light
level<00:03:55.030> but<00:03:55.420> they<00:03:55.510> do<00:03:55.570> still<00:03:55.840> have<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:56.020> damaged

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
level but they do still have a damaged

level but they do still have a damaged
or<00:03:56.530> attack<00:03:56.800> cap<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.640> if<00:03:57.700> you're<00:03:57.850> then<00:03:58.060> going<00:03:58.180> to

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
or attack cap so if you're then going to

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.910 
or attack cap so if you're then going to
raise<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.510> level<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.810> level<00:03:58.900> 32<00:03:59.260> you're<00:03:59.800> all

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
raise the level to level 32 you're all

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.290 
raise the level to level 32 you're all
going<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.070> want<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.340> weapons<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.790> follow<00:04:01.030> suit

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
going to want the weapons to follow suit

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.670 
going to want the weapons to follow suit
and<00:04:01.420> actually<00:04:01.720> kind<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:01.900> like<00:04:02.020> amp<00:04:02.290> themselves

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
and actually kind of like amp themselves

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.440 
and actually kind of like amp themselves
up<00:04:02.800> in<00:04:03.010> accordance<00:04:03.370> with<00:04:03.459> that<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.270> would

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
up in accordance with that so I would

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.910 
up in accordance with that so I would
then<00:04:04.540> imagine<00:04:04.750> again<00:04:05.140> if<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:05.380> use<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.530> exotic

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
then imagine again if you use the exotic

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.199 
then imagine again if you use the exotic
weapon<00:04:06.160> core<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.550> would<00:04:06.640> either<00:04:06.790> add<00:04:07.060> an

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
weapon core it would either add an

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.490 
weapon core it would either add an
additional<00:04:07.540> slot<00:04:07.959> which<00:04:08.110> you<00:04:08.200> can<00:04:08.350> then<00:04:08.380> spend

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
additional slot which you can then spend

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.830 
additional slot which you can then spend
ascendant<00:04:09.250> energy<00:04:09.550> in<00:04:09.670> alternatively<00:04:10.630> would

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
ascendant energy in alternatively would

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.210 
ascendant energy in alternatively would
just<00:04:11.019> be<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.170> slot<00:04:11.530> for<00:04:11.560> that<00:04:11.769> weapon<00:04:11.890> coal

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
just be a slot for that weapon coal

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.979 
just be a slot for that weapon coal
which<00:04:12.550> would<00:04:12.700> then<00:04:12.820> upgrade<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.900> know

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
which would then upgrade the you know

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.600 
which would then upgrade the you know
the<00:04:14.080> base<00:04:14.230> stats<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:15.070> allow<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.430> have<00:04:15.580> a

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
the base stats and allow you to have a

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.640 
the base stats and allow you to have a
slightly<00:04:15.970> more<00:04:16.150> powerful<00:04:16.570> weapon<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.049> is

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
slightly more powerful weapon it is

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.930 
slightly more powerful weapon it is
worth<00:04:17.799> noting<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.220> right<00:04:18.430> now<00:04:18.549> these<00:04:18.700> are

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
worth noting that right now these are

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.729 
worth noting that right now these are
called<00:04:19.150> exotic<00:04:19.630> weapon<00:04:20.080> cause<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.500> armor

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
called exotic weapon cause and armor

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.590 
called exotic weapon cause and armor
shards<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:21.520> they<00:04:21.640> don't<00:04:21.789> seem<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.120> be<00:04:22.300> anywhere

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600

for<00:04:22.750> like<00:04:22.840> legendary<00:04:23.140> item<00:04:23.470> so<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.650> would<00:04:23.860> still

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
for like legendary item so I would still

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.279 
for like legendary item so I would still
imagine<00:04:24.520> that<00:04:25.090> you're<00:04:25.750> kind<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:25.960> led<00:04:26.140> from<00:04:26.200> the

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
imagine that you're kind of led from the

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:27.120 
imagine that you're kind of led from the
items<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:26.650> have<00:04:26.710> got

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
items you have got

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.830 
items you have got
would<00:04:27.370> potentially<00:04:27.820> become<00:04:28.360> redundant<00:04:28.600> you

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
would potentially become redundant you

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.820 
would potentially become redundant you
know<00:04:28.930> there<00:04:29.080> is<00:04:29.110> still<00:04:29.380> always<00:04:29.530> going<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.800> be

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
know there is still always going to be

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.170 
know there is still always going to be
the<00:04:29.980> element<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.340> kind<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.610> throwaway<00:04:30.880> gear

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
the element of kind of throwaway gear

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.910 
the element of kind of throwaway gear
and<00:04:31.630> so<00:04:31.750> coming<00:04:31.990> back<00:04:32.110> it's<00:04:32.350> always<00:04:32.590> how<00:04:32.740> old

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
and so coming back it's always how old

some kind of transportation mechanic
whereby<00:04:38.170> you<00:04:38.230> can<00:04:38.320> keep<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.680> look<00:04:38.800> of<00:04:38.920> an<00:04:39.010> item

but<00:04:39.460> then<00:04:39.580> still<00:04:39.730> have<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.970> move<00:04:40.090> on<00:04:40.210> either

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
way you are always going to need to

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.930 
way you are always going to need to
upgrade<00:04:41.860> otherwise<00:04:42.280> there's<00:04:42.490> no<00:04:42.520> point<00:04:42.610> you

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
upgrade otherwise there's no point you

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.980 
upgrade otherwise there's no point you
know<00:04:43.030> there's<00:04:43.210> no<00:04:43.330> point<00:04:43.570> just<00:04:43.660> give<00:04:43.870> you

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
know there's no point just give you

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.570 
know there's no point just give you
items<00:04:44.320> where<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:44.920> can<00:04:45.010> just<00:04:45.040> throw<00:04:45.190> them<00:04:45.430> into

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
items where you can just throw them into

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.100 
items where you can just throw them into
something<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.150> then<00:04:46.510> forever<00:04:46.780> keep<00:04:46.960> that

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
something and then forever keep that

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.480 
something and then forever keep that
same<00:04:47.260> gear<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:47.680> there<00:04:47.800> will<00:04:47.890> always<00:04:48.130> be<00:04:48.220> that

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
same gear so there will always be that

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.100 
same gear so there will always be that
element<00:04:48.820> of<00:04:48.940> throwaway<00:04:49.210> gear<00:04:49.510> especially

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
element of throwaway gear especially

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.660 
element of throwaway gear especially
when<00:04:50.200> you<00:04:50.350> see<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.800> know<00:04:50.830> quoted<00:04:51.370> in<00:04:51.490> has

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
when you see that you know quoted in has

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.550 
when you see that you know quoted in has
two<00:04:51.820> tiers<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.150> gear<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:52.570> also<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.320> bottle

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
two tiers of gear and also the bottle

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.020 
two tiers of gear and also the bottle
glass<00:04:53.740> does<00:04:53.980> have<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.220> second<00:04:54.550> tier<00:04:54.700> which<00:04:54.850> has

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
glass does have a second tier which has

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.330 
glass does have a second tier which has
yet<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.330> be<00:04:55.420> added<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.230> I<00:04:56.470> would<00:04:56.860> imagine<00:04:57.070> there

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
yet to be added so I would imagine there

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.500 
yet to be added so I would imagine there
will<00:04:57.430> still<00:04:57.610> come<00:04:57.820> points<00:04:58.120> where<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.300> have<00:04:58.420> to

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
will still come points where you have to

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.850 
will still come points where you have to
use<00:04:58.660> that<00:04:58.690> gear<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.350> get<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.620> certain<00:04:59.710> level

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
use that gear to get to a certain level

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.380 
use that gear to get to a certain level
and<00:05:00.280> then<00:05:00.580> throw<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:00.880> away<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.030> start<00:05:01.180> all

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
and then throw it away and start all

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.020 
and then throw it away and start all
over<00:05:01.450> again<00:05:01.570> so<00:05:02.080> these<00:05:02.980> are<00:05:03.040> as<00:05:03.430> we<00:05:03.670> understand

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
over again so these are as we understand

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.000 
over again so these are as we understand
at<00:05:04.150> this<00:05:04.240> point<00:05:04.510> only<00:05:04.690> for<00:05:05.230> exotic<00:05:05.680> weapons

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
at this point only for exotic weapons

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.040 
at this point only for exotic weapons
and<00:05:06.190> exotic<00:05:06.550> armor<00:05:06.850> but<00:05:07.180> either<00:05:07.300> way<00:05:07.480> that<00:05:07.840> is

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
and exotic armor but either way that is
