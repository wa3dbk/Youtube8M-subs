00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 so now here is a tutorial an update to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.480
 where all the great thing I had ever 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.370
 when pilot is understood is shows 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.719
 here again I'm still too 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.369
 So this time, hear from steam 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.750
 download the left one 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.779
 but I believe the description 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.070
 most people have been anyway 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.660
 so if I started it for him 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.439
 you're up here too 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.710
 play on tabs and the tab 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.800
 measures source sdk base2006 and source sdk 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.280
 you can find it until 2007 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 usually somewhere down here me 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.590
 have downloaded the ye shall 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.879
 this file down there I can do that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.789
 package, of course, also the link 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.170
 in the description that will 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.680
 downloaded and installed this 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.780
 exe file here is usually 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.390
 by default the steam folder is specified 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.470
 if not soon from the folder thanks 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.619
 steam app stores mods and g9 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:12.570
 to install 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.189
 for that, it must be finished so after 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.409
 we have the installed you go in 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:26.340

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:27.299

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.850
 after you have that installed open 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.060

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.470
 any important that time was not something 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.340
 little shit that would be 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.200
 you do not need that is dirt and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 windows 7 reports to me constantly that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.470
 the file is not installed correctly 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.890

 There are a lot of folders in there and one 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.070

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.149

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.310
 There you have a lot of stuff 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.450

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.830
 fey who has now marked 220 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.400
 by default 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.180
 just a 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.510
 the whole store you can then you 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:31.980
 close and then you have to steam 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:35.520
 Just start again so to play 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.970

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.340
 it was already the game 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.340
 as far as whole could start now 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.560
 96 is fully functional, I say 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.560
