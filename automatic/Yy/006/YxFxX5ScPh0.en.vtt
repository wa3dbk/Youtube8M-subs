00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.230 
it's got like a sticky mouthfeel you
know<00:02:39.480> sugary<00:02:40.170> type<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.830> thing<00:02:41.010> yeah<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:42.060> not

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
know sugary type of thing yeah it's not

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.160 
know sugary type of thing yeah it's not
like<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> huge<00:02:43.340> beer<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.520> mean<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.240> don't

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
like a huge beer I mean it is I don't

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.449 
like a huge beer I mean it is I don't
want<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.350> say<00:02:46.440> thin<00:02:46.709> because<00:02:46.920> it's<00:02:47.160> nowhere

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
want to say thin because it's nowhere

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.730 
want to say thin because it's nowhere
near<00:02:47.490> thin<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.690> helps<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.080> carbonation<00:02:49.590> on

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
near thin but it helps of carbonation on

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.120 
near thin but it helps of carbonation on
this<00:02:49.920> night<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:51.410> think<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.470> carbonation<00:02:53.040> is

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
this night I think the carbonation is

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.660 
this night I think the carbonation is
good<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.550> don't<00:02:53.910> like<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.090> very<00:02:54.420> heavily

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
good I don't like a very heavily

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.220 
good I don't like a very heavily
carbonated<00:02:56.670> beer<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.420> think<00:02:57.780> they<00:02:58.050> got<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
carbonated beer so I think they got the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.380 
carbonated beer so I think they got the
carbonation<00:02:58.860> right<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.370> now<00:02:59.760> there's<00:03:00.120> very

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
carbonation right on it now there's very

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.820 
carbonation right on it now there's very
little<00:03:00.630> now<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.590> I'm<00:03:01.680> getting<00:03:06.560> all<00:03:07.560> right<00:03:07.650> as

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
