00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.700
 Yes 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.160
 hello welcome to caradisiac motorcycle 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.540
 we are on the circuit of pride 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.950
 left-handed I can assure you that it does 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.860
 very cold to try today 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.590
 this new machine the husqvarna 500 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.450
 smr aesthetic members well at first 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.600
 look that this bike is a super 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.460
 100% biker I explain myself flagship plate 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.830
 minimalist flashers present for 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.380
 the homologation the counter right there for 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.330
 the shrine and tanks of 8.5 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.520
 you forget the concessions and the envy 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.309
 to take Madame to deauville with the mrc 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.019
 stripped of the side in sports 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.940
 sporty one can say that the eye of the 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.070
 owner is flattered on all sides 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.010
 marzocchi fork and shock absorber sachs 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.489
 adjustable in all directions of disc braking 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.830
 320 mm pinched by a radial brembo caliper 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.530
 titanium exhaust line that 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.890
 of humor on the engine side, however, we will 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.710
 a little more head 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.320
 good with bmw did not do that good 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.260
 exit the old cross blocks of 450 and 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.950
 570 the last one takes over the engine 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.900
 of the g450x of the German mark 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 made for the occasion at 477 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.130
 cubic centimeters the mono is endowed 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.590
 of an electronic injection and all 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.930
 two mappings the smr also has 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 of the pronounced cts gottschalk reich a 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.009
 system that allows you to keep a 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.020
 identical chain tension and more 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.979
 constant under the constraint improving 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.229
 so motor skills 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.060
 do not look for the constraint or the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.220
 motricity on these images she does not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.170
 will nowhere be a reason for that 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.479
 the original pneumatic ride on this 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.440
 machine is an unnamed catastrophe and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.479
 I weigh my words 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.310
 whether on the route of pride 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.899
 left-handed or on the road for near 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.880
 two days of testing we never 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.740
 been exploited agility and power 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.929
 of this machine because of pirelli 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.360
 diablo corsa equipping this machine 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.820
 impossible to harness the power of the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.350
 block bmw yet everything is progressive 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.360
 in its revs 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.910
 with excellent performance and a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.769
 substantial power displacement each 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.690
 angle socket will result in a loss 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.690
 from the front or from an exit square 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.150
 we loved what we did not like about 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.530
 caradisiac place summarizes very quickly 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.510
 we did not like the first thing 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.269
 it's that damn crutches I you 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.680
 watch 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.769
 you understood automatic recall 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.660
 it's the worst thing to put 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.010
 your hairy ode to the second thing 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.250
 we did not like at caradisiac 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.930
 if this saddle besides replace it with 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.370
 a piece of wood I do not see what 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.900
 could be really much more 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.430
 comfortable what we liked at 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.090
 caradisiac you know that in full this 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.569
 machine because the supermotard on a 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.030
 circuit 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.390
 even when it's cold it's great 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.250
 why it slips it moves its life the 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.160
 engine is powerful no one 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.790
 particular point that we liked it 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.790
 all 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.200
 no
