which<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.030> well<00:00:36.870> kind<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.260> weird<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.440> all

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
which is well kind of weird and with all
that<00:00:40.770> weirdness<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:42.030> guess<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.540> they

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
that weirdness going on my guess is they

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.930 
that weirdness going on my guess is they
accidentally<00:00:43.680> made<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.129> ten<00:00:44.370> million<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
accidentally made up of ten million of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.340 
accidentally made up of ten million of
these<00:00:45.030> canisters<00:00:46.670> with<00:00:47.670> no<00:00:48.539> mash'ems<00:00:49.200> in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
these canisters with no mash'ems in

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.369 
these canisters with no mash'ems in
there<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.280> said<00:00:50.940> oh<00:00:51.180> boy<00:00:51.780> we're<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.260> gonna

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
there and said oh boy we're not gonna

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.160 
there and said oh boy we're not gonna
break<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.129> open<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.020> shove<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
break them all open and shove the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.990 
break them all open and shove the
mash'ems<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.829> them<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.699> that's<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
mash'ems in them now because that's a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.670 
mash'ems in them now because that's a
lot<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.180> trouble<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.750> we'll<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.170> slap<00:00:58.500> them

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
