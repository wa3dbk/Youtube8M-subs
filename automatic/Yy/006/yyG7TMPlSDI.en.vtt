interesting to see them actually do this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.049 
interesting to see them actually do this
because<00:00:58.829> previously<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.460> attitude<00:00:59.879> has<00:01:00.030> been

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
because previously the attitude has been

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
because previously the attitude has been
pretty<00:01:00.449> lacks<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.829> know<00:01:01.920> sure<00:01:02.190> whatever

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
pretty lacks like you know sure whatever

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
pretty lacks like you know sure whatever

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
just share with each other yeah it seems

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.890 
just share with each other yeah it seems
like<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.549> wanted<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.360> saturate

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
like what they wanted to do was saturate

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
like what they wanted to do was saturate
the<00:01:07.080> market<00:01:07.110> first<00:01:07.799> that's<00:01:08.490> why<00:01:08.640> they're<00:01:08.790> not

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the market first that's why they're not

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.609 
the market first that's why they're not
cracking<00:01:09.180> down<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.630> want<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> build<00:01:10.320> up
