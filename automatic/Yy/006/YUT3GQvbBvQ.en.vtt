00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.460
 video and dota 2 that's it guys at the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 yoke 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.890
 here I am doing the tutorial 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.859
 schumi, how about giving a 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.449
 Looked at stock was very sinister 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.730
 tokyo cities note 2 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.800
 let's look here only 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 You're pretty much into it. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.210
 let's talk a little of that hero here 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 notice 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.890
 when the first skill to see this is him 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 She does what she calls empty here. 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 gain on the enemy is the xbox before speaking 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.450
 some of the scheme is based on the strong 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.239
 when I came at night he came at night 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.820
 all your rights if you improve the tone 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.510
 so that is first skill the duration 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.760
 her 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.500
 the duration of the motion delay 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.440
 attack lasted two seconds at the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.600
 night in zone 4 and damage ranging from 90 to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.770
 315 exam 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.070
 This is the damage assessment, let's go to 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:10.740
 the second skill the second skill is a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:23.869
 before doing second skills is only yours 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:34.049
 mona a hero here turned enemy the kiss 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:35.250
 for here in the sinister logic until 25 years 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.030
 considered mild 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.829
 4 there is the description here plus or 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.340
 to the science that during the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.009
 day 23 seconds only during the night lasts 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.040
 eight seconds take the maximum and the chance of 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:02:06.049
 If the error goes out from 10 during the day to 40% 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:06.049
 still face of the mass - customer and rouen 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:20.660
 I remember being worth less customer 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:24.380
 turned on 20 maggi and neither was the song 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.160
 beating cedaw half a day but still 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.520
 have a chance to go to a serious club in 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.340
 Dana Mashaie and let's go to the third 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.980
 very passive session that makes your 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.860
 site stalk increase your movement 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.160
 during night movement speed 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.350
 increases attack speed by 35% 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.480
 75% takes at most or is his forte 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.370
 at night as his strong at night team 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.320
 it does nothing more than transform the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.170
 day to night 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.520
 night looks Speed see how it goes 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.600
 This one without having any but looks the difference 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.720
 speed is insane running well 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.060
 more to them some who will have to have the 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.220
 sisters say stronger here at 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.769
 movement flap and vice versa and 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.060
 also father who beats faster and 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.950
 faster than normal and the 15 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.340
 This is the order galerinha gave to skill 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.810
 is our focus is usually it only 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.700
 because he is an excellent singer, right? 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.120
 so it ends up sounding media like you 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.530
 if you saw in the 9th dp creek 3 that 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.450
 had a game that the selection played with 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.060
 Alex plays and rolls 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.709
 he is an excellent soil miss is the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.190
 order of this judgment peace 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.830
 I usually father I usually for a light and 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.010
 designs but not the first hand 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.230
 first public vod college said 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.040
 that this emptiness to dani 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.440
 then college says alice and and canada 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.530
 passive concussion a light car prey 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.980
 after good maximizing here 3 4 and 5 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.080
 ac maximizes and one of each leads you not 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.540
 catch ultimate yet I can put you 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.140
 another passive and then I go 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.390
 maximizing ultimate passive ovoid 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.340
 the last sales alice takes one because the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.530
 Always motivation with you 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.540
 but to see if this issue of items 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.580
 facebook is very good because it ends 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.830
 a step in this system but giving way 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.090
 cool make the marks the blade all these 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.550
 recommended items are good in that the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.370

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.530
 he who has he has the vision is 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.720
 he has the vision during the night he 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.950
 You can see the hero anywhere 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.260
 that the alien can see the hero 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.150
 so it 's kind of insane 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.850
 it ensures excellent vision during 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.770
 At night, the day is good for him too. 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.810
