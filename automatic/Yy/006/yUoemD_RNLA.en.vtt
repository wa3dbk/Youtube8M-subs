differential<00:00:47.120> dip<00:00:47.660> friends<00:00:47.960> you<00:00:48.050> want<00:00:48.199> to

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
differential dip friends you want to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.930 
differential dip friends you want to
shake<00:00:48.379> different<00:00:49.190> difference<00:00:49.699> y'all

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
shake different difference y'all

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.030 
shake different difference y'all
difference<00:00:50.600> y'all<00:00:50.780> from<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.620> south<00:00:51.800> right

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
difference y'all from the south right

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.500 
difference y'all from the south right
yeah<00:00:52.280> different<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:52.760> if<00:00:53.120> you're<00:00:53.239> flying<00:00:53.390> a

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
yeah different so if you're flying a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.299 
yeah different so if you're flying a
plane<00:00:53.629> from<00:00:53.839> the<00:00:53.900> south<00:00:54.199> I<00:00:54.440> can't<00:00:55.010> even<00:00:55.100> go

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
plane from the south I can't even go

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.650 
plane from the south I can't even go
that<00:00:55.460> can't<00:00:55.699> I<00:00:55.879> can't<00:00:56.150> try<00:00:56.269> to<00:00:56.329> make<00:00:56.420> that<00:00:56.600> work

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
that can't I can't try to make that work

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.479 
that can't I can't try to make that work
I'm<00:00:56.900> sorry

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
I'm sorry

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.829 
I'm sorry
differential<00:00:58.489> differential<00:00:59.059> differential

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
differential differential differential

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.049 
differential differential differential
yes<00:01:00.290> singular<00:01:00.710> alright<00:01:01.250> basically<00:01:01.790> one<00:01:01.909> thing

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
yes singular alright basically one thing

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.520 
yes singular alright basically one thing
I<00:01:02.089> guess<00:01:02.239> with<00:01:02.360> differential<00:01:02.780> is<00:01:02.930> it's<00:01:03.440> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
I guess with differential is it's the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.049 
I guess with differential is it's the
difference<00:01:03.920> between<00:01:03.979> planes<00:01:04.670> and

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
difference between planes and

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.180 
difference between planes and
helicopters<00:01:05.180> helicopters<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:06.590> boats<00:01:06.650> boats

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
helicopters helicopters and boats boats

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.820 
helicopters helicopters and boats boats
and<00:01:07.430> cars<00:01:07.659> difference<00:01:08.659> yeah<00:01:09.670> no<00:01:10.670> it's<00:01:10.850> not

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
and cars difference yeah no it's not

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.660 
and cars difference yeah no it's not
basically<00:01:12.830> what<00:01:13.040> you<00:01:13.159> got<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:13.430> here's<00:01:13.610> a

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
basically what you got on here's a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.520 
basically what you got on here's a
circumstance<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.780> an<00:01:14.930> airplane<00:01:15.260> with

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
circumstance you have an airplane with

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.990 
circumstance you have an airplane with
ailerons<00:01:15.950> on<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.250> outer<00:01:16.369> portions<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
ailerons on the outer portions of the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.080 
ailerons on the outer portions of the
winxs<00:01:17.270> oftentimes<00:01:17.780> things<00:01:18.049> like<00:01:18.200> paper<00:01:18.530> cups

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
winxs oftentimes things like paper cups

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.370 
winxs oftentimes things like paper cups
pattern<00:01:20.090> ships<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:20.390> matter<00:01:20.600> 3d<00:01:20.960> planes<00:01:21.229> guy

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
pattern ships that matter 3d planes guy

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.140 
pattern ships that matter 3d planes guy
just<00:01:21.799> differential<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.790> can<00:01:22.909> sail

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
just differential and you can sail

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.179 
just differential and you can sail
planes<00:01:23.479> for<00:01:24.049> that<00:01:24.140> matter<00:01:24.290> also<00:01:24.500> flying<00:01:24.920> wings

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
planes for that matter also flying wings

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.890 
planes for that matter also flying wings
without<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.610> fence<00:01:25.850> oftentimes<00:01:26.659> you'll<00:01:26.810> have

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
without the fence oftentimes you'll have

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.240 
without the fence oftentimes you'll have
to<00:01:26.990> make<00:01:27.140> some<00:01:27.259> adjustments<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.710> differential

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
to make some adjustments to differential

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.830 
to make some adjustments to differential
this<00:01:28.790> is<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.000> sail<00:01:29.210> plane<00:01:29.390> obvious<00:01:29.689> it's

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
this is a sail plane obvious it's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.600 
this is a sail plane obvious it's
borderline<00:01:30.140> hot<00:01:30.439> liner<00:01:30.650> as<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.250> can<00:01:31.370> see<00:01:31.490> the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
borderline hot liner as you can see the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.580 
borderline hot liner as you can see the
ailerons<00:01:31.970> on<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.270> outer<00:01:32.390> portions<00:01:32.870> what<00:01:33.470> we

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
ailerons on the outer portions what we

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.960 
ailerons on the outer portions what we
want<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.890> always<00:01:34.100> get<00:01:34.220> when<00:01:34.370> we<00:01:34.460> have<00:01:34.490> ailerons

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
want to always get when we have ailerons

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.940 
want to always get when we have ailerons
is<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.150> true<00:01:35.390> axial<00:01:35.900> roll<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.470> don't<00:01:36.680> want<00:01:36.830> the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
is a true axial roll you don't want the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.190 
is a true axial roll you don't want the
plane<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.310> Bank<00:01:37.550> off<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:38.450> give<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:38.900> awkward

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
plane to Bank off and give you awkward

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.230 
plane to Bank off and give you awkward
angles<00:01:39.530> will<00:01:39.620> never<00:01:39.740> use<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.130> ailerons<00:01:40.850> cuz

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
angles will never use the ailerons cuz

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.520 
angles will never use the ailerons cuz
then<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.390> gotta<00:01:41.600> correspond<00:01:42.050> with<00:01:42.170> rudder

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
then you gotta correspond with rudder

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.260 
then you gotta correspond with rudder
well<00:01:42.890> sometimes<00:01:43.250> planes<00:01:43.520> don't<00:01:43.760> have<00:01:43.909> rudders

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
well sometimes planes don't have rudders

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.610 
well sometimes planes don't have rudders
this<00:01:44.420> one<00:01:44.570> doesn't<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:45.110> one<00:01:45.290> does<00:01:45.440> not<00:01:45.560> have

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
this one doesn't this one does not have

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.020 
this one doesn't this one does not have
a<00:01:45.740> rudder<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.250> know<00:01:46.340> what<00:01:46.550> we<00:01:46.880> have<00:01:46.970> a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
a rudder but you know what we have a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.399 
a rudder but you know what we have a
computerized<00:01:47.420> radio<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.080> that's<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.290> good

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
computerized radio and that's a good

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.170 
computerized radio and that's a good
thing<00:01:48.470> because<00:01:48.800> basically<00:01:49.490> what<00:01:49.820> we<00:01:49.940> can<00:01:50.090> do

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
thing because basically what we can do

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.850 
thing because basically what we can do
is<00:01:50.300> we<00:01:50.390> can<00:01:50.480> tell<00:01:50.659> this<00:01:50.780> plane<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.500> lift<00:01:51.680> up

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
is we can tell this plane to lift up

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.440 
is we can tell this plane to lift up
this<00:01:51.980> aileron<00:01:52.400> more<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:52.820> Sailor<00:01:53.090> unless

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
this aileron more and the Sailor unless

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.940 
this aileron more and the Sailor unless
you<00:01:53.659> want<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.870> know<00:01:53.930> why<00:01:54.050> we<00:01:54.170> do<00:01:54.320> that<00:01:54.440> because

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
you want to know why we do that because

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.550 
you want to know why we do that because
we<00:01:55.400> can<00:01:55.729> because<00:01:56.120> we<00:01:56.479> can't<00:01:56.780> difference<00:01:57.320> y'all

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
we can because we can't difference y'all

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.130 
we can because we can't difference y'all
here's<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.460> circumstance<00:01:59.060> basically<00:01:59.840> when

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
here's a circumstance basically when

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.480 
here's a circumstance basically when
you're<00:02:00.290> flying<00:02:00.470> an<00:02:00.650> airplane<00:02:00.800> like<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:01.130> and

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
you're flying an airplane like this and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.890 
you're flying an airplane like this and
you<00:02:01.760> give<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.090> law<00:02:02.270> run<00:02:02.390> normally<00:02:02.630> this

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
you give it a law run normally this

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.750 
you give it a law run normally this
aileron<00:02:03.260> goes<00:02:03.440> up<00:02:03.680> which<00:02:04.159> is<00:02:04.310> forcing<00:02:04.670> this

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
aileron goes up which is forcing this

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.490 
aileron goes up which is forcing this
wing<00:02:04.940> down<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:05.270> one<00:02:05.479> goes<00:02:05.720> down<00:02:05.750> which<00:02:06.380> is

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
wing down this one goes down which is

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.020 
wing down this one goes down which is
forcing<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.860> swing<00:02:07.010> up<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.400> bank's<00:02:07.580> okay

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
forcing to swing up and the bank's okay

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.270 
forcing to swing up and the bank's okay
here's<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.720> problem<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.470> bites<00:02:09.799> more<00:02:10.099> air

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
here's the problem this bites more air

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.949 
here's the problem this bites more air
which<00:02:10.580> oftentimes<00:02:11.120> causes<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.629> bank<00:02:11.810> but

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
which oftentimes causes the bank but

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.990 
which oftentimes causes the bank but
also<00:02:12.140> causes<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.650> swing<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.980> drag<00:02:13.220> which<00:02:13.730> pulls

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
also causes a swing to drag which pulls

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.430 
also causes a swing to drag which pulls
it<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.239> way<00:02:14.450> yeah<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.019> gives<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.290> something

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
it this way yeah it gives you something

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.809 
it this way yeah it gives you something
called<00:02:15.530> adverse<00:02:16.040> yaw<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.549> want<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.730> guess

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
called adverse yaw you want to guess

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.449 
called adverse yaw you want to guess
with<00:02:16.940> adverse<00:02:17.209> yaw<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.599> adverse<00:02:18.349> y'all<00:02:18.680> do<00:02:19.370> you

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
with adverse yaw is adverse y'all do you

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.949 
with adverse yaw is adverse y'all do you
like<00:02:19.610> those<00:02:19.819> southern<00:02:20.120> terms<00:02:20.299> don't<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.750> have

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
like those southern terms don't you have

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.960 
like those southern terms don't you have
adverse<00:02:21.500> yaw<00:02:21.739> is<00:02:21.980> basically<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.519> just<00:02:22.790> showed

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
adverse yaw is basically I just showed

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.699 
adverse yaw is basically I just showed
you<00:02:23.120> basically<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.569> wingtip<00:02:24.140> even<00:02:24.620> though

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
you basically this wingtip even though

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.899 
you basically this wingtip even though
it's<00:02:24.830> going<00:02:25.040> up<00:02:25.129> is<00:02:25.280> catching<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.790> it's

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
it's going up is catching and it's

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.430 
it's going up is catching and it's
actually<00:02:26.260> counteracting<00:02:27.260> with<00:02:27.379> the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
actually counteracting with the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.720 
actually counteracting with the
direction<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.890> probably<00:02:28.190> would<00:02:28.340> like<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.519> go

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
direction you probably would like to go

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.640 
direction you probably would like to go
or<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> orientation<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.870> airplane<00:02:30.200> this

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
or the orientation of the airplane this

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.780 
or the orientation of the airplane this
is<00:02:30.830> when<00:02:30.950> they<00:02:31.040> also<00:02:31.190> need<00:02:31.400> have<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.580> start

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
is when they also need have to start

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.699 
is when they also need have to start
shoving<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.450> rudder<00:02:32.659> than<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.260> get<00:02:33.379> this<00:02:33.530> nose

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
shoving and rudder than to get this nose

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.170 
shoving and rudder than to get this nose
around<00:02:34.069> because<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.459> adverse<00:02:34.760> yaw<00:02:34.939> is

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
around because you adverse yaw is

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.970 
around because you adverse yaw is
causing<00:02:35.719> to<00:02:35.810> want<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.019> turn<00:02:36.079> to<00:02:36.139> the<00:02:36.230> left<00:02:36.379> it's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
causing to want to turn to the left it's

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.170 
causing to want to turn to the left it's
the<00:02:37.069> tendency<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:37.579> the<00:02:37.760> nose<00:02:37.939> of<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.150> plane

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
the tendency for the nose of the plane

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.600 
the tendency for the nose of the plane
to<00:02:38.450> pitch<00:02:38.659> to<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
to pitch to the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.670 
to pitch to the
wings<00:02:40.000> that's<00:02:40.270> dropping<00:02:40.540> Neil<00:02:40.870> around<00:02:41.230> Sarris

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
wings that's dropping Neil around Sarris

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.790 
wings that's dropping Neil around Sarris
yawing<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:43.000> look<00:02:43.150> Nolan<00:02:43.360> go<00:02:43.780> ahead<00:02:43.900> I'm<00:02:44.500> okay

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
yawing you look Nolan go ahead I'm okay

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.720 
yawing you look Nolan go ahead I'm okay
how<00:02:45.220> do<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.340> done<00:02:45.460> now

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
how do you done now

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.040 
how do you done now
yep<00:02:45.880> do<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.360> wake<00:02:46.540> do<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.720> need<00:02:46.810> some<00:02:46.930> coffee

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
yep do you wake do you need some coffee

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.050 
yep do you wake do you need some coffee
good<00:02:47.350> okay<00:02:47.800> we're<00:02:47.950> good<00:02:48.130> there's<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.700> simple

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
good okay we're good there's a simple

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.180 
good okay we're good there's a simple
way<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.180> overcome<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:49.930> problem<00:02:50.190> basically

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
way to overcome this problem basically

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.380 
way to overcome this problem basically
when<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.340> program<00:02:51.670> your<00:02:51.700> differential<00:02:52.270> what

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
when you program your differential what

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.640 
when you program your differential what
your<00:02:52.570> program<00:02:53.020> is<00:02:53.140> going<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.350> be<00:02:53.440> programming

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
your program is going to be programming

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.040 
your program is going to be programming
one<00:02:54.400> nail<00:02:54.520> around<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.880> go<00:02:55.000> down<00:02:55.210> last<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.810> one

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
one nail around to go down last and one

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.690 
one nail around to go down last and one
nailer<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.530> go<00:02:56.620> up<00:02:56.740> more<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.280> obviously

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
nailer on to go up more and obviously

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.220 
nailer on to go up more and obviously
goes<00:02:57.850> both<00:02:58.090> weight<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.540> whenever<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.930> give<00:02:59.200> a

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
goes both weight so whenever I give a

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.840 
goes both weight so whenever I give a
write<00:02:59.500> input<00:02:59.830> this<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.460> going<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.640> be<00:03:00.700> pushing

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
write input this is going to be pushing

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.430 
write input this is going to be pushing
this<00:03:01.000> wing<00:03:01.180> down<00:03:01.360> this<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:01.990> going<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.200> also<00:03:02.290> be

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
this wing down this is going to also be

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.050 
this wing down this is going to also be
pushing<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:02.860> wing<00:03:03.040> up<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.700> drag<00:03:03.910> is

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
pushing this wing up but the drag is

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.480 
pushing this wing up but the drag is
gonna<00:03:04.240> be<00:03:04.390> sufficiently<00:03:04.900> less<00:03:05.170> okay<00:03:05.740> now<00:03:06.130> on

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
gonna be sufficiently less okay now on

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.220 
gonna be sufficiently less okay now on
my<00:03:06.760> final<00:03:07.090> one<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.270> got<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.420> really<00:03:07.660> big<00:03:07.840> finally

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
my final one I got a really big finally

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.810 
my final one I got a really big finally
at<00:03:08.380> home<00:03:08.500> it's<00:03:08.680> legit<00:03:09.010> flying<00:03:09.220> with<00:03:09.459> no<00:03:09.610> wing

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
at home it's legit flying with no wing

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.060 
at home it's legit flying with no wing
plates<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.300> actually<00:03:10.930> have<00:03:11.260> where<00:03:11.709> this<00:03:11.860> only

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
plates I actually have where this only

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.470 
plates I actually have where this only
goes<00:03:12.280> up<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:12.760> doesn't<00:03:13.000> move<00:03:13.209> at<00:03:13.390> all

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
goes up and this doesn't move at all

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.690 
goes up and this doesn't move at all
because<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.080> adverse<00:03:14.709> yaw<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.220> great<00:03:15.490> and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
because the adverse yaw is so great and

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.270 
because the adverse yaw is so great and
it's<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.300> far<00:03:16.510> out<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.750> wing<00:03:16.930> tips<00:03:17.280> it's

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's so far out in the wing tips it's

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.220 
it's so far out in the wing tips it's
near<00:03:18.730> impossible<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:19.300> fly<00:03:19.450> unless<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.930> have

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
near impossible to fly unless you have

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.900 
near impossible to fly unless you have
differential<00:03:20.680> program<00:03:21.040> dental<00:03:21.400> gotcha

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
differential program dental gotcha

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.540 
differential program dental gotcha
gotcha<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.720> basically<00:03:23.110> let<00:03:23.800> me<00:03:23.890> show<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.400> the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
gotcha so basically let me show to the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.190 
gotcha so basically let me show to the
side<00:03:24.670> this<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.090> gonna<00:03:25.209> go<00:03:25.360> up<00:03:25.540> push<00:03:25.900> your<00:03:26.080> wing

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
side this is gonna go up push your wing

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.500 
side this is gonna go up push your wing
down<00:03:26.350> this<00:03:26.830> is<00:03:26.980> gonna<00:03:27.100> go<00:03:27.310> down<00:03:27.340> less<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.090> then

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
down this is gonna go down less and then

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.449 
down this is gonna go down less and then
most<00:03:28.750> drag<00:03:29.050> lets<00:03:29.350> drag<00:03:29.590> on<00:03:29.800> this<00:03:29.890> wing<00:03:30.100> you<00:03:30.250> got

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
most drag lets drag on this wing you got

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.920 
most drag lets drag on this wing you got
it<00:03:30.640> me<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:30.910> got<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.270> couldn't<00:03:31.540> said<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.810> better

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
it me and got it couldn't said it better

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.930 
it me and got it couldn't said it better
now<00:03:32.290> one<00:03:32.650> nice<00:03:32.800> thing<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.400> depend<00:03:33.730> on<00:03:33.790> your

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
now one nice thing is is depend on your

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.699 
now one nice thing is is depend on your
flying<00:03:34.090> with<00:03:34.270> different<00:03:34.540> speeds<00:03:34.780> adverse<00:03:35.560> yaw

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
flying with different speeds adverse yaw

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.320 
flying with different speeds adverse yaw
is<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:35.950> different<00:03:36.250> effect<00:03:36.459> with<00:03:36.760> most<00:03:36.970> computer

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
is a different effect with most computer

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.910 
is a different effect with most computer
radios<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.989> can<00:03:38.140> switch<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.560> on<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.860> switch

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
radios you can switch it on and switch

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.229 
radios you can switch it on and switch
it<00:03:39.160> off<00:03:39.250> depend<00:03:39.550> on<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.670> kind<00:03:39.850> of<00:03:39.910> flying<00:03:40.120> you

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
it off depend on the kind of flying you

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.490 
it off depend on the kind of flying you
want<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.480> do<00:03:40.600> okay<00:03:41.020> okay

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
want to do okay okay

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.810 
want to do okay okay
also<00:03:41.860> nice<00:03:41.980> thing<00:03:42.190> if<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.370> have<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.520> plane<00:03:42.700> that

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
also nice thing if you have a plane that

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.270 
also nice thing if you have a plane that
you<00:03:42.910> always<00:03:43.120> have<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.390> mix<00:03:43.570> rudder<00:03:44.410> on<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:45.040> fly

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
you always have to mix rudder on to fly

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.110 
you always have to mix rudder on to fly
it<00:03:45.340> where<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.700> want<00:03:45.850> such<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:45.970> flight

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
it where you want such a flight

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.759 
it where you want such a flight
coordinated<00:03:46.540> oftentimes<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.350> Pienaar<00:03:47.650> don't

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
coordinated oftentimes the Pienaar don't

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:48.990 
coordinated oftentimes the Pienaar don't
do<00:03:47.830> differential<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.400> can<00:03:48.549> make<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:48.880> it's

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
do differential you can make it so it's

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.050 
do differential you can make it so it's
pretty<00:03:49.180> much<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:50.070> banking<00:03:51.070> yeah<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:51.670> can<00:03:51.940> you

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
pretty much a banking yeah you can you

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.000 
pretty much a banking yeah you can you
ain't<00:03:52.180> careful<00:03:52.360> yes<00:03:52.989> we're<00:03:53.350> learning<00:03:53.500> we<00:03:53.980> are

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
ain't careful yes we're learning we are

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.500 
ain't careful yes we're learning we are
learning<00:03:54.400> we're<00:03:54.640> doing<00:03:54.880> really<00:03:55.030> good<00:03:55.299> now

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
learning we're doing really good now

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.479 
learning we're doing really good now
let's<00:03:56.410> go<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.739> recap<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.130> want<00:03:57.250> tell<00:03:57.370> them

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
let's go in recap you want tell them

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.620 
let's go in recap you want tell them
what<00:03:57.580> we<00:03:57.670> talked<00:03:57.850> about<00:03:57.940> yes

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
what we talked about yes

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.900 
what we talked about yes
what<00:03:58.989> we've<00:03:59.110> done<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.560> we've<00:03:59.739> adjusted<00:03:59.910> so

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
what we've done is we've adjusted so

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.000 
what we've done is we've adjusted so
that<00:04:01.180> when<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.540> go<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.690> make<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.900> turn<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.799> one

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
that when you go to make a turn this one

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.940 
that when you go to make a turn this one
goes<00:04:03.190> up<00:04:03.310> more<00:04:03.700> this<00:04:04.239> one<00:04:04.450> comes<00:04:04.660> down<00:04:04.900> less<00:04:05.320> so

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
goes up more this one comes down less so

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.130 
goes up more this one comes down less so
that<00:04:05.980> way<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.610> pushes<00:04:06.880> this<00:04:07.150> wing<00:04:07.390> down<00:04:07.660> real

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
that way it pushes this wing down real

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.810 
that way it pushes this wing down real
nice<00:04:08.380> just<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.769> way<00:04:08.890> you<00:04:08.950> want<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.400> but<00:04:09.760> it

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
nice just the way you want it to but it

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.789 
nice just the way you want it to but it
doesn't<00:04:09.880> give<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.209> any<00:04:10.239> drag<00:04:10.630> okay<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.440> vice

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
doesn't give you any drag okay and vice

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.800 
doesn't give you any drag okay and vice
versa<00:04:12.070> you<00:04:12.430> do<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.820> other<00:04:12.850> way<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.630> have

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
versa you do it the other way and have

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.650 
versa you do it the other way and have
no<00:04:13.989> drag<00:04:14.440> less<00:04:14.890> drag<00:04:15.190> over<00:04:15.459> here<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.540> a
