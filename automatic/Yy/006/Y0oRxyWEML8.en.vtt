00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
going to give you a close up of the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.730 
going to give you a close up of the
sectioning<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.609> did<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.449> off<00:00:21.740> from

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
sectioning I did and I'm going off from

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.130 
sectioning I did and I'm going off from
the<00:00:22.830> parts<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.609> see<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.810> corner

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the parts as you can see to the corner

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.070 
the parts as you can see to the corner
of<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> eye<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> other<00:00:26.070> side<00:00:26.960> now<00:00:27.960> I'm

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
of the eye on the other side now I'm

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.800 
of the eye on the other side now I'm
gonna<00:00:28.199> cut<00:00:28.380> these<00:00:28.500> dry<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.420> wet

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
gonna cut these dry you can do this wet

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.540 
gonna cut these dry you can do this wet
pretty<00:00:31.170> much<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> same<00:00:31.710> technique<00:00:32.279> when<00:00:32.430> it's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
pretty much the same technique when it's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.910 
pretty much the same technique when it's
wet<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.540> I'm<00:00:33.719> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> which<00:00:34.079> show<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.770> guys

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
wet but I'm going to which show you guys

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.920 
wet but I'm going to which show you guys
how<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.550> dry<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
how to do this when it's dry so for the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530 
how to do this when it's dry so for the
longer<00:00:37.410> fringe<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:39.030> we're<00:00:39.120> gonna<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
longer fringe what we're gonna do is

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.709 
longer fringe what we're gonna do is
going<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.750> leave<00:00:40.399> this<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.059> longest<00:00:42.480> point

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
going to leave this as the longest point

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.990 
going to leave this as the longest point
batting<00:00:43.410> through<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.010> then<00:00:44.520> simply

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
batting through here and then simply

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.860 
batting through here and then simply
what<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.420> want<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:48.590> angle<00:00:49.590> our<00:00:50.870> fingers

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
what we want to do is angle our fingers

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.979 
what we want to do is angle our fingers
by<00:00:52.110> lifting<00:00:52.320> our<00:00:52.649> elbow<00:00:53.610> okay<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.390> I'm<00:00:54.629> I'm

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
by lifting our elbow okay so I'm I'm

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.330 
by lifting our elbow okay so I'm I'm
right-handed<00:00:55.320> I'm<00:00:55.590> lifting<00:00:55.860> my<00:00:55.949> left<00:00:56.160> elbow

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
right-handed I'm lifting my left elbow

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.610 
right-handed I'm lifting my left elbow
alright<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
alright and then that is going to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.369 
alright and then that is going to
determine<00:00:58.829> how<00:00:59.489> high<00:00:59.789> of<00:01:00.000> an<00:01:00.120> angle<00:01:00.629> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
determine how high of an angle that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.349 
determine how high of an angle that
we're<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> cut<00:01:01.859> these<00:01:02.039> side<00:01:02.789> fringe<00:01:03.090> up

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
we're going to cut these side fringe up

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.679 
we're going to cut these side fringe up
so<00:01:04.049> I've<00:01:04.379> got<00:01:04.830> my<00:01:05.010> angle<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.030> place<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.540> and

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
so I've got my angle in place here and

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.179 
so I've got my angle in place here and
here's<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.869> length<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
here's the length and I'm just going to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.920 
here's the length and I'm just going to
simply<00:01:12.320> cut<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:14.180> all<00:01:15.180> right<00:01:15.330> following<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
simply cut up all right following the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.120 
simply cut up all right following the
same<00:01:16.430> guide<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:18.110> on<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.380> angle

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.030 

and<00:01:24.130> this<00:01:24.820> is<00:01:25.000> just<00:01:25.150> simply<00:01:25.330> establishing<00:01:26.260> the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
and this is just simply establishing the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.150 
and this is just simply establishing the
length<00:01:27.310> okay<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:29.080> we've<00:01:29.290> got<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.590> angle<00:01:29.920> here

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
length okay so we've got the angle here

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.460 
length okay so we've got the angle here
the<00:01:30.310> shorter<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.820> longer<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.450> now<00:01:32.230> what<00:01:32.380> we're

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
the shorter to longer and now what we're

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.630 
the shorter to longer and now what we're
going<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.620> do<00:01:32.800> is<00:01:33.040> create<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.510> layering<00:01:35.140> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
going to do is create the layering and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
going to do is create the layering and
we<00:01:36.640> do<00:01:36.790> this<00:01:36.910> simply<00:01:37.270> by<00:01:37.950> over<00:01:38.950> direction<00:01:42.150> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
we do this simply by over direction so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.510 
we do this simply by over direction so
this<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.710> going<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:44.860> create<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.220> little<00:01:45.310> bit<00:01:45.430> of

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
this is going to create a little bit of

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.060 
this is going to create a little bit of
softness<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.300> we're<00:01:47.200> just<00:01:47.380> simply<00:01:47.680> bringing

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
softness and we're just simply bringing

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.450 
softness and we're just simply bringing
everything<00:01:48.690> over<00:01:49.690> dragging<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.230> that<00:01:51.160> one

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
everything over dragging it to that one

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.430 
everything over dragging it to that one
point<00:01:51.760> to<00:01:51.970> that<00:01:52.090> one<00:01:52.240> corner<00:01:52.540> which<00:01:53.230> is<00:01:53.350> going

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
point to that one corner which is going

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.100 
point to that one corner which is going
to<00:01:53.500> leave<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:53.980> corner<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:55.479> shortest<00:01:55.900> point

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
to leave this corner the shortest point

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.700 
to leave this corner the shortest point
and<00:01:56.290> then<00:01:56.470> over<00:01:56.740> directing<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.250> leaves<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
and then over directing it leaves the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.219 
and then over directing it leaves the
other<00:02:00.340> side<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:01.030> longest<00:02:01.450> point<00:02:01.660> which<00:02:02.080> is

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
other side the longest point which is

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.810 
other side the longest point which is
where<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.560> length<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.280> that's<00:02:03.640> what

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
where the length is and that's what

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.310 
where the length is and that's what
creates<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.240> sweeping<00:02:04.690> look

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
creates that sweeping look

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.260 
creates that sweeping look
so<00:02:07.130> as<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.370> can<00:02:07.430> see<00:02:07.640> with<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:07.940> particular

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
so as you can see with this particular

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.050 
so as you can see with this particular
type<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.690> sweeping<00:02:09.260> fringe<00:02:09.710> or<00:02:09.950> bang<00:02:10.130> this<00:02:10.910> is

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
type of sweeping fringe or bang this is

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.550 
type of sweeping fringe or bang this is
left<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.360> lot<00:02:11.540> longer<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.140> corner<00:02:12.440> which

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
left a lot longer in the corner which

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.060 
left a lot longer in the corner which
allows<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.160> go<00:02:14.090> over<00:02:14.480> pretty<00:02:15.290> pretty<00:02:15.770> far

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
allows it to go over pretty pretty far

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.250 
allows it to go over pretty pretty far
with<00:02:16.100> this<00:02:16.490> piece<00:02:16.760> here<00:02:17.210> working<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.080> through

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
with this piece here working in through

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.140 
with this piece here working in through
everything<00:02:18.560> else<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.190> know<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.610> didn't

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
everything else and you know I didn't

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.970 
everything else and you know I didn't
use<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.270> smoothing<00:02:20.810> iron<00:02:20.990> or<00:02:21.260> blow-dry<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.680> just

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
use a smoothing iron or blow-dry it just

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.220 
use a smoothing iron or blow-dry it just
kind<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.220> went<00:02:22.370> with<00:02:22.400> how<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.090> hair<00:02:23.300> was<00:02:23.540> but

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
kind of went with how the hair was but

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.360 
kind of went with how the hair was but
this<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.380> what's<00:02:24.650> going<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.860> allow<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.130> kind

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
this is what's going to allow it to kind

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.520 
this is what's going to allow it to kind
of<00:02:25.400> sweep<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.180> work<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.600> through<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
of sweep in and work in through the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.010 
of sweep in and work in through the
longer<00:02:27.890> hair<00:02:28.130> now<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.450> can<00:02:29.570> see<00:02:29.630> in

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
longer hair now as you can see in

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.620 
longer hair now as you can see in
another<00:02:30.250> photograph<00:02:31.250> she<00:02:31.520> has<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:32.060> much

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
another photograph she has a much

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.620 
another photograph she has a much
shorter<00:02:32.870> fringe<00:02:33.290> which<00:02:33.500> starts<00:02:33.830> up<00:02:34.040> here<00:02:34.400> and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
shorter fringe which starts up here and

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.450 
shorter fringe which starts up here and
ends<00:02:35.630> up<00:02:35.720> kind<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.350> around<00:02:36.680> here<00:02:37.010> somewhere

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
ends up kind of around here somewhere

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.120 
ends up kind of around here somewhere
alright<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:38.930> obviously<00:02:39.860> quite<00:02:40.040> a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
alright and that is obviously quite a

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.710 
alright and that is obviously quite a
bit<00:02:40.310> shorter<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:41.210> I'm<00:02:41.390> going<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.540> show<00:02:41.630> you

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
bit shorter so I'm going to show you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.480 
bit shorter so I'm going to show you
guys<00:02:41.840> how<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.080> do<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.230> very<00:02:42.560> very<00:02:42.920> much

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
guys how to do that very very much

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.430 
guys how to do that very very much
pretty<00:02:43.790> much<00:02:43.850> simply<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.600> same<00:02:44.870> technique

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
pretty much simply the same technique

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.200 
pretty much simply the same technique
the<00:02:45.560> same<00:02:45.590> method<00:02:46.100> except<00:02:46.820> we're<00:02:46.940> going<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.120> go

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
the same method except we're going to go

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.740 
the same method except we're going to go
a<00:02:47.240> little<00:02:47.870> bit<00:02:48.050> shorter<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:49.330> do<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.360> little<00:02:50.600> bit

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
a little bit shorter and do a little bit

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.710 
a little bit shorter and do a little bit
more<00:02:51.220> layering<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.910> what<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.090> like<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.390> do<00:02:53.510> first

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
more layering so what I like to do first

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.020 
more layering so what I like to do first
is<00:02:54.640> establish<00:02:57.010> again<00:02:58.010> where<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.640> want<00:02:58.910> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
is establish again where I want the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.980 
is establish again where I want the
length<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.480> be<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.010> sometimes<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.130> cut<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.990> you

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
length to be and sometimes I cut it you

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.449 
length to be and sometimes I cut it you
know<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.590> leave<00:03:03.740> it<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> little<00:03:04.130> bit<00:03:04.310> on<00:03:04.340> the

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
know and leave it a little bit on the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.310 
know and leave it a little bit on the
longer<00:03:04.670> side<00:03:04.820> this<00:03:05.720> way<00:03:05.900> if<00:03:05.990> I<00:03:06.020> need<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.230> go

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
longer side this way if I need to go

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.170 
longer side this way if I need to go
back<00:03:06.500> in<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.860> can<00:03:07.010> go<00:03:07.160> back<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:07.760> make<00:03:07.940> any

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
back in I can go back in and make any

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.320 
back in I can go back in and make any
sort<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.800> adjustments<00:03:09.800> if<00:03:10.010> needed<00:03:10.550> and<00:03:10.820> also

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
sort of adjustments if needed and also

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.380 
sort of adjustments if needed and also
keep<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.630> mind<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:12.530> on<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.739> mannequin<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.000> a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
keep in mind this is on a mannequin so a

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.390 
keep in mind this is on a mannequin so a
mannequin<00:03:14.900> hair<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.680> way<00:03:15.800> it<00:03:15.920> lays<00:03:16.100> is<00:03:16.370> a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
mannequin hair and the way it lays is a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.479 
mannequin hair and the way it lays is a
little<00:03:16.550> bit<00:03:16.640> different<00:03:17.000> than<00:03:18.010> if<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.190> was<00:03:19.310> on<00:03:19.430> a

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
little bit different than if it was on a

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.550 
little bit different than if it was on a
human<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:22.190> here's<00:03:22.790> why<00:03:23.030> established<00:03:23.870> lengths

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
human so here's why established lengths

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.240 
human so here's why established lengths
and<00:03:24.920> through<00:03:25.130> here<00:03:25.630> okay<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:27.050> then<00:03:27.890> now<00:03:28.040> I'm

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
and through here okay and then now I'm

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.960 
and through here okay and then now I'm
going<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:28.640> go<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.330> determine<00:03:30.140> if<00:03:30.410> this<00:03:30.560> is

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
going to go in and determine if this is

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.090 
going to go in and determine if this is
short<00:03:31.970> enough<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.450> is<00:03:32.600> long<00:03:32.810> enough<00:03:33.110> and

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
short enough this is long enough and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.670 
short enough this is long enough and
that's<00:03:34.430> where<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:34.760> make<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.120> adjustments<00:03:36.850> so

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
that's where you make the adjustments so

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.720 
that's where you make the adjustments so
you<00:03:39.680> know<00:03:39.769> I'm<00:03:39.890> kind<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.190> happy<00:03:40.400> with<00:03:40.580> the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
you know I'm kind of happy with the

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.259 
you know I'm kind of happy with the
length<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.300> through<00:03:41.450> here<00:03:41.690> now<00:03:42.410> it's<00:03:42.650> time<00:03:42.890> to

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
length and through here now it's time to

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.380 
length and through here now it's time to
create<00:03:44.269> more<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.200> sweeping<00:03:46.209> motion<00:03:47.209> into

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
create more of the sweeping motion into

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.810 
create more of the sweeping motion into
here<00:03:47.510> which<00:03:47.600> is<00:03:47.750> done<00:03:47.930> by<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.739> layering<00:03:48.980> so

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
here which is done by the layering so

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.479 
here which is done by the layering so
believe<00:03:50.269> it<00:03:50.390> or<00:03:50.450> not<00:03:50.570> again<00:03:51.340> we're<00:03:52.340> going<00:03:52.430> to

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
believe it or not again we're going to

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.130 
believe it or not again we're going to
come<00:03:52.670> in<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.970> same<00:03:53.209> exact<00:03:53.510> way<00:03:53.540> there<00:03:53.840> before

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
come in the same exact way there before

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.630 
come in the same exact way there before
and<00:03:54.820> cut<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.330> top<00:03:56.720> part<00:03:56.750> here<00:03:57.500> which<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:58.550> going

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
and cut the top part here which is going

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.280 
and cut the top part here which is going
to<00:03:58.700> create<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.390> softer<00:04:00.080> layer

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.950 

and<00:04:07.640> then<00:04:08.640> over<00:04:08.970> directing<00:04:09.390> everything<00:04:09.660> from

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
and then over directing everything from

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.880 
and then over directing everything from
this<00:04:10.080> corner<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:11.340> other<00:04:11.400> side<00:04:12.740> and<00:04:13.740> then<00:04:13.860> I

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
this corner to the other side and then I

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.790 
this corner to the other side and then I
actually<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.520> come<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:14.910> from<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.840> top

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:16.800 
actually like to come in from the top

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.520 
actually like to come in from the top
angle<00:04:17.040> here<00:04:17.640> and<00:04:19.190> simply<00:04:20.190> just<00:04:21.020> cut<00:04:22.020> a<00:04:22.050> shorter

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
angle here and simply just cut a shorter

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.150 
angle here and simply just cut a shorter
to<00:04:22.710> longer<00:04:23.450> angle<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.630> remove<00:04:24.900> any<00:04:25.140> other<00:04:25.440> sort

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
to longer angle to remove any other sort

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.130 
to longer angle to remove any other sort
of<00:04:26.220> weight<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:27.420> could<00:04:27.660> be<00:04:28.790> restricting<00:04:29.790> the

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
of weight that could be restricting the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.940 
of weight that could be restricting the
bangs<00:04:31.140> from<00:04:31.350> moving<00:04:32.280> there<00:04:33.060> sweeping<00:04:33.480> over

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
bangs from moving there sweeping over

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.490 
bangs from moving there sweeping over
for<00:04:34.950> styling<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.520> simply<00:04:36.090> applied<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:37.020> output

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
for styling I simply applied the output

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.440 
for styling I simply applied the output
while<00:04:37.740> gender<00:04:37.980> styling<00:04:38.400> treatment<00:04:38.730> oil<00:04:38.760> to

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
tame down a little frizz and give it

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.730 
tame down a little frizz and give it
some<00:04:40.830> shine<00:04:41.690> which<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.750> did<00:04:42.900> already<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.380> for

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.929 

right<00:05:19.199> so<00:05:19.409> if<00:05:19.770> we<00:05:20.099> have<00:05:20.249> a<00:05:20.279> blow-dried<00:05:20.759> you

just<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:21.240> we<00:05:21.360> comb<00:05:21.539> it<00:05:21.659> into<00:05:21.840> place<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.610> create

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
just so we comb it into place and create

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.989 
just so we comb it into place and create
that<00:05:23.729> angle<00:05:24.029> I'm<00:05:24.210> going<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:25.639> lock<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.669> in<00:05:26.879> while

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:26.999 
that angle I'm going to lock it in while

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:29.029 
that angle I'm going to lock it in while
using<00:05:27.150> worked<00:05:27.479> up<00:05:27.659> which<00:05:27.870> is<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.050> workable

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
using worked up which is a workable

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.679
