00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.610
 Hello, I want to tell you today 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.960
 show home appliances that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.040
 do it yourself 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.630
 last video I talked about 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.840
 the fixture that I made for 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.960
 ignition key test 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.550
 ignition coils 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.099
 common people we call it the transistor 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.310
 to make it easier for us to communicate this 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.940
 I have gathered here at my desk, I 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.579
 tested both transistors purely on the table 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.170
 Alexey not on mail wrote Vladimir 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.160
 people are interested 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.710
 what the scheme of this device is now I 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.750
 I 'll show you what kind of light saboteur 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.789
 can copied people here there is a chip site 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:00.770
 the tuner here is the chip tuning they have such 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.589
 reference do it yourself there is a reference further 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.130
 tester like in the ignition module and here it is 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.869
 Here is an article just about this device 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:19.850
 o download we now do with me already 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:23.009
 ready to eat 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.180
 this here this specifically cursor 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.740
 shows it here is the electrical part 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.119
 ignition module 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.850
 here it is, I soldered instead of this 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.920
 transistor here so here will show 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.299
 so here I will show this instead 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.030
 I got a transistor 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.450
 three wires and brought them to crocodiles 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.899
 thereby i 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.420
 connected control keys here 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.950
 ignition coils 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.860
 here to collect this shooting 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.770
 we must be a little bit like that 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.409
 hams i'm being new to parts 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.890
 For the sake of amateur, I collected this shemku for 2 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.250
 evenings the scheme is very good earned 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.160
 straight away right away 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.849
 I told the previous video about 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.160
 motor tester staging and there i did 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.440
 power protection so that's protection 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.680
 nutrition here it is just here 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.500
 Relyushka and dioiodik here I am right cursor 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:31.209
 I drive the cursor I drive here this here relyushka 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.150
 relyushka idiot here do and dug 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.940
 I usually thought well on the table I did not 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.329
 I liked to check the wrong conditions here 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.239
 let's say with an arabic coil here yes y 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.230
 you are not on the table for almost three prices 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.540
 centimeter 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.709
 horse kill can say but when I 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.440
 I put the coil on the car I do not work 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:59.090
 I decided to think if the transistors hi 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.549
 directly on the bow machine and 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.859
 create create those conditions under which 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.359
 this 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.519
 I want to correct the coils are clamped 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.680
 work directly on the machine and 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.889
 collected just such a scheme 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.120
 so sad I was two thick 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:19.010
 ignition module 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.440
 I took them apart I took them 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.310
 just such a good electrical circuit 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.220
 and another took serviceable or three as 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.160
 ignition coil 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.230
 also one key and left working a 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.750
 The second key I brought here on 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.750
 crocodiles here you can see there key 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.860
 ignition is worth it now let's see how it is 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.520
 everything works all 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.520
 we start the car 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.349
 Here the machine is working properly 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.349
 here 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.060
 no matter ps3 you can see that everything works 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.760
 Well, if someone worked here or tester 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:08.800
 sees that everything is fine here and everything 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:10.989
 fine now the machine is working on 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.700
 2 cylinder tweet for two cylinders 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:17.970
 only 1 and 4 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.970
 like 2 3 no i connect back 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:28.580
 appeared and went here all see how 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:32.060
 comfortable here everything is just her on the table i 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.330
 I cannot create such conditions as 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.830
 car here, we employ work 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.110
 high voltage spark wires control 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.200
 we see a troll see what's in there 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.770
 there is also the most important parameter 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.230
 which we did not see on the table this 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.110
 pressure in the cylinder and not just pressure 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.610
 air stoichiometric mixture there 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.230
 job 14 to one languishing take and 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.190
 turbulence and transients at 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.850
 recycling 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.000
 and here it turned out so unique 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.840
 one key gauge 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:20.060
 leave so let's say 1 minutes for 10 you can 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:23.450
 check 10 keys one and a half well here 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.170
 there is a lightweight piston with frets 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:30.380
 priors 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:31.340
 here's the number show arm that's lightened 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.700
 piston 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.280
 and yet see all there show 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.090
 everything is very good of everything here here here 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.760
 it turned out so all grown together well 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:48.110
 Now I want to try it now 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.260
 regular coil as it will but 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:54.680
 now working on his regular coil 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.800
 Well , you see the first cylinder in red 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.900
 bit there is something wrong on my like 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.910
 ears got much better all 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.550
 rovnenko here the first cylinder if 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.129
 take a closer look there is something wrong in 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.439
 this coil 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.839
 so here I am what turned out good 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:13.509
 cream of two module I collected a good 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:15.909
 module and here in normal mode 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:22.719
 here's the first cylinder the damn thing is wrong here 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:26.199
 let's say and now now I threw 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:28.659
 coil straight newest possible too 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.379
 principle, not bad turned out like mine 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.999
 also 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:38.219
 exactly here everything is fine well for today and 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:38.219
 all respectfully vadim
