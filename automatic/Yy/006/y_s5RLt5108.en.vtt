Ableton as the quickest and easiest way
of<00:01:02.890> demonstrating<00:01:03.699> how<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:03.969> map<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.869> controls

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
of demonstrating how to map the controls

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.880 
of demonstrating how to map the controls
on<00:01:05.410> his<00:01:05.500> own<00:01:05.649> 40<00:01:06.070> so<00:01:07.030> in<00:01:07.509> order<00:01:07.660> to<00:01:07.869> put<00:01:08.470> Ableton

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
on his own 40 so in order to put Ableton

that<00:01:18.190> everything<00:01:18.430> goes<00:01:18.670> blue<00:01:19.710> basically<00:01:20.710> we

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
that everything goes blue basically we

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.910 
that everything goes blue basically we
can<00:01:21.450> map<00:01:22.450> anything<00:01:22.840> that's<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.380> blue<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:23.770> what

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
can map anything that's in blue so what

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.290 
can map anything that's in blue so what
I'm<00:01:24.009> gonna<00:01:24.100> do<00:01:24.280> first<00:01:24.429> of<00:01:24.700> all<00:01:24.789> is<00:01:24.850> I'm<00:01:25.179> gonna

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
I'm gonna do first of all is I'm gonna

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.380 
I'm gonna do first of all is I'm gonna
click<00:01:25.539> on<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.780> channel<00:01:26.110> fader<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:28.119> then<00:01:28.270> on

click on the channel fader and then on

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.180 
click on the channel fader and then on
the<00:01:28.450> for<00:01:28.690> D<00:01:28.869> I'm<00:01:29.530> just<00:01:29.770> gonna<00:01:29.860> move<00:01:30.039> the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
the for D I'm just gonna move the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.620 
the for D I'm just gonna move the
channel<00:01:30.460> fader<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:30.729> want<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.090> correspond<00:01:31.570> to

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
channel fader I want to correspond to

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.240 
channel fader I want to correspond to
that<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.470> see<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.710> little<00:01:32.800> text<00:01:33.130> box

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
that and you see the little text box

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.749 
that and you see the little text box
appears<00:01:33.820> which<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:34.959> a<00:01:35.080> forward<00:01:35.410> slash<00:01:35.649> 19<00:01:36.190> so

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
appears which is a forward slash 19 so

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.430 
appears which is a forward slash 19 so
that's<00:01:36.940> basically<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.420> MIDI<00:01:37.690> channel<00:01:38.140> number

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
that's basically the MIDI channel number

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.100 
that's basically the MIDI channel number
in<00:01:39.310> front<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.119> then<00:01:40.209> the<00:01:40.300> 19<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.959> to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
in front of that and then the 19 is to

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.630 
in front of that and then the 19 is to
control<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.500> number<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.179> quickly<00:01:43.479> come<00:01:43.690> out

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
control a number if I quickly come out

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.059 
control a number if I quickly come out
of<00:01:45.640> my<00:01:45.819> MIDI<00:01:46.000> mapping<00:01:46.209> mode<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.770> can

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
of my MIDI mapping mode now I can

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.850 
of my MIDI mapping mode now I can
operate<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.489> fader<00:01:49.140> using<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.229> fader<00:01:50.440> 1<00:01:50.590> for

as<00:02:07.530> 16:9<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:08.739> that's<00:02:08.890> channel<00:02:09.160> 16<00:02:09.550> controller

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
as 16:9 so that's channel 16 controller

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.119 
as 16:9 so that's channel 16 controller
number<00:02:10.300> 9<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:12.489> you'll<00:02:12.730> see<00:02:15.209> that's<00:02:16.209> my<00:02:16.450> coder

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
number 9 and you'll see that's my coder

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.270 
number 9 and you'll see that's my coder
controlling<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.220> pan<00:02:19.830> well<00:02:20.830> now<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.099> want<00:02:21.160> to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
controlling the pan well now I want to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.229 
controlling the pan well now I want to
have<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> look<00:02:21.520> at<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:21.730> one<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:21.970> digital

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
have a look at it's one of the digital

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.130 
have a look at it's one of the digital
controls<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.930> want<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.560> use<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.830> as<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.340> rotary

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
controls I want to use it as as a rotary

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.330 
controls I want to use it as as a rotary
so<00:02:26.140> I'm<00:02:26.200> gonna<00:02:26.290> use<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.590> for<00:02:26.680> one<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.920> sends

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
so I'm gonna use it for one of the sends

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.020 
so I'm gonna use it for one of the sends
so<00:02:27.790> we<00:02:27.879> go<00:02:28.000> into<00:02:28.239> mapping<00:02:28.989> mode<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.580> send

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
so we go into mapping mode and you send

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.830 
so we go into mapping mode and you send
a<00:02:31.379> sort<00:02:32.379> of<00:02:32.410> select<00:02:32.680> send<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.069> now<00:02:33.879> I<00:02:34.239> rotate<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
a sort of select send a now I rotate the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.729 
a sort of select send a now I rotate the
encoder<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.190> you'll<00:02:36.370> see<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.750> little

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
encoder and you'll see that the little

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.160 
encoder and you'll see that the little
text<00:02:38.920> box<00:02:39.040> comes<00:02:39.489> up<00:02:39.810> what<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:40.870> need<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.079> pay

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
text box comes up what we need to pay

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.479 
text box comes up what we need to pay
attention<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.650> here<00:02:41.829> is<00:02:42.010> down<00:02:42.159> in<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.370> bottom

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
attention to here is down in the bottom

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.229 
attention to here is down in the bottom
of<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.879> screen

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
of the screen

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:43.920 
of the screen
you'll<00:02:43.510> see

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
you'll see

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.240 
you'll see
it<00:02:43.989> says<00:02:44.230> Maps<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.159> channel<00:02:45.599> CC<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.019> says

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
it says Maps to channel CC and it says

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.699 
it says Maps to channel CC and it says
1632<00:02:48.280> mode<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.120> at<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.719> moment<00:02:50.109> that<00:02:50.409> sigh

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
1632 mode and at the moment that sigh

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.920 
1632 mode and at the moment that sigh
that's<00:02:51.069> set<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.310> relative<00:02:52.030> sign<00:02:52.299> bits<00:02:52.659> now<00:02:52.870> as

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
that's set to relative sign bits now as

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.410 
that's set to relative sign bits now as
to<00:02:53.140> ways<00:02:53.319> we<00:02:53.500> can<00:02:53.650> do<00:02:53.799> this<00:02:53.909> we<00:02:54.909> can<00:02:55.060> either<00:02:55.150> go

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
to ways we can do this we can either go

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.509 
to ways we can do this we can either go
down<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:57.359> that<00:02:58.359> menu<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.650> can<00:02:59.890> select

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
down in that menu and we can select

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.479 
down in that menu and we can select
relative<00:03:01.389> two's<00:03:01.629> complement<00:03:02.370> which<00:03:03.370> is

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
relative two's complement which is

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.369 
relative two's complement which is
basically<00:03:03.790> what<00:03:04.000> we're<00:03:04.180> after<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:05.230> other

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
basically what we're after the other

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.899 
basically what we're after the other
option<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.739> continue<00:03:06.250> turning<00:03:06.639> the<00:03:06.730> rotary

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
option is to continue turning the rotary

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.069 
option is to continue turning the rotary
and<00:03:07.239> you'll<00:03:07.480> see<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:08.219> the<00:03:09.219> setting<00:03:09.609> changes

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
and you'll see that the setting changes

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.509 
and you'll see that the setting changes
from<00:03:11.079> sowing<00:03:11.379> bit<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.769> absolute<00:03:12.219> two's

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
from sowing bit to absolute two's

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.940 
from sowing bit to absolute two's
complement<00:03:13.000> now<00:03:13.209> we<00:03:13.359> want<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.750> complement<00:03:14.290> so

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
complement now we want to complement so

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.860 
complement now we want to complement so
we'll<00:03:15.069> leave<00:03:15.189> it<00:03:15.250> there<00:03:15.579> come<00:03:16.359> out<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.569> mapping

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
we'll leave it there come out of mapping

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.140 
we'll leave it there come out of mapping
mode<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.829> you'll<00:03:18.129> now<00:03:18.280> see<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:21.150> endless

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
mode and you'll now see the endless

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.509 
mode and you'll now see the endless
encoder<00:03:22.620> it's<00:03:23.620> controlling<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.220> channel

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
encoder it's controlling the channel

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.319 
encoder it's controlling the channel
send<00:03:25.590> you'd<00:03:26.590> map<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.919> jog<00:03:27.129> wheel<00:03:27.340> in<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:28.120> same

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
send you'd map the jog wheel in the same

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.869 
send you'd map the jog wheel in the same
way<00:03:28.540> as<00:03:28.659> this<00:03:29.010> I'll<00:03:30.010> quickly<00:03:30.219> go<00:03:30.340> through<00:03:30.459> a

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
way as this I'll quickly go through a

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.069 
way as this I'll quickly go through a
switch<00:03:32.219> now<00:03:33.219> down<00:03:33.459> here<00:03:33.730> if<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.599> go<00:03:34.719> into<00:03:34.840> MIDI

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
switch now down here if I go into MIDI

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.050 
switch now down here if I go into MIDI
mapping<00:03:35.290> mode<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:36.099> see<00:03:36.250> we've<00:03:36.400> got<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.579> flanger

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
mapping mode you see we've got a flanger

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.720 
mapping mode you see we've got a flanger
this<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.389> just<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.599> plug<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:37.900> effect<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:39.010> I'm

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
this is just a plug in effect so I'm

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.300 
this is just a plug in effect so I'm
gonna<00:03:39.909> select<00:03:40.150> B<00:03:40.389> on<00:03:40.540> off<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.590> I'm<00:03:42.010> gonna<00:03:42.129> use

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
gonna select B on off and I'm gonna use

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.690 
gonna select B on off and I'm gonna use
the<00:03:42.430> button<00:03:42.760> on<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.989> Enderson<00:03:44.290> coder<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:45.489> turn

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
the button on the Enderson coder to turn

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.190 
the button on the Enderson coder to turn
the<00:03:45.849> flanger<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.359> and<00:03:46.510> off<00:03:46.599> so<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:46.870> come<00:03:47.049> back

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
the flanger on and off so I come back

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.159 
the flanger on and off so I come back
out<00:03:47.379> of<00:03:47.409> MIDI<00:03:47.620> mapping<00:03:47.829> mode<00:03:48.099> you<00:03:48.940> see<00:03:49.150> now<00:03:49.329> how

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
out of MIDI mapping mode you see now how

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.949 
out of MIDI mapping mode you see now how
the<00:03:50.229> controls<00:03:50.650> gray<00:03:51.010> out<00:03:51.659> when<00:03:52.659> everything's

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
the controls gray out when everything's

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.379 
the controls gray out when everything's
turned<00:03:53.199> off
