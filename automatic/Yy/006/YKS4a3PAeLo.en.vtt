00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.330 
this
and<00:00:35.170> you<00:00:36.170> may<00:00:36.320> want<00:00:36.469> to<00:00:36.590> add<00:00:36.860> some<00:00:36.890> water<00:00:38.200> maybe

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
and you may want to add some water maybe

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.610 
and you may want to add some water maybe
don't<00:00:40.340> keep<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:40.730> too<00:00:40.910> long<00:00:41.120> maybe<00:00:42.050> a<00:00:42.170> few<00:00:42.410> days

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
don't keep it too long maybe a few days

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.650

I<00:00:42.890> think<00:00:42.920> would<00:00:43.219> be<00:00:43.340> okay<00:00:43.640> but<00:00:44.239> just<00:00:44.270> for

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
I think would be okay but just for

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.000 
I think would be okay but just for
effect<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:45.860> would<00:00:45.980> be<00:00:46.129> very<00:00:46.309> nice<00:00:46.579> too

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
effect and that would be very nice too

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.709

this<00:01:43.280> project<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:44.090> will<00:01:44.299> use<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.170> floppy<00:01:45.740> kind

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
this project I will use the floppy kind

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.539 
this project I will use the floppy kind
and<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:48.590> chosen<00:01:49.009> two<00:01:49.460> colors<00:01:50.380> one<00:01:51.380> color<00:01:51.649> is<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
and I chosen two colors one color is the

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.330 
and I chosen two colors one color is the
yellow<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.020> red<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.829> the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
yellow and red and the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.210 
yellow and red and the
it<00:01:55.700> almost<00:01:55.909> looks<00:01:56.240> red<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.409> yellow<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:58.040> it's

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
it almost looks red and yellow but it's

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.330 
it almost looks red and yellow but it's
called<00:01:58.549> orange<00:01:59.030> red<00:01:59.360> yellow<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.320> has<00:02:00.560> kind

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
called orange red yellow so it has kind

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.520 
called orange red yellow so it has kind
of<00:02:02.229> triggered<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.409> from<00:02:03.950> orange<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.790> yellow<00:02:05.530> and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
of triggered a from orange to yellow and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.290 
of triggered a from orange to yellow and
I<00:02:07.190> have<00:02:07.580> I<00:02:08.090> think<00:02:08.360> seven<00:02:08.780> pieces<00:02:09.850> in<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:11.000> clear

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
I have I think seven pieces in a clear

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.610 
I have I think seven pieces in a clear
face<00:02:12.400> all<00:02:13.400> right

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
face all right

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.050 
face all right
so<00:02:18.400> I'm<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:19.730> going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.090> use<00:02:20.330> anything<00:02:20.780> but<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
so I'm not going to use anything but the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.530 
so I'm not going to use anything but the
calla<00:02:23.390> lilies<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:25.489> will<00:02:25.730> begin<00:02:25.940> by

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
calla lilies and I will begin by

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.180 
calla lilies and I will begin by
actually<00:02:27.410> twisting<00:02:28.220> them<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.560> can<00:02:30.920> fit

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
actually twisting them so that I can fit

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.740 
actually twisting them so that I can fit
them<00:02:31.310> into<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.970> container<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.420> really

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
them into the container this is really

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.020 
them into the container this is really
going<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.200> give<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:38.500> clear<00:02:39.500> glass<00:02:40.220> vase<00:02:40.700> a

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
going to give the the clear glass vase a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.650 
going to give the the clear glass vase a
very<00:02:41.360> interesting<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.290> back<00:02:45.430> right<00:02:46.660> you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
very interesting that back right you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:56.199 
very interesting that back right you
almost<00:02:47.900> want<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.230> coil<00:02:48.830> down<00:02:54.280> okay<00:02:55.280> maybe<00:02:56.090> you

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
almost want to coil down okay maybe you

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.430 
almost want to coil down okay maybe you
will<00:02:56.360> have<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.690> make<00:02:56.840> them<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.110> little<00:02:57.260> bit

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
will have to make them a little bit

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.050 
will have to make them a little bit
smaller<00:03:03.040> let's<00:03:04.040> see<00:03:04.220> if<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.519> works<00:03:04.790> this

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
smaller let's see if this works this

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.380 
smaller let's see if this works this
time

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.000 

much<00:03:08.390> better

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
much better

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:28.050 
much better
here's<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.130> first<00:03:10.280> calla<00:03:10.670> lily

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060

just fish it through and this one can

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.520 
just fish it through and this one can
flop<00:03:39.469> the<00:03:39.769> other<00:03:39.920> way<00:03:40.719> it's<00:03:41.719> not<00:03:41.930> already

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
flop the other way it's not already

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.229 
flop the other way it's not already
starting<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.189> look<00:03:43.310> really<00:03:43.549> good<00:03:43.819> with<00:03:44.030> only

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
starting to look really good with only

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.309 
starting to look really good with only
two<00:03:45.099> let's<00:03:46.099> continue<00:03:48.040> coiling<00:03:49.930> maybe<00:03:50.930> this

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
two let's continue coiling maybe this

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.589 
two let's continue coiling maybe this
one<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.769> wanted<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.519> wanted<00:03:52.639> to<00:03:53.150> go<00:03:53.329> all<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.480> way

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
one I wanted I wanted to go all the way

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.949 
one I wanted I wanted to go all the way
through<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.349> I<00:03:54.379> will<00:03:54.739> begin<00:03:54.939> coiling<00:03:55.939> it<00:03:56.120> kind

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
through so I will begin coiling it kind

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:09.350 
through so I will begin coiling it kind
of<00:03:57.079> in<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.319> middle

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:22.100 

fish<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.600> right<00:04:10.810> through

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.689 

what<00:04:23.110> does<00:04:23.289> they<00:04:23.439> have<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.620> mind<00:04:23.949> of<00:04:24.099> their<00:04:24.159> own

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.439 

and<00:04:27.699> I<00:04:27.849> think<00:04:27.879> this<00:04:28.360> one<00:04:28.599> does<00:04:28.629> anything<00:04:30.449> the

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
and I think this one does anything the

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.239 
and I think this one does anything the
next<00:04:31.629> four<00:04:32.259> I<00:04:33.419> will<00:04:34.419> just<00:04:35.080> fish<00:04:35.889> through

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:36.249 
next four I will just fish through

00:04:36.249 --> 00:05:00.610 
next four I will just fish through
without<00:04:36.580> any<00:04:36.639> coiling

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:11.250 

how<00:05:01.490> simple<00:05:01.940> is<00:05:02.090> this<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.570> make<00:05:02.780> huh<00:05:10.090> and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
how simple is this to make huh and

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.090 
how simple is this to make huh and
almost<00:05:12.260> finished<00:05:12.889> here

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.280 

and<00:05:18.670> it<00:05:18.850> should<00:05:19.060> have<00:05:19.180> gotten<00:05:19.480> a<00:05:19.660> bigger<00:05:19.960> vase

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
and it should have gotten a bigger vase

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.670 
and it should have gotten a bigger vase
I<00:05:20.880> think<00:05:21.880> it's<00:05:21.970> gonna<00:05:22.120> work<00:05:22.210> out<00:05:23.850> there<00:05:24.850> we<00:05:25.000> go

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
I think it's gonna work out there we go

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.050 
I think it's gonna work out there we go
alright<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:28.140> here<00:05:29.140> we<00:05:29.260> have<00:05:29.500> few<00:05:30.430> calla<00:05:30.760> lilies

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
alright so here we have few calla lilies

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:44.300 
alright so here we have few calla lilies
in<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.390> clear<00:05:34.750> base

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.200 

easy<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.580> do<00:05:45.760> maybe<00:05:46.480> we<00:05:46.540> get<00:05:46.690> a<00:05:46.750> larger<00:05:47.320> vase

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
easy to do maybe we get a larger vase

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.020 
easy to do maybe we get a larger vase
and<00:05:49.210> until<00:05:49.780> next<00:05:49.930> time<00:05:50.290> this<00:05:51.250> is<00:05:51.430> Donna<00:05:51.700> with

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
and until next time this is Donna with

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.830 
and until next time this is Donna with
flowers<00:05:52.840> by<00:05:53.290> design
