 leave eyes well I'll tell you that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.170
 added adeca graf is worth it because 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.510
 making a being that has made a server 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.840
 full of sky guard that is super super 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.329
 handsome I've already seen a sky was server 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.320
 as handsome as those who make the case a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.540
 authentic madness 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.000
 so you will do well to add it because 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.470
 it's worth it then now it's good now 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.460
 when we start playing I will tell you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.500
 a few more things 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.920
 this is going to give the permissions and the people 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.440
 Let's see 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.760
 OK yes 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.990
 have 32 hard thanks in advance 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.850
 guys I will find a few 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.580
 important things for example about 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.990
 of inactivity on YouTube is worth and is that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.640
 been outside I was not mentioning by 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.850
 twitter that was going to be a week 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.120
 outside and that's why it has not gone up 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.310
 let's say videos in a week regarding 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.710
 the hangout with subscribers that we had 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.400
 what to do then it is still standing 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.200
 the only thing is that 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.740
 to see how I tell you 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.890
 it's not going to be from minecraft it's not going to be what 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.890
 only 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.710
 and if he is making a very fat mistake 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.689
 in the day that I give water I say 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.340
 How strange that you can not pay the 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.500
 players because I have spent many 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.030
 times I play but it turns out that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.730
 then the players can not be attacked 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.170
 for some strange reason good as it was 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.160
 saying the hangout with subscribers going 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.370
 to be in playstation 3 and playstation 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.049
 it is better most suitable site 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.090
 to make a hangout with subscribers 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.370
 well there we can play all chess 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.930
 and these things that will be much better 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.640
 what 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.650
 in order that minecraft that I can only 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.019
 imitate as much as I like this and what 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.900
 you are very good very good 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.900
 ibm that runs out of permissions 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.700
 to him we 're not going to good 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.590
 once and I can I do not know what to do 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.780
 I'm decided if I'm going to get something 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.170
 will shoot unless it has no arc 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.170
 and arrow 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.050
 not today 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.950
 then expedition two arrows turns me 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.180
 two fatal are left I'm doing the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.310
 with subscribers because that's going to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.750
 be there and not the minecraft as it was 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.540
 thought about that as I said they are going to 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.629
 be fertilizers there of what degree has already gone 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.390
 that instead of falling and dying it has 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.099
 stayed there for you ready for that 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.769
 that in my case there are other players and 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.569
 then it is more preferable preferable 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.329
 for me to do it in a place where 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.390
 basically he is a lot of people not 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.159
 and it is that the boys have separate logo 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.900
 thought to do that in fact I do not know if not 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.310
 I will start this week a new series that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.659

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.760
 playstation 3 as you know they have 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.879
 taken a pretty cool update 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.409
 in which they have added so many things and 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.079

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:53.730

 Valencian dies 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.460
 because it turns out that there are people who 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.370
 it's a bit heavy for him to see a 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.830
