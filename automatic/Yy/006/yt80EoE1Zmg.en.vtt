playbook calm and right now we are going
to<00:00:06.450> short<00:00:07.049> cut<00:00:07.519> fluid<00:00:08.519> volume<00:00:08.880> deficits<00:00:10.280> we

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
to short cut fluid volume deficits we

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.990 
to short cut fluid volume deficits we
have<00:00:11.429> three<00:00:11.700> types<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.269> dehydration<00:00:14.000> isotonic

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
have three types of dehydration isotonic

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.830 
have three types of dehydration isotonic

hypertonic and hypo tun in an earlier
video<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.350> gave<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.619> some<00:00:19.770> shortcuts<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.550> how

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
video we gave you some shortcuts on how

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.730 
video we gave you some shortcuts on how
to<00:00:21.090> memorize<00:00:21.539> those<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.109> make<00:00:22.260> sure<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.529> check

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
to memorize those so make sure you check

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.370 
to memorize those so make sure you check
out<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> video<00:00:23.630> with<00:00:24.630> your<00:00:24.779> isotonic

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
out that video with your isotonic

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.279 
out that video with your isotonic
dehydration<00:00:26.070> you're<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.289> water

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
dehydration you're going to have water

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.299 
dehydration you're going to have water
and<00:00:28.849> electrolyte<00:00:29.849> loss<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.470> equal<00:00:32.160> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and electrolyte loss that is equal so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.920 
and electrolyte loss that is equal so
you<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.610> equals<00:00:33.030> amounts<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> water<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
you have equals amounts of water and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.620 
you have equals amounts of water and
electrolytes<00:00:34.649> being<00:00:35.010> lost<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.550> yourself<00:00:35.969> it's

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
electrolytes being lost in yourself it's

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.420 
electrolytes being lost in yourself it's
the<00:00:37.020> most<00:00:37.350> common<00:00:38.219> type<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:39.110> dehydration<00:00:40.430> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the most common type of dehydration this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.540 
the most common type of dehydration this
results<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.719> decrease<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.800> circulation<00:00:44.430> of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
results in a decrease of circulation of

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.959 
results in a decrease of circulation of
blood<00:00:44.610> volume<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.020> an<00:00:47.010> adequate<00:00:47.520> tissue

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
blood volume and an adequate tissue

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.279 
blood volume and an adequate tissue
perfusion<00:00:49.610> things<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.789> note<00:00:52.789> hypertonic

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
perfusion things to note hypertonic

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.549 
perfusion things to note hypertonic
dehydration<00:00:55.460> this<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.699> where<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.870> water<00:00:58.199> loss

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
dehydration this is where the water loss

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.330 
dehydration this is where the water loss
exceeds<00:00:59.539> electrolyte<00:01:00.539> loss<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.920> fluid

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
exceeds electrolyte loss and the fluid

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.090 
exceeds electrolyte loss and the fluid
moves<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> intercellular<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
moves from the intercellular to the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.859 
moves from the intercellular to the
plasma<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.619> my<00:01:07.770> picture<00:01:08.010> here

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
plasma so if you can see my picture here

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.890 
plasma so if you can see my picture here
my<00:01:09.869> lovely<00:01:10.170> drawing<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:11.030> myself<00:01:12.030> right<00:01:12.869> here

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
my lovely drawing of myself right here

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
my lovely drawing of myself right here
and<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.960> intracellular<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.369> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and this is the intracellular this is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.140 
and this is the intracellular this is
gonna<00:01:17.640> represent<00:01:17.970> our<00:01:18.299> plasma<00:01:18.810> areas<00:01:20.150> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
gonna represent our plasma areas the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.899 
gonna represent our plasma areas the
fluid<00:01:21.540> from<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> cell<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.549> actually<00:01:23.549> being

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
fluid from the cell is actually being

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.450 
fluid from the cell is actually being
sucked<00:01:25.610> or<00:01:27.110> dehydrated<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.470> where<00:01:28.829> we're

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
sucked or dehydrated is where we're

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.560 
sucked or dehydrated is where we're
going<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.729> use<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:32.119> it's<00:01:33.119> gonna<00:01:33.299> look<00:01:33.509> like

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
going to use and it's gonna look like

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.230 
going to use and it's gonna look like
that<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:35.159> cell<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:38.240> your

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that so your cell is here and your

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
that so your cell is here and your
plasma<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.759> here<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.899> where<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.590> fluid

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
plasma is here this is where your fluid

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.060 
plasma is here this is where your fluid
has<00:01:44.430> shifted<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.600> move<00:01:45.869> causing<00:01:46.860> this

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
has shifted and it is move causing this

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.550 
has shifted and it is move causing this
cell<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:48.740> dehydrated<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.280> shrinks

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
cell to be dehydrated and it shrinks

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.929 
cell to be dehydrated and it shrinks
next<00:01:53.149> hypotonic<00:01:54.259> dehydration<00:01:55.399> this<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.670> where

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
next hypotonic dehydration this is where

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.050 
next hypotonic dehydration this is where
electrolyte<00:01:57.719> loss<00:01:58.020> exceeds<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.490> water<00:01:59.729> loss

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
electrolyte loss exceeds the water loss

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.630 
electrolyte loss exceeds the water loss
and<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:01.409> fluid<00:02:01.770> moves

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and the fluid moves

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
and the fluid moves
the<00:02:03.090> plasma<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.610> intracellular<00:02:06.710> parts<00:02:07.710> of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the plasma to the intracellular parts of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.540 
the plasma to the intracellular parts of
the<00:02:08.610> cell<00:02:08.850> okay<00:02:09.240> this<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.229> where<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.220> cell

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the cell okay this is where the cell

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.000 
the cell okay this is where the cell
swells<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.780> starts<00:02:13.110> out<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.650> your

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
swells it starts out like this your

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.360 
swells it starts out like this your
normal<00:02:14.430> cell<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.910> then<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:16.710> ends<00:02:17.070> up<00:02:17.160> like

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
normal cell and then it ends up like

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.670 
normal cell and then it ends up like
this<00:02:18.380> swells<00:02:19.380> up<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.510> those<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:22.050> some<00:02:22.230> quick
