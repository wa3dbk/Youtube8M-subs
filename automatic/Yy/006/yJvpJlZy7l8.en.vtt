00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
for people to start recognizing me as

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.430 
for people to start recognizing me as
one<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.390> top<00:02:40.599> in<00:02:40.780> players<00:02:41.019> in<00:02:41.260> North

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
one of the top in players in North

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.949 
one of the top in players in North
America<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.760> know<00:02:42.849> not<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.060> top<00:02:43.390> April<00:02:43.810> like

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
America you know not just top April like

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.379 
America you know not just top April like
top<00:02:44.200> three<00:02:44.230> or<00:02:44.620> maybe<00:02:44.739> even<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.160> best<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.700> think

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
top three or maybe even the best I think

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.569 
top three or maybe even the best I think
that<00:02:46.660> I've<00:02:46.870> already<00:02:47.019> improved<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.829> ton<00:02:48.340> since

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
that I've already improved a ton since

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.340 
that I've already improved a ton since
last<00:02:48.850> foot<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.299> if<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.600> keep<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.930> up<00:02:50.109> then<00:02:50.319> I

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
last foot and if I keep it up then I

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.950 
last foot and if I keep it up then I
think<00:02:50.560> it's<00:02:50.739> possible
