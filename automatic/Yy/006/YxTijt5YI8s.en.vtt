00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 the end of the day in the bathroom i 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.930
 put things in order it's standing on 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.970
 continues to serve the first thing I did 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.740
 slide into the walls of this partition where 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.690
 there is a doorway when i read 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.980
 who took the size 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.350
 on this wall spun screw installed 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.320
 rules and level or plumb set 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.660
 the next screw and in this way have 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.269
 me these screws 2 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.220
 set strictly by level or by 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.060
 plummeted over the solution turned out 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.250
 so here are my what 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.160
 and my other one in the same way i 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.140
 I found my two lighthouses 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
 Installed if I will not what 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.719
 which one I have this wall will be 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.329
 parallel plastered this wall 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:49.469
 here also found these in the same way 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.289
 two t-shirt but first plaster that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.199
 wall with to plaster this bitch 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 of course still set two, the two T-shirt 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.250
 the troops came these here corner angle 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 corner pressed against this wall and pulled 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.830
 the thread there is this one this one 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.189
 general in such a way found and then 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.530
 right sizes from this thread or from this 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.229
 corner and twisted here this one screw 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.730
 took let's say 8 centimeters turned out and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.350
 from this shoelace took let's say 8 centimeters 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.230
 spun or unscrewed this aircraft all 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.760
 further it removed everything complicated the rules and 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:38.070
 the next pic itself also set by 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.990
 plumb through this through this rule 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.740
 and here is the same thing you round me 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.830
 now the angle here is 90 you can 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.890
 watch now show see what 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.290
 Corner a good not see angle he was 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.560
 good look here I pressed so here 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.660
 way and move move move and here 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.490
 see the angle which turned out perfect 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.550
 here look anywhere so here 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.280
 way to cook and of course try 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.470
 to horizontally here and here 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 the corner was pressed and not in that way 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.610
 so not so island so here 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.800
 look again move move move 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.670
 and once a node is 90 degrees 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.130
 without gaps 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:27.150
 these so i have everything i did and when 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:33.390
 I made sure I primed the wall 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:35.580
 walked I will show the primer wall passed 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.160
 because here is on these 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.200
 the walls are dust and this dust is enveloped 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.800
 But this primer only when 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.540
 absorbed then the liquid evaporates and 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.700
 such is done 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.359
 and all the pebbles all the dust and she as if 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.459
 enveloped everything well naturally still in 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.500
 raw it is brick and 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.299
 it's the same here but when i'm dry 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.730
 for example, I will make dust 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.620
 will not be on the finger or here it is 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.769
 plaster she will not pour but she 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.959
 no longer fray there is a film here 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.720
 this is acrylic or latex paint 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.840
 let's say but this is good plaster 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.540
 This paint should not be whipped, of course. 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.510
 if i throw this plaster 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.409
 gypsum on this paint this paint 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.079
 she will soak it very well what 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.000
 she got wet and in the same way i will 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.269
 throw on this brickwork 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.930
 where there is such a film and this 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.120
 primer 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.090
 This primer also has a film this 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.400
 the film gets wet too 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.730
 together everything will dry up and this one 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.950
 the paint will dry too, with the environment 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.340
 plaster and everything will be like this 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.739
 uniform and adhesion will be perfect then 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.639
 have it paint this plaster good 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.989
 why take it off no crack and 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:58.099
 sometime in life will not be 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:00.379
 and the grip will be perfect that's all 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:04.780
 here I will plaster this place here 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:07.510
 I'll leave it shorter tomorrow, all plastered 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.120
 there is not 1 son left and 2 here of course 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.709
 don't have to shoot down that brick here 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.980
 laying that I am here 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.730
 knocked down when you install this beacon 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.510
 did not have to shoot down this brick here 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:27.550
 laying and so it is necessary to bring down further here 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:30.130
 I do not wait for cooking here see here I do not 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.900
 plastering here too also has 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:38.500
 which would not that I'm always doing something 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.890
 everything seems to be told of course these 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.200
 Here are the beacons, they of course dry out mom 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.480
 bitch millimeter millimeter here i'm 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.150
 screw unscrewed there also unscrewed 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.210
 there it will be necessary to unscrew and here too 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.370
 will need to unscrew this screw 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.260
 dries well pissed off i take 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.580
 this is a rib that i don't work 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.590
 I work this here this here 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.410
 Of course it can be erased 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.910
 twisted here I came here like this 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.890
 here's the way well drying out 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.280
 simultaneously everywhere throughout this 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:16.120
 the verticals of this shirt are the same everywhere 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.970
 Drying took place and now see no 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.520
 one cheek is not all exactly of course will 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.570
 exactly drying it occurs 3 microns 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.640
 mikola this is not noticeable angle well 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.680
 Naturally 90 degrees and that's when I 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.160
 I read that this wall when I took 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.130
 parallels and you're here 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.320
 look there the angle will be 90 degrees or 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.620
 no and there is the same thing and this is also the corner 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.420
 let's see we put the corner exactly 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.370
 putting off parallels parallels should 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.260
 to be perfect, I would have told everything 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.420
 work schemes here such a bath remains 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.780
 the floor last of all when what 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.390
 and I will do this watering floor 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.750
 I will throw out and I will be warm 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.810
 the floor that will be straight in this solution 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.400
 being thicker is not this solution not 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.050
 I know it will be necessary to knock down because 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:13.320
 me is the ultimate level 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.460
 along with the corridor is shorter here in my 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.100
 higher higher 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.620
 but before it was of course the same but through 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.330
 the threshold is as if not visible and now 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.980
 felt when we removed the old floor 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.990
 already felt where the bottom here above and 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.550
 everything 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.200
 I don't specifically show films like me 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.000
 I did it all, but you see in it 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.340
 example all say speak even drill not 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.970
 took a screwdriver did not take everything told about 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:42.380
 only a single corner he showed 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.380
 I moved back and forth until
