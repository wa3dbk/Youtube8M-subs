will<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.440> two<00:00:26.010> four<00:00:26.640> pin<00:00:26.880> connectors<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.750> more

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
will be two four pin connectors but more

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.430 
will be two four pin connectors but more
on<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.290> a<00:00:28.560> little<00:00:28.860> later<00:00:29.780> we<00:00:30.780> will<00:00:30.930> start<00:00:31.230> now

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.440 
on that a little later we will start now

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.330 
on that a little later we will start now
with<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.860> 24<00:00:32.340> pin<00:00:32.579> connecter<00:00:34.340> 24-pin

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
connector usually comes in two sections

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.500 
connector usually comes in two sections
that<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.620> will<00:00:40.740> have<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> connect<00:00:41.510> together

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
that you will have to connect together

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.380 
that you will have to connect together
one<00:00:42.960> side<00:00:43.260> has<00:00:43.650> 20<00:00:44.190> pins<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.970> other<00:00:45.090> side

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
one side has 20 pins and the other side

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.920 
one side has 20 pins and the other side
has<00:00:45.690> 4<00:00:46.050> pins<00:00:46.320> which<00:00:47.130> must<00:00:47.400> be<00:00:47.579> attached<00:00:48.000> the

has 4 pins which must be attached the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.470 
has 4 pins which must be attached the
reason<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.380> these<00:00:49.530> separate<00:00:50.250> connectors<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
reason for these separate connectors is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.060 
reason for these separate connectors is
that<00:00:52.200> some<00:00:52.500> small<00:00:52.920> form-factor<00:00:53.610> motherboards

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
that some small form-factor motherboards

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.880 
that some small form-factor motherboards
only<00:00:56.070> use<00:00:56.250> 20<00:00:56.790> pin<00:00:57.000> connectors<00:00:57.540> so<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.530> option

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
only use 20 pin connectors so the option

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.400 
only use 20 pin connectors so the option
is<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.700> motherboards<00:01:00.410> this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
is there for these motherboards this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.399 
is there for these motherboards this
information<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.250> made<00:01:02.520> clear<00:01:02.730> by<00:01:02.850> checking

connector this one gives power to the
processor<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:54.140> can<00:01:54.320> see<00:01:54.590> there<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:54.950> it's

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
processor you can see there that it's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.830 
processor you can see there that it's
keyed<00:01:55.910> it<00:01:56.330> will<00:01:56.570> only<00:01:56.750> fit<00:01:57.080> in<00:01:57.260> one<00:01:57.680> way<00:01:57.890> and

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
keyed it will only fit in one way and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.020 
keyed it will only fit in one way and
there's<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.930> clip<00:02:00.230> that<00:02:00.500> locks<00:02:01.010> into<00:02:01.340> place<00:02:01.610> on

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
there's a clip that locks into place on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.690 
there's a clip that locks into place on
the<00:02:02.090> sock

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.610 

so<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.420> clip<00:02:09.080> there<00:02:09.349> on<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.590> top<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.950> it

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.040 

and<00:02:13.099> there's<00:02:13.340> how<00:02:13.580> it's<00:02:13.879> keyed<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.959> it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and there's how it's keyed so that it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.710 
and there's how it's keyed so that it
fits<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.500> one<00:02:16.190> direction<00:02:16.400> oil

so<00:02:22.320> clip<00:02:24.440> facing<00:02:25.440> towards<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.190> outside<00:02:26.670> of

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
so clip facing towards the outside of

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.370 
so clip facing towards the outside of
the<00:02:26.910> board<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:28.430> then<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.520> will<00:02:29.640> clip<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.380> as

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
the board and then it will clip in as

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.630 
the board and then it will clip in as
shown

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.790 

so<00:02:37.640> here<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.090> new<00:02:38.360> motherboard<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:39.290> has<00:02:39.500> if

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
so here is a new motherboard that has if

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.800 
so here is a new motherboard that has if
an<00:02:40.280> i5<00:02:40.849> processor<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:42.020> has<00:02:42.080> turbo<00:02:42.530> power<00:02:43.810> so

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
an i5 processor that has turbo power so

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.500 
an i5 processor that has turbo power so
when<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.590> are<00:02:45.739> using<00:02:46.030> high-end<00:02:47.030> software

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
when you are using high-end software

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.020 
when you are using high-end software
programs<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.440> require<00:02:48.620> extra<00:02:49.340> power<00:02:49.580> this

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
programs that require extra power this

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.790 
programs that require extra power this
is<00:02:50.209> where<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.630> extra<00:02:50.959> power<00:02:51.170> for<00:02:51.680> the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
is where the extra power for the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.020 
is where the extra power for the
processor<00:02:52.280> comes<00:02:52.550> from<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.810> second<00:02:54.230> 4-pin

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
processor comes from the second 4-pin

desktop Torian because this is the way
you<00:04:36.490> will<00:04:36.880> have<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.240> install<00:04:37.990> them<00:04:38.200> and

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
you will have to install them and

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.010 
you will have to install them and
usually<00:04:39.340> there<00:04:39.790> is<00:04:39.910> very<00:04:40.210> little<00:04:40.420> room<00:04:40.720> for

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
usually there is very little room for

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:50.829 
usually there is very little room for
getting<00:04:41.830> these<00:04:42.310> connectors<00:04:42.820> into<00:04:43.120> position

damage the motherboard so make sure you
are<00:05:48.240> applying<00:05:48.749> pressure<00:05:49.110> up<00:05:49.469> with<00:05:50.309> your

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
are applying pressure up with your

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.699 
are applying pressure up with your
fingers<00:05:50.939> when<00:05:51.419> you<00:05:51.449> push<00:05:51.809> down<00:05:52.080> with<00:05:52.319> your

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:52.709 
fingers when you push down with your

00:05:52.709 --> 00:06:07.410 
fingers when you push down with your
thumbs

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:14.579 

you

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:14.589 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:17.649 

with<00:06:15.589> the<00:06:15.799> 4-pin<00:06:16.249> connection<00:06:16.849> you<00:06:17.209> will<00:06:17.359> have

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
with the 4-pin connection you will have

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.549 
with the 4-pin connection you will have
less<00:06:18.199> room<00:06:18.469> to<00:06:18.679> get<00:06:19.099> in<00:06:19.519> up<00:06:19.909> the<00:06:20.179> connection<00:06:20.629> so

00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:21.559 
less room to get in up the connection so

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:23.199 
less room to get in up the connection so
the<00:06:21.679> best<00:06:21.889> way<00:06:22.099> is<00:06:22.369> to<00:06:22.549> follow<00:06:22.759> what<00:06:23.059> I<00:06:23.179> am

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.209 
the best way is to follow what I am

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:27.549 
the best way is to follow what I am
doing<00:06:23.629> here<00:06:24.849> slip<00:06:25.849> it<00:06:25.969> into<00:06:26.209> place<00:06:26.569> and<00:06:26.899> use

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:27.559 
doing here slip it into place and use

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:30.639 
doing here slip it into place and use
your<00:06:27.799> finger<00:06:28.189> to<00:06:28.609> push<00:06:28.849> it<00:06:28.999> in<00:06:29.119> and<00:06:29.499> it<00:06:30.499> will

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:30.649 
your finger to push it in and it will

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:33.489 
your finger to push it in and it will
click<00:06:31.039> into<00:06:31.339> place<00:06:31.599> it<00:06:32.599> may<00:06:32.869> take<00:06:33.139> a<00:06:33.169> bit<00:06:33.319> of

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:33.499 
click into place it may take a bit of

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:37.859 
click into place it may take a bit of
force<00:06:34.269> so<00:06:35.269> stick<00:06:35.569> with<00:06:35.779> it<00:06:35.929> and<00:06:36.139> it<00:06:36.739> will<00:06:36.949> go<00:06:37.129> in

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:37.869 
force so stick with it and it will go in

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:43.209 
force so stick with it and it will go in
with<00:06:38.869> a<00:06:38.899> bit<00:06:39.139> of<00:06:39.289> persistence<00:06:41.469> so<00:06:42.469> that's<00:06:42.859> it

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
with a bit of persistence so that's it

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.769 
with a bit of persistence so that's it
you<00:06:43.399> have<00:06:43.579> now<00:06:43.789> connected<00:06:44.119> the<00:06:44.569> two

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:44.779 
you have now connected the two

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.929 
you have now connected the two
connectors<00:06:45.259> of<00:06:45.469> the<00:06:45.769> power<00:06:45.979> supply<00:06:46.339> to<00:06:46.819> your

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939 
connectors of the power supply to your

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.239 
connectors of the power supply to your
motherboard
