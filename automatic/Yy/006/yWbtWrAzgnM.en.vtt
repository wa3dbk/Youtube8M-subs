00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 One day goalie thought a delicious 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.680
 strawberry jam bread with honey 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.300
 he does a walk but that 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.739
 strawberry jam bread with honey wanted 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 can not get out of his head because 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:31.410
 Me at MÃ¼ller is truly in the mill 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.580
 as well as my stone in his pig 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.460
 black i share with the table and bed 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.900
 and chairs and sometimes I whistle too 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.900
 on it the most beautiful gate 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.770
 that was nice mÃ¼ller that was even so 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.810
 nice that I totally mine 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.090
 Forget about strawberry jam bread with honey 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.360
 do you think I can too 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.110
 instrument learn clear tom that can do it 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.450
 everyone 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.880
 you just have to practice a bit and you 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.680
 you'll see with music everything works 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.510
 better 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.210
 Tom thought that was a wonderful idea 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.370
 The miller gave him a bass and tom 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.370
 started practicing immediately 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.369
 so you have you probably do not 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.510
 presented 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:31.560
 how would it be with a bit 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:37.869
 rhythm i am tom and play for what 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:42.190
 I think that's a wonderful idea 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.160
 is nothing to stop to clarify 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.479
 would be too cheap minimoys you squeeze 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.090
 and 4b off 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.369
 she's just you she has everything and me 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.369
 on the drum with the banks of a bang 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.789
 your mum 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.650
 the tuba 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:12.830
 but unfortunately my son is no gate 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:25.040
 So we can but better 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:28.040
 definitely now if all of them 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.040
 directions 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.920
 great with music but actually everything 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.599
 better and if we all still 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.450
 playing together is safe on 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:43.120
 Best of all, we are a band 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.120
 Let's go 1234 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.800
 that does not work so well with the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.440
 band because yes everyone has played it 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.510
 you should play 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.600
 no, I as internationally recognized 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.490
 of course no 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.490
 I finally have with the music 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.500
 ever started 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:23.209
 no we are the most 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.209
 and what about me at the zoo 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.459
 not confused 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.950
 but with each other 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.200
 that goes that goes the foot and head itself 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.200
 then you again and again 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.790
 and the nicest things are done 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.580
 are the most beautiful and are ready 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.970
 most 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.970
 everyone 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:07.290
 So Kruse continues to ship you think it works 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:13.159
 not car or the provider from the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.159
 bird house undoubtedly from the borehole 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.539
 hurray a serb got bread with honey 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.190
 Thanks a lot and so did Tom finally 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.400
 Half a strawberry jam bread with 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.560
 honey and that tasted as good as 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.470
 it would have been a whole 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.500
 he still spent the whole day with 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.500
 his band desireless
