dollars so for 30 bucks I can have
digital<00:00:49.110> dash<00:00:49.320> readouts<00:00:49.830> of<00:00:50.130> my<00:00:50.940> horsepower

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
digital dash readouts of my horsepower

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.870 
digital dash readouts of my horsepower
rating<00:00:52.100> there's<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> lot<00:00:53.310> of<00:00:53.400> calculation

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
rating there's a lot of calculation

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.250 
rating there's a lot of calculation
involved<00:00:54.240> and<00:00:54.330> obviously<00:00:54.450> it's<00:00:54.870> not<00:00:54.900> as<00:00:55.110> good

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
involved and obviously it's not as good

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560 
involved and obviously it's not as good
as<00:00:55.380> a<00:00:55.410> dyno<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.490> a<00:00:56.610> rough<00:00:56.820> estimate<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
as a dyno but it's a rough estimate and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.970 
as a dyno but it's a rough estimate and
it's<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> ballpark<00:00:58.170> figure<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.710> probably

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
it's a ballpark figure that's probably

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.400 
it's a ballpark figure that's probably
good<00:00:59.190> within<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:01:00.390> 10<00:01:01.050> horsepower

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
good within you know 10 horsepower

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.189 
good within you know 10 horsepower
depending<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.980> how<00:01:02.130> good<00:01:02.310> your<00:01:02.430> math<00:01:02.610> is<00:01:03.199> but

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
depending on how good your math is but

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899 
depending on how good your math is but
it<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.500> also<00:01:04.650> tell<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> acceleration<00:01:05.759> your

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it can also tell you acceleration your

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.179 
it can also tell you acceleration your
coolant<00:01:06.240> temperatures<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:07.649> boost<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:11.070> know

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
coolant temperatures your boost you know

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.239 
coolant temperatures your boost you know
I<00:01:11.609> will<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.600> hook<00:01:12.899> it<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.320> we'll<00:01:13.859> go<00:01:14.009> for

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:14.249 
I will just hook it up and we'll go for

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:15.649 
I will just hook it up and we'll go for
a<00:01:14.280> lap<00:01:14.429> when<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.820> nighttime<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.450> can

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
a lap when it's nighttime so you can

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.239 
a lap when it's nighttime so you can
actually<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> gauges<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.710> I'm<00:01:16.829> driving

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
actually see the gauges as I'm driving

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:18.830 
actually see the gauges as I'm driving
but<00:01:17.700> yeah<00:01:17.789> you<00:01:17.969> guys<00:01:18.090> should<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.659> check

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
but yeah you guys should really check

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.919 
but yeah you guys should really check
out<00:01:19.049> its<00:01:19.319> the<00:01:19.619> OBD<00:01:20.369> sensor<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.569> one<00:01:21.719> that<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
out its the OBD sensor the one that I

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.599 
out its the OBD sensor the one that I
bought<00:01:22.140> specifically<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.859> called<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
bought specifically is called the I

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.719 
bought specifically is called the I
guess<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> hho<00:01:25.109> VB<00:01:25.409> advanced<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.579> app

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
guess the hho VB advanced and the app

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.169 
guess the hho VB advanced and the app
that<00:01:27.060> goes<00:01:27.179> with<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.539> is<00:01:27.600> torque<00:01:28.079> -<00:01:28.289> it's<00:01:29.179> Apple

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
that goes with it is torque - it's Apple

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.609 
that goes with it is torque - it's Apple
and<00:01:30.359> Android<00:01:30.539> you<00:01:30.929> should<00:01:31.109> really<00:01:31.319> get<00:01:31.469> it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and Android you should really get it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.499 
and Android you should really get it
because<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.490> reason<00:01:32.880> why<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.060> got

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
because it was the one reason why I got

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.379 
because it was the one reason why I got
the<00:01:34.229> standalone<00:01:34.829> tuner<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.119> tuner

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:36.389 
the standalone tuner and not the tuner

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:37.789 
the standalone tuner and not the tuner
that<00:01:36.539> came<00:01:36.749> with<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> wireless<00:01:37.439> built<00:01:37.649> in

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that came with the wireless built in

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.069 
that came with the wireless built in

wondering
matters<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.909> show<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.710> it's<00:02:04.710> gonna

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
matters on this show and it's gonna

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.880 
matters on this show and it's gonna
wirelessly<00:02:05.340> transmit<00:02:05.909> data<00:02:06.060> from<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.869> car<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
wirelessly transmit data from the car to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.380 
wirelessly transmit data from the car to
the<00:02:07.920> device<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.700> give<00:02:08.819> me<00:02:08.970> real-time

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the device and give me real-time

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.760 
the device and give me real-time
information<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.760> guess<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.330> would<00:02:12.510> be

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
information and so I guess that would be

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.420 
information and so I guess that would be
over<00:02:13.770> here<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.310> corner<00:02:14.750> real-time<00:02:15.750> info

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
over here in the corner real-time info

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:25.550 
over here in the corner real-time info
so<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.300> just<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.720> attack<00:02:23.239> ISIL<00:02:24.239> here<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.690> get

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
so this is just a attack ISIL here I get

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.300 
so this is just a attack ISIL here I get
six<00:02:25.860> gauges<00:02:26.280> running<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.890> obviously<00:02:28.890> it's

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
six gauges running and obviously it's

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.530 
six gauges running and obviously it's
not<00:02:29.520> hooked<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:29.850> right<00:02:30.000> now<00:02:30.150> because<00:02:30.270> it's<00:02:30.450> in

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
not hooked up right now because it's in

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.850 
not hooked up right now because it's in
my<00:02:30.630> hand<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.230> these<00:02:31.410> gauges<00:02:31.590> are
