by keeping that moisture and humidity

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.919 
by keeping that moisture and humidity
level<00:01:51.679> down<00:01:51.829> that<00:01:52.520> will<00:01:52.819> keep<00:01:53.539> from<00:01:53.780> any

crawlspace we have tested for humidity

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.649 
crawlspace we have tested for humidity
and<00:01:58.099> we've<00:01:58.280> got<00:01:58.520> monitors<00:01:58.970> still<00:01:59.270> installed

in<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.899> crawlspace<00:02:00.140> measuring<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.039> right

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
in the crawlspace measuring that right

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.449 
in the crawlspace measuring that right
now<00:02:02.079> those<00:02:03.079> were<00:02:03.259> installed<00:02:03.649> about<00:02:03.950> 4<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.280> 6

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
now those were installed about 4 to 6

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.219 
now those were installed about 4 to 6
weeks<00:02:04.549> before<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:05.149> started<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.539> work<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:05.959> will

weeks before we started to work and will

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.630 
weeks before we started to work and will
be<00:02:06.349> installed<00:02:06.709> another<00:02:06.950> week<00:02:07.130> or<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.429> after
