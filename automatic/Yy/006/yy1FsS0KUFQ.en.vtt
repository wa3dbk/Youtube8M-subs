00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
oregano be careful because oregano can

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
be quite strong I like about a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.240 
be quite strong I like about a
tablespoon<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.060> regular<00:02:03.420> leaf<00:02:03.659> leaves<00:02:04.500> for

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
tablespoon of a regular leaf leaves for

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.520 
tablespoon of a regular leaf leaves for
the<00:02:05.310> whole<00:02:05.460> recipe<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.450> start<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.079> little<00:02:07.380> bit

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
the whole recipe but start a little bit

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.410 
the whole recipe but start a little bit
shy<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.399> know<00:02:08.489> maybe<00:02:08.700> start<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.060> teaspoon

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
shy you know maybe start with a teaspoon

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690 
shy you know maybe start with a teaspoon
if<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.810> haven't<00:02:10.259> really<00:02:10.470> eaten<00:02:10.709> raw<00:02:11.129> oregano

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
if you haven't really eaten raw oregano

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.160 
if you haven't really eaten raw oregano
because<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.750> quite

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
because it can be quite

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.040 
because it can be quite
although<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.590> absolutely<00:02:14.280> adore<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.870> can

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050

course you don't need a mini chop or a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.850 
course you don't need a mini chop or a
food<00:02:20.069> processor<00:02:20.100> but<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.540> makes<00:02:22.260> my<00:02:22.470> life<00:02:22.650> a
