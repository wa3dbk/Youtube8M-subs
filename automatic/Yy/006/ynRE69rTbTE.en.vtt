00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
can put in a Mac Mini g4 if it shows

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.689 
can put in a Mac Mini g4 if it shows
anything<00:00:52.079> less<00:00:52.440> than<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.770> such<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.160> 512

sure<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.000> desktop<00:01:12.450> memory<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.080> laptop

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
sure it is desktop memory and not laptop

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.410 
sure it is desktop memory and not laptop
memory<00:01:13.830> here's<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.520> desktop<00:01:14.939> memory<00:01:15.180> looks

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
memory here's what desktop memory looks

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
memory here's what desktop memory looks
like<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.869> here's<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.619> laptop<00:01:17.009> memory<00:01:17.280> looks

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
like and here's what laptop memory looks

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.929 
like and here's what laptop memory looks
like<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.710> you'll<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> start<00:01:20.729> by<00:01:20.880> turning

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the computer upside down a lot of people

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.120 
the computer upside down a lot of people
will<00:01:24.330> say<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> use<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> credit<00:01:25.110> card<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.950> can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
will say to use a credit card but I can

will say to use a credit card but I can
never<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.820> work<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.450> wind

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
never get this to work and I just wind

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.609 
never get this to work and I just wind
up<00:01:27.720> destroying<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.259> card<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> use<00:01:31.380> is

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
up destroying the card so what I use is

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.340 
up destroying the card so what I use is
to<00:01:31.890> flat<00:01:32.250> tip<00:01:32.460> screwdriver<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:33.180> start<00:01:33.930> by

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to flat tip screwdriver I start by

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
to flat tip screwdriver I start by
putting<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.740> first<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.579> then

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
putting the first one in and then

putting the first one in and then
holding<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.360> spot<00:01:36.630> open<00:01:37.049> while<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> insert

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
holding that spot open while I insert

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.319 
holding that spot open while I insert
the<00:01:38.220> second<00:01:38.520> screwdriver<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.240> bit

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the second screwdriver a little bit

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.420 
the second screwdriver a little bit
further<00:01:39.570> down<00:01:42.500> then<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.799> keep<00:01:43.950> doing<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
further down then I just keep doing this

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:57.810 
further down then I just keep doing this
all<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.450> way<00:01:45.479> around

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.180 

at<00:01:58.820> some<00:01:59.810> point<00:02:00.050> you<00:02:00.260> should<00:02:00.290> be<00:02:00.530> able<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.920> lift

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
at some point you should be able to lift

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.990 
at some point you should be able to lift
the<00:02:01.280> top<00:02:01.490> off<00:02:01.700> if<00:02:03.160> all<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.370> want<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.640> do<00:02:04.760> is<00:02:04.880> the

be able to pretty much lift this whole
top<00:03:15.230> section<00:03:15.680> up<00:03:15.830> it<00:03:16.190> may<00:03:16.580> take<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.850> little

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
top section up it may take a little

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.370 
top section up it may take a little
force<00:03:17.390> because<00:03:17.750> there's<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.989> card<00:03:18.260> edge

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
force because there's a card edge

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.160 
force because there's a card edge

this<00:03:21.620> piece<00:03:21.830> upside<00:03:22.250> down<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.760> should

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
this piece upside down and you should

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.690 
this piece upside down and you should
see<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.360> actual<00:03:23.840> hard<00:03:24.020> drive<00:03:24.400> you'll<00:03:25.400> need<00:03:25.580> to

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
see the actual hard drive you'll need to

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.479 
see the actual hard drive you'll need to
remove<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.209> fan<00:03:26.540> first<00:03:27.190> you'll<00:03:28.190> need<00:03:28.370> to

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
remove this fan first you'll need to

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.410 
remove this fan first you'll need to
remove<00:03:28.670> this<00:03:28.910> screw<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.989> one<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:30.830> way

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
remove this screw this one and this way

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.240 
remove this screw this one and this way
then<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.570> can<00:03:32.720> lift<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.050> fan<00:03:33.230> out<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:34.010> might

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
then you can lift the fan out this might

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.590 
then you can lift the fan out this might
be<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.489> good<00:03:34.700> time<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.090> use<00:03:35.239> some<00:03:35.270> compressed
