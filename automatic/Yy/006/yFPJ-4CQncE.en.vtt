00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.880 

alright<00:00:01.170> guys<00:00:01.350> let's<00:00:01.530> go<00:00:01.680> over<00:00:01.709> the

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
alright guys let's go over the

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.420 
alright guys let's go over the
difference<00:00:02.460> between<00:00:03.200> dementia<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.440> delirium

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
difference between dementia and delirium

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.089 
difference between dementia and delirium
and<00:00:06.919> how<00:00:08.660> dementia<00:00:09.660> it's<00:00:10.620> actually<00:00:10.950> not<00:00:11.040> even

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
and how dementia it's actually not even

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.880 
and how dementia it's actually not even
a<00:00:11.340> disease<00:00:12.110> and<00:00:13.759> how<00:00:14.759> dementia<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:16.680> heard

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
a disease and how dementia we heard

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.939 
a disease and how dementia we heard
about<00:00:16.980> all<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> time<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> kind<00:00:19.859> of

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
about all the time but it is a kind of

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.880 
about all the time but it is a kind of
interchangeable<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:21.510> Alzheimer's<00:00:22.260> whether

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
interchangeable with Alzheimer's whether

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.220 
interchangeable with Alzheimer's whether
totally<00:00:23.580> two<00:00:23.789> different<00:00:24.119> things<00:00:24.269> let's<00:00:25.080> go

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
totally two different things let's go

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.670 
totally two different things let's go
over<00:00:25.380> here

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
over here

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.209 
over here
so<00:00:26.340> delirium<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:28.849> dementia<00:00:29.849> are<00:00:30.449> both

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
so delirium and dementia are both

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.819 
so delirium and dementia are both
conditions<00:00:32.219> where<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.600> altered<00:00:34.380> level

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
conditions where we have altered level

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.130 
conditions where we have altered level
of<00:00:34.920> consciousness<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> we're<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.780> able<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
of consciousness so we're not able to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.569 
of consciousness so we're not able to
make<00:00:37.380> rational<00:00:37.710> decisions

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
make rational decisions

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.990 
make rational decisions
we<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:40.070> alert<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.250> orientation

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
we don't have alert and orientation

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.690 
we don't have alert and orientation
times<00:00:42.270> for<00:00:42.629> basically<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.950> can't<00:00:44.190> answer<00:00:44.430> four

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
times for basically we can't answer four

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.549 
times for basically we can't answer four
questions<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:45.360> who's<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.690> name<00:00:45.870> birthday

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
questions like who's your name birthday

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.069 
questions like who's your name birthday

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
president what's the date today that

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.069 
president what's the date today that
kind<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> thing<00:00:50.059> we<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.690> questions

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
kind of thing we have a lot of questions

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.770 
kind of thing we have a lot of questions
and<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.440> whoa<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.219> heck<00:00:53.370> bro<00:00:53.610> crazy

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and like whoa the heck bro crazy

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.189 
and like whoa the heck bro crazy
so<00:00:55.620> delirium<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.760> very<00:00:57.149> brief<00:00:57.600> very

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
so delirium is very brief very

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.430 
so delirium is very brief very
short-term<00:00:59.100> there's<00:00:59.789> nothing<00:01:00.539> wrong<00:01:00.989> with

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
short-term there's nothing wrong with

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.910 
short-term there's nothing wrong with
the<00:01:01.590> actual<00:01:01.800> brain<00:01:02.609> okay<00:01:03.260> it's<00:01:04.260> very<00:01:04.589> quick

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the actual brain okay it's very quick

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.520 
the actual brain okay it's very quick
very<00:01:04.979> short-term<00:01:06.049> basically<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> means<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
very short-term basically it means that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.920 
very short-term basically it means that
you<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:10.040> overcome<00:01:11.040> by<00:01:11.310> let's<00:01:11.970> say<00:01:12.150> drugs<00:01:12.570> or

our dementia patients because our

dementia patients usually do not make

dementia patients usually do not make
time<00:05:39.310> for<00:05:39.550> eating<00:05:39.940> they're<00:05:40.659> usually<00:05:40.930> trying

to find something they want to go

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.110 
to find something they want to go
somewhere<00:05:44.430> that's<00:05:45.430> where<00:05:45.610> we<00:05:45.699> always<00:05:45.820> have<00:05:46.000> to

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
somewhere that's where we always have to

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.270 
somewhere that's where we always have to
reorient<00:05:46.449> them<00:05:46.810> redirect<00:05:47.500> them<00:05:47.650> so

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
reorient them redirect them so

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.430 
reorient them redirect them so
scheduling<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.180> making<00:05:49.509> sure<00:05:49.690> they<00:05:49.840> eat<00:05:50.110> is<00:05:50.380> a

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
scheduling and making sure they eat is a

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.420 
scheduling and making sure they eat is a
big<00:05:50.860> priority

big priority

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.719 
big priority
that's<00:05:52.300> why<00:05:52.449> maintaining<00:05:53.110> weight<00:05:53.349> is<00:05:53.680> a<00:05:54.250> very

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
that's why maintaining weight is a very

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.070 
that's why maintaining weight is a very
good<00:05:55.620> result<00:05:56.620> or<00:05:57.099> basically<00:05:57.580> response<00:05:58.120> it's<00:05:59.020> a

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
good result or basically response it's a

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.439 
good result or basically response it's a
very<00:05:59.259> impatient<00:05:59.710> goal<00:06:01.020> social<00:06:02.020> interaction

patients<00:06:07.479> will<00:06:08.229> want<00:06:08.530> to<00:06:08.620> be<00:06:09.099> by<00:06:09.280> themselves

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
patients will want to be by themselves

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.790 
patients will want to be by themselves
because<00:06:10.270> they're<00:06:10.599> trying<00:06:10.900> to<00:06:11.050> usually<00:06:11.530> solve

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
because they're trying to usually solve

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.060 
because they're trying to usually solve
cases<00:06:12.130> they<00:06:13.090> want<00:06:13.360> to<00:06:13.710> find<00:06:14.710> something

cases they want to find something

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.680 
cases they want to find something
somewhere<00:06:16.169> so<00:06:17.820> including<00:06:18.820> them<00:06:19.030> in<00:06:19.270> group

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
somewhere so including them in group

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
so resistant that's one of the main
