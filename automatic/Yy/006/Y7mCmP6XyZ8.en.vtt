ultramarine blue these are three

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.970 
ultramarine blue these are three
transparent<00:00:21.699> colors<00:00:22.119> now<00:00:23.020> people<00:00:23.650> sometimes

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
transparent colors now people sometimes

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.130 
transparent colors now people sometimes
ask<00:00:24.160> me<00:00:24.340> how<00:00:24.489> you<00:00:24.550> can<00:00:24.789> tell<00:00:25.029> how<00:00:25.750> can<00:00:25.900> you<00:00:25.960> tell

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
ask me how you can tell how can you tell

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.689 
ask me how you can tell how can you tell
they're<00:00:26.320> transparent<00:00:26.739> so<00:00:27.279> here's<00:00:27.520> how<00:00:27.669> you

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
they're transparent so here's how you

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.209 
they're transparent so here's how you
can<00:00:27.970> tell<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.300> difference<00:00:28.739> the<00:00:29.739> easiest<00:00:29.980> way

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:30.219 
can tell the difference the easiest way

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:32.100 
can tell the difference the easiest way
is<00:00:30.250> to<00:00:30.399> really<00:00:30.700> is<00:00:30.879> to<00:00:31.029> look<00:00:31.239> on<00:00:31.450> the<00:00:31.570> two<00:00:31.809> but

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
is to really is to look on the two but

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.490 
is to really is to look on the two but
not<00:00:32.469> all<00:00:32.770> tubes<00:00:33.300> state<00:00:34.300> that<00:00:34.600> and<00:00:34.870> sometimes

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
not all tubes state that and sometimes

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.760 
not all tubes state that and sometimes
it's<00:00:35.649> not<00:00:35.770> so<00:00:35.829> easy<00:00:36.039> to<00:00:36.340> find<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.379> put<00:00:38.590> it<00:00:38.620> to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
it's not so easy to find so to put it to

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.310 
it's not so easy to find so to put it to
the<00:00:38.890> test<00:00:38.920> I've<00:00:39.430> made<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:39.700> black<00:00:40.059> stripe<00:00:40.719> here<00:00:41.170> I

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
the test I've made a black stripe here I

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.580 
the test I've made a black stripe here I
put<00:00:41.890> out<00:00:42.039> a<00:00:42.280> number<00:00:42.789> of<00:00:43.030> colors<00:00:43.449> here<00:00:43.840> and<00:00:43.960> this

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
put out a number of colors here and this

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.410 
put out a number of colors here and this
one<00:00:44.800> here<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.160> my<00:00:45.340> Indian<00:00:45.790> yellow<00:00:46.030> which<00:00:46.239> is<00:00:46.270> a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
one here is my Indian yellow which is a

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.890 
one here is my Indian yellow which is a
transparent<00:00:47.200> color<00:00:47.940> when<00:00:48.940> I<00:00:48.970> paint<00:00:49.300> this<00:00:49.480> over

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
transparent color when I paint this over

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.610 
transparent color when I paint this over
the<00:00:50.020> black<00:00:50.260> stripe<00:00:50.770> you<00:00:51.430> can<00:00:51.610> readily<00:00:51.970> see

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the black stripe you can readily see

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.310 
the black stripe you can readily see
that<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.800> black<00:00:53.980> shows<00:00:54.399> through<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:56.020> this<00:00:56.170> is

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
that the black shows through so this is

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.940 
that the black shows through so this is
a<00:00:56.350> transparent<00:00:57.130> color<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:59.230> let<00:00:59.410> me<00:00:59.500> wash<00:00:59.710> out

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
a transparent color now let me wash out

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.889 
a transparent color now let me wash out
my<00:01:00.130> brush

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
my brush

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.310 
my brush
I'll<00:01:01.899> pick<00:01:02.170> up<00:01:02.230> some<00:01:02.730> cadmium<00:01:03.730> yellow<00:01:03.760> light

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
I'll pick up some cadmium yellow light

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.590 
I'll pick up some cadmium yellow light
this<00:01:05.320> is<00:01:05.530> an<00:01:05.649> opaque<00:01:06.040> color<00:01:06.579> and<00:01:06.909> then<00:01:07.450> when<00:01:07.570> I

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
this is an opaque color and then when I

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.370 
this is an opaque color and then when I
put<00:01:07.840> this<00:01:07.960> yellow<00:01:08.340> over<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.490> black<00:01:09.759> stripe

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
put this yellow over this black stripe

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.219 
put this yellow over this black stripe
you<00:01:11.380> can<00:01:11.590> see<00:01:11.799> that<00:01:11.979> it<00:01:12.070> covers<00:01:12.659> covers<00:01:13.659> fairly

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
you can see that it covers covers fairly

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.230 
you can see that it covers covers fairly
well<00:01:14.439> it's<00:01:15.189> quite<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.460> difference<00:01:15.880> between

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
well it's quite a difference between

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.349 
well it's quite a difference between
those<00:01:16.479> two<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:18.009> this<00:01:18.159> is<00:01:18.219> a<00:01:18.399> transparent<00:01:19.149> color

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
those two so this is a transparent color

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.989 
those two so this is a transparent color
and<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:20.079> is<00:01:20.139> an<00:01:20.409> opaque<00:01:20.740> color<00:01:20.799> now<00:01:21.759> just

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 
and this is an opaque color now just

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.730 
and this is an opaque color now just
because<00:01:22.329> this<00:01:22.509> is<00:01:22.719> Indian<00:01:23.170> yellow<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:23.679> this

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
because this is Indian yellow and this

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.919 
because this is Indian yellow and this
is<00:01:23.950> transparent<00:01:24.700> doesn't<00:01:25.420> mean<00:01:25.539> that<00:01:25.689> all

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
is transparent doesn't mean that all

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.429 
is transparent doesn't mean that all
Indian<00:01:26.859> yellows<00:01:27.280> will<00:01:27.759> be<00:01:27.990> transparent<00:01:28.990> I've

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
Indian yellows will be transparent I've

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.010 
Indian yellows will be transparent I've
seen<00:01:29.770> some<00:01:30.100> manufacturers<00:01:30.819> that<00:01:31.420> manufacture

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
seen some manufacturers that manufacture

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.830 
seen some manufacturers that manufacture
in<00:01:32.200> Indian<00:01:32.679> yellow<00:01:33.009> that's<00:01:33.549> very<00:01:33.999> very<00:01:34.270> opaque

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
in Indian yellow that's very very opaque

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.910 
in Indian yellow that's very very opaque
it's<00:01:35.229> usually<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:36.069> less<00:01:36.639> expensive<00:01:37.060> brands

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it's usually the less expensive brands

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.039 
it's usually the less expensive brands
here<00:01:38.920> I'll<00:01:39.069> take<00:01:39.429> some<00:01:40.020> ultramarine<00:01:41.020> blue

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
here I'll take some ultramarine blue

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.669 
here I'll take some ultramarine blue
will<00:01:41.979> -<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.520> same<00:01:42.759> thing<00:01:43.060> here<00:01:43.529> this<00:01:44.529> is

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
will - the same thing here this is

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.410 
will - the same thing here this is
pretty<00:01:44.889> hard<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:45.219> see<00:01:45.520> because<00:01:45.729> those<00:01:46.270> are

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
pretty hard to see because those are

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.190 
pretty hard to see because those are
both<00:01:46.599> dark<00:01:46.959> colors<00:01:47.969> but<00:01:48.969> the<00:01:49.060> black<00:01:49.299> does<00:01:49.599> show

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
both dark colors but the black does show

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.989 
both dark colors but the black does show
through<00:01:50.999> now<00:01:51.999> on<00:01:52.270> my<00:01:52.479> cerulean<00:01:53.439> blue<00:01:53.849> you<00:01:54.849> can

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
through now on my cerulean blue you can

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.699 
through now on my cerulean blue you can
see<00:01:55.240> that's<00:01:55.419> very<00:01:55.599> opaque<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.499> does

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
see that's very opaque it does

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.339 
see that's very opaque it does
definitely<00:01:57.249> covers<00:01:57.999> and<00:01:58.719> we'll<00:01:58.869> go<00:01:58.990> down<00:01:59.169> the

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
definitely covers and we'll go down the

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.879 
definitely covers and we'll go down the
line<00:01:59.380> we'll<00:01:59.829> pick<00:02:00.039> up<00:02:00.069> a<00:02:00.459> lizard<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.149> crimson

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889 
line we'll pick up a lizard and crimson

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:05.489 
line we'll pick up a lizard and crimson
transparent<00:02:02.889> color<00:02:03.159> as<00:02:03.959> we<00:02:04.959> paint<00:02:05.289> that<00:02:05.469> over

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
transparent color as we paint that over

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:08.910 
transparent color as we paint that over
here<00:02:06.189> you<00:02:06.399> can<00:02:07.029> see<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.630> black<00:02:08.229> shows

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
here you can see that the black shows

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.760 
here you can see that the black shows
through<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.340> doesn't<00:02:09.670> cover<00:02:09.880> very<00:02:10.179> well<00:02:10.770> so

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
through it doesn't cover very well so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.220 
through it doesn't cover very well so
that's<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:12.300> transparent<00:02:13.300> color<00:02:13.540> now<00:02:13.900> pick<00:02:14.200> up

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
that's a transparent color now pick up

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.870 
that's a transparent color now pick up
some<00:02:14.560> my<00:02:14.739> cadmium<00:02:15.280> red<00:02:15.520> light<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:18.010> very

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
some my cadmium red light and a very

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.870 
some my cadmium red light and a very
opaque<00:02:19.360> color<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.830> we<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:21.040> transparent

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
opaque color so we have transparent

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.900 
opaque color so we have transparent
opaque<00:02:22.240> transparent<00:02:23.020> opaque<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.710> on<00:02:23.980> now

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
opaque transparent opaque and so on now

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.180 
opaque transparent opaque and so on now
I<00:02:24.940> find<00:02:25.420> by<00:02:25.600> start

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
I find by start

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.400 
I find by start
out<00:02:26.310> my<00:02:26.520> paintings<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.630> transparent

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
out my paintings with the transparent

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.490 
out my paintings with the transparent
colors<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.100> get<00:02:29.400> much<00:02:30.060> nicer<00:02:30.780> richer<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
colors I can get much nicer richer and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.860 
colors I can get much nicer richer and
darker<00:02:31.860> colors<00:02:32.280> than<00:02:33.000> using<00:02:33.360> any<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.630> my

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
darker colors than using any of my

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.980 
darker colors than using any of my
opaque<00:02:34.530> colors<00:02:35.310> now<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.420> find<00:02:36.750> your

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
opaque colors now if you find your

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.500 
opaque colors now if you find your
painting<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.590> getting<00:02:38.340> chalky<00:02:38.760> or<00:02:39.120> muddy

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
painting is getting chalky or muddy

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.800 
painting is getting chalky or muddy
especially<00:02:40.380> when<00:02:40.530> using<00:02:40.920> glazes<00:02:41.360> most<00:02:42.360> likely

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
especially when using glazes most likely

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.800 
especially when using glazes most likely
it's<00:02:42.960> because<00:02:43.290> you're<00:02:43.470> using<00:02:44.030> opaque<00:02:45.030> colors

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
it's because you're using opaque colors

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.010 
it's because you're using opaque colors
so<00:02:46.800> when<00:02:47.010> using<00:02:47.220> glazes<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.270> most<00:02:48.480> important

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
so when using glazes it's most important

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.340 
so when using glazes it's most important
to<00:02:49.170> use<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.650> transparent<00:02:50.430> colors<00:02:51.230> here<00:02:52.230> I'll

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
to use the transparent colors here I'll

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.040 
to use the transparent colors here I'll
pick<00:02:52.500> up<00:02:52.710> some<00:02:52.920> white<00:02:53.210> of<00:02:54.210> course<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.840> is

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
pick up some white of course this is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.130 
pick up some white of course this is
titanium<00:02:55.650> white<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.330> of<00:02:57.330> course<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.690> covers

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
titanium white and of course it covers

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.460 
titanium white and of course it covers
very<00:02:58.710> well<00:02:59.420> but<00:03:00.420> there<00:03:00.600> are<00:03:00.750> other<00:03:00.930> whites<00:03:01.170> -

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
very well but there are other whites -

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.280 
very well but there are other whites -
there's<00:03:01.740> zinc<00:03:02.310> white<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.970> now<00:03:03.960> that's<00:03:04.170> a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
there's zinc white and now that's a

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.430 
there's zinc white and now that's a
transparent<00:03:05.070> white<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.600> use<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:06.840> very<00:03:07.110> seldom

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
transparent white I use that very seldom

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.070 
transparent white I use that very seldom
but<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.400> would<00:03:08.580> be<00:03:08.700> good<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.210> some<00:03:09.480> instances

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
but it would be good in some instances

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.620 
but it would be good in some instances
like<00:03:10.290> if<00:03:10.500> you're<00:03:10.820> doing<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:12.030> painting<00:03:12.300> that

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
like if you're doing a painting that

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.280 
like if you're doing a painting that
maybe<00:03:12.930> require<00:03:13.380> some<00:03:13.740> fog<00:03:14.700> or<00:03:15.030> mist<00:03:15.240> or<00:03:16.020> smoke

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
maybe require some fog or mist or smoke

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.960 
maybe require some fog or mist or smoke
or<00:03:16.470> something<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.490> they<00:03:17.610> all<00:03:17.760> do

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
or something like that so they all do

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.060 
or something like that so they all do
have<00:03:18.000> their<00:03:18.360> uses<00:03:18.810> I'll<00:03:19.110> put<00:03:19.350> one<00:03:19.560> other<00:03:19.770> color

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
have their uses I'll put one other color

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.960 
have their uses I'll put one other color
out<00:03:20.310> here<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.970> yellow<00:03:21.360> ochre<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.970> it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
out here and this is yellow ochre and it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.410 
out here and this is yellow ochre and it
is<00:03:24.180> quite<00:03:24.630> close<00:03:25.020> in<00:03:25.320> value<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.000> Indian

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
is quite close in value to the Indian

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.820 
is quite close in value to the Indian
yellow<00:03:28.490> but<00:03:29.490> very<00:03:30.000> opaque<00:03:30.570> as<00:03:30.930> opposed<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
yellow but very opaque as opposed to the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.680 
yellow but very opaque as opposed to the
Indian<00:03:32.190> yellow<00:03:32.550> these<00:03:33.180> are<00:03:33.420> really

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
Indian yellow these are really

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.270 
Indian yellow these are really
translucent<00:03:34.680> colors<00:03:34.950> they're<00:03:35.130> not

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
translucent colors they're not

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.880 
translucent colors they're not
transparent<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.330> artists<00:03:36.870> generally<00:03:37.650> call

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
transparent but artists generally call

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.890 
transparent but artists generally call
them<00:03:38.100> transparent<00:03:38.690> transparent<00:03:39.690> would<00:03:39.780> be

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
them transparent transparent would be

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.630 
them transparent transparent would be
something<00:03:40.110> like<00:03:40.260> glass<00:03:40.770> where<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.160> could<00:03:41.370> see

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
something like glass where you could see

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.270 
something like glass where you could see
totally<00:03:42.060> through<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.480> translucent<00:03:43.350> has<00:03:44.040> some

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
totally through it translucent has some

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.090 
totally through it translucent has some
color<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.050> rule<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.380> thumb<00:03:46.830> I

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
color to it so is a rule of thumb I

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.490 
color to it so is a rule of thumb I
generally<00:03:47.640> start<00:03:47.700> out<00:03:48.209> by<00:03:48.360> paintings<00:03:48.930> using

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
generally start out by paintings using

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.860 
generally start out by paintings using
transparent<00:03:50.489> colors<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.150> they<00:03:51.480> generally

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
transparent colors and they generally

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.170 
transparent colors and they generally
work<00:03:52.200> good<00:03:52.500> for<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:53.130> foundation<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:54.060> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
work good for a foundation of the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.170 
work good for a foundation of the
painting<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:55.220> may<00:03:56.220> put<00:03:56.459> out<00:03:56.489> some<00:03:56.790> opaque

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
painting I may put out some opaque

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.960 
painting I may put out some opaque
colors<00:03:57.989> later<00:03:58.260> especially<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:59.100> yellow<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.670> get

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
colors later especially a yellow to get

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.970 
colors later especially a yellow to get
some<00:04:00.180> vivid<00:04:00.390> greens<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:01.320> I'm<00:04:01.410> going<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.650> start

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
some vivid greens but I'm going to start

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.320 
some vivid greens but I'm going to start
with<00:04:02.070> these<00:04:02.220> three<00:04:02.280> transparent<00:04:03.090> colors

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
with these three transparent colors

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330 
with these three transparent colors
because<00:04:03.600> they'll<00:04:03.810> give<00:04:04.350> me<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.680> lot<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.010> nice

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
because they'll give me a lot of nice

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:21.560 
because they'll give me a lot of nice
dark<00:04:05.910> rich<00:04:06.450> tones

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.630 

you
