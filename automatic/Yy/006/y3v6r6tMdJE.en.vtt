this came right great but got my eyes
pretty<00:02:26.920> good<00:02:28.140> round<00:02:29.609> you<00:02:30.609> know<00:02:30.790> where<00:02:31.000> I

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
pretty good round you know where I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.380 
pretty good round you know where I
didn't<00:02:31.329> have<00:02:31.420> my<00:02:31.540> glasses<00:02:31.689> here<00:02:33.090> anyway<00:02:34.090> I

didn't have my glasses here anyway I

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.569 
didn't have my glasses here anyway I
learned<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.319> hard<00:02:35.500> way<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:36.069> that<00:02:36.519> can

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
learned the hard way that that can

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.729 
learned the hard way that that can
explode<00:02:37.239> i<00:02:37.299> guess<00:02:37.659> this<00:02:37.989> tube<00:02:38.290> would<00:02:38.470> fill<00:02:38.709> up

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
explode i guess this tube would fill up

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.199 
explode i guess this tube would fill up
with<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.069> gases<00:02:39.609> and<00:02:40.420> cause<00:02:41.379> it<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:43.120> know

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
with the gases and cause it to you know

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.250 
with the gases and cause it to you know
tornado<00:02:43.689> cannon<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:45.099> anyway<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:46.329> suggest<00:02:47.049> you

I<00:03:10.450> got<00:03:10.810> some<00:03:10.989> little<00:03:11.139> furnace<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.950> hooked<00:03:12.819> it<00:03:12.970> to

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
I got some little furnace I hooked it to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.520 
I got some little furnace I hooked it to
some<00:03:13.599> of<00:03:13.689> this<00:03:14.069> dryer<00:03:15.659> type<00:03:16.659> that<00:03:16.930> used<00:03:17.139> right

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
some of this dryer type that used right

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.750 
some of this dryer type that used right
you<00:03:18.269> drive<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.389> closed<00:03:19.599> in<00:03:20.129> any<00:03:21.129> way<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.310> run<00:03:21.579> it

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
you drive it closed in any way I run it

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.789 
you drive it closed in any way I run it
up<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.329> put<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.540> little<00:03:22.599> hole<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.260> can't<00:03:23.530> see

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
up and put a little hole you can't see

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.729 
up and put a little hole you can't see
there's<00:03:24.220> all<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.639> my<00:03:24.819> wall<00:03:25.540> there<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.530> goes

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
there's all of my wall there and it goes

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.449 
there's all of my wall there and it goes
outside<00:03:27.389> so<00:03:28.389> it<00:03:28.540> just<00:03:28.750> basically<00:03:29.459> invented

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
outside so it just basically invented

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.780 
outside so it just basically invented
outside<00:03:30.909> like<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> dryer<00:03:32.500> would<00:03:32.769> do<00:03:32.949> since<00:03:33.639> the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
outside like a dryer would do since the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.479 
outside like a dryer would do since the
gases<00:03:34.180> are<00:03:34.329> not<00:03:34.510> hot<00:03:34.750> at<00:03:34.930> this<00:03:35.079> point<00:03:35.489> this

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
gases are not hot at this point this

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.319 
gases are not hot at this point this
works<00:03:36.790> is<00:03:37.030> fine<00:03:38.250> see<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.280> gases<00:03:39.819> leave<00:03:40.060> their

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
works is fine see the gases leave their

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.710 
works is fine see the gases leave their
soap<00:03:40.870> around<00:03:41.319> that<00:03:41.590> one<00:03:41.829> go<00:03:42.760> down<00:03:43.060> into<00:03:43.540> that

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
soap around that one go down into that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.979 
soap around that one go down into that
cooler<00:03:44.699> through<00:03:45.699> those<00:03:45.909> two<00:03:46.180> three<00:03:46.750> tubes

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
cooler through those two three tubes

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.569 
cooler through those two three tubes
into<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.799> bomb<00:03:48.069> core<00:03:49.019> filter<00:03:50.250> out<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.489> the

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
into a bomb core filter out of the

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.770 
into a bomb core filter out of the
filter<00:03:51.790> into<00:03:52.629> my<00:03:53.440> motor<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.669> I<00:03:54.879> said<00:03:55.239> today

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
filter into my motor and I said today

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.830 
filter into my motor and I said today
the<00:03:55.959> motor<00:03:56.169> ran<00:03:56.440> great<00:03:57.329> then<00:03:58.329> I<00:03:58.449> started

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
the motor ran great then I started

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.039 
the motor ran great then I started
getting<00:03:58.959> another<00:03:59.290> idea<00:03:59.769> on<00:04:00.389> this<00:04:01.389> would<00:04:01.870> make

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
getting another idea on this would make

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.369 
getting another idea on this would make
a<00:04:02.109> pretty<00:04:02.319> good<00:04:02.590> heater<00:04:02.829> for<00:04:03.129> my<00:04:03.280> shop<00:04:03.609> here

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
a pretty good heater for my shop here

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.909 
a pretty good heater for my shop here
why<00:04:05.379> not<00:04:05.620> produce<00:04:05.859> electricity<00:04:06.609> and<00:04:07.299> heat<00:04:07.919> so

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
why not produce electricity and heat so

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.050 
why not produce electricity and heat so
I<00:04:08.949> just<00:04:09.430> did<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.819> test<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:11.159> did<00:04:12.159> it<00:04:12.310> again<00:04:12.430> not

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
I just did a test and I did it again not

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.569 
I just did a test and I did it again not
let's<00:04:13.120> at<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.690> moment<00:04:14.139> but<00:04:14.799> I<00:04:14.889> let<00:04:15.129> it<00:04:15.250> again

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
let's at the moment but I let it again

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.219 
let's at the moment but I let it again
and<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:17.320> don't<00:04:18.250> know<00:04:18.340> burn<00:04:18.609> about<00:04:18.760> 45<00:04:19.510> cup<00:04:19.959> fulls

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
and I don't know burn about 45 cup fulls

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.399 
and I don't know burn about 45 cup fulls
of<00:04:20.440> them<00:04:20.590> things<00:04:21.240> let<00:04:22.240> get<00:04:22.419> good<00:04:22.659> hot<00:04:22.990> so<00:04:23.349> you

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
of them things let get good hot so you

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.060 
of them things let get good hot so you
turn<00:04:23.770> my<00:04:23.889> fan<00:04:24.130> on<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.760> exhausts<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.479> right<00:04:25.659> on

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
turn my fan on it exhausts it right on

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.610 
turn my fan on it exhausts it right on
out<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.460> I'm<00:04:26.610> not<00:04:26.880> getting<00:04:27.180> any<00:04:27.300> gas<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.380> going

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
out so I'm not getting any gas is going

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.620 
out so I'm not getting any gas is going
on<00:04:28.770> in<00:04:28.980> here<00:04:29.010> everything<00:04:29.820> sealed<00:04:30.120> up<00:04:30.330> getting

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
on in here everything sealed up getting
