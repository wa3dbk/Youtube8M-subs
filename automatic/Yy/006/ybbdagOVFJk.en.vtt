plate<00:02:33.350> I'm<00:02:34.350> going<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.620> cover<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.250> bottom<00:02:35.520> of

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
plate I'm going to cover the bottom of

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.790 
plate I'm going to cover the bottom of
my<00:02:35.940> glass<00:02:36.390> plate<00:02:36.980> with<00:02:37.980> Mod<00:02:38.250> Podge<00:02:39.800> making

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
my glass plate with Mod Podge making

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.770 
my glass plate with Mod Podge making
sure<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.490> there<00:02:42.480> are<00:02:42.690> any<00:02:43.050> spots<00:02:43.530> left

unpainted<00:02:46.160> unglued<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:48.800> want<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.920> make<00:02:50.040> sure

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
unpainted unglued I want to make sure

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.040 
unpainted unglued I want to make sure
the<00:02:50.490> rim<00:02:51.290> has<00:02:52.290> Mod<00:02:52.740> Podge<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.550> way<00:02:53.640> around

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
the rim has Mod Podge all the way around

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.840 
the rim has Mod Podge all the way around
like<00:02:55.050> my<00:02:55.260> other<00:02:55.410> projects<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.250> want<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.730> make

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
like my other projects I want to make

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.530 
like my other projects I want to make
sure<00:02:56.880> there<00:02:57.300> are<00:02:57.480> no<00:02:57.890> big<00:02:59.180> globs<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.770> Mod<00:03:01.770> Podge

sure there are no big globs of Mod Podge
that<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:04.080> painted<00:03:04.590> on<00:03:05.810> very<00:03:06.810> smoothly

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
that is just painted on very smoothly

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.540 
that is just painted on very smoothly
and<00:03:08.239> consistently<00:03:09.239> around<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.650> plate<00:03:11.300> okay

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
and consistently around the plate okay

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.810 
and consistently around the plate okay
I'll<00:03:14.550> take<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.300> tissue<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.680> put<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
I'll take the tissue and put the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.199 
I'll take the tissue and put the
brightest<00:03:18.420> side<00:03:18.900> down<00:03:19.620> as<00:03:20.160> that<00:03:20.400> side<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:20.850> want

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
brightest side down as that side I want

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.220 
brightest side down as that side I want
to<00:03:21.390> show<00:03:22.050> through<00:03:22.320> my<00:03:22.440> plate<00:03:23.570> centered<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.690> in

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
to show through my plate centered it in

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
the middle it's fragile tissue paper is

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.890 
the middle it's fragile tissue paper is
delicate<00:03:31.020> so<00:03:32.010> first<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.120> all<00:03:33.240> I'll<00:03:33.510> press<00:03:33.870> it

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
delicate so first of all I'll press it

doesn't<00:03:47.640> touch<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.150> glue<00:03:49.700> now<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.940> it's

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
doesn't touch the glue now that it's

touched all the way around the rim I'll

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.800 
touched all the way around the rim I'll
work<00:03:53.040> my<00:03:53.280> way<00:03:53.310> around<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.090> plate<00:03:56.690> pushing<00:03:57.690> the

trying to keep it as smooth as I

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.230 
trying to keep it as smooth as I
possibly<00:04:03.270> can<00:04:03.680> there<00:04:04.680> because<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.430> plate<00:04:05.880> is

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
possibly can there because the plate is

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.710 
possibly can there because the plate is
curved<00:04:06.780> there<00:04:07.170> are<00:04:07.410> going<00:04:07.740> to<00:04:07.830> be<00:04:08.510> creases<00:04:09.510> in

isn't<00:04:31.980> that<00:04:32.220> pretty

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
isn't that pretty

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.159

it's<00:04:33.090> pretty<00:04:33.330> already<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:33.900> it's<00:04:33.990> not<00:04:34.050> even

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
it's pretty already and it's not even

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.000 
it's pretty already and it's not even
done<00:04:35.450> I'm<00:04:36.450> going<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.050> set<00:04:37.260> this<00:04:37.410> plate<00:04:37.680> aside

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
done I'm going to set this plate aside

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.460 
done I'm going to set this plate aside
for<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.340> couple<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.640> hours<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.150> dry<00:04:39.419> if<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.320> was

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
for a couple of hours to dry if I was

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.050 
for a couple of hours to dry if I was
doing<00:04:40.710> this<00:04:40.800> project<00:04:41.340> in<00:04:41.460> evening<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.000> think

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
doing this project in evening I think

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.600 
doing this project in evening I think
I'd<00:04:42.390> let<00:04:42.600> it<00:04:42.660> dry<00:04:42.990> overnight<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:47.280> set<00:04:47.520> it

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
I'd let it dry overnight and you set it

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.240 
I'd let it dry overnight and you set it
upside<00:04:48.000> down<00:04:48.030> on<00:04:48.270> this<00:04:48.630> side<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:50.880> dry

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
upside down on this side to dry

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.540 
upside down on this side to dry
here's<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:53.000> plate<00:04:53.210> that<00:04:53.240> I<00:04:53.480> glued<00:04:53.720> earlier<00:04:54.550> it's

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
here's a plate that I glued earlier it's

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:04.180 
here's a plate that I glued earlier it's
completely<00:04:56.060> dry<00:04:58.480> so<00:04:59.480> I<00:04:59.720> will<00:05:00.050> cut<00:05:00.410> away<00:05:03.190> any

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
completely dry so I will cut away any

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.360 
completely dry so I will cut away any
paper<00:05:05.060> that<00:05:05.740> isn't<00:05:06.740> glued<00:05:06.950> down<00:05:08.290> just<00:05:09.370> going

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
paper that isn't glued down just going

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.910 
paper that isn't glued down just going
along<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.820> edge<00:05:10.940> of<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.150> plate<00:05:14.920> cutting

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
along the edge of the plate cutting

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.650 
along the edge of the plate cutting
around<00:05:16.070> edge<00:05:16.460> of<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.730> plate<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:17.150> little<00:05:17.390> bit<00:05:17.540> at

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
around edge of the plate a little bit at

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:29.010 
around edge of the plate a little bit at
a<00:05:17.750> time<00:05:22.180> almost<00:05:23.180> done<00:05:26.470> here

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
a time almost done here

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.380 
a time almost done here
now<00:05:30.020> let's<00:05:30.230> paper<00:05:30.740> cut<00:05:31.370> away<00:05:31.640> from<00:05:31.850> the<00:05:31.970> edges

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
now let's paper cut away from the edges

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.720 
now let's paper cut away from the edges
I'm<00:05:33.080> going<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.410> put<00:05:33.590> one<00:05:33.890> more<00:05:33.920> layer<00:05:34.340> of<00:05:34.370> Mod

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
I'm going to put one more layer of Mod

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.780 
I'm going to put one more layer of Mod
