00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.390
 and that roger I like the same as he showed and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.700
 comes this video stress what is the 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.350
 ruins mode version 2.0 was 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.550
 updated and very good is compatible 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.380
 with knitting onces of the few 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.840
 compatible tips that are being 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.160
 compatible right now with 0.11 and so 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.110
 the truth is very cool because 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.720
 they will know is a way that ruins you 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.370
 how crazy you look that generated one that is that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.570
 it is this 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.570
 that cooking 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 ok it looks super strange another thing that they 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 I'm going to mention the mod looks weird 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.390
 some ruins because it does not require 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.580
 texture but the texture has not been 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.050
 updated so they soon do some 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.850
 ruins that are very strange but with 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.520
 this looks normal and that we have inside 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.500
 of her because as I said some 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.000
 ruins look a little strange so 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.129
 that the texture has not been updated 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.170
 for this version but the measure of 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.790
 ruins that are created are independent 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.770
 they do not require the texture and in fact 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.900
 many like that house upstairs is 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.670
 they generate in the sky look at this that 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.670
 here is like a 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.759
 mini dock what I do not know if it 's okay 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.500
 the ship was also generated if they will know in 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.909
 certain parts with water are generated as 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.189
 what new boats more like that is not 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.679
 generated well that's a boat and the sail 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.869
 over and because we have like that another 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.700
 mini port that were a little like 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.439
 It should be mentioned that the mode a little bit 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.630
 of the ctc because it is here generates 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.700
 quite enough ruins like crazy 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.009
 well because up there are those islands that 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.350
 also like that it generated it badly but in 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.750
 those islands if you took the 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.549
 bother to float and get there sometimes 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.590
 chests I think here not though sometimes 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.939
 they are hidden 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.649
 here it is hidden in the tree and it helps us 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.310
 to fly it they eat it there yes they generated three 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.020
 ruins look like they were pyramids boats 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.970
 every time they feel a loot and alain 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.470
 express generating a 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.710
 it also generates those very strange caves 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.550
 we let him create another one and there's 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.660
 another that comes from below are another ruin 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.479
 here is that 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.160
 lava also generates the ruins with the ba 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.830
 also pyramids with lava inside 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.510
 look there is another one more than anything 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.640
 so that you according to battle without getting 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.290
 what's in the chest and it's a little more 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.420
 of intensity to the matter of truth 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.880
 the mod is very cool and I did not know that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.870
 out compatible simply told me 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.640
 they said and provides version 1 which is the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.380
 that I brought them I know a lot and 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.510
 Version 2 worked if it does not work 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.860
 version 1 does not generate any ruin or 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.760
 nothing and here it is generating the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.760
 then I do not know anything 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.330
 The funniest thing about this is that although 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.300
 that has the mode and go to minecraft 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.060
 normal the ruins remain made by 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.250
 forever 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.480
 I do not know I do not know they disappear like that of the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.730
 diamonds that activate the mod 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.200
 they disappear to diamonds not to almost 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.800
 ruins are left like that for 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.020
 always on the map and then right now that 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.560
 there is another bus appear from nowhere 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.390
 There are other 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.860
 if there was a whole boat because I'm 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.599
 flying like I was doing the crazy thing to see if 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.010
 We did not find the boats but it's coming 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.670
 fact I think here one I think there's one 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.590
 in the shadow 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.090
 here because there is a strange shadow here 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.190
 that is supposed to have formed nothing 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.110
 strange 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.790
 let's see if he gets to take care of a 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.190
 boat my friendship the dock with the chest 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.680
 down but do not form a boat well 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.180
 done but not celebrated way ships and 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.120
 all the pyramids roll well here 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.120
 there 's another strange it is like 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.900
 like that windows when it's very weird 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.909
 that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.980
 and because nothing people do not require us anything 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.470
 nothing else the point js bach to the exception 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.709
 and then I think it's all for this video 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.629
 since I do not find as well as that the 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.310
 well done boat as I wanted and the 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.319
 giant pyramids that make them too 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.569
 they have not left me but they are still 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.730
 It is also formed as I said fat 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.109
 this roll covered by this video does not 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.640
 I found the boat well done maybe we 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.709
 it resonates as they seem this is the boat 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.510
 for this sdk but they have not had the 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.659
 luck and the magic that this generates is 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.579
 structures at sea and is also 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.049
 there is the boat well done well what 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.930
 I want to show you good, it's not there 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.660
 so well done is a part like that 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.070
 ate it from the floor but good is the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.949
 most formed boat that I have seen up to 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.590
 right now and then there is the boat 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.479
 has its little things resources sometimes that 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.070
 the copper control does not bring anything 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.380
 new to the cobra and sometimes for 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.030
 example if done on a floating island 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.669
 you try to upload it and everything and it turns out 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.620
 that then not at the end of accounts not 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.880
 I had nothing not then it's the joke 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.110
 in this way look here area of ​​the 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.410
 wow pyramids 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.420
 wow home see these pyramids more than 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.170
 the more I like they look so effective has been 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.170
 those with lava 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.479
 there is someone in the pyramid to see 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.240
 our saints and saints and 6th 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:04.110
 supposed to have the stones but the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.449
 glows lathe turns on because it is I do not know what 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.969
 it will be that strange rock but good people 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.289
 that despite everything for this video they take care 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.330
 as you can see is one of the pyramids 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.939
 is very father of the mod to be given 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.340
 a little more flavor to your sip the same and 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.440
 well 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.750
 I add him miserly some time but 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.790
 way any single version broke the 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.680
 map if you pass them that good try to 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.210
 always as I tell you back in your 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.490
 most important worlds in the event that 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.830
 comes to pass what is still strange but in this 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.419
 version I do not think it happens but well what 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.080
 object per uploaded in Vienna songs 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.430
 floating with chests everywhere that do not 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.320
 it is not got nothing but a no if it has 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.120
 they are also hidden in the tree there 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.460
 are we to see a lot here 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.020
 there are those who offer and then nothing 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.020
 care and goes ae
