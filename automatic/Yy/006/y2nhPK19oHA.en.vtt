00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
marlton or stew linger would be the one

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.100 
marlton or stew linger would be the one
to<00:01:35.729> fear<00:01:35.909> because<00:01:36.210> marlton<00:01:36.689> had<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:36.990> those

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
to fear because marlton had all those

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.109 
to fear because marlton had all those
quotes<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.530> Newtown<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:37.890> he's<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
quotes in Newtown and he's like this the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.380 
quotes in Newtown and he's like this the
the<00:01:39.680> scientist<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:40.829> whatever<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.390> stew

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the scientist or whatever and stew

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.880 
the scientist or whatever and stew
lingers<00:01:42.720> turning<00:01:42.990> into<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> zombies<00:01:43.680> so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
lingers turning into the zombies so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.200 
lingers turning into the zombies so
would<00:01:44.009> make<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.189> lot<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.399> sense<00:01:44.729> opposed<00:01:44.970> him

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
