00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.020
 tools and this 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.300
 by hand it is also true that it is the hand 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.100
 that we have strong is the thing this 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.960
 going to do bike in Barcelona and you 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.589

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.290

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.780
 she bore him what makes you big pussy 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.760
 so lady, how are we doing, thanks 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.340
 and the borja is here to unpack 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.199
 for the box to put the bike in then 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.670
 the above video how to try here 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.800
 steal some bike that would be good to 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.019
 there are a few but above all how 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.760
 disassemble it to put it in a box and 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.530
 send the leg before to make a 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.409
 little honor to the thing in the delivery 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.729
 it was before yesterday and yesterday we 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.829
 we walk today because the bike was given to me 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.390
 Yesterday and today has had to make the adjustment of 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.129
 the whole bike or what they gave us 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.570
 special permission of the titan desert for 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.790
 arrive at the last minute, so many 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.899
 thanks to rpm for the consideration here 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.350
 there is the mounted bike 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.479
 the first thing is a gps for home and this 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.550
 that we save ourselves and man we have a spare 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.990
 piece wheel and to put it in the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.610
 we had to do like the cropped 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.289
 like the shotguns cut out 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.030
 cut him a little bit of entrance man 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.679
 this already only has a single axis so 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.830
 It will be easier than going to need 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.490
 to dismantle this if we're lucky 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.799
 come the process 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.200
 already just dismantling noise forward and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.509
 clever pedals and saab applications released 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 throw perfect if you get robbed something 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.990
 you throw the key in the head is already 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.100
 worn out you can already mount me pedals that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.869
 whenever we have disassembled we have 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.080
 had problems because we never know if 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.420
 is next to the clock or the opposite of 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.580
 then it can only be that what 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.049
 break or we do it well would be 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.880
 better to do it well and it made you a lot 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.310
 illusion and free good either you 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.679
 Believe you now missing for a week the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.330
 change does not come so if you break it 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.810
 I already have an excuse to decide that 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.310
 it's even the box and for home we're going to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.569
 hold the box and see if we 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.569
 we saved the pedals 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.680
 Look, I think we're going to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.290
 save to remove pedals because they 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.209
 will break the box sometime and chubby 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.670
 is that it was already back 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.099
 give it now as they do all tour tour 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.780
 tour rotates and energy generates energy in 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.160
 defend defend defend defend 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.580
 this good key of these to do 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.870
 lever boss here but here we have 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.870
 found the one that was missing 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.680
 I think the bikes are very 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.599
 well for the next one a fisher-price 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.370
 a fisher-price you put it on and take 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.130
 for ass both ride and disassemble man 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.290
 canon gentlemen of fisher-price for the 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.480
 next here 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.480
 weary and fernando the visit of strong 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.380
 perfect lever good thanks many 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.540
 thanks in the video 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.140
 we delete it and it seems that what 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.140
 we have made us 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.140
 host 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.380
 we do not have tools to get this out 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.819
 and therefore I do against leverage 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.819
 come one two three 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.030
 here you go from so professionals with 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.400
 tools and this 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.990
 by hand it is also true that it is the hand 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.660
 that we have strong 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.160
 Now it's time to remove the front wheel 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.140
 we need a tool either 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.970
 not not well this yes yes this rule 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.459
 Remove 26 times in two days 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.580
 eye trick here to take out the wheel of 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.170
 forward it is not necessary to remove the 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.170
 two the one above only loosens 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.790
 fuck of this video I will have to edit 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.980
 too cut the mind 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.569
 come on, this is what happens then I do not 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.510
 agreement to cut to cut we stayed 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.630
 fatal come here now and remove the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.250
 wheel in front of the wheel for the same with 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.930
 the important rear wheel does not 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.820
 wrong on the side of the thread that already 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.410
 has ever happened to us and then what 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.690
 Thread with how smart we are 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.310
 we put the bushing back inside 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.200
 we are also the exchange pin 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.239
 to not fuck the thing that time and 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.160
 visitor both austria and at the end the 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.440
 good thing is always a misery 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.210
 we put a little plastic to avoid rolling 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.830
 the all how 's it going if we 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.479
 we avoid of dismantling man there is no 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.860
 disassemble or the handlebar with wheel for 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.469
 in 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.689
 the pedals for a bit of 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.250
 tape to ensure the item does not go to 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.840
 unless we go down the thing 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.120
 we made the pedals to the wheel so that 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.819
 do not miss the thing but never 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.159
 made it look aerodynamic that we have 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.689
 studied and in the end hire nobody 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.250
 to disassemble furniture at home mola 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.469
 cardboard boxes so they do not go away 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.320
 cities through a hole we make the ball 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:52.080
 with this 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.970
 this is bricomanÃ­a but for so 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.550
 important to close the box is not going to be 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.400
 that we drop the bike outside and now 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.070

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.240
 make a good seal that I do not know 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.680
 I that we also have life 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.390
 I'm going to say that I think I'm the only 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.370
 geek that I came to the other end 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.620
 of barcelona of the free zone and 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.120
 driving the bike do not think that 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.610
 I'm dressed like that because I like to ride 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.760
