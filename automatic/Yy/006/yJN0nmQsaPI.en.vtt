paradox<00:03:25.720> actually<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.780> think<00:03:26.960> they<00:03:27.290> appeared

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
paradox actually I think they appeared

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.500 
paradox actually I think they appeared
in<00:03:27.830> brawl<00:03:28.130> together<00:03:28.610> so<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:28.910> don't<00:03:29.210> think<00:03:29.420> it

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
in brawl together so I don't think it

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.480 
in brawl together so I don't think it
was<00:03:29.600> too<00:03:29.750> much<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:29.960> a<00:03:30.110> time<00:03:30.290> paradox<00:03:30.560> anyways

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
was too much of a time paradox anyways

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.430 
was too much of a time paradox anyways
else<00:03:32.180> I'd<00:03:32.390> love<00:03:32.660> it<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.960> for<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.230> next

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
else I'd love it to you for the next

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.640 
else I'd love it to you for the next
video<00:03:33.860> I'll<00:03:34.040> see<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.310> all<00:03:34.430> then
