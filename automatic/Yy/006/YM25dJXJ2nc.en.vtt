released<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:02.980> case<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:05.040> replacing<00:01:06.040> it<00:01:06.130> is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
released from a case and replacing it is

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.800 
released from a case and replacing it is
very<00:01:06.640> simple<00:01:06.850> provided<00:01:07.360> you<00:01:07.420> have<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.689> right

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
very simple provided you have the right

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.010 
very simple provided you have the right
tool<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:09.250> not<00:01:09.280> this<00:01:12.450> first<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:13.600> have<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.810> line

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
tool it's not this first we have to line

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.810 
tool it's not this first we have to line
it<00:01:14.049> up<00:01:14.290> then<00:01:14.680> without<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.010> movement<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.610> dial

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
it up then without a movement and dial

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.429 
it up then without a movement and dial
it's<00:01:16.119> difficult<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.720> get<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:16.930> exactly<00:01:17.350> right

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
it's difficult to get it exactly right

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.600 
it's difficult to get it exactly right
so<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.320> leave<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.920> crystal<00:01:21.070> in<00:01:21.369> some

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
so and I leave the crystal in some

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.890 
so and I leave the crystal in some
people<00:01:21.909> say<00:01:22.390> they've<00:01:22.540> got<00:01:22.659> out<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.840> the
