 hi welcome to you on the channel review 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.910
 toys today i will tell you about my 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.509
 homemade from Lego 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 in minecraft style as you know already 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.300
 there is a designer preparing 4 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.160
 or 3 series of this series of designers 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.580
 lego minecraft natural and made there 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 bias everything under micro dimensions and i decided 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.300
 to make 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.010
 a piece of the world in size minifigures so 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.910
 we see here everything is done in size 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.050
 minifigures 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.890
 except for how to say lake 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.570
 here we see it is a very small Christmas tree 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.850
 flowers all the same here we see myself 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.090
 home of our main character like us 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.170
 he sees me here at the head 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:02.730
 To which he lives I made him by 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.500
 the sides are empty in order to be easy to put 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.420
 there character specially thought it over 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.490
 put believe and here we see the door 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.270
 the door and of course I have everything here 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.100
 running doors open freely 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.439
 see the roof of the wooden Don himself too 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.450
 made of wood and there is a window 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.030
 decided to diversify the cold to me sending 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:34.259
 could but here we see the fragment skeleton itself 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:39.329
 In fact, in general from the series I will now say 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.079
 how is it called ninjago where there were 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.520
 spinners 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.930
 and so I bought myself such a character 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.979
 put here as a skeleton since u 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.000
 I do not have a real skeleton and as we see 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.110
 it is located on a snowy mountain here it is 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.500
 snow mountain itself at the very top you 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.620
 mountains there is a small Christmas tree in the usual 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.560
 we have a big tree in the forest 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.810
 well in general here in my world here in this 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.680
 slice of the world shows nothing more 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.680
 especially on
