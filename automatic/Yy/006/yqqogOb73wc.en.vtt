00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
compact I mean don't expect it to have a

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.420 
compact I mean don't expect it to have a
large<00:05:16.680> when<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:17.800> are<00:05:17.919> you<00:05:18.039> have<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.310> remember

not<00:05:21.220> sure<00:05:21.430> whether<00:05:21.669> this<00:05:21.880> ribosome<00:05:22.659> necessity

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
not sure whether this ribosome necessity

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.339 
not sure whether this ribosome necessity
I<00:05:23.860> think<00:05:24.789> that<00:05:24.940> they<00:05:25.180> made<00:05:25.599> it<00:05:25.750> there<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:26.080> so

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
I think that they made it there to so

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.760 
I think that they made it there to so
that<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.740> lens<00:05:26.949> of<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.190> look<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:27.490> bad<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:29.620> take

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
that the lens of the look so bad to take

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.100 
that the lens of the look so bad to take
the<00:05:29.919> attention<00:05:30.190> away<00:05:30.460> this<00:05:31.330> is<00:05:31.479> rough<00:05:31.840> it<00:05:31.990> is

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
the attention away this is rough it is

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.499 
the attention away this is rough it is
like<00:05:32.289> an<00:05:32.500> ugly<00:05:32.710> girl<00:05:32.889> here<00:05:33.370> wearing<00:05:33.669> a<00:05:34.180> very

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
low-cut top that's right I don't think

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.270
