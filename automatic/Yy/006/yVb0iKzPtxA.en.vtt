00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
small in terms of the size so I would

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.780 
small in terms of the size so I would
recommend<00:02:16.030> for<00:02:16.510> anyone<00:02:16.719> who<00:02:17.049> is<00:02:17.319> buying<00:02:18.280> these

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
recommend for anyone who is buying these

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.179 
recommend for anyone who is buying these
pairs<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.450> shoes<00:02:19.689> you<00:02:20.140> should<00:02:20.349> probably<00:02:20.560> go<00:02:20.920> at

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
pairs of shoes you should probably go at

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.149 
pairs of shoes you should probably go at
least<00:02:21.400> half<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.670> size<00:02:21.969> or<00:02:22.719> a<00:02:22.750> full<00:02:23.170> size<00:02:23.439> bigger

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
least half a size or a full size bigger

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.979 
least half a size or a full size bigger
so<00:02:24.640> then<00:02:24.819> you<00:02:25.060> can<00:02:25.209> be<00:02:25.359> a<00:02:25.390> little<00:02:25.659> bit<00:02:25.810> more

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
so then you can be a little bit more

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.179 
so then you can be a little bit more
comfortable<00:02:26.319> when<00:02:26.620> you're<00:02:26.769> wearing<00:02:26.950> them

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
comfortable when you're wearing them

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.789 
comfortable when you're wearing them
just<00:02:27.640> because<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.030> feel<00:02:28.659> like<00:02:28.959> just<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.680> the

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
just because I feel like just in the

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.880 
just because I feel like just in the
front<00:02:30.010> it's<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.489> little<00:02:30.819> bit<00:02:31.260> tight<00:02:32.260> for<00:02:32.290> my

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
front it's a little bit tight for my

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.580 
front it's a little bit tight for my
feet<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:35.700> these<00:02:36.700> are<00:02:37.090> actually<00:02:37.840> four<00:02:38.109> hundred

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
feet and these are actually four hundred

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.410 
feet and these are actually four hundred
and<00:02:38.769> seventy-five<00:02:39.370> dollars<00:02:39.609> and<00:02:40.030> then<00:02:40.150> plus

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
and seventy-five dollars and then plus

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.770 
and seventy-five dollars and then plus
taxes<00:02:40.959> they<00:02:41.739> were<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.549> think<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:43.150> fabric<00:02:43.359> ones

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
taxes they were I think the fabric ones

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.099 
taxes they were I think the fabric ones
were<00:02:44.079> 300<00:02:44.920> something<00:02:45.299> dollars<00:02:46.299> last<00:02:46.510> year<00:02:46.750> and

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
were 300 something dollars last year and

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.140 
were 300 something dollars last year and
the<00:02:47.349> leather<00:02:47.650> ones<00:02:47.980> were<00:02:48.340> 400<00:02:48.970> something

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
the leather ones were 400 something

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.110 
the leather ones were 400 something
close<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.659> 500<00:02:50.200> dollars<00:02:50.290> however<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.669> year<00:02:52.060> I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
close to 500 dollars however this year I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.770 
close to 500 dollars however this year I
guess<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.650> price<00:02:53.889> went<00:02:54.159> up<00:02:54.220> by<00:02:54.459> around<00:02:54.879> $100

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
guess the price went up by around $100

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.750 
guess the price went up by around $100
so<00:02:56.319> they<00:02:56.560> were<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.709> bit<00:02:56.950> more<00:02:57.159> expensive<00:02:57.519> than

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
so they were a bit more expensive than

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.149 
so they were a bit more expensive than
last<00:02:58.000> year<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.569> she<00:02:59.260> did<00:02:59.409> mention<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.889> you

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
last year and she did mention that you

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.879 
last year and she did mention that you
know<00:03:00.519> they<00:03:00.849> just<00:03:00.879> got<00:03:01.299> them<00:03:01.689> so<00:03:02.019> if<00:03:02.500> you're

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
know they just got them so if you're

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.369 
know they just got them so if you're
interested<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:03.639> getting<00:03:03.849> them<00:03:04.180> sure<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.629> said

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
interested in getting them sure you said

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.170 
interested in getting them sure you said
that<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:05.950> was<00:03:06.159> the<00:03:06.250> last<00:03:06.400> pair<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.120> she

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
that this was the last pair so she

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.580 
that this was the last pair so she
doesn't<00:03:07.540> know<00:03:07.629> which<00:03:07.870> they're<00:03:08.109> getting<00:03:08.230> more

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
doesn't know which they're getting more

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.890 
doesn't know which they're getting more
so<00:03:09.189> it<00:03:09.639> would<00:03:09.790> probably<00:03:10.000> be<00:03:10.239> best<00:03:10.450> if<00:03:10.599> you<00:03:10.750> put

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
so it would probably be best if you put

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.809 
so it would probably be best if you put
yourself<00:03:11.230> on<00:03:11.379> like<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.919> waiting<00:03:12.340> list<00:03:12.489> or

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
yourself on like a waiting list or

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.099 
yourself on like a waiting list or
something<00:03:13.120> like<00:03:13.269> that<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.629> then<00:03:13.780> they<00:03:13.930> can

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
something like that so then they can

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.929 
something like that so then they can
call<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.470> when<00:03:14.650> they<00:03:14.769> receive<00:03:15.129> them<00:03:15.340> now<00:03:15.790> I'm

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
call you when they receive them now I'm

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.759 
call you when they receive them now I'm

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769
