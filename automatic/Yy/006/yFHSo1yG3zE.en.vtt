00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
inches to 61 inches so that is the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.170

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
has no five-point harness so I would

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.170 
has no five-point harness so I would

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
so I like that about it now it has latch

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.419 
so I like that about it now it has latch
now<00:01:25.229> let's<00:01:25.409> talk<00:01:25.529> about<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.859> latch<00:01:26.130> here

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
now let's talk about this latch here

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.269 
now let's talk about this latch here
right<00:01:26.819> now<00:01:26.969> now<00:01:27.179> the<00:01:27.899> latch<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.679> a<00:01:28.979> loose

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279 
right now now the latch it's a loose

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:32.179 
right now now the latch it's a loose
latch<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.029> the<00:01:30.389> reason<00:01:30.779> it<00:01:30.929> has<00:01:31.289> a<00:01:31.590> latch<00:01:31.889> is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
latch and the reason it has a latch is

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.839 
latch and the reason it has a latch is
just<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.149> keep<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.810> seat<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.439> place<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:35.670> if

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:35.849 
just to keep the seat in place like if

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:37.429 
just to keep the seat in place like if
it's<00:01:35.999> empty<00:01:36.359> in<00:01:36.479> your<00:01:36.599> car<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.139> get<00:01:37.259> into

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
it's empty in your car and you get into

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.199 
it's empty in your car and you get into
a<00:01:37.469> collision<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.219> that<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.459> doesn't<00:01:38.849> become<00:01:38.969> a

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
a collision so that it doesn't become a

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.300 
a collision so that it doesn't become a
