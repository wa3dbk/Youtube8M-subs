00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.230
 hi everybody knows michael and 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.560
 today we find ourselves again 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.120
 come into way on call of duty black ops 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 from where to sell domination on the map 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.590
 reindeer with the silent mp7 them 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.060
 killstreaks micro orbital station 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.380
 dogs and hunting group and like you 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.850
 can see it before your eyes this is the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.510
 gameplay started for a while I 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.149
 are currently doing 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.980
 from 8 to 5 years strings have frankly a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.929
 score also mouths while the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 part started already since well 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.780
 for a long time it's really ugly and so 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.920
 why did not I forget you 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.570
 first part of the game because like 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.909
 I just said it was really 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.589
 horrible I was doing chained but 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.569
 really but would cost dry but 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.129
 really a dry with gravel and 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.499
 frankly moment I said to myself we're going 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.819
 lubricated all that and it's going to go a lot 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.530
 better frankly is pass 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.300
 quietly after the party I do not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.319
 do not know why that's why this start 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.579
 of party was also horrible 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.260
 Yet my allies was putting 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.579
 VSATs and knows how to play with 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.379
 smooth so frankly I told myself 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.270
 it should be well done 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.290
 that's why I'm doing parts of 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.640
 gods I do not know I was maybe 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.649
 not hot but you'll see that at 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.880
 from now on it's really going 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.850
 send big heavy 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.409
 and then here is today I 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.549
 wanted to come back on a little thing I 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.039
 would like to talk to you about one thing 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.789
 two remarks right now is that 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.950
 on Youtube 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.469
 there are scrambles yes yes gentlemen 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.549
 there are tweets on youtube 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.229
 normally this sentence would not want 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.060
 to say anything because youtube scramble 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.640
 it should not even exist in the same 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.140
 sentence but that's like last year 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 there was a mess with I 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.159
 not know if you remember news 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.380
 critical hd kfn video machin gain 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.729
 time of rooney man 1 and I had given 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.539
 my feeling surely this chain know 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.960
 not if you remember 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.369
 it's been a long time now and there he 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.840
 yad'autres tangles melons Thursday 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.859
 I like to quote demonstrates that otherwise the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.539
 people do not understand what I want 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.399
 to tell there is jingle between them joe 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.450
 space and suck me that bunny but I 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.850
 considering that and still good bonuses 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.829
 magnitude because there was khairi 78 done 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.540
 a video ya swaps' gaming made a 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.670
 big video where he unveiled things 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.230
 terra and I would like to come back to a 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.350
 only thing compared to all these 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.640
 stories I 'm fighting them then 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.080
 you will tell me why is that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.570
 you make videos if you do not care 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.800
 complete then I'll just have to come back 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.750
 on one thing it's true that people 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.370
 join my cause actually why am I 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.100
 say that because at the base 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.410
 you're going to say my guy you take for 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.400
 a peace and love her but that's no no 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.350
 it's not fair it's not at all 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.710
 but it's just that I do not understand 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.720
 why do guys that clash on a 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.220
 platform as they and youtube to the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.570
 base they came there they laid 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.010
 their pickups they did a gameplay 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.780
 they commented on their gameplay they have 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.040
 put on youtube to please some 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.980
 people and to please m 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.380
 why go insult them 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.730
 why do they do that I do not know must 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.370
 probably explain to me because there I 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.780
 really do not understand and frankly 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.340
 the guys who make good videos the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.810
 dodgers pay I love these videos 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.820
 the estoril did that makes me a lot 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.680
 laugh suspense videos at the pinault 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.050
 with the youtuber thing there it was 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.040
 really funny there with with all 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.570
 youtube hours that was making 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.070
 matches where they invented others not 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.260
 yes changed when this back was really 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.230
 very funny I loved it but 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.970
 why both clashed 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.800
 why they create scrambles for 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.989
 nothing because at the base on the gold 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.090
 chain they have a lot of subscribers 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.980
 frankly a lot of people appreciate 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.720
 their video what it brings them back from 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.360
 hide like that it's just hate 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.920
 and people who are going to order who 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.540
 wanted to unsubscribe from their channels 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.100
 because they are saying well, voila 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.170
 insults of the things so I do not know 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.330
 more and that's it I do not understand 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.950
 why put them stuff like that 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.720
 on youtube at the base all this to get 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.190
 relax I repeat it again but at the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.600
 base we are all here I go home 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.549
 me at night I turn on my pc I sell 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.739
 video on youtube it's to relax 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.620
 it's to laugh or to learn something 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.150
 thing about a game or I do not know 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.610
 me just to entertain myself like that but 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.049
 no defends falls on videos and when 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.239
 I go home and I see thing 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.720
 clash thing or I'm telling the truth about 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.310
 everybody 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.570
 frankly that does not want to 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.260
 watch his videos that gives me less 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.060
 in less funny 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.980
 watch videos and I think I 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.239
 I'm not the only one to be like that 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.799
 think that more and more people are 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.390
 tired of this kind of little clash that 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.790
 are useless because even people 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.709
 who are subscribers to the joe chain 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.209
 space or to someone even if for example 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.900
 you who are subscribers to my channel 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.540
 those who listen to me 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.129
 currently if I start to make 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.659
 create scrambles game clash thing 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.100
 I will for example clasher replicating 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.329
 you know it's a friend of mine so here you go 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.440
 I imagine in play the size clash 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.180
 makes more videos this is an asshole 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.650
 go the 10 nice who are you going to 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.090
 to say but what are you doing but 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.889
 we do not care, we're here to 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.210
 relax and not there to go chi 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.770
 someone else frankly I do not 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.760
 do not understand then that's just it 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.199
 meant in relation to this case 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.010
 me there I do not care completely 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.720
 guys do what they want in their 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.220
 corner but why if they get confused they 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.020
 do not think about skype I do not know it 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.490
 is called they really call themselves the 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.229
 four truths opposite not the 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.160
 videos on youtube to prevent all 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.810
 world like what they liked 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.440
 contentment against each other 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.490
 a discontent surrendered 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.539
 disagreement behind the other 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.699
 frankly I do not understand why 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.770
 that but that's it so I'm sorry if I 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.360
 have told you about my 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.530
 my little lonely rebellion the 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.880
 not a rebellion at all but 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.110
 well here I just wanted to give my 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.020
 opinion on it I fight the balls 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.580
 1 as usual but that was it 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.570
 samsung just to see some always 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.039
 scramble on youtube 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.930
 always eager in addition to the big ones 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.900
 youtuber is anything 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.250
 I do not understand short anyway I 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.419
 am here to make you spend a moment 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.430
 so I hope the video will you 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.570
 please you will stop feeling sorry for me 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.699
 my fate guys do what they want 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.340
 but here I just wanted to spend a 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.889
 little message so I'm sure red with 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.940
 the with hate right now so you 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.840
 could see that frankly I got 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.370
 well awake wide begin to 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.960
 Unlocking the VSAT of dogs 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.280
 groups of hunters and since I have 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.510
 does for all a fat girl a 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.580
 really time that groups of 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.050
 to hunt dogs by massacre so this 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.180
 that I wanted to tell you is that I 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.710
 a lot of time without video atpu 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.130
 last week I had done a 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.979
 video 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.240
 last wednesday and so why did I 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.949
 P2Y12 not you already explained 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.210
 it's the end of the quarter if 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.010
 I had to work well the end of 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.960
 quarter and where besides tonight there 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.610
 at my class board so I laugh 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.050
 really to take tariffs I think 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.580
 that he wants to keep you at camp on 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.840
 twitter of what is 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.099
 or what but honestly I have not 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.389
 so much easier anyway 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.250
 worked this quarter is not no 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.050
 more like a wave and I think that 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.819
 the teachers saw it and I risk 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.469
 take to take part of which a good 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.520
 tall at tonight's class council 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.710
 so frankly I'll hold you to 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.879
 running on twitter for those who me 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.439
 follow and then here I'll hold you 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:12.509
 aware all cases of all that 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:14.009
 happened at my year's level 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.590
 school because I think there on 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.120
 the end I took a little bit expensive here 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.979
 so guys anyways I hope that 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.270
 this video you liked I hope my 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.110
 small killing on the end you enjoyed 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.270
 since the groups of 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.419
 chasing the dogs have done rather a 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.639
 pretty intersideral slaughter I would say and 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.569
 So here we are frankly I find myself 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.009
 do not know when for a next 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.539
 video I try to make it the fastest 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.879
 possible I also try to make you a 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.020
 sniper gameplay because a lot 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.520
 were waiting for sniper snaps my hand I 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.349
 give all I have to make one 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.590
 simple sniper and I tell you that at 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.590
 field 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.580
 elias
