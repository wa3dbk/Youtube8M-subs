00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
much as you can the wheels going to turn

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.789 
much as you can the wheels going to turn
a<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:51.619> there's<00:01:52.619> nothing

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
a bit just because there's nothing

a bit just because there's nothing
really<00:01:53.369> keeping<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.970> from<00:01:54.329> not<00:01:54.780> turning

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
really keeping it from not turning

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.649 
really keeping it from not turning
necessarily<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.299> want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.600> get

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
necessarily but you just want to get

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.959 
necessarily but you just want to get
them<00:01:57.810> snug<00:01:58.049> enough<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.530> they<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.969> support

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
them snug enough that they can support

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.310 
them snug enough that they can support
the<00:02:00.240> vehicle<00:02:00.570> when<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.750> lower<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> back<00:02:01.259> down

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the vehicle when you lower it back down

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.420 
the vehicle when you lower it back down
and<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:03.210> at<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.450> point<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:04.680> want<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.040> lower

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
and so at this point we want to lower

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.980 
and so at this point we want to lower
the<00:02:05.579> vehicle<00:02:05.729> back<00:02:06.030> down<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> tires

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the vehicle back down so that the tires

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.540 
the vehicle back down so that the tires
make<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> contact<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.220> ground<00:02:08.310> you

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
don't have to lower it all the way down

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.680

click from the torque wrench that means

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.910 
click from the torque wrench that means
we're<00:03:24.030> at<00:03:24.210> our<00:03:24.240> proper<00:03:24.900> tightening<00:03:25.320> torque<00:03:25.590> we

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
we're at our proper tightening torque we

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.710 
we're at our proper tightening torque we
go<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> other<00:03:26.370> lug<00:03:26.780> same<00:03:27.780> thing<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.380> then
