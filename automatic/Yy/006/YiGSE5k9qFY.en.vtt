00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 annoying I must say and above all 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.830
 when especially against enemies 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.830
 pretty or christ 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.580
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.090
 this new game I'm there if 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.119
 this blocks blog I blocked 3d 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.870
 who deposited me on some comment 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.530
 and it's a game like study minecraft 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.820
 just because we don't see so many 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.330
 lately that is view and it is a game 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.120
 off screen that resumes a bit the fate 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.360
 of shooting games a shootout 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.540
 so fps mein carte style and quite a lot 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.309
 of nice things I honestly saw that 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.780
 are quite a few in mode for some 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.530
 guard and techno part with i keep it for 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.479
 another outgoing battle has a lot of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.040
 serves his field and then people and al 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.650
 I play Russian so absolutely there is 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.570
 a lot of people who play and bob 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.710
 cone of beautiful things 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.619
 I can also choose the class e 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.930
 we have a lot of sports stuff 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.000
 also full loses that this does not 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:31.190
 is full there is the coin with nick ward 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:35.330
 ok good for these water waters 4 lo 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.710
 let's take we come then it seems to fall 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.180
 compared to the other fire games 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.520
 also because why you want to be there 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.080
 some pasta form caina for which 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.110
 also the one of the tanks I don't have 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.720
 seen in any game that resumes 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.690
 being a bit the style of minecraft is 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.040
 add the style of the things I do 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.230
 beautiful 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.120
 in the meantime apart from the fact that it does not 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.970
 known badly because why 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.790
 definitive only sniper recall in 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.480
 this way I can stay on this map 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.130
 it is high and free each is one almost one of the 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.229
 reasons why the one downloaded anyway 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.440
 and then really very little to say for that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.080
 what is currently also because in 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.820
 alpha again at stake in alpa e 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.080
 funny about that there are doubts is 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.210
 not even pretty enough so it is 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.209
 pretty nice i'd play it 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.640
 which more revolts have done that there 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.130
 so they are found against him 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.670
 one very much died for the rest us and that 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.010
 makes good is very much a game but them 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.440
 we really feel that I recommend it if 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.489
 you have some free time processed on 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.000
 steam as I said on account is 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.040
 free 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.890
 ultim now wants to make a TV with car 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.020
 twizy too much now needs with that tank 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.640
 eder and let us ask for peace but have it 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.200
 could fucker actually my friend 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.360
 opinions on this game I'm telling you 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.060
 now as demonstrated because I play 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.110
 and these are personal opinions 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.209
 ok today you can play with cute 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.860
 quietly live as it weighs 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.989
 very little should not perhaps too 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.790
 also because they serve Russians also though 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.459
 these Europeans are all about taste 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.220
 so ultimately yeah he lives russians you 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.850
 you say bad Russians do bad things 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.170
 people sniff lewis and jokes 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.930
 squalid and no, but you have a game nothing 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.760
 bad you can play with friends 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.030
 above all I think it's hilarious 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.030
 with friends 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.900
 and someone just destroyed me 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.670
 something to wear we buy this 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.099
 game that is one of the problems of the games 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.079
 This boxing's free to play is the 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.500
 fact that there are pid win 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:52.230
 in the sense that there are people who pay for 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.190
 have nice things like shotgun eyes 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.560
 new 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.790
 what it does not indeed have when if a 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.549
 hormone player who penalized 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.110
 play does not want to spend money not 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.239
 know if you like to see the 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.849
 negative values ​​perhaps to have something 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:10.109
 nice to show you if they can do it for 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:12.450
 example on the coffee robot could be 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.030
 cute we canosa problematic of this 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.570
 game is the fact that the aim is not me 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.800
 it seems 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.910
 let's say you have problems with trajectories 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.870
 in the sense that like these works done 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.710
 games 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.300
 if you shoot the right you catch this 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.470
 it is one of the biggest problems of these 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.210
 game tools because they are well not 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.860
 very realistic 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.990
 the engine is quite large 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.760
 basic takes up a lot if of minecraft 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:47.660
 never even worse fate than minecraft 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:52.940
 so why not more enriching then 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:55.190
 shit assholes why not come 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.560
 destroyed a tree yeah i like it because 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.660
 no, there may also be this made of 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.850
 spain this way i want to soon for 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.320
 institution or card even if I can do one 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.760
 massacre 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.590
 now like you snipers on something one 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.730
 fantastic that I don't know how they do 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.990
 weapons so it is a bit m or a hyper pose 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.990
 put the perfect sniper 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.580
 beautiful I am absurd in fact we lower 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.580
 a little bit 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.059
 they go to the people who die 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:41.710
 home someone guys above that such 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.710
 we peck at the minino and the ok one 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.320

 what regardless what that can you 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.550
 make noise absurdly less enough 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.520
 ugly 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.550

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:02.470

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:36.100
 closed monstrous and quite annoying 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.960
 I have to say and especially when 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.320
 especially against enough enemies or 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:49.720
 christ is never misaki and they exploded 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:56.650
 in fact they don't market their peckers 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:59.200
 something is known to those who love that time 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.360
 it will be a big problem watching them 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.210
 early pole and some camper things went 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.910

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:26.860
