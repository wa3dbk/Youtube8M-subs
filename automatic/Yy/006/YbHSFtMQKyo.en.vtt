hello<00:00:01.050> youtube<00:00:01.439> today<00:00:01.469> I'm<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.370> show

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hello youtube today I'm going to show

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.460 
hello youtube today I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.639> how<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.820> return<00:00:03.210> from<00:00:03.419> moons<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:04.080> Kerbal

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
you how to return from moons in Kerbal

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.829 
you how to return from moons in Kerbal
space<00:00:04.500> program<00:00:05.480> basically<00:00:06.480> we're<00:00:06.660> going<00:00:06.779> to

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
space program basically we're going to

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.560 
space program basically we're going to
return<00:00:07.080> from<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.710> moon<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.220> carbon<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.480> I'm

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
return from the moon to carbon and I'm

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.669 
return from the moon to carbon and I'm
going<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.719> show<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.050> most<00:00:10.200> efficient<00:00:10.620> way

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
going to show you the most efficient way

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.440 
going to show you the most efficient way
of<00:00:10.710> doing<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.160> because<00:00:11.400> there<00:00:12.179> are<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> couple

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
of doing this because there are a couple

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.730 
of doing this because there are a couple
of<00:00:12.570> ways<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.840> could<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.320> could<00:00:13.349> get

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
of ways you could do it you could get

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.320 
of ways you could do it you could get
out<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> moon<00:00:14.340> sphere<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.730> influence<00:00:15.000> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
out of the moon sphere of influence and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.060 
out of the moon sphere of influence and
then<00:00:15.450> burn<00:00:15.690> retrograde<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.619> bring<00:00:16.949> your

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
then burn retrograde to bring your

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.820 
then burn retrograde to bring your
periapsis<00:00:17.430> down<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.210> within<00:00:18.830> carbons

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
periapsis down to within carbons

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.070 
periapsis down to within carbons
atmosphere<00:00:20.490> all<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.390> could<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.630> I'm<00:00:21.840> going<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
atmosphere all you could do I'm going to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.330 
atmosphere all you could do I'm going to
show<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.289> which<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> lot<00:00:22.859> more<00:00:23.010> efficient

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
show you which is a lot more efficient

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.769 
show you which is a lot more efficient
and<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.550> basically<00:00:23.880> involves<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.480> doing<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and it basically involves you doing the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.269 
and it basically involves you doing the
whole<00:00:24.960> thing<00:00:25.199> from<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> moon<00:00:25.830> sphere<00:00:26.189> of

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
whole thing from the moon sphere of

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.939 
whole thing from the moon sphere of
influence<00:00:27.019> anyway<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.439> first<00:00:28.560> thing<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.830> need

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
influence anyway the first thing we need

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.339 
influence anyway the first thing we need
to<00:00:28.980> look<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.609> where<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.359> moon<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:31.109> so

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
to look at is where the moon is going so

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.200 
to look at is where the moon is going so
the<00:00:31.439> moon's<00:00:31.619> pro-grade<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.550> pro-grade<00:00:32.969> for

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the moon's pro-grade the pro-grade for

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.970 
the moon's pro-grade the pro-grade for
the<00:00:33.270> moon<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.260> direction<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.860> going

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the moon is in this direction it's going

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.310 
the moon is in this direction it's going
over<00:00:35.160> towards<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.700> side<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.110> want<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
over towards this side so if we want to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.290 
over towards this side so if we want to
go<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.829> throw<00:00:38.070> ourselves<00:00:38.219> down<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.700> relative

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
go and throw ourselves down and relative

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.069 
go and throw ourselves down and relative
to<00:00:39.660> urban<00:00:40.460> urban<00:00:41.460> surface<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.090> whatever<00:00:42.300> we

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
to urban urban surface or whatever we

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.630 
to urban urban surface or whatever we
need<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.379> actually<00:00:43.530> burn<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> moon's

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
need to actually burn into the moon's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.389 
need to actually burn into the moon's
retrograde<00:00:45.329> now<00:00:46.050> depending<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.649> where<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
retrograde now depending on where on the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.319 
retrograde now depending on where on the
moon<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.000> will<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.239> slightly

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
moon you are this will be slightly

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
moon you are this will be slightly
different<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.989> I'm<00:00:49.170> gonna<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.800> burn

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
different but I'm gonna have to burn

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.619 
different but I'm gonna have to burn
eastward<00:00:50.670> see<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:50.940> you're<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.270> side<00:00:51.329> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
eastward see if you're on this side you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.869 
eastward see if you're on this side you
have<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.870> burn<00:00:51.989> west<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:53.280> I'm<00:00:53.550> gonna<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
have to burn west but I'm gonna have to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.279 
have to burn west but I'm gonna have to
burn<00:00:54.000> eastwards<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.809> example<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.170> you're

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
burn eastwards for example if you're

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.139 
burn eastwards for example if you're
here<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.860> burn<00:00:56.010> straight<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.030> if

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
here you just burn straight up and if

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.700 
here you just burn straight up and if
you're<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.570> you'd<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.050> burn<00:00:58.199> probably

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you're here you'd have to burn probably

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.680 
you're here you'd have to burn probably
east<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.399> it'd<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.570> more

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
east and then it'd be a bit more

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.090 
east and then it'd be a bit more
difficult<00:01:00.899> because<00:01:01.320> you've<00:01:01.590> got<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> almost

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
difficult because you've got to almost

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100 
difficult because you've got to almost
get<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.699> way<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.899> when<00:01:04.019> you're

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
get out this way so actually when you're

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.539 
get out this way so actually when you're
looking<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> landing<00:01:04.890> location<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
looking for a landing location on the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.039 
looking for a landing location on the
moon<00:01:05.670> try<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.150> bring<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> somewhere<00:01:06.780> closer

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
moon try and bring it somewhere closer

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.520 
moon try and bring it somewhere closer
to<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:08.220> line<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.570> essentially<00:01:09.960> it's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
to this this line here essentially it's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500 
to this this line here essentially it's
think<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.860> burn<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.250> straight<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.790> but

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
think you can burn just straight up but

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
think you can burn just straight up but
anyway<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.680> where<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.830> am<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.159> need

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
anyway so you can see where I am I need

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.789 
anyway so you can see where I am I need
to<00:01:14.430> burn<00:01:14.580> east<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:15.990> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.170> start<00:01:16.439> by

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
to burn east so I'm going to start by

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.830 
to burn east so I'm going to start by
just<00:01:17.009> throttling<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.700> pitching<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
just throttling up and pitching over to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.920 
just throttling up and pitching over to
45<00:01:19.439> degrees<00:01:19.799> east<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.060> myself<00:01:21.240> clear<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
45 degrees east to get myself clear of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.899 
45 degrees east to get myself clear of
any<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> ground<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.979> you'll<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.520> my

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
any of the ground and you'll see my

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.179 
any of the ground and you'll see my
orbit<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:24.780> being<00:01:25.200> raised<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.979> I'm<00:01:26.070> going

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
orbit is now being raised and I'm going

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.880 
orbit is now being raised and I'm going
to<00:01:26.250> start<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> pitch<00:01:26.729> down<00:01:26.970> even<00:01:27.360> more

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
to start to pitch down even more

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.080 
to start to pitch down even more
basically<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> need<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.220> point<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
basically I need to point in the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.330 
basically I need to point in the
direction<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.840> my<00:01:31.079> escape<00:01:31.740> trajectory

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
direction and get my escape trajectory

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.859 
direction and get my escape trajectory
pointing<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> same<00:01:32.939> direction<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.720> this

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
pointing in the same direction as this

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.800 
pointing in the same direction as this
line<00:01:34.220> going<00:01:35.220> away<00:01:35.520> into<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> distance<00:01:36.390> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
line going away into the distance that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.289 
line going away into the distance that
way<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> should<00:01:39.119> get

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
way if I can do that then I should get

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.230 
way if I can do that then I should get
back<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.930> kerbin<00:01:40.560> reasonably<00:01:41.460> safely<00:01:41.850> I'll

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
back to kerbin reasonably safely I'll

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.550 
back to kerbin reasonably safely I'll
just<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> keep<00:01:42.869> burning<00:01:43.110> until<00:01:43.439> my

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
just have to keep burning until my

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.620 
just have to keep burning until my
predicted<00:01:44.009> periapsis<00:01:44.460> around<00:01:45.000> kerbin<00:01:45.390> gets

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
predicted periapsis around kerbin gets

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
predicted periapsis around kerbin gets
low<00:01:45.780> enough<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.320> I'll<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.710> pulled<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.430> by<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
low enough that I'll be pulled in by the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.510 
low enough that I'll be pulled in by the
atmosphere<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.950> here<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.220> are<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.399> gonna

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
atmosphere so here we are I'm gonna

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.399 
atmosphere so here we are I'm gonna
bring<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:50.970> landing<00:01:51.270> legs<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:52.079> neat

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
bring in my landing legs just to be neat

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.520 
bring in my landing legs just to be neat
and<00:01:52.439> tidy<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.810> yeah<00:01:54.810> everything's<00:01:55.380> looking

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
and tidy and yeah everything's looking

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.280 
and tidy and yeah everything's looking
reasonably<00:01:56.100> good<00:01:56.659> there<00:01:57.659> where<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.110> see

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
reasonably good there where you can see

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.630 
reasonably good there where you can see
my<00:01:58.439> Apple<00:01:58.740> apps<00:01:58.890> let's<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.369> way<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
my Apple apps let's go in that way a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.010 
my Apple apps let's go in that way a
little<00:01:59.880> bit<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.360> I'm<00:02:00.420> gonna<00:02:00.540> actually<00:02:00.689> pitch

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
little bit so I'm gonna actually pitch

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.469 
little bit so I'm gonna actually pitch
up<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.439> little<00:02:01.649> bit<00:02:01.770> because<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.759> should<00:02:03.180> make

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
up a little bit because that should make

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.319 
up a little bit because that should make
my<00:02:03.750> escape<00:02:03.990> trajectory<00:02:04.710> come<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.850> bit<00:02:06.299> more

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
my escape trajectory come a bit more

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
my escape trajectory come a bit more
sort<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.780> towards<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.229> line<00:02:07.439> because<00:02:07.649> at<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
sort of towards this line because at the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.869 
sort of towards this line because at the
moment<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> go<00:02:08.520> over<00:02:08.700> here

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
moment it's going to go over here

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.940 
moment it's going to go over here
somewhere

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
somewhere

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.410 
somewhere
laughter<00:02:10.399> burn<00:02:10.550> upwards<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.060> little<00:02:11.270> bit

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
laughter burn upwards a little bit

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.259 
laughter burn upwards a little bit
really<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:13.250> basically<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.730> need<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:13.910> do<00:02:14.090> this

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
really and basically you need to do this

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.930 
really and basically you need to do this
until<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.170> can<00:02:15.530> actually<00:02:16.430> get<00:02:16.730> your<00:02:16.849> escape

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
until you can actually get your escape

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.330 
until you can actually get your escape
trajectory<00:02:17.780> something<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.950> there

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
trajectory something like that and there

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.369 
trajectory something like that and there
we<00:02:19.430> are<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:20.120> now<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.360> need<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.930> keep<00:02:21.140> burning

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
we are and now I need to keep burning

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.589 
we are and now I need to keep burning
and<00:02:22.280> actually<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.209> want<00:02:23.300> your<00:02:23.450> escape

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
and actually you want your escape

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.660 
and actually you want your escape
trajectory<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.470> be<00:02:24.560> sort<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.950> parallel<00:02:25.489> with

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
trajectory to be sort of parallel with

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.300 
trajectory to be sort of parallel with
this<00:02:25.790> line<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.410> I'm<00:02:27.860> just<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.190> keep

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
this line so I'm just going to keep

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.309 
this line so I'm just going to keep
burning<00:02:28.670> up<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:28.940> way<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.750> you'll<00:02:29.989> see<00:02:30.140> my

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
burning up this way and you'll see my

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.350 
burning up this way and you'll see my
periapsis<00:02:30.769> around<00:02:31.310> kerbin<00:02:31.730> that's<00:02:31.910> predicted

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
periapsis around kerbin that's predicted

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.199 
periapsis around kerbin that's predicted
keeps<00:02:32.810> going<00:02:33.080> down<00:02:33.319> if<00:02:34.280> it's<00:02:34.519> going<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.880> then

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
keeps going down if it's going up then

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.539 
keeps going down if it's going up then
this<00:02:35.540> isn't<00:02:35.840> parallel<00:02:36.470> properly<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.190> you'll

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
this isn't parallel properly and you'll

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.000 
this isn't parallel properly and you'll
need<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.730> adjust<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.590> there<00:02:39.590> we<00:02:39.650> go<00:02:39.799> it's

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
need to adjust it and there we go it's

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.620 
need to adjust it and there we go it's
still<00:02:40.310> going<00:02:40.640> down<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:42.940> there<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.090> are<00:02:44.120> it's

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
still going down and there we are it's

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.690 
still going down and there we are it's
within<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.019> atmosphere<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.580> looks

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
within the atmosphere and that looks

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.050 
within the atmosphere and that looks
pretty<00:02:46.880> good<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:48.769> can<00:02:48.799> do<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.220> from<00:02:49.519> minimus

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
pretty good you can do this from minimus

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.729 
pretty good you can do this from minimus
as<00:02:50.239> well<00:02:50.420> it's<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.780> same<00:02:50.989> principle<00:02:51.590> on

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
as well it's the same principle on

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.800 
as well it's the same principle on
actually<00:02:52.160> because<00:02:52.760> men<00:02:52.970> must<00:02:53.239> spins<00:02:53.569> round

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
actually because men must spins round

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.809 
actually because men must spins round
you<00:02:54.110> should<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:54.530> able<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:55.040> wait<00:02:55.280> until

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
you should be able to just wait until

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.309 
you should be able to just wait until
you're<00:02:56.090> on<00:02:56.180> minimus<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.690> retrograde<00:02:57.019> because

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
you're on minimus is retrograde because

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.530 
you're on minimus is retrograde because
I<00:02:57.380> think<00:02:57.440> minimus<00:02:57.890> spins<00:02:58.160> around<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.549> for

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
I think minimus spins around and for

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.690 
I think minimus spins around and for
example<00:02:59.750> if<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.079> want<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.380> go<00:03:00.530> from<00:03:00.950> leave<00:03:01.310> all

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
example if you want to go from leave all

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.420 
example if you want to go from leave all
the<00:03:01.819> way<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:01.970> jewel<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:03.680> same<00:03:03.860> principle

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
the way to jewel the same principle

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.400 
the way to jewel the same principle
would<00:03:04.579> apply<00:03:04.640> although<00:03:05.540> we're<00:03:05.989> actually<00:03:06.110> late

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
would apply although we're actually late

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.600 
would apply although we're actually late
has<00:03:06.620> an<00:03:06.709> atmosphere<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:07.310> it'd<00:03:07.370> be<00:03:07.400> so

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
has an atmosphere so it'd be so

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.280 
has an atmosphere so it'd be so
different<00:03:07.819> but<00:03:08.209> if<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.780> want<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:08.989> go<00:03:09.079> from

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
different but if you want to go from

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.839 
different but if you want to go from
somewhere<00:03:09.680> with<00:03:10.280> an<00:03:10.400> atmosphere<00:03:10.819> to

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
somewhere with an atmosphere to

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.600 
somewhere with an atmosphere to
somewhere<00:03:11.269> without<00:03:11.510> an<00:03:11.660> atmosphere<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.519> if

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
somewhere without an atmosphere so if

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.349 
somewhere without an atmosphere so if
somewhere<00:03:13.910> without<00:03:14.150> an<00:03:14.239> atmosphere

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
somewhere without an atmosphere

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.150 
somewhere without an atmosphere
somewhere<00:03:14.959> with<00:03:15.230> an<00:03:15.319> atmosphere<00:03:15.470> like<00:03:15.950> that

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
somewhere with an atmosphere like that

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.150 
somewhere with an atmosphere like that
then<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.519> would<00:03:16.579> work<00:03:16.819> and<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:18.709> guess<00:03:18.889> you<00:03:19.040> could

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
then it would work and I guess you could

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.309 
then it would work and I guess you could
you<00:03:19.459> know<00:03:19.579> if<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.970> place<00:03:20.480> you're<00:03:20.989> orbiting

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
you know if the place you're orbiting

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.780 
you know if the place you're orbiting
around<00:03:21.440> if<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:21.920> know<00:03:21.980> if<00:03:22.069> kerbin<00:03:22.430> didn't<00:03:22.700> have

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
around if you know if kerbin didn't have

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.190 
around if you know if kerbin didn't have
an<00:03:22.880> atmosphere<00:03:23.299> for<00:03:23.329> example<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.900> would<00:03:23.959> still

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
an atmosphere for example it would still

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.520 
an atmosphere for example it would still
work<00:03:24.519> but<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:25.609> just<00:03:25.760> have<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.209> burn<00:03:26.630> when<00:03:27.470> you

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
work but you just have to burn when you

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.140 
work but you just have to burn when you
get<00:03:27.680> there<00:03:27.829> anyway<00:03:28.130> I'll<00:03:28.280> bring<00:03:28.609> my<00:03:28.790> periapsis

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
get there anyway I'll bring my periapsis

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.199 
get there anyway I'll bring my periapsis
down<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:29.930> actually<00:03:30.350> gonna<00:03:31.130> hit<00:03:31.400> kerbin<00:03:31.819> and

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.690 

then<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.510> can<00:03:35.660> just<00:03:35.840> split<00:03:36.109> off<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.680> deploy<00:03:37.579> the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
then I can just split off and deploy the

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.690 
then I can just split off and deploy the
parachutes<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.510> turn<00:03:39.350> off<00:03:39.500> SAS<00:03:39.980> as<00:03:40.190> well<00:03:40.370> and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
parachutes and turn off SAS as well and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.069 
parachutes and turn off SAS as well and
then<00:03:40.850> we<00:03:40.970> can<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:41.209> tie<00:03:41.389> them<00:03:41.569> up<00:03:41.630> until<00:03:41.989> we

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
then we can just tie them up until we

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.550 
then we can just tie them up until we
get<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.380> kerbin<00:03:44.079> make<00:03:45.079> sure<00:03:45.290> if<00:03:45.440> you're

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
get to kerbin make sure if you're

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.740 
get to kerbin make sure if you're
splitting<00:03:45.950> off<00:03:46.100> any<00:03:46.519> you<00:03:47.389> know<00:03:47.510> if<00:03:47.630> you're

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
splitting off any you know if you're

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.629 
splitting off any you know if you're
splitting<00:03:47.900> off<00:03:48.170> your<00:03:48.319> command<00:03:48.590> pod<00:03:48.799> then<00:03:49.459> make

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
splitting off your command pod then make

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:50.650 
splitting off your command pod then make
sure<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:49.880> split<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.209> off<00:03:50.299> while<00:03:50.540> you're

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
sure you split it off while you're

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.059 
sure you split it off while you're
pointing<00:03:50.989> retrograde<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.680> make<00:03:51.829> sure<00:03:51.950> you

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
pointing retrograde to make sure you

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.470 
pointing retrograde to make sure you
don't<00:03:52.160> speed<00:03:52.489> yourself<00:03:52.819> up<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.180> actually

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
don't speed yourself up and actually

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.550 
don't speed yourself up and actually
push<00:03:53.660> yourself<00:03:54.019> out<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.440> atmosphere

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
push yourself out of the atmosphere

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.080 
push yourself out of the atmosphere
because<00:03:55.099> that<00:03:55.220> has<00:03:55.400> happened<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.849> me<00:03:55.940> before

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
because that has happened to me before

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.319 
because that has happened to me before
and<00:03:56.569> it's<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.109> bit<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.349> pain<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.180> know

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
and it's a bit of a pain and so you know

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.550 
and it's a bit of a pain and so you know
make<00:03:59.660> sure<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.870> do<00:03:59.989> that<00:04:00.109> and<00:04:00.260> if<00:04:00.349> you're<00:04:00.470> not

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
make sure you do that and if you're not

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.720 
make sure you do that and if you're not
quite<00:04:00.709> in<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.980> atmosphere<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:01.519> might

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
quite in the atmosphere you might

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.890 
quite in the atmosphere you might
actually<00:04:01.849> be<00:04:02.030> able<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.209> get<00:04:02.420> if<00:04:02.569> you<00:04:02.720> are<00:04:02.750> a

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
actually be able to get if you are a

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.509 
actually be able to get if you are a
trajectory<00:04:03.170> inside<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:03.950> atmosphere<00:04:04.069> by

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
trajectory inside the atmosphere by

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.550 
trajectory inside the atmosphere by
doing<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.930> worth<00:04:06.049> the<00:04:06.169> try<00:04:06.349> and

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
doing that so it's worth the try and

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.559 
doing that so it's worth the try and
I've<00:04:07.519> done<00:04:07.700> that<00:04:07.849> before<00:04:08.000> I'm<00:04:08.299> one<00:04:08.419> of<00:04:08.480> my

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
I've done that before I'm one of my

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.080 
I've done that before I'm one of my
playthroughs<00:04:09.130> anyway<00:04:10.130> yeah<00:04:10.760> we're<00:04:10.970> coming

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
playthroughs anyway yeah we're coming

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.309 
playthroughs anyway yeah we're coming
into<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.359> atmosphere<00:04:11.510> now<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.200> that's

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
into the atmosphere now and that's

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.809 
into the atmosphere now and that's
pretty<00:04:12.560> much<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.829> for<00:04:12.859> this<00:04:13.069> tutorial<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.669> mean

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
pretty much it for this tutorial I mean

pretty much it for this tutorial I mean
you<00:04:14.030> know<00:04:14.120> we<00:04:14.389> have<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.630> do<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:15.139> wait<00:04:15.410> for

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
you know we have to do is wait for

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.310 
you know we have to do is wait for
parachutes<00:04:15.919> to<00:04:16.039> deploy<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.700> land<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.690> thanks

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
parachutes to deploy and land so thanks

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.050 
parachutes to deploy and land so thanks
