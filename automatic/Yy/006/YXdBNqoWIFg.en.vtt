00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
love to do that i just i wish i had the

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.200 
love to do that i just i wish i had the
time<00:06:13.029> to<00:06:14.069> to<00:06:15.069> you<00:06:15.520> know<00:06:15.639> put<00:06:15.879> something

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
time to to you know put something

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.480 
time to to you know put something
together<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:17.169> i'm<00:06:17.379> not<00:06:17.560> one<00:06:17.800> to<00:06:17.830> like

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
together and i'm not one to like

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.119 
together and i'm not one to like
half-ass<00:06:18.940> things<00:06:18.969> so<00:06:19.569> if<00:06:20.259> i<00:06:20.409> were<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.620> do<00:06:20.830> it<00:06:20.860> i

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:21.129 
half-ass things so if i were to do it i

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.519 
half-ass things so if i were to do it i
would<00:06:21.250> go<00:06:21.400> all<00:06:21.639> out<00:06:21.669> and<00:06:22.240> it<00:06:22.960> would<00:06:23.110> be<00:06:23.139> the

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
would go all out and it would be the

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.730 
would go all out and it would be the
most<00:06:24.009> badass<00:06:24.940> probably<00:06:25.750> expensive<00:06:25.960> cosplay

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
most badass probably expensive cosplay

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.640 
most badass probably expensive cosplay
ever<00:06:26.949> done<00:06:27.599> just<00:06:28.599> because<00:06:28.900> that's<00:06:29.050> the<00:06:29.319> way<00:06:29.349> my

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
ever done just because that's the way my

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.040 
ever done just because that's the way my
brain<00:06:29.919> operates<00:06:30.460> like<00:06:31.360> if<00:06:31.509> i<00:06:31.599> wanted<00:06:31.810> to<00:06:31.930> make

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
brain operates like if i wanted to make

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.519 
brain operates like if i wanted to make
a<00:06:32.080> sword<00:06:32.639> I'm<00:06:33.639> not<00:06:34.629> making<00:06:34.990> that<00:06:35.020> thing<00:06:35.349> out<00:06:35.500> of

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:35.529 
a sword I'm not making that thing out of

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.860 
a sword I'm not making that thing out of
foam<00:06:35.860> and<00:06:37.139> like<00:06:38.139> paper<00:06:38.770> mache<00:06:39.659> no<00:06:40.659> I'm

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
foam and like paper mache no I'm

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.300 
foam and like paper mache no I'm
probably<00:06:41.139> going<00:06:41.349> to<00:06:41.440> go<00:06:41.560> to<00:06:41.620> like<00:06:41.949> a

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
probably going to go to like a

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.300 
probably going to go to like a
blacksmith<00:06:43.300> and<00:06:43.690> have<00:06:44.110> him<00:06:44.349> floor<00:06:44.710> to<00:06:44.889> be<00:06:45.039> a

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
blacksmith and have him floor to be a

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.040 
blacksmith and have him floor to be a
sword<00:06:45.909> out<00:06:46.120> of<00:06:46.180> steel

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
sword out of steel

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.680 
sword out of steel
I<00:06:47.430> don't<00:06:48.430> care<00:06:48.520> how<00:06:48.639> much<00:06:48.759> it<00:06:48.819> costs<00:06:49.120> I<00:06:49.449> just

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
I don't care how much it costs I just

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.540 
I don't care how much it costs I just
want<00:06:49.870> to<00:06:49.930> have<00:06:50.080> them<00:06:50.229> you<00:06:50.500> know<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:51.340> most

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
want to have them you know the most

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.300 
want to have them you know the most
badass<00:06:51.789> authentic-looking<00:06:52.569> costume<00:06:53.310> that

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
badass authentic-looking costume that

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.339 
badass authentic-looking costume that
that's<00:06:54.699> how<00:06:54.819> my<00:06:54.970> brain<00:06:55.180> works<00:06:55.210> which<00:06:56.139> is

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:56.349 
that's how my brain works which is

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:57.899 
that's how my brain works which is
probably<00:06:56.650> why<00:06:56.919> I'm<00:06:57.069> not<00:06:57.370> going<00:06:57.580> to<00:06:57.639> do<00:06:57.729> it

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
probably why I'm not going to do it

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.510 
probably why I'm not going to do it
because<00:06:58.870> it's<00:06:59.199> going<00:06:59.409> to<00:06:59.470> cost<00:06:59.680> me<00:06:59.830> an<00:07:00.069> arm<00:07:00.340> and

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
because it's going to cost me an arm and

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.510 
because it's going to cost me an arm and
a<00:07:00.610> leg<00:07:00.639> to<00:07:00.849> do<00:07:01.090> something<00:07:01.479> like<00:07:01.599> that<00:07:02.099> so<00:07:03.099> it's

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
a leg to do something like that so it's

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.629 
a leg to do something like that so it's
better<00:07:04.030> than<00:07:04.240> I<00:07:04.360> don't
