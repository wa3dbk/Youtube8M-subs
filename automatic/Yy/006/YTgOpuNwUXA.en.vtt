00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
seems to work for him so we're gonna

seems to work for him so we're gonna
give<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.530> shot<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.860> believe<00:01:20.340> he<00:01:21.119> had<00:01:21.360> talked

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
give that a shot I believe he had talked

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.230

to<00:01:21.810> mr.<00:01:22.110> hurricane<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> too<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.850> think

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to mr. hurricane about it too so I think

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
to mr. hurricane about it too so I think
it's<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.930> sliders<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.380> both<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> them<00:01:26.010> are

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it's the sliders that both of them are

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.969 
it's the sliders that both of them are
using<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:26.970> least<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.479> very<00:01:27.810> similar<00:01:28.409> version

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
using or at least a very similar version

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.880

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
catching now this one is all the way to

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.240 
catching now this one is all the way to
85<00:02:04.020> um<00:02:06.409> seems<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.590> weird<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.039> me<00:02:08.129> you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
85 um seems a little weird to me you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.800 
85 um seems a little weird to me you
know<00:02:08.399> obviously<00:02:08.789> we're<00:02:09.360> trying<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.659> make<00:02:09.750> this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
know obviously we're trying to make this

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.660 
know obviously we're trying to make this
series<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.289> little<00:02:10.619> bit<00:02:10.739> more<00:02:10.890> challenging<00:02:11.159> but

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
series a little bit more challenging but

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.160 
series a little bit more challenging but
maybe<00:02:11.939> that's<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.569> come<00:02:12.689> off<00:02:12.840> somewhere

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
maybe that's going to come off somewhere

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.539 
maybe that's going to come off somewhere
else<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.470> know<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:13.709> have<00:02:13.950> been<00:02:14.189> dealing<00:02:14.519> with

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
else you know we have been dealing with

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.690 
else you know we have been dealing with
a<00:02:14.670> whole<00:02:14.909> lot<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.150> drops<00:02:15.569> lately<00:02:16.249> 85<00:02:17.249> seems

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
a whole lot of drops lately 85 seems

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.540 
a whole lot of drops lately 85 seems
really<00:02:18.329> excessive<00:02:19.079> though

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
really excessive though

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.820 
really excessive though
that's<00:02:20.030> very<00:02:20.240> high<00:02:20.840> up<00:02:21.080> there<00:02:21.290> I'm<00:02:21.440> kind<00:02:21.740> of

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
that's very high up there I'm kind of

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.260 
that's very high up there I'm kind of
wondering<00:02:22.040> what<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.460> reason<00:02:22.790> behind<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.120> is

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
wondering what the reason behind that is

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.910 
wondering what the reason behind that is
that<00:02:23.420> being<00:02:23.870> said<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.290> shouldn't<00:02:24.620> be<00:02:24.770> dealing

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
that being said I shouldn't be dealing

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.680 
that being said I shouldn't be dealing
with<00:02:25.130> six<00:02:25.520> drop<00:02:25.850> games<00:02:26.210> like<00:02:26.480> we've<00:02:26.660> seen

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
with six drop games like we've seen

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.350 
with six drop games like we've seen
every<00:02:27.230> once<00:02:27.410> in<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> while<00:02:27.710> in<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.860> past<00:02:28.360> run

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
every once in a while in the past run

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.390 
every once in a while in the past run
blocking<00:02:29.540> now<00:02:29.960> see<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.440> one<00:02:30.710> is<00:02:30.980> all<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.310> way

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
blocking now see this one is all the way

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.950 
blocking now see this one is all the way
up<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.550> 40<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.770> don't<00:02:33.770> think<00:02:34.100> we<00:02:34.280> can<00:02:34.460> do<00:02:34.670> that

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
up to 40 I don't think we can do that

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.720 
up to 40 I don't think we can do that
we've<00:02:35.960> had<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> whole<00:02:36.530> lot<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.920> success<00:02:37.310> running

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
we've had a whole lot of success running

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.600 
we've had a whole lot of success running
the<00:02:37.880> ball<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.510> I've<00:02:39.200> lowly<00:02:39.650> are<00:02:40.040> slowly<00:02:40.310> been

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
the ball and I've lowly are slowly been

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.610 
the ball and I've lowly are slowly been
trying<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.970> bring<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.600> back<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.080> little<00:02:42.440> bit

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
trying to bring that back a little bit

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.410 
trying to bring that back a little bit
because<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:43.040> got<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.250> little<00:02:43.520> too<00:02:43.790> easy<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.240> run

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
because it got a little too easy to run

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.870 
because it got a little too easy to run
the<00:02:44.540> ball<00:02:44.750> I'm<00:02:45.350> gonna<00:02:45.560> keep<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.040> at<00:02:46.250> 15<00:02:46.700> I'm

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.720 
gonna keep it there fumbles down to two
down<00:02:50.660> two<00:02:50.960> we<00:02:51.590> might<00:02:51.860> need<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.100> drop<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.520> down

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
down two we might need to drop that down

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.980 
down two we might need to drop that down
more<00:02:53.000> because<00:02:53.150> that's<00:02:53.300> been<00:02:53.480> an<00:02:53.570> issue<00:02:53.720> with

all the way up to 100 I'm cool with that
I've<00:03:22.700> tried<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.180> before<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.720> didn't<00:03:23.959> work

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
I've tried that before it didn't work

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.440 
I've tried that before it didn't work
we'll<00:03:25.220> give<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.489> shot<00:03:25.700> again<00:03:25.760> though<00:03:26.239> this

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
is also on 85 so hopefully this works

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.690 
is also on 85 so hopefully this works

at<00:03:34.850> 65<00:03:35.690> that's<00:03:36.140> pretty<00:03:36.620> cool<00:03:36.860> of<00:03:36.920> me<00:03:37.959> fumbles

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
at 65 that's pretty cool of me fumbles

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.070 
at 65 that's pretty cool of me fumbles
at<00:03:39.470> 48<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.730> again<00:03:41.209> i<00:03:41.239> think<00:03:41.390> i'm<00:03:41.600> in<00:03:41.630> mind<00:03:41.930> to

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
at 48 and again i think i'm in mind to

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.290 
at 48 and again i think i'm in mind to
45<00:03:42.470> will<00:03:42.650> do<00:03:42.739> that<00:03:42.920> for<00:03:43.100> them<00:03:43.190> as<00:03:43.370> well<00:03:43.400> pass

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
45 will do that for them as well pass

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.060 
45 will do that for them as well pass
defense<00:03:44.720> reaction<00:03:45.380> time<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:45.739> is<00:03:45.830> going<00:03:46.010> to

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
defense reaction time this is going to

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.030 
defense reaction time this is going to
be<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.190> 40<00:03:47.320> interceptions<00:03:48.320> again<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.739> little

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
be a 40 interceptions again a little

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.640 
be a 40 interceptions again a little
weird<00:03:49.580> this<00:03:50.330> is<00:03:50.450> all<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.690> way<00:03:50.780> down<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:50.959> 35

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
weird this is all the way down to 35

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.140 
weird this is all the way down to 35
we'll<00:03:51.950> give<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.100> a<00:03:52.220> shot<00:03:52.250> if<00:03:52.610> i<00:03:52.700> need<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.030> adjust

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
we'll give it a shot if i need to adjust

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.440 
we'll give it a shot if i need to adjust
it<00:03:53.570> i<00:03:53.660> will<00:03:54.070> pass<00:03:55.070> coverage<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.820> at<00:03:55.970> 45

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
it i will pass coverage this is at 45

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.860 
it i will pass coverage this is at 45
and<00:03:56.750> tackling<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.410> also<00:03:57.890> at<00:03:58.010> 34<00:03:58.640> them<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.720> the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
and tackling is also at 34 them so the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.310 
and tackling is also at 34 them so the
only<00:04:00.140> really<00:04:00.800> significant<00:04:01.550> change<00:04:02.110> that<00:04:03.110> I'm

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
only really significant change that I'm

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.780 
only really significant change that I'm
not<00:04:03.650> gonna<00:04:03.950> do<00:04:04.280> is<00:04:04.580> our<00:04:05.540> run<00:04:06.290> blocking<00:04:06.760> so<00:04:07.760> I

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
not gonna do is our run blocking so I

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.640 
not gonna do is our run blocking so I
don't<00:04:08.150> know<00:04:08.270> if<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.540> rest<00:04:09.140> of<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.410> sliders

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
don't know if the rest of the sliders

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.010 
don't know if the rest of the sliders
changing<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.459> going<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.730> affect<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.450> much<00:04:11.780> I

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
changing is going to affect that much I

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.949 
changing is going to affect that much I
don't<00:04:12.320> see<00:04:12.500> why<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.739> would<00:04:13.100> i<00:04:13.540> feel<00:04:14.540> like<00:04:14.720> if<00:04:14.840> i

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
don't see why it would i feel like if i

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.449 
don't see why it would i feel like if i
were<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.110> put<00:04:15.170> that<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.470> 40<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:15.980> would<00:04:16.070> be<00:04:16.190> way

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
were to put that a 40 it would be way

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.780 
were to put that a 40 it would be way
too<00:04:16.519> easy<00:04:16.760> though<00:04:17.739> so<00:04:18.739> we'll<00:04:18.830> try<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:19.160> with<00:04:19.340> 15

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
too easy though so we'll try it with 15

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.580 
too easy though so we'll try it with 15
if<00:04:20.120> everything<00:04:20.570> else<00:04:20.660> is<00:04:20.840> kind<00:04:21.049> of<00:04:21.169> changed

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
if everything else is kind of changed

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.530 
if everything else is kind of changed
that<00:04:21.799> around<00:04:21.830> a<00:04:22.310> little<00:04:22.340> bit<00:04:22.640> we<00:04:23.000> will<00:04:23.240> change

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
that around a little bit we will change

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.770 
that around a little bit we will change
it<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.770> these<00:04:24.950> are<00:04:25.010> at<00:04:25.310> least<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.850> very<00:04:26.240> similar

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
it so these are at least a very similar

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.630 
it so these are at least a very similar
version<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.350> sliders<00:04:27.620> that<00:04:27.830> mr.<00:04:28.250> hurricane

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
version of sliders that mr. hurricane

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.420 
version of sliders that mr. hurricane
and<00:04:28.850> moonlight<00:04:29.120> Swami<00:04:29.479> are<00:04:29.750> both<00:04:29.960> using<00:04:30.430> so

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
and moonlight Swami are both using so

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.830 
and moonlight Swami are both using so
it's<00:04:31.580> worth<00:04:31.729> checking<00:04:31.789> out<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.570> know<00:04:32.690> we

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
it's worth checking out you know we

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.410 
it's worth checking out you know we
again

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
again

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.060 
again
struggled<00:04:33.960> with<00:04:34.080> sliders<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.650> need<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.890> figure

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
struggled with sliders I need to figure

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.210 
struggled with sliders I need to figure
something<00:04:35.430> else<00:04:35.610> out<00:04:35.850> I'm<00:04:36.060> hoping<00:04:36.390> this<00:04:36.750> works

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
something else out I'm hoping this works

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.500 
something else out I'm hoping this works
so<00:04:38.220> it's<00:04:38.430> not<00:04:38.550> something<00:04:38.790> I<00:04:39.060> have<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.240> worry

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
so it's not something I have to worry

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.300 
so it's not something I have to worry
about<00:04:39.660> anymore<00:04:40.140> because<00:04:40.470> throughout<00:04:41.100> this

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
about anymore because throughout this

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.430 
about anymore because throughout this
entire<00:04:41.550> man<00:04:42.090> I've<00:04:42.330> really<00:04:42.750> struggled<00:04:42.960> finding

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
entire man I've really struggled finding

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.110 
entire man I've really struggled finding
a<00:04:43.650> set<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:43.980> sliders<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.610> feel<00:04:44.880> really

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
a set of sliders that I feel really

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.020 
a set of sliders that I feel really
comfortable<00:04:45.450> with<00:04:46.100> as<00:04:47.100> you<00:04:47.280> see<00:04:47.460> me<00:04:47.610> changing

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
comfortable with as you see me changing

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.850 
comfortable with as you see me changing
everything<00:04:48.300> else<00:04:48.660> here<00:04:48.900> fatigue<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:49.680> is

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
everything else here fatigue this is

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.480 
everything else here fatigue this is
down<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.100> 60<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:51.810> kind<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.680> like<00:04:52.860> fatigue<00:04:53.250> where

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
down to 60 I kind of like fatigue where

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.520 
down to 60 I kind of like fatigue where
it's<00:04:53.640> at<00:04:53.820> now<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.420> probably<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.960> reason

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
it's at now this is probably a reason

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.100 
it's at now this is probably a reason
why<00:04:55.710> fumbles<00:04:56.310> have<00:04:56.460> been<00:04:56.610> occurring<00:04:56.940> more<00:04:57.360> so

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
why fumbles have been occurring more so

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.080 
why fumbles have been occurring more so
if<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.470> continues<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:59.280> happen<00:04:59.490> what<00:04:59.850> I<00:04:59.880> might

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
if that continues to happen what I might

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.850 
if that continues to happen what I might
do<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.600> lower<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:01.050> fumble<00:05:01.470> slider<00:05:01.740> a

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
do is just lower the fumble slider a

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.710 
do is just lower the fumble slider a
little<00:05:01.950> bit<00:05:02.280> but<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.490> like<00:05:02.790> that<00:05:03.030> fatigue<00:05:03.450> is

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
little bit but I like that fatigue is

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.510 
little bit but I like that fatigue is
happening<00:05:04.230> because<00:05:04.380> it's<00:05:04.770> getting<00:05:05.100> me<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.250> lot

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
happening because it's getting me a lot

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.650 
happening because it's getting me a lot
of<00:05:05.670> subs<00:05:05.970> which<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.360> really<00:05:06.660> do<00:05:06.780> enjoy<00:05:08.420> this<00:05:09.420> is

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
of subs which I really do enjoy this is

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.630 
of subs which I really do enjoy this is
all<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:09.930> way<00:05:10.020> down<00:05:10.230> to<00:05:10.260> zero<00:05:10.860> that's

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
all the way down to zero that's

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.870 
all the way down to zero that's
interesting<00:05:12.830> we'll<00:05:13.830> give<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.280> shot<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.820> see

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
interesting we'll give it a shot and see

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.820 
interesting we'll give it a shot and see
how<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.360> affects<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.900> game<00:05:16.140> but<00:05:16.440> that<00:05:16.620> is

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
how it affects the game but that is

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.320 
how it affects the game but that is
where<00:05:16.980> that<00:05:17.220> is<00:05:17.400> app<00:05:17.550> for<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:17.820> sliders<00:05:18.300> that

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
where that is app for the sliders that

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:26.170 
where that is app for the sliders that
I've<00:05:18.630> seen<00:05:19.340> 50<00:05:20.340> to<00:05:21.200> 54<00:05:22.970> 60<00:05:23.970> up<00:05:24.150> here<00:05:24.540> all<00:05:24.930> right

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
I've seen 50 to 54 60 up here all right

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.490 
I've seen 50 to 54 60 up here all right
51<00:05:27.180> this<00:05:27.450> is<00:05:27.570> all<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.810> way<00:05:27.900> a<00:05:27.930> 99<00:05:28.740> okay<00:05:30.500> we'll

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
51 this is all the way a 99 okay we'll

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.080 
51 this is all the way a 99 okay we'll
give<00:05:31.740> that<00:05:31.770> a<00:05:32.010> shot<00:05:32.130> and<00:05:32.460> then<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.670> next<00:05:32.850> one

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
give that a shot and then the next one

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.220 
give that a shot and then the next one
is<00:05:33.240> all<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.480> way<00:05:33.570> down<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.780> one<00:05:36.080> then<00:05:37.080> we'll

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
is all the way down to one then we'll

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.050 
is all the way down to one then we'll
have<00:05:37.350> 50<00:05:37.800> which<00:05:37.950> i<00:05:38.070> think<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.370> already<00:05:38.640> correct

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
have 50 which i think is already correct

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.420 
have 50 which i think is already correct
so<00:05:40.020> hopefully<00:05:40.440> this<00:05:40.590> will<00:05:40.800> introduce<00:05:41.160> a

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
so hopefully this will introduce a

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.210 
so hopefully this will introduce a
little<00:05:41.640> more<00:05:42.650> penalties<00:05:43.650> into<00:05:43.920> the<00:05:44.040> game

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
little more penalties into the game

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.130 
little more penalties into the game
something<00:05:44.670> we<00:05:44.790> don't<00:05:45.000> really<00:05:45.450> see<00:05:45.660> all<00:05:45.900> too

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
something we don't really see all too

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.060 
something we don't really see all too
often<00:05:46.430> this<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:47.520> up<00:05:47.730> to<00:05:47.880> 54<00:05:49.070> intentional

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
often this is up to 54 intentional

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.680 
often this is up to 54 intentional
grounding<00:05:50.100> 77<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:51.240> needs<00:05:51.450> to<00:05:51.660> happen

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
grounding 77 that needs to happen

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.510 
grounding 77 that needs to happen
because<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.200> computer<00:05:52.740> has<00:05:53.130> so<00:05:53.400> many

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
because the computer has so many

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.920 
because the computer has so many
intentional<00:05:53.880> grounding<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.660> are<00:05:54.780> never

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
intentional grounding that are never

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:01.250 
intentional grounding that are never
called<00:05:55.320> um<00:05:56.900> 5050<00:05:59.660> alright<00:06:00.660> so<00:06:00.900> that<00:06:00.930> should<00:06:01.230> be

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
called um 5050 alright so that should be

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.200 
called um 5050 alright so that should be
it<00:06:01.500> these<00:06:02.010> are<00:06:02.220> going<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.460> be<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.760> new<00:06:02.880> slider

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
it these are going to be the new slider

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.240 
it these are going to be the new slider
skies<00:06:03.630> we<00:06:03.990> are<00:06:04.110> going<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.410> give<00:06:04.530> it<00:06:04.650> a<00:06:04.710> shot<00:06:04.950> if

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
skies we are going to give it a shot if

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.920 
skies we are going to give it a shot if
we<00:06:05.400> need<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.610> adjust<00:06:05.700> it<00:06:06.180> from<00:06:06.360> here<00:06:06.570> which<00:06:06.750> I'm

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
we need to adjust it from here which I'm

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.780 
we need to adjust it from here which I'm
sure<00:06:07.170> we'll<00:06:07.380> have<00:06:07.590> to<00:06:07.800> play<00:06:08.220> with<00:06:08.370> a<00:06:08.430> little

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
sure we'll have to play with a little

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.640 
sure we'll have to play with a little
bit<00:06:08.940> we<00:06:09.480> will<00:06:09.690> do<00:06:09.870> that<00:06:10.050> but<00:06:10.230> everybody's<00:06:10.620> been

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
bit we will do that but everybody's been

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.930 
bit we will do that but everybody's been
asking<00:06:10.860> to<00:06:11.160> make<00:06:11.280> this<00:06:11.430> series<00:06:11.640> more
