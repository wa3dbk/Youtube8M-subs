00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.859 

now<00:00:16.039> why<00:00:16.400> am<00:00:16.580> I<00:00:16.700> talking<00:00:16.760> about<00:00:17.360> a<00:00:17.390> pedal<00:00:17.840> that

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
now why am I talking about a pedal that

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.480 
now why am I talking about a pedal that
for<00:00:18.200> all<00:00:18.350> intents<00:00:18.650> and<00:00:18.740> purposes<00:00:18.830> is<00:00:19.460> a

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
for all intents and purposes is a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.550 
for all intents and purposes is a
distortion<00:00:19.939> pedal<00:00:20.150> when<00:00:20.840> not<00:00:21.020> only<00:00:21.050> if<00:00:21.290> I<00:00:21.349> said

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
distortion pedal when not only if I said

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.440 
distortion pedal when not only if I said
that<00:00:21.650> I<00:00:21.740> don't<00:00:21.890> like<00:00:22.040> distortion<00:00:22.610> pedals<00:00:22.970> not

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
that I don't like distortion pedals not

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.519 
that I don't like distortion pedals not
only<00:00:23.660> if<00:00:23.750> I<00:00:23.840> said<00:00:24.050> that<00:00:24.110> we<00:00:24.230> won't<00:00:24.349> be<00:00:24.500> using

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
only if I said that we won't be using

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.800 
only if I said that we won't be using
them<00:00:25.040> but<00:00:25.460> I'm<00:00:25.550> doing<00:00:25.849> a<00:00:25.939> series<00:00:26.330> about<00:00:26.450> tube

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
them but I'm doing a series about tube

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.229 
them but I'm doing a series about tube
amps<00:00:27.169> and<00:00:27.289> to<00:00:27.439> babs<00:00:27.740> only<00:00:28.130> well<00:00:28.910> there<00:00:29.180> are

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
amps and to babs only well there are

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.440 
amps and to babs only well there are
three<00:00:29.419> reasons<00:00:29.649> for<00:00:30.649> me<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:31.550> tube<00:00:32.090> screamer

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
three reasons for me the tube screamer

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.540 
three reasons for me the tube screamer
is<00:00:32.540> not<00:00:32.870> a<00:00:32.899> distortion<00:00:33.410> pedal<00:00:33.590> it's<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.250> boost

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
is not a distortion pedal it's a boost

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.340 
is not a distortion pedal it's a boost
pedal<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:35.149> doesn't<00:00:35.480> really<00:00:35.660> change<00:00:35.750> your

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
pedal it doesn't really change your

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.560 
pedal it doesn't really change your
sound<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.680> just<00:00:36.860> gives<00:00:37.070> you<00:00:37.190> more<00:00:37.460> of<00:00:37.520> it

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
sound it just gives you more of it

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.870 
sound it just gives you more of it
number<00:00:39.230> two<00:00:39.380> for<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.649> very<00:00:39.890> reason<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.610> is

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
number two for that very reason it is

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.330 
number two for that very reason it is
perfect<00:00:41.360> with<00:00:41.480> tube<00:00:41.719> amps<00:00:42.170> by<00:00:42.829> feeding<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:43.250> a

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
perfect with tube amps by feeding it a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.000 
perfect with tube amps by feeding it a
hotter<00:00:43.550> signal<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:45.050> we<00:00:45.170> get<00:00:45.380> hotter<00:00:45.680> to

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
hotter signal and we get hotter to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.650 
hotter signal and we get hotter to
response<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:46.790> why<00:00:47.000> do<00:00:47.060> you<00:00:47.120> think<00:00:47.360> they<00:00:47.450> call

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
response and why do you think they call

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.260 
response and why do you think they call
it<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.900> tube<00:00:48.170> screamer<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.090> finally<00:00:50.090> number

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
it a tube screamer and finally number

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.620 
it a tube screamer and finally number
three<00:00:50.630> it<00:00:51.020> sounds<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:51.890> great<00:00:52.210> now<00:00:53.210> as<00:00:53.300> far<00:00:53.510> as

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
three it sounds and great now as far as

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.090 
three it sounds and great now as far as
I'm<00:00:53.780> concerned<00:00:54.140> most<00:00:54.350> tube<00:00:54.560> screamers<00:00:54.980> are

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
I'm concerned most tube screamers are

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.640 
I'm concerned most tube screamers are
great<00:00:55.310> but<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.790> tsa<00:00:56.329> o8<00:00:56.630> with<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.170> Robert

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
great but the tsa o8 with the Robert

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.030 
great but the tsa o8 with the Robert
Keeley<00:00:57.950> mod<00:00:58.250> is<00:00:58.520> by<00:00:58.790> far<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.150> best<00:00:59.800> to<00:01:00.800> be<00:01:00.890> fair

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
Keeley mod is by far the best to be fair

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.229 
Keeley mod is by far the best to be fair
though<00:01:01.160> I<00:01:01.190> haven't<00:01:01.460> tried<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.790> hand<00:01:02.000> wired

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
though I haven't tried the hand wired

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.630 
though I haven't tried the hand wired
one<00:01:02.510> yet<00:01:02.750> but<00:01:03.350> since<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:03.980> don't<00:01:04.040> want<00:01:04.399> to<00:01:04.489> tear

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
one yet but since I don't want to tear

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.359 
one yet but since I don't want to tear
up<00:01:04.729> my<00:01:04.759> pedal<00:01:05.149> board<00:01:05.329> I'm<00:01:05.869> gonna<00:01:06.049> use<00:01:06.320> this<00:01:06.500> ts9

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
up my pedal board I'm gonna use this ts9

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.639 
up my pedal board I'm gonna use this ts9
with<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.270> John<00:01:08.600> brimsley<00:01:09.049> mod<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.619> I

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
with the John brimsley mod that I

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.039 
with the John brimsley mod that I
installed<00:01:10.159> myself<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:11.360> was<00:01:11.479> my<00:01:11.600> main<00:01:11.810> tube

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
installed myself it was my main tube

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.810 
installed myself it was my main tube
screamer<00:01:12.350> before<00:01:12.770> I<00:01:12.799> got<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.159> Kealing<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:13.579> have

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
screamer before I got the Kealing I have

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.120 
screamer before I got the Kealing I have
used<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:14.210> performance<00:01:14.799> now<00:01:15.799> if<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:15.979> don't

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
used in performance now if you don't

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.440 
used in performance now if you don't
have<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.310> tube<00:01:16.579> screw<00:01:16.880> but<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.119> do<00:01:17.270> have<00:01:17.389> some

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
have a tube screw but you do have some

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.260 
have a tube screw but you do have some
type<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:18.020> similar<00:01:18.319> pedal<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:19.670> can<00:01:19.880> use<00:01:20.060> that

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
type of similar pedal you can use that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.690 
type of similar pedal you can use that
instead<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.840> actually<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.319> this<00:01:21.499> this<00:01:22.460> is<00:01:22.670> a

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
instead I actually have this this is a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.050 
instead I actually have this this is a
modified<00:01:23.240> fab<00:01:23.749> overdrive<00:01:24.469> it<00:01:25.399> sounds<00:01:25.819> a<00:01:25.909> lot

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
modified fab overdrive it sounds a lot

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.260 
modified fab overdrive it sounds a lot
like<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.329> tube<00:01:26.659> screamer<00:01:26.990> but<00:01:27.560> since<00:01:27.859> it's<00:01:28.009> made

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
like a tube screamer but since it's made

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.429 
like a tube screamer but since it's made
completely<00:01:29.270> out<00:01:29.389> of<00:01:29.569> plastic<00:01:30.049> it<00:01:30.139> would<00:01:30.289> not

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
completely out of plastic it would not

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.010 
completely out of plastic it would not
last<00:01:30.679> very<00:01:30.889> long<00:01:31.249> in<00:01:31.459> my<00:01:31.579> rig<00:01:31.819> but<00:01:32.780> if<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:32.929> have

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
last very long in my rig but if you have

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.809 
last very long in my rig but if you have
any<00:01:33.200> kind<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.439> boost<00:01:33.679> pedal<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.459> you<00:01:34.579> want<00:01:34.759> to

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
any kind of boost pedal that you want to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.760 
any kind of boost pedal that you want to
use<00:01:34.999> by<00:01:35.299> all<00:01:35.450> means<00:01:35.689> go<00:01:35.899> ahead<00:01:36.200> just<00:01:36.350> don't<00:01:36.560> use

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
use by all means go ahead just don't use

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.709 
use by all means go ahead just don't use
a<00:01:36.799> heavy<00:01:37.100> distortion<00:01:37.490> pedal<00:01:38.060> since<00:01:38.539> it

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
a heavy distortion pedal since it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:39.999 
a heavy distortion pedal since it
totally<00:01:39.020> defeats<00:01:39.319> the<00:01:39.439> purpose<00:01:39.619> of<00:01:39.920> what

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
totally defeats the purpose of what

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.769 
totally defeats the purpose of what
we're<00:01:40.189> about<00:01:40.249> to<00:01:40.429> do<00:01:40.579> now<00:01:41.329> what<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.539> want<00:01:41.689> to

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:41.779 
we're about to do now what you want to

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:43.389 
we're about to do now what you want to
do<00:01:41.869> is<00:01:41.959> plug<00:01:42.200> straight<00:01:42.529> into<00:01:42.590> your<00:01:42.859> pedal<00:01:43.219> and

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
do is plug straight into your pedal and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.859 
do is plug straight into your pedal and
plug<00:01:43.579> your<00:01:43.729> pedals<00:01:44.060> straight<00:01:44.359> into<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.749> EM

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
plug your pedals straight into the EM

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.719 
plug your pedals straight into the EM
we're<00:01:45.319> going<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.499> be<00:01:45.590> using<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.069> on<00:01:46.670> the

we're going to be using this on the

we're going to be using this on the
lower<00:01:47.479> game<00:01:47.779> modes<00:01:48.130> using<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.340> boost<00:01:49.549> pedal<00:01:49.789> on

the clean channel here I got my master
up<00:01:58.969> and<00:01:59.209> I<00:01:59.569> got<00:01:59.749> the<00:01:59.899> power<00:02:00.139> of<00:02:00.349> stealth<00:02:00.649> on

it's<00:02:01.639> getting<00:02:01.909> a<00:02:01.939> little<00:02:02.090> late<00:02:02.299> here<00:02:02.329> as<00:02:02.719> I

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
it's getting a little late here as I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:04.660 
it's getting a little late here as I
shoot<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.229> too<00:02:03.499> so<00:02:03.799> I<00:02:03.829> can't<00:02:04.189> be<00:02:04.340> rattling

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.790 

so<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:18.810> one<00:02:18.959> happens<00:02:19.230> when<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.380> kick<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
high enough to fight a little bit as far

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:39.160 
high enough to fight a little bit as far
from<00:02:25.500> Distortion<00:02:26.130> it's<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.580> live<00:02:26.790> video

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.750 

tube<00:02:40.170> screamer<00:02:40.560> always<00:02:40.920> sounds<00:02:41.310> great<00:02:41.550> with

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
tube screamer always sounds great with

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:56.150 
tube screamer always sounds great with

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
an exit now on tube screamer does sound

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.790 
an exit now on tube screamer does sound
great<00:02:56.400> even<00:02:56.760> with<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> solid<00:02:57.300> Stadium<00:02:57.800> the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
great even with a solid Stadium the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.440 
great even with a solid Stadium the
beauty<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.340> running<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.730> through<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.940> tube<00:03:00.150> amp

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
beauty of running it through a tube amp

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.570 
beauty of running it through a tube amp
is<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:01.470> by<00:03:01.680> increasing<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.190> dry<00:03:02.519> signal

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
is that by increasing the dry signal

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.059 
is that by increasing the dry signal
strength<00:03:03.360> we<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.050> cause<00:03:04.260> light<00:03:04.590> clipping<00:03:04.980> on

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
strength we can cause light clipping on

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.190 
strength we can cause light clipping on
a<00:03:05.100> clean<00:03:05.430> signal<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.390> will<00:03:06.600> sweeten<00:03:06.930> up<00:03:06.959> into

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
a clean signal that will sweeten up into

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.740 
a clean signal that will sweeten up into
power<00:03:07.410> tubes<00:03:07.739> if<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.760> play<00:03:08.970> hard<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.420> get<00:03:09.510> some

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
power tubes if you play hard to get some

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.059 
power tubes if you play hard to get some
grip

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.140 

what's<00:03:18.069> really<00:03:18.280> happening<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.030> the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
what's really happening is that the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.860 
what's really happening is that the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.320

isn't<00:03:20.260> adding<00:03:20.590> its<00:03:20.739> own<00:03:20.890> distortion<00:03:21.520> its<00:03:21.970> kind

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
isn't adding its own distortion its kind

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.110 
isn't adding its own distortion its kind
of<00:03:22.360> adding<00:03:22.690> just<00:03:22.930> more<00:03:23.140> power<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.520> natural

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
of adding just more power to the natural

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.970 
of adding just more power to the natural
gain<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.599> amp<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:25.989> we're<00:03:26.170> really<00:03:26.560> getting

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
gain of the amp so we're really getting

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.710 
gain of the amp so we're really getting
is<00:03:27.099> still<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.459> natural<00:03:27.940> guitar<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.569> amp

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
is still the natural guitar and amp

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.930 
is still the natural guitar and amp
sound<00:03:29.050> it's<00:03:29.560> just<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.739> little<00:03:29.920> bit<00:03:30.040> hotter<00:03:30.280> now

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
sound it's just a little bit hotter now

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.790 
sound it's just a little bit hotter now
let's<00:03:31.150> go<00:03:31.270> orange<00:03:31.660> now<00:03:31.840> still<00:03:32.200> get<00:03:32.319> a<00:03:32.350> low<00:03:32.560> gain

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
let's go orange now still get a low gain

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:57.369 
let's go orange now still get a low gain
setting<00:03:33.250> here<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.520> is<00:03:33.610> without<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.970> screen

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.199 

as<00:03:58.379> a<00:03:58.530> lot<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:58.920> punch<00:03:59.190> since<00:03:59.550> what<00:03:59.730> we've<00:03:59.910> got

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
as a lot of punch since what we've got

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.330 
as a lot of punch since what we've got
is<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> boost<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:01.080> lightly<00:04:01.560> clipped<00:04:01.890> signal

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
is a boost in lightly clipped signal

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.000 
is a boost in lightly clipped signal
going<00:04:03.120> into<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.510> warm<00:04:03.810> preamp

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
going into a warm preamp

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.770 
going into a warm preamp
the<00:04:05.310> power<00:04:05.550> tubes<00:04:05.819> get<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.030> lot<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.269> sound<00:04:06.540> but

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the power tubes get a lot of sound but

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.690 
the power tubes get a lot of sound but
you<00:04:06.900> still<00:04:07.200> retain<00:04:07.470> dynamic<00:04:08.190> control<00:04:08.519> so

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
you still retain dynamic control so

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.770 
you still retain dynamic control so
another<00:04:08.910> great<00:04:09.090> thing<00:04:09.269> about<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.599> tube

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
another great thing about the tube

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.570 
another great thing about the tube
screamer<00:04:09.930> even<00:04:10.349> with<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.560> on<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.010> with<00:04:11.370> some

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
screamer even with it on and with some

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.040 
screamer even with it on and with some
distortion<00:04:12.120> in<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.239> app

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.800 

you<00:04:15.860> can<00:04:15.980> still<00:04:16.250> get<00:04:16.370> really<00:04:16.580> clean<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.450> even

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
you can still get really clean and even

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:25.440 
you can still get really clean and even
a<00:04:18.200> little<00:04:18.650> bit<00:04:18.860> out<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.070> tune

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.720 

okay<00:04:26.230> so<00:04:26.290> let's<00:04:26.560> go<00:04:26.710> read<00:04:26.980> now<00:04:27.190> here<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.610> is

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
okay so let's go read now here it is

00:04:27.730 --> 00:05:16.050 
okay so let's go read now here it is
without

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.570 

that's<00:05:17.060> some<00:05:17.240> pretty<00:05:17.510> sweet<00:05:17.720> overdrive

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
that's some pretty sweet overdrive

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.860 
that's some pretty sweet overdrive
certainly<00:05:19.580> well<00:05:19.730> below<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.090> limits<00:05:20.480> of<00:05:20.750> the

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
certainly well below the limits of the

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.470 
certainly well below the limits of the
channel<00:05:21.260> game<00:05:21.440> but<00:05:21.650> this<00:05:21.800> has<00:05:21.980> a<00:05:22.010> different

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
channel game but this has a different

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.700 
channel game but this has a different
slightly<00:05:23.480> brighter<00:05:23.780> texture<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.650> I

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
slightly brighter texture that I

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.320 
slightly brighter texture that I
actually<00:05:24.890> think<00:05:25.190> sounds<00:05:25.640> sweeter<00:05:25.940> than<00:05:26.120> the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
actually think sounds sweeter than the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.480 
actually think sounds sweeter than the
than<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.840> channel<00:05:27.260> game<00:05:27.440> itself<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.130> you<00:05:28.310> can

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
than the channel game itself and you can

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.820 
than the channel game itself and you can
tweak<00:05:28.850> it<00:05:28.880> lightly<00:05:29.630> with<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.170> tone<00:05:30.440> knob<00:05:30.650> on

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
tweak it lightly with the tone knob on

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.640 
tweak it lightly with the tone knob on
the<00:05:30.860> tube<00:05:31.100> screamer<00:05:31.250> itself<00:05:32.500> overall<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.530> think

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
the tube screamer itself overall I think

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.140 
the tube screamer itself overall I think
the<00:05:33.920> tube<00:05:34.130> screamer<00:05:34.280> really<00:05:34.820> adds<00:05:35.030> something

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
the tube screamer really adds something

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.040 
the tube screamer really adds something
very<00:05:35.690> sweet<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.440> clean<00:05:36.680> channel
