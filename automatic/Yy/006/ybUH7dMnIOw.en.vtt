everybody<00:00:00.930> head<00:00:01.110> here<00:00:01.290> with<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.560> digital

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
everybody head here with the digital

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.409 
everybody head here with the digital
digest<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.610> today<00:00:02.820> I<00:00:02.850> wanted<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.179> share<00:00:03.389> a

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
digest and today I wanted to share a

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.539 
digest and today I wanted to share a
quick<00:00:03.750> look<00:00:04.080> at<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.380> transcend<00:00:04.950> ultimate

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
quick look at the transcend ultimate

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.780 
quick look at the transcend ultimate
SDXC<00:00:06.299> memory<00:00:06.480> card<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.890> 64<00:00:08.580> gig

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
SDXC memory card this is the 64 gig

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.700 
SDXC memory card this is the 64 gig
capacity<00:00:09.389> which<00:00:09.599> right<00:00:09.809> now<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.139> running<00:00:10.440> a

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
capacity which right now is running a

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.850 
capacity which right now is running a
little<00:00:11.340> under<00:00:11.610> $40<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.650> essentially<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.799> is

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
little under $40 and essentially this is

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.589 
little under $40 and essentially this is
unique<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:14.820> even<00:00:15.150> though<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.389> only<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
unique because even though it's only a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.310 
unique because even though it's only a
64<00:00:16.230> gig<00:00:16.440> card<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.130> does<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.000> uhs-1

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
64 gig card it does have that uhs-1

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.820 
64 gig card it does have that uhs-1

this<00:00:25.260> card<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.859> fast<00:00:26.220> enough

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this card it is fast enough

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.580 
this card it is fast enough
specifically<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.840> cameras<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.439> the

specifically with cameras like the

now the ax 100 now the ax 100 is a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.100 
now the ax 100 now the ax 100 is a
little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.040> more<00:00:38.190> forgiving<00:00:38.809> because<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
little bit more forgiving because of the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.200 
little bit more forgiving because of the
codec<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:41.250> opposed<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> Panasonic

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.260 
codec as opposed to the Panasonic
cameras<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.620> otherwise<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.430> see<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
cameras but otherwise you can see the

respectively<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.090> transcend<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.440> really<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
respectively and transcend is really you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.350 
respectively and transcend is really you
know<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.399> those<00:00:56.489> brands<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.180> been

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
know one of those brands that's been

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.220 
know one of those brands that's been
around<00:00:57.480> forever

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
around forever

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.250 
around forever
and<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:59.070> could<00:00:59.219> argue<00:00:59.430> they're<00:01:00.260> essentially

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
and you could argue they're essentially

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
and you could argue they're essentially
a<00:01:01.469> value<00:01:02.100> oriented<00:01:02.640> manufacturer<00:01:03.359> but

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
a value oriented manufacturer but

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.299 
a value oriented manufacturer but
there's<00:01:03.690> nothing<00:01:03.960> wrong<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.530> their<00:01:04.769> product

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
there's nothing wrong with their product

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
there's nothing wrong with their product
so<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.570> wanted<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> share<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.350> card<00:01:07.650> with

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
so I just wanted to share this card with

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.899 
so I just wanted to share this card with
all<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> those

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
all of you because it's one of those

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.850 
all of you because it's one of those
things<00:01:09.270> where<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:10.110> lot<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.710> are

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
things where I know a lot of you are

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.820 
things where I know a lot of you are
trying<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> figure<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:12.409> doesn't<00:01:13.409> seem<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.680> need

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
trying to figure out doesn't seem I need

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.490 
trying to figure out doesn't seem I need
to<00:01:13.950> cut<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:15.360> trying<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> figure<00:01:16.320> out

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to cut it out but trying to figure out

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.640 
to cut it out but trying to figure out
what<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.490> appropriate<00:01:17.939> card<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.229> pick<00:01:19.439> up

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
what the appropriate card is to pick up

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
what the appropriate card is to pick up
apparently<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.790> need<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> cut<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.330> out

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
apparently I don't need to cut it out

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.340 
apparently I don't need to cut it out
and<00:01:22.549> this<00:01:23.549> seems<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.450> me<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and this seems right now to me to be the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.460 
and this seems right now to me to be the
best<00:01:25.650> value<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.330> bunch<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
best value of the bunch because at the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.740 
best value of the bunch because at the
price<00:01:28.820> you're<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> beat

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
price you're really not going to beat

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.999 
price you're really not going to beat
this<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.670> say<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.180> because<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.200> looked

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
this and I say that because I looked

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
this and I say that because I looked
there<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.729> aren't<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.509> lot<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.750> other<00:01:36.990> cards

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
there really aren't a lot of other cards

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.940 
there really aren't a lot of other cards
at<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.070> class<00:01:38.729> rating<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.890> to
