should<00:01:52.079> probably<00:01:52.110> walk<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.939> was<00:01:54.180> um

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
should probably walk it so I was um

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.399 
should probably walk it so I was um
bridge<00:01:56.210> she<00:01:57.210> cut<00:01:57.450> she<00:01:57.719> knows<00:01:57.869> her<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> spell<00:01:58.320> her

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
bridge she cut she knows her a spell her

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.330 
bridge she cut she knows her a spell her
name<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.280> just

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
name but this is kind of just

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.300 
name but this is kind of just
reinforcing<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.229> was<00:02:01.350> gonna<00:02:01.500> actually<00:02:02.040> use

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
reinforcing so I was gonna actually use

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.459 
reinforcing so I was gonna actually use
the<00:02:02.579> letters<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.149> her<00:02:03.689> name<00:02:03.869> instead<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the letters of her name instead of the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.100 
the letters of her name instead of the
arrows<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.310> way<00:02:05.490> she<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.600> remember<00:02:06.750> how<00:02:07.079> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
arrows that way she can remember how to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.630 
arrows that way she can remember how to
spell<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.710> they'll<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.829> reinforce<00:02:08.399> it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
spell it and they'll just reinforce it

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.990 
spell it and they'll just reinforce it
so<00:02:08.849> she<00:02:08.910> won't<00:02:09.030> forget<00:02:09.360> over<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.629> summer<00:02:09.810> um

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so she won't forget over the summer um

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.960 
so she won't forget over the summer um
and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.740> this<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:13.800> another<00:02:14.190> idea<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.760> could

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and then this is another idea you could

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.120 
and then this is another idea you could
do<00:02:15.240> if<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.080> didn't<00:02:16.620> want<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.830> mark<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.100> new

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
do if you didn't want to mark a new

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.310 
do if you didn't want to mark a new
shoes<00:02:17.550> or<00:02:17.730> whatever<00:02:17.820> but<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:19.140> know<00:02:19.230> if

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
shoes or whatever but I don't know if

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.440 
shoes or whatever but I don't know if
this<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.500> gonna<00:02:19.830> work<00:02:20.130> for<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> good<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.270> not<00:02:21.420> but

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
this is gonna work for a good or not but

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.200 
this is gonna work for a good or not but
you<00:02:21.780> could<00:02:21.930> take<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.590> sticker<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:24.000> is

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
you could take just a sticker this is

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.240 
you could take just a sticker this is
supposed<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.600> green<00:02:24.840> apple<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
supposed to be a green apple you get to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.380 
supposed to be a green apple you get to
take<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.370> sticker<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:27.000> cut<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.330> half

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
take a sticker and just cut it in half

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.870 
take a sticker and just cut it in half
and<00:02:27.840> do<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.290> one<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.620> each<00:02:28.709> shoot<00:02:29.040> although<00:02:29.820> I'm

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
and do it one in each shoot although I'm

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.270 
and do it one in each shoot although I'm
sure<00:02:29.910> these<00:02:30.330> will<00:02:30.390> probably<00:02:30.990> come<00:02:31.170> off<00:02:31.380> in<00:02:31.620> no

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
sure these will probably come off in no

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.760 
sure these will probably come off in no
time<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:33.120> um<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.860> shoes<00:02:35.160> actually<00:02:35.760> right<00:02:36.180> here

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
time so um the shoes actually right here

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.920 
time so um the shoes actually right here
you<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.920> kind<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.190> see<00:02:38.250> faintly<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.880> arrow<00:02:39.090> it

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
you can kind of see faintly the arrow it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.710 
you can kind of see faintly the arrow it
was<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> sharpie<00:02:40.530> arrow<00:02:41.300> kind<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.450> see<00:02:42.630> it

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
was a sharpie arrow kind of see it

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.500 
was a sharpie arrow kind of see it
anyways<00:02:43.310> they<00:02:44.310> eventually<00:02:44.430> fade<00:02:45.000> off<00:02:45.209> so<00:02:45.420> you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
anyways they eventually fade off so you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.380 
anyways they eventually fade off so you
have<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.780> write<00:02:45.959> them<00:02:46.170> again<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:48.000> totally

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
have to write them again but it totally

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.890 
have to write them again but it totally
works<00:02:49.370> um<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.970> way<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.180> don't<00:02:51.750> always

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
works um so that way you don't always

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.260 
works um so that way you don't always
have<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.200> be<00:02:52.410> right<00:02:52.440> there<00:02:52.620> hovering<00:02:53.310> around

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
have to be right there hovering around

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.060 
have to be right there hovering around
them<00:02:54.780> when<00:02:55.320> they're<00:02:55.470> trying<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.770> figure<00:02:55.950> out

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
them when they're trying to figure out

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.860 
them when they're trying to figure out
what<00:02:56.220> she<00:02:56.430> was<00:02:56.550> wish<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.360> saves<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.660> time

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
what she was wish so it saves you time

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.920 
what she was wish so it saves you time
gives<00:02:58.260> them<00:02:58.440> some<00:02:58.680> confidence<00:02:58.890> some<00:02:59.520> in

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
gives them some confidence some in

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.050 
gives them some confidence some in
Independence<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:02.220> know<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.459> they<00:03:02.550> can<00:03:02.580> do<00:03:02.910> it

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
Independence to know that they can do it

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.600 
Independence to know that they can do it
and<00:03:04.370> until<00:03:05.370> they<00:03:05.520> kind<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.880> get<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.330> gist<00:03:06.750> of

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
and until they kind of get the gist of

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.430 
and until they kind of get the gist of
the<00:03:08.610> bigger<00:03:08.850> part<00:03:09.209> goes<00:03:09.570> for<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.020> bigger<00:03:10.170> toe

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
the bigger part goes for the bigger toe

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.930 
the bigger part goes for the bigger toe
that<00:03:11.010> kind<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.280> thing<00:03:11.489> because<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.790> can

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
that kind of thing because you can

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.760 
that kind of thing because you can
explain<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.330> all<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.750> want<00:03:12.959> like<00:03:13.140> see<00:03:13.590> this

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
big part it goes on this big toe but

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.050 
big part it goes on this big toe but
they<00:03:15.750> don't<00:03:15.930> get<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.519> no<00:03:17.519> they<00:03:17.730> don't<00:03:17.910> get<00:03:18.000> it
