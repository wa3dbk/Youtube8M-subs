in<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.340> video<00:00:38.640> we're<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.179> show<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
in this video we're going to show you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.500 
in this video we're going to show you
how<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.750> use<00:00:40.230> make<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:42.210> jigs<00:00:44.269> so<00:00:45.269> what

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
how to use make and think jigs so what

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.549 
how to use make and think jigs so what
is<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.019> jig<00:00:46.730> in<00:00:47.730> routing<00:00:48.059> turns<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.809> jig<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.530> a

is a jig in routing turns a jig is a
guiding<00:00:50.039> system<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:51.149> determine<00:00:51.929> the<00:00:52.079> path<00:00:52.289> of

guiding system to determine the path of

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:54.799 
guiding system to determine the path of
the<00:00:52.620> cutter<00:00:53.239> let's<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.449> at<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> router

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the cutter let's look at the router

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.759 
the cutter let's look at the router
itself<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.850> cutter<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.449> fixed<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.109> relation

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
itself the cutter is fixed in relation

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.369 
itself the cutter is fixed in relation
to<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.039> router<00:00:59.249> base<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.909> is<00:01:00.600> simply<00:01:00.929> lowered

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to the router base and is simply lowered

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
to the router base and is simply lowered
or<00:01:01.559> raised<00:01:02.070> by<00:01:02.730> operating<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.449> plunging

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
or raised by operating the plunging

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.250 
or raised by operating the plunging
mechanism<00:01:04.940> if<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.570> operate<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.050> router

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
mechanism if you operate the router

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.969 
mechanism if you operate the router
freehand<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.550> have<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> jig<00:01:09.120> device<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.740> in

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
freehand you have a jig device and in

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.160 
freehand you have a jig device and in
this<00:01:11.130> case<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.329> who<00:01:12.570> determines<00:01:13.079> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
this case it is you who determines the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.370 
this case it is you who determines the
path<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> cutter<00:01:14.479> such<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> method<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.110> used

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
path of the cutter such a method is used

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
path of the cutter such a method is used
for<00:01:16.590> freehand<00:01:17.130> lettering<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:18.149> example<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
for freehand lettering for example the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.139 
for freehand lettering for example the
tabletop<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.200> visual<00:01:22.619> illusion<00:01:23.030> instead<00:01:24.030> of

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
tabletop is a visual illusion instead of

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.030 
tabletop is a visual illusion instead of
making<00:01:24.540> an<00:01:24.719> intricate<00:01:25.259> lattice<00:01:25.649> work<00:01:25.829> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
making an intricate lattice work of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280 
making an intricate lattice work of
cross<00:01:26.280> harming<00:01:26.700> joints<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> setting

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
cross harming joints and then in setting

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.130 
cross harming joints and then in setting
the<00:01:28.409> squares<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.100> simply<00:01:30.060> started<00:01:30.509> by<00:01:30.719> gluing

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the squares I simply started by gluing

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.770 
the squares I simply started by gluing
squares<00:01:31.560> onto<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> baseboard<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:33.299> worrying

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
squares onto a baseboard not worrying

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.840 
squares onto a baseboard not worrying
too<00:01:33.960> much<00:01:33.990> about<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:35.159> accurately<00:01:35.610> they

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
too much about how accurately they

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.340 
too much about how accurately they
matched<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:37.969> then<00:01:38.969> I<00:01:39.210> routed<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.930> series<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
matched up then I routed a series of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.410 
matched up then I routed a series of
parallel<00:01:40.799> grooves<00:01:41.250> along<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> center<00:01:42.210> lines

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
parallel grooves along the center lines

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.260 
parallel grooves along the center lines
using<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.200> batten<00:01:43.950> guide<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:46.880> then<00:01:47.880> set<00:01:48.240> some

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
using a batten guide I then set some

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.569 
using a batten guide I then set some
strips<00:01:48.899> which<00:01:49.469> had<00:01:49.649> been<00:01:49.799> prepared<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
strips which had been prepared on the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.319 
strips which had been prepared on the
planer<00:01:50.820> thickness<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.880> then<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.909> cut<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
planer thickness on and then I cut the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.750 
planer thickness on and then I cut the
adjacent<00:01:54.930> series<00:01:55.289> of<00:01:55.439> grooves

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.250 

and<00:01:58.110> inset<00:01:59.110> more<00:01:59.380> strips<00:01:59.770> as<00:02:00.010> before<00:02:00.870> all<00:02:01.870> this

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
and inset more strips as before all this

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.290 
and inset more strips as before all this
was<00:02:02.530> done<00:02:02.770> with<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:02.980> simple<00:02:03.280> baton<00:02:03.790> guide<00:02:04.000> a
