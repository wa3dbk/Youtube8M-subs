00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
up here on my board somewhere I try to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
up here on my board somewhere I try to
cover<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.250> hopefully<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.879> can't<00:01:03.120> see

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
cover it up so hopefully you can't see

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.940 
cover it up so hopefully you can't see
it<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.989> um<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:05.129> comes<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:06.560> little<00:01:07.560> heat

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

protection<00:01:08.340> thing<00:01:08.930> supposed<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> clip<00:01:10.260> it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
protection thing supposed to clip it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.000 
protection thing supposed to clip it
onto<00:01:10.530> here

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
onto here

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.210 
onto here
and<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.570> supposed<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.080> help<00:01:13.320> guard<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and it's supposed to like help guard it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.999 
and it's supposed to like help guard it
from<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:14.850> skin<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.140> thing's<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.680> close

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
from your skin but this thing's so close

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.179 
from your skin but this thing's so close
to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> rotating<00:01:18.420> iron<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.439> gets<00:01:19.710> pretty

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to the rotating iron that it gets pretty

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.060 
to the rotating iron that it gets pretty
hot<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.509> hurts<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.810> bit<00:01:21.930> touchy<00:01:22.320> but

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
hot so it kind of hurts a bit touchy but

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
hot so it kind of hurts a bit touchy but
it<00:01:23.250> probably<00:01:23.549> won't<00:01:23.820> burn<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.689> leave

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.140 
it probably won't burn you and leave
burn<00:01:25.140> marks<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.710> skin's<00:01:26.009> own<00:01:26.220> probably

burn marks on your skin's own probably

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.649

keratin smooth that

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.060 
keratin smooth that
yeah<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.399> um<00:01:50.149> after<00:01:50.689> I<00:01:51.020> took<00:01:51.079> shower<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.679> sprayed

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
through and I can't really say if it

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.370 
through and I can't really say if it
works<00:01:58.939> better<00:01:59.240> than<00:01:59.570> other<00:01:59.810> products<00:02:00.259> because

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
works better than other products because

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.840 
works better than other products because
I<00:02:00.560> haven't<00:02:00.799> really<00:02:00.979> tried<00:02:01.100> her<00:02:01.399> in<00:02:01.490> many<00:02:01.640> he

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
I haven't really tried her in many he

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.330 
I haven't really tried her in many he
protects<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.299> sprays<00:02:02.539> but<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.500> did<00:02:03.860> what<00:02:04.310> I

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
protects and sprays but it did what I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.380 
protects and sprays but it did what I
wanted<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.789> do<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.289> like<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:07.209> and<00:02:08.209> then

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
wanted it to do so I like it and then

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.869 
wanted it to do so I like it and then
the<00:02:08.509> next<00:02:08.750> thing<00:02:08.869> was<00:02:09.500> really<00:02:09.830> expensive<00:02:10.190> but

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
the next thing was really expensive but

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.280 
the next thing was really expensive but
it<00:02:11.180> was<00:02:11.299> kind<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.510> like<00:02:11.629> an<00:02:11.780> impulse<00:02:12.170> buy<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.610> I

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290
