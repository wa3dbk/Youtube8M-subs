00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:09.380
 Hello everyone for those who fight for whom 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.940
 dust is a serious problem 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.529
 task 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:19.260
 I want to introduce you to a vacuum cleaner 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.600
 which in my opinion is good 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:29.960
 copes with this this vacuum karcher 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.960
 ds 6000 water filter 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 Well, in short, this is a water vacuum cleaner 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.890
 I will tell the filter here in this 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.629
 chips main water filter gone 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.079
 the main feature of this vacuum cleaner 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.980
 go into details in the characteristics 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.649
 I will not it after all can be found in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.140
 On the Internet, well, I just want to 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.090
 visually demonstrate this 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.320
 a vacuum cleaner 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:06.119
 let's actually say something 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 Well, if we talk about cons, then they 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.570
 here now immediately rush in the eyes of this 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.430
 his size he is such a big vacuum cleaner 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.759
 but if you put it like it now 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.650
 standing upright then in principle he is not 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.920
 so much space takes 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.320
 although in the working position that is when 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.780
 he stands on the floor he is pretty 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.810
 large though not critical and main 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.310
 its chip is a water filter 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.680
 who solve the dust problem 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.110
 which in ordinary vacuum cleaner seeks 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.590
 still having the whole system break out 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.240
 out here solves this problem water 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.350
 filter 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.049
 besides, it simplifies 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.130
 getting rid of shine 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.680
 &amp; type or which will be inside here 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.600
 this water filter all the dust 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:09.819
 going to burn inject very easily with 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:13.390
 this filter work install it 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:21.239
 see no complicated operations 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.239
 do not need to make a chick and all 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.790
 let's see what's inside here 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:37.780
 this lid opens too everything is easy and 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:40.300
 just water pours in here 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.180
 the place is suitable tube working this 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:49.180
 that's why the place is here and accordingly 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:52.209
 dust enters in enters in here 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.019
 this pipe from the pipe see see 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.540
 here this part of the pipe is already loaded 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.090
 under water and respectively 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.760
 the dust gets straight to god here 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:09.299
 water is pouring in now I am you 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:13.000
 demonstrate how water is poured and 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:18.370
 in the work of this very vacuum cleaner 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.599
 I will demonstrate so worth success husband 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.680
 nuf-nuf 10 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.829
 hides inside the vacuum cleaner and pulled out 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.160
 one easy movement is removed very 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.160
 is simple 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.120
 and so to bring the filter into the working 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:48.510
 state you need to pour water 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:52.490
 pour water water should 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.490
 meet a certain level 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.020
 filters, install water 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.030
 still need a vacuum cleaner 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.590
 yes here to add special 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.610
 fluid that prevents 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.610
 foam formation 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.350
 now 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.670
 add special anti cap 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.670
 back howling fluid 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.150
 a little more than usual 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:51.100
 vacuuming a little more action but they 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:52.990
 absolutely not annoying in the end all the same 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.550
 maybe even with a regular vacuum cleaner 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.140
 which bag has up dust collector 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.730
 you need to get the dust collector there later 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.200
 somewhere I'll throw him out there something else 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.810
 I know about the same amount 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.230
 act all water filter poured 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.230
 installed 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:19.120
 latch all resource ready to work 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:23.640
 and here still inside there 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:27.970
 nozzles well, except for those 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.520
 Kit Phillip Can't Say 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:35.130
 how quietly it works well, rather 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:38.130
 Of course there is a shunt but he is a measure 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.130
 reasonable 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.020
 long cord 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.200
 you can ruin and unwind press 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:06.760
 a button so big that merges 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:09.390
 with vacuum cleaners of course 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.390
 my hunger 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.280
 It could be worse 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.280
 glad 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.190
 you cover the strip 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.190
 May 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.840
 and the best part is that 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.840
 air passing through the water filter 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.860
 air passing through the water filter and there 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.910
 some more filters it becomes 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.890
 get carried away without any dust here 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.940
 the power you saw pulls so 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.440
 tears off a strip 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.830
 all that I wanted to tell you 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.960
 the main feature is a water filter and not me 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.390
 even then I will show results now about 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.100
 vacuum cleaner here show that there will be 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:05.750
 inside 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:10.160
 it will be curious to see so I 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:11.560
 finished vacuuming your palace is not the most 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.550
 dirty 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.690
 relatively recently and have fallen under 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.910
 vacuum cleaner now see what we have there 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:24.110
 plucked inside 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:34.090
 remove the cover there look what 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:34.090
 dirty water bullets are now there 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:44.770
 then it all pours into the toilet 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:48.129
 washed with tap water here and in 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:52.210
 as a result we get everything clean again 

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:56.830
 practical easy cost well vacuum cleaner 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:08:01.680
 somewhere around 12 thousand on this think 

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.680
 Thank you all for your attention.
