00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.749
 Hello Lord, this way would like to show you how to do it 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.589
 which can very easily set up its own web server under Windows 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.140
 corresponding video as they can do the same under Ubuntu we have 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.939
 already on simple as Didier online put her quasi the variant leads 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.630
 Windows there are several ways we can achieve our goal 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.719
 of course, that's why I go the way of the least resistance 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.269
 in communities Videos is then shown how we this server to a SQL 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.930
 Server can then finally to its own forward and 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.230
 Software on our work server to be able to use as mentioned under Ubuntu however 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.469
 all this already shown and basically Ubuntu is a Windows 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.390
 always preferable 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.470
 this only affects the tests for versions so Windows XP Windows Vista 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.800
 and so on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 may as well 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.450
 so far stable operating systems but why spend money if you do the same 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.090
 can also have it for free 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.770
 but not everyone has a two hit available around this and bunch 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.130
 or Linux, or the ability to network at all 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.260
 In that regard, can maintain a server on one of the stop Windows systems 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.740
 quite useful if it used, for example, for kleinst- server 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.810
 It should be called or, for example, during development times 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.730
 create websites and want to test them quickly without the 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.360
 the corresponding pages in March to have to push another server 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.400
 I would not take days like that but still we are with the Local 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 Heroes are still the fastest on the way 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.020
 So let's start our standard browser at our ease 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 Default search engine for a program named- 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.350
 extra a GPS 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.460
 We should first hit the point Apax Skivereins point Borg 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.080
 Find 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.600
 Fichtner on it 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.650
 Dahlem 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.270
 get here the download options Sam for Clean Abs 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.939
 we're doing Xiamen for UBS Kiek 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.069
 it could have something down here again the download 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:21.880
 we take 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.619
 Xanten 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.119
 then here is the version 1 point 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.890
 7 2 is the current version 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.720
 I take every text packet 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.389
 44 megabytes 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.389
 flip on it 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.099
 to save 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.999
 so now come complete 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.999
 Halberstadt - Nancy directly 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.480
 zol that the people full of that more and more come in the district obe and 9 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.839
 into the gate 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.839
 the whole house parked 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:16.589
 the program packages are unpacked come directly into the tent we can now 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:20.229
 we want to decide that has done in the Start menu or a desktop 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.519
 I assume that we basically want it all so 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.699
 leave the default now image salone 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.699
 click OK de 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.549
 it again 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.019
 Tomorrow a Portable Version No default also 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.739
 should we in Europe Paris should now be in Paris 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.999
 Posco FMA anyway 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.369
 to 17 thus is the diesel 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:54.839
 why and why 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.839
 Start Xiamen Control Panel »So the 1 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.769
 comes the control panel minimize the first time 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.629
 the weekend is 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.340
 the stable https for development purposes this will not be necessary so why 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.990
 If you can then it is the stable it is only natural 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.170
 they urgently need 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.839
 Altenhof there 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:19.310
 however, they then develop here Anabel Alf PIF Euro before only 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.820
 that's okay for us 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.079
 So from the 5 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.150
 they do not have to do that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.029
 ALG II version 6 that is hardly ever used 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:30.819
 Murder Forlán sees both sides creating 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.189
 can you do that here now 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.889
 turned on properly let the bombshell turned off 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.330
 Son as Pia is the same the Cosmo is full it has increased so has seven 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.090
 that's automatically turned off for me too Leo Kirch he currently wants 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.900
 only http pages 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.330
 I do not want that any more 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.190
 Well, so Dix will change the whole tent off 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.960
 You can also finish it 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.960
 should start rock solid above 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.779
 dapd double click 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:05.349
 so now we are the installed server what makes you extra sense 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.480
 that, for example, we already see sql-server as the second Steinmeier 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.839
 as I said, we need later 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.430
 now we just need the patch myself that earned the bachelor and 

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:18.089
 this is not allowed at the moment 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:21.029
 that means the opponent just waiting for the start and we get 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.120
 now for the message 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.309
 Bayer was running better now 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:27.309
 what did Local Holstein mean to me now? 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.580
 then your answer should come and here is 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.210
 when they step in German and then we can have here again 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.009
 configured 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.339
 Let's take a quick look at the hard drive to start with 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.439
 the Xperia ray navigate this 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:47.770
 to c programs 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.889
 and then I had it all Xiamen installed 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:58.009
 Noisy but here you need a called HTC Oaks because our html document is there 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.119
 older 

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:02.030
 not that you can see two documents in it today 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.800
 once an index php and once on 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.029
 Index point html 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.269
 why I am editing the html document right mouse button im 

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:12.240
 context menu 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.820
 and just describe the quarks 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.970
 I do not say anything simply kept html-page 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.840
 So it's just great but I will not show which more 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:25.269
 apparently the PEA is displayed every part 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.529
 When I look at these I do not see here 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:35.319
 4 except a diversion that is performed here that is called me calls 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.719
 Actually, with Lokal out of this one, she also showed 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.629
 but the index php file is addressed before the index html file 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:47.159
 not unimportant if complaints should want to place there 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:50.860
 Do you want this index php then directs me further into 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.290
 though listed 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.420
 I can see that I am here for example now although I only have Locle Vos 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.849
 called 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.849
 now in the directory Local August / 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.620
 that is, if I am this one 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.630
 Would like to strangle diversion 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.889
 So if I want to feel Margon later 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.110
 then I would have to go back to Local August 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.740
 Enter Samp 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.930
 or call 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.490
 OK so 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.409
 even researchers expect 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.409
 So I delete now first the index points Herb Rhee 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:23.960
 Now just call Lockenhaus on it 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.760
 and now also stands here VOX and that it is this page that according to 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.619
 to see that if I changed that to the fast one 

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:32.879
 the favorite stations video 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:34.330
 to save 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.779
 Control trios 

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.279
 Make sure that they are adjusted accordingly that means if we are so 

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:42.099
 want to develop our documents or our documents already 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:45.519
 finished then have the here recorded in the hd box 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.210
 So pretty much all this is a dedicated web server on a Windows XP 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.190
 Calculator will be much easier, it will not be more
