00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:05.839
 the ski season is now time for audits two real top athletes 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:38.000
 to challenge for a very special duel 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.250
 Today, our two specialists have first caused a stir in many 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.089
 Things advantage can play 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.249
 I think they are the way when in the end a duo is skiing 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:53.100
 how learning with the second child can be just that is the challenge 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.910
 both women athletes have to be in the special field 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.990
 prove their competitor 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.950
 the track is designed so that both can be full of driving skills 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.580
 just have to do just in parallel slalom has been doubled just like that 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.810
 and Dr Pölten just super good for the one he burns flatter 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.620
 and railway technology allow Antti Nieminen Witten there is for Hilde Gerg 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.650
 probably on the second round exciting when the two the route with the 313th 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.630
 PS strong Audi of the q5 must cope however exactly there a hardness test 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.860
 with Bernard Weber before the Enlightenment, the two complaining surprisingly 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.250
 Of course we worked very thoroughly intensively otherwise we will end up 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.810
 took 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.930
 Flasbarth can be praised 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.270
 Well kept and we have to delineate 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.710
 now it's getting exciting 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.080
 Passage 1 skiing 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.270
 how does the Swiss Rahel free the duel against a real student 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.800
 the 7th 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.310
 Kurth 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.649
 Hildegard Pfaff bumps into the crowd and makes it to the first 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:07.150
 Meters a clear lead 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:18.119
 April ideal line throws Hilde down the slope 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.449
 Of course, as a racing driver, Consumers helpful is looking for the ideal line 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:25.589
 but has not come up with so much momentum 6 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:39.039
 In the end, Hilde Gerg's lead in the finish is clear 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.009
 the first time Dhaka 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:50.669
 on and nice after 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.529
 I think FDP warned before the eyes of the world there 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.479
 I agree 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:01.659
 Meanwhile, the sun has softened the slope, the two expects one 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.769
 Evening slide on the market 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.409
 the promoter dictated dermatologist Niederreiter Annina Pierson the examiner 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.289
 On the other hand, he put there lives 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.739
 Work is done 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.370
 April three cars honked at both sides small cross 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.409
 for Nadal 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:19.539
 long foul 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.789
 later set on fire because on the front axle of sitting on the last 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:24.329
 Place in the air 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.599
 then when sick resumed 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.109
 so go on in the second round 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.059
 Now the factory riders in Reil must also show that they are behind the wheel 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:35.869
 can 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:49.369
 while their side is heavier with lowered and ground 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:53.219
 the value is also going well here the manufacturer of the q5 apparently playful and 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:04:02.179
 even goes 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.429
 at the steepest point content but many small volunteer ones 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:19.729
 reduced 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:26.460
 nevertheless all respect that was scarce 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.919
 09 11 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.199
 Has 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.870
 so he should be numbers at the 11 I asked 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.030
 a think that even considerations Frankfurt am Main he was with "My 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.060
 Cassette Player »is safe even if he is popular and successful 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.349
 to work 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.599
 what to do and how to succeed and who has won now 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.969
 1 1 draw 1 so an inside of the rescuers will be nice to me this 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.559
 By the way, winnings could also be about a draw 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:58.249
 the Audi RS q5 will also be excellent on asphalt
