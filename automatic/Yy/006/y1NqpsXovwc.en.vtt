00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
compass on top you might have the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
so in a vanilla game i think the the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.370 
so in a vanilla game i think the the

the<00:03:35.280> more<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.519> just<00:03:35.970> dislike<00:03:36.659> it<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.989> just

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
the more I just dislike it and I just

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.479 
the more I just dislike it and I just
want<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.319> go<00:03:37.440> back<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.799> vanilla<00:03:38.069> colors

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
want to go back to the vanilla colors

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.659 
want to go back to the vanilla colors
but<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.389> like<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.079> unique<00:03:40.470> on<00:03:40.650> fix<00:03:40.919> because<00:03:41.370> of

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
but I like the unique on fix because of

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.979 
but I like the unique on fix because of
the<00:03:41.760> shadow<00:03:42.000> fix<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.419> I'll<00:03:42.510> demonstrate<00:03:42.629> now

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
the shadow fix that I'll demonstrate now

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.539 
the shadow fix that I'll demonstrate now
so<00:03:43.440> i'll<00:03:43.530> go<00:03:43.620> ahead<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.769> turn<00:03:43.979> off<00:03:44.129> the<00:03:44.220> EMB

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
so i'll go ahead and turn off the EMB

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.599 
so i'll go ahead and turn off the EMB
and<00:03:44.790> here's<00:03:45.690> here's<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.560> default<00:03:47.099> game<00:03:47.340> on

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
and here's here's the default game on

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.390 
and here's here's the default game on
high<00:03:48.030> shadow<00:03:48.629> settings<00:03:49.079> so<00:03:49.979> this<00:03:50.099> is<00:03:50.250> high

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
high shadow settings so this is high

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.969 
high shadow settings so this is high
shadows<00:03:50.790> things<00:03:51.000> alright<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.049> this<00:03:52.290> this

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
shadows things alright so this this

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.770 
shadows things alright so this this
shadows<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.639> little<00:03:53.849> choppy<00:03:54.090> right<00:03:54.329> there<00:03:54.569> you

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
shadows a little choppy right there you

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.439 
shadows a little choppy right there you
see<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.079> little<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.889> guess<00:03:56.819> lines<00:03:57.180> of

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
see the little like I guess lines of

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.449 
see the little like I guess lines of
shadow<00:03:57.720> on<00:03:58.049> this<00:03:58.260> far<00:03:58.500> rock<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:59.069> might<00:03:59.190> be<00:03:59.280> kind

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
shadow on this far rock it might be kind

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.680 
shadow on this far rock it might be kind
of<00:03:59.489> hard<00:03:59.639> to<00:03:59.699> see<00:03:59.819> with<00:03:59.909> the<00:04:00.000> video<00:04:00.299> codec

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
of hard to see with the video codec

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.909 
of hard to see with the video codec
maybe<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.019> think<00:04:01.349> coming<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> little<00:04:01.680> closer

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
maybe I think coming a little closer

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.039 
maybe I think coming a little closer
will<00:04:02.190> show<00:04:02.340> up<00:04:02.489> but<00:04:03.389> you<00:04:03.449> can<00:04:03.599> see<00:04:03.750> those<00:04:03.900> that

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
will show up but you can see those that

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.259 
will show up but you can see those that
kind<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.319> like<00:04:04.440> run<00:04:05.340> away<00:04:05.579> as<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.879> approach

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
kind of like run away as you approach

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.300 
kind of like run away as you approach
them<00:04:06.479> but<00:04:07.139> with<00:04:07.379> this<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.859> B<00:04:07.979> that<00:04:08.220> i'm

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
them but with this a and B that i'm

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.949 
them but with this a and B that i'm
using<00:04:08.519> right<00:04:08.549> now<00:04:08.669> which<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.150> ambience<00:04:09.659> a<00:04:09.810> no

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
using right now which is ambience a no

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.300 
using right now which is ambience a no
bland<00:04:10.379> and<00:04:10.650> i'm<00:04:11.519> using<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.970> ENB<00:04:12.560> 0.1<00:04:13.560> 13<00:04:14.040> and

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
bland and i'm using the ENB 0.1 13 and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.990 
bland and i'm using the ENB 0.1 13 and
if<00:04:15.269> i<00:04:15.359> turn<00:04:15.419> it<00:04:15.659> on<00:04:16.039> the<00:04:17.039> shadows<00:04:17.430> are<00:04:17.579> smoother

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
if i turn it on the shadows are smoother

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.959 
if i turn it on the shadows are smoother
much<00:04:18.690> much<00:04:19.260> more<00:04:19.470> realistic<00:04:19.799> if<00:04:20.340> any<00:04:20.609> shadow

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:20.969 
much much more realistic if any shadow

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.530 
much much more realistic if any shadow
in<00:04:21.299> real<00:04:21.510> life<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.989> has<00:04:22.289> a

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
in real life it has a

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.510 
in real life it has a
smooth<00:04:22.780> edge<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.260> it<00:04:23.290> you<00:04:24.040> don't<00:04:24.220> see<00:04:24.370> any

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
smooth edge to it you don't see any

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.330 
smooth edge to it you don't see any
sharp<00:04:24.760> edges<00:04:24.910> except<00:04:25.480> for<00:04:25.800> actual<00:04:26.800> direct

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
sharp edges except for actual direct

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.520 
sharp edges except for actual direct
lights<00:04:27.610> not<00:04:28.330> outside<00:04:28.600> lights<00:04:29.050> like<00:04:29.350> I'm

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
lights not outside lights like I'm

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.960 
lights not outside lights like I'm
talking<00:04:29.680> about<00:04:29.830> like<00:04:29.950> lamps<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.730> stuff<00:04:30.790> like

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
talking about like lamps and stuff like

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.940 
talking about like lamps and stuff like
that<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.150> produces<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.750> sharp<00:04:32.020> shadow<00:04:32.290> but<00:04:32.860> if

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
that that produces a sharp shadow but if

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.350 
that that produces a sharp shadow but if
you're<00:04:33.070> outside<00:04:33.250> with<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.880> Sun<00:04:34.120> It's<00:04:34.330> going

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
you're outside with the Sun It's going

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.880 
you're outside with the Sun It's going
to<00:04:34.480> be<00:04:34.540> a<00:04:34.630> soft<00:04:34.870> shadow<00:04:35.140> like<00:04:35.380> these<00:04:35.560> so<00:04:35.740> that's

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
to be a soft shadow like these so that's

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.590 
to be a soft shadow like these so that's
pretty<00:04:36.040> realistic<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:37.150> lines<00:04:37.330> on<00:04:37.480> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
pretty realistic and the lines on the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.030 
pretty realistic and the lines on the
these<00:04:37.930> far<00:04:38.110> rocks<00:04:38.320> are<00:04:38.470> gone<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:38.830> that's

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
these far rocks are gone so that's

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.190 
these far rocks are gone so that's
pretty<00:04:39.190> nice<00:04:39.400> too<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:40.540> next<00:04:40.720> mod<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:40.930> want

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
pretty nice too and the next mod I want

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.230 
pretty nice too and the next mod I want
to<00:04:41.260> mention<00:04:41.410> is<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.770> mod<00:04:42.160> called<00:04:42.190> dual<00:04:42.880> sheath

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
to mention is a mod called dual sheath

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.000 
to mention is a mod called dual sheath
plus<00:04:43.540> shield<00:04:43.840> on<00:04:43.990> back<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.470> this<00:04:44.800> mod

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
plus shield on back and this mod

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.910 
plus shield on back and this mod
essentially<00:04:45.490> adds<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:46.090> new<00:04:46.870> animations<00:04:47.650> or

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
essentially adds a new animations or

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.860 
essentially adds a new animations or
textures<00:04:48.640> or<00:04:48.790> meshes<00:04:49.180> I'm<00:04:49.300> not<00:04:49.420> sure<00:04:49.570> which

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
textures or meshes I'm not sure which

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.590 
textures or meshes I'm not sure which
but<00:04:50.140> it<00:04:50.380> basically<00:04:50.980> just<00:04:51.310> modifies<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.210> so

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
but it basically just modifies it so

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.480 
but it basically just modifies it so
that<00:04:52.750> when<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:52.990> have<00:04:53.170> two<00:04:53.830> weapons<00:04:54.190> in<00:04:54.400> your

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
that when you have two weapons in your

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.490 
that when you have two weapons in your
dual<00:04:54.760> wielding<00:04:55.120> there's<00:04:55.720> two<00:04:56.020> weapons<00:04:56.350> on

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
dual wielding there's two weapons on

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.320 
dual wielding there's two weapons on
your<00:04:56.620> hip<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:56.980> if<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.310> have<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.490> shield<00:04:57.880> this

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
your hip and if you have a shield this

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.640 
your hip and if you have a shield this
shield<00:04:58.390> would<00:04:58.810> be<00:04:58.900> placed<00:04:59.170> on<00:04:59.320> your<00:04:59.410> back

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
shield would be placed on your back

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.490 
shield would be placed on your back
which<00:05:00.520> is<00:05:00.670> pretty<00:05:00.820> sweet<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:02.200> guards

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
which is pretty sweet and the guards

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.470 
which is pretty sweet and the guards
will<00:05:02.590> also<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.890> use<00:05:03.280> this<00:05:03.490> feature<00:05:03.730> anyone

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
will also to use this feature anyone

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.360 
will also to use this feature anyone
that<00:05:04.510> has<00:05:04.810> a<00:05:04.840> shield<00:05:05.170> and<00:05:05.320> if<00:05:05.440> they're<00:05:05.590> not

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
that has a shield and if they're not

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.700 
that has a shield and if they're not
combative<00:05:07.180> state<00:05:07.480> they'll<00:05:08.080> just<00:05:08.380> have<00:05:08.470> the

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
combative state they'll just have the

progress<00:05:24.730> but<00:05:25.090> i<00:05:25.300> would<00:05:25.480> consider<00:05:25.660> this<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:25.960> be

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
progress but i would consider this to be

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.650 
progress but i would consider this to be
pretty<00:05:26.320> essential<00:05:26.650> for<00:05:27.010> i<00:05:27.220> lure<00:05:27.790> purposes<00:05:28.450> or

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
pretty essential for i lure purposes or

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.780 
pretty essential for i lure purposes or
just<00:05:28.840> immersion<00:05:29.380> not<00:05:29.890> so<00:05:30.070> much<00:05:30.190> lower<00:05:30.490> but<00:05:30.730> i

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
just immersion not so much lower but i

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.120 
just immersion not so much lower but i
guess<00:05:31.210> more<00:05:31.420> of<00:05:31.510> like<00:05:31.660> an<00:05:31.780> immersion<00:05:32.140> so<00:05:32.440> but

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
guess more of like an immersion so but

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.380 
guess more of like an immersion so but
anyways<00:05:33.400> i<00:05:33.430> definitely<00:05:33.970> recommend<00:05:34.030> at<00:05:34.360> least

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
anyways i definitely recommend at least

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.230 
anyways i definitely recommend at least
