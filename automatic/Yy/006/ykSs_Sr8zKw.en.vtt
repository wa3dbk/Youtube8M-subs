can<00:04:26.880> see<00:04:27.060> here<00:04:27.409> let's<00:04:28.409> go<00:04:28.560> ahead<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.599> take<00:04:30.599> it

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
can see here let's go ahead and take it

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.209 
can see here let's go ahead and take it
off<00:04:30.870> of<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.200> tree<00:04:31.409> for<00:04:31.650> now<00:04:31.800> we're<00:04:32.070> going<00:04:32.159> to

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:32.219 
off of the tree for now we're going to

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:36.500 
off of the tree for now we're going to
go<00:04:33.150> around<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.320> take<00:04:35.039> off<00:04:35.250> all<00:04:35.490> the

the tabs and whatnot and get it all
cleaned<00:04:38.940> up<00:04:39.090> before<00:04:39.270> we<00:04:39.690> start<00:04:40.260> our<00:04:40.350> bill<00:04:40.590> but

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
cleaned up before we start our bill but

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.530 
cleaned up before we start our bill but
we'll<00:04:40.920> do<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.190> in<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.400> minute<00:04:41.550> let's<00:04:42.390> go<00:04:42.510> ahead

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
we'll do that in a minute let's go ahead

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.560 
we'll do that in a minute let's go ahead
and<00:04:42.750> set<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.050> down<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:44.280> next<00:04:45.000> part<00:04:45.360> that

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
and set that down the next part that

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.830 
and set that down the next part that
we're<00:04:45.690> going<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.990> need<00:04:46.260> is<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:50.300> servo<00:04:51.300> holder

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
we're going to need is the servo holder

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.390 
we're going to need is the servo holder
which<00:04:52.200> is<00:04:52.230> 85<00:04:52.830> 4<00:04:53.700> 04<00:04:54.120> dash<00:04:54.390> 2<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.230> that's<00:04:55.920> this

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
which is 85 4 04 dash 2 and that's this

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.110 
which is 85 4 04 dash 2 and that's this
little<00:04:56.610> section<00:04:56.970> right<00:04:57.180> here<00:04:57.410> which<00:04:58.410> is<00:04:58.650> a

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
little section right here which is a

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.970 
little section right here which is a
rectangular<00:05:00.120> section<00:05:00.810> you<00:05:01.320> do<00:05:01.500> need<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.770> watch

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
rectangular section you do need to watch

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.760 
rectangular section you do need to watch
out<00:05:02.250> because<00:05:02.460> there<00:05:02.880> are<00:05:03.060> other<00:05:03.390> parts<00:05:03.870> that

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
out because there are other parts that

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.230 
out because there are other parts that
are<00:05:04.890> tagged<00:05:05.160> onto<00:05:05.430> here<00:05:05.790> so<00:05:05.910> we're<00:05:06.030> going<00:05:06.120> to

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
are tagged onto here so we're going to

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.780 
are tagged onto here so we're going to
take<00:05:06.450> those<00:05:06.750> off<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.490> we're<00:05:08.490> going<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.640> go

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
ahead and put those back in our bag

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.400 
ahead and put those back in our bag
loose<00:05:10.980> so<00:05:11.370> they<00:05:11.490> don't<00:05:11.610> get<00:05:11.790> lost<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.450> we're

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
loose so they don't get lost and we're

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.830 
loose so they don't get lost and we're
going<00:05:13.530> to<00:05:13.560> go<00:05:13.740> ahead<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.520> remove<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.630> 85<00:05:16.610> 404

going to go ahead and remove the 85 404

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.630 
going to go ahead and remove the 85 404
from<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:18.960> tree<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:19.590> that's<00:05:20.130> what<00:05:20.370> it<00:05:20.460> looks

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
from the tree and that's what it looks

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.130 
from the tree and that's what it looks
like<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.000> again<00:05:21.240> we're<00:05:21.570> going<00:05:21.660> to<00:05:21.750> clean<00:05:21.990> this
