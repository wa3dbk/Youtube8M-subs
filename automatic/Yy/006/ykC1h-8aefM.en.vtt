00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.300 
what it does is it changes the
parameters<00:01:54.320> of<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.530> driving<00:01:54.740> experience<00:01:54.920> of

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
parameters of the driving experience of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.790 
parameters of the driving experience of
the<00:01:55.369> car<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:56.000> just<00:01:56.810> hit<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:56.960> it'll

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
the car so I just hit that it'll

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.080 
the car so I just hit that it'll
actually<00:01:57.979> increase<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:58.610> part<00:01:58.910> to<00:01:59.000> the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
actually increase this part to the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.040 
actually increase this part to the
engine<00:01:59.330> so<00:01:59.450> that's<00:01:59.540> when<00:01:59.720> you're<00:01:59.840> making<00:01:59.960> your

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
engine so that's when you're making your

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.330 
engine so that's when you're making your
full<00:02:00.290> hundred<00:02:00.470> five<00:02:00.800> hundred<00:02:00.830> fifty<00:02:01.100> five

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
full hundred five hundred fifty five

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.610 
full hundred five hundred fifty five
horsepower

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
horsepower

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.940 
horsepower
but<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.550> sport<00:02:05.000> exhaust<00:02:05.120> just<00:02:05.660> sounds<00:02:06.260> mean

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.320 

but<00:04:28.560> again<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:28.830> can't<00:04:28.949> state<00:04:29.490> how<00:04:29.639> powerful

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
but again I can't state how powerful

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.249 
but again I can't state how powerful
this<00:04:30.479> feels<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.990> feels<00:04:31.259> so<00:04:31.740> powerful<00:04:33.169> just<00:04:34.169> to

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
this feels it feels so powerful just to

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.330 
this feels it feels so powerful just to
give<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.410> little<00:04:34.470> taste<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.800> acceleration

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
give you little taste the acceleration

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.950 
give you little taste the acceleration
I'm<00:04:35.430> not<00:04:35.550> gonna<00:04:35.669> really<00:04:35.850> go<00:04:36.389> crazy<00:04:36.419> here<00:04:36.930> but

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
I'm not gonna really go crazy here but

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.570 
I'm not gonna really go crazy here but
I'm<00:04:37.440> gonna<00:04:37.530> put<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.889> M<00:04:38.009> mode<00:04:38.220> I'm<00:04:38.490> gonna

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
I'm gonna put it in the M mode I'm gonna

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.930 
I'm gonna put it in the M mode I'm gonna
drop<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.630> transmission<00:04:40.289> in<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.470> sport<00:04:40.770> mode

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
drop the transmission in the sport mode

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.890 
drop the transmission in the sport mode
so<00:04:41.940> that's<00:04:42.060> gonna<00:04:42.180> allow<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.479> hold<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:42.750> lower

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
so that's gonna allow it to hold a lower

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.870 
so that's gonna allow it to hold a lower
gear<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.650> get<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:43.830> stay<00:04:44.520> at<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.699> power

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
gear so that you get to stay at a power

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.810 
gear so that you get to stay at a power
band<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.870> little<00:04:46.169> bit<00:04:46.259> longer<00:04:46.490> but<00:04:47.490> you'll<00:04:48.479> see

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.409

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
that's basically zero to 60
