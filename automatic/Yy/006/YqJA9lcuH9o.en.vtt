00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.439

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.250

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.200

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.379
 leon it was they come like that in a pot 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.160
 until today I only saw this format, right? 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.250
 There are countless country and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.100
 11 to 10 are with which other side is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.559
 This little country here is the side that the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:02.120
 people are going to put the folio what I have 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:04.040
 This one is beautiful too, in silver 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.200
 holographic 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.830
 I bought them both 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.650
 It's in the hands of KKK, I'm leaving. 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.570
 here underneath the shop and for you 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.580
 apply is necessary the glue is the item 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.189
 that I used for this line were by 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:30.450
 enamel risquÃ© 01 black matte the glue 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:35.610
 bulk was the two prints of Neuer was 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.509
 or a scissors line and an extra gloss 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.700
 hypoallergenic is because he 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.700
 does not have all the components of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.170
 normal nail polish this one is not the dermis 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.210
 or it's just one is super simple then if you 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.329
 You want to learn, keep watching. 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.530
 videos pass two layers of enamel 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:02.420
 Do not wait until dry and start ironing. 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.509
 the appropriate glue for the neal was the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.870
 cool, wait to get well, she's fine 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.370
 transparent 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.110
 then you cut several pieces of the forum 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.180
 with a very dry glue she has to stay 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.270
 transparent are the people 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.940
 You're putting up with a calm is a mistake. 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.470
 It was on your finger nail you can use your 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.570
 creativity 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.780

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.700

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.120
 cool leave the spaces in black 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.990
 also to look like what kind it was 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.230
 stamped on the nail this is the result and 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.800
 to finish we will put more 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.340
 a layer of glue expects to dry well from 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.650
 new it will be transparent and 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.230
 finish with extra brightness passes with 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.040
