in<00:00:02.520> this<00:00:02.669> tutorial<00:00:02.909> I'm<00:00:03.389> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.689> show<00:00:03.870> you

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
in this tutorial I'm going to show you

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.430 
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:06.319> Korea<00:00:07.319> hole<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.370> flat<00:00:08.670> surface<00:00:09.440> in

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
how to Korea hole on a flat surface in

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.759 
how to Korea hole on a flat surface in
Samba<00:00:10.769> 4000<00:00:11.160> or<00:00:11.309> Alice<00:00:11.639> 3<00:00:12.120> 2<00:00:12.269> software<00:00:12.769> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
Samba 4000 or Alice 3 2 software the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.950 
Samba 4000 or Alice 3 2 software the
simplest<00:00:14.429> way<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.910> using<00:00:15.330> bowling

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
simplest way is using bowling

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.689 
simplest way is using bowling
I<00:00:15.990> guess<00:00:16.440> not<00:00:16.650> if<00:00:16.859> people's<00:00:17.220> be<00:00:17.430> using

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
I guess not if people's be using

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.970 
I guess not if people's be using
Boeing's<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.330> create<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.750> hole<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:19.859> you

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
Boeing's to create this hole so if you

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.560 
Boeing's to create this hole so if you
go<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.400> structures<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.180> case<00:00:21.420> you'll

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
go to the structures in this case you'll

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.320 
go to the structures in this case you'll
see<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.320> created<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.130> using<00:00:24.090> any<00:00:24.240> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
see that I just created and using any of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.290 
see that I just created and using any of
the<00:00:24.510> primitive<00:00:24.720> polygons<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> bowling<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the primitive polygons at a bowling and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.710 
the primitive polygons at a bowling and
that's<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.470> ok<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.250> see<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.820> subtract<00:00:30.420> B

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that's it ok you can see a subtract B

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.250 
that's it ok you can see a subtract B
you<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.890> perfectly<00:00:32.550> fit<00:00:32.700> hell<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.630> ok<00:00:34.140> if

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you can to perfectly fit hell here ok if

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620 
you can to perfectly fit hell here ok if
you<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> rendering<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.670> looks<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.239> great

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
you do a rendering it looks very great

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.639 
you do a rendering it looks very great
but<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.500> happened<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.579> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.649> modify

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
but what happened if you want to modify

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.450 
but what happened if you want to modify
or<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.210> want<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.870> add<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.530> high<00:00:44.040> burners

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
or if you want to add a high burners

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.619 
or if you want to add a high burners
okay

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
okay

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.709 
okay
if<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.200> add<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> hive<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> nerves<00:00:49.460> on<00:00:50.460> top<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
if I add the hive a nerves on top of the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.090 
if I add the hive a nerves on top of the
bullying<00:00:53.239> ok<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.140> Salima<00:00:55.770> 40

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
bullying ok so you see that Salima 40

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.139 
bullying ok so you see that Salima 40
will<00:00:56.250> Korean<00:00:56.760> not<00:00:57.030> even<00:00:57.449> necessary<00:00:59.149> service

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
will Korean not even necessary service

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.860 
will Korean not even necessary service
and<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.230> shape<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.039> more<00:01:02.760> than<00:01:02.940> 1<00:01:03.210> okay

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and the shape is not more than 1 okay

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.560 
and the shape is not more than 1 okay
and<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.100> want<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> further<00:01:05.820> modify<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and if I want to further modify this

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.140 
and if I want to further modify this
polygon<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.860> see<00:01:08.100> that's<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.580> serve<00:01:08.880> its

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
polygon you can see that's the serve its

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.899 
polygon you can see that's the serve its
distribution<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.990> not<00:01:10.229> very<00:01:10.560> good<00:01:10.909> examples

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
distribution is not very good examples

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.620 
distribution is not very good examples
for<00:01:11.990> further<00:01:12.990> modification<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.479> I'm

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
for further modification so what I'm

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.840 
for further modification so what I'm
going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.590> I'll<00:01:16.950> show<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.250> another<00:01:17.580> way

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
going to do is I'll show you another way

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
going to do is I'll show you another way
to<00:01:17.880> create<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> perfectly<00:01:19.080> fit<00:01:19.470> polygons<00:01:20.040> that

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to create a perfectly fit polygons that

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
to create a perfectly fit polygons that
auntie<00:01:20.549> modified<00:01:21.090> even<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.780> ever<00:01:22.140> nerves

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
auntie modified even I have ever nerves

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.429 
auntie modified even I have ever nerves
so<00:01:23.310> let's<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.939> part<00:01:24.240> okay<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
so let's see of this part okay so this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
so let's see of this part okay so this
is<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.860> perfectly<00:01:26.670> fit<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.360> come<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:29.420> having

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
is to perfectly fit I come with having

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.359 
is to perfectly fit I come with having
our<00:01:30.540> Sun<00:01:30.810> tables<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.829> will<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
our Sun tables and you will see the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.240 
our Sun tables and you will see the
perfect<00:01:32.729> oh<00:01:33.590> ok<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
perfect oh ok you can see the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.440 
perfect oh ok you can see the
distribution<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> polygon<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> very

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
distribution of the polygon is very

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.080 
distribution of the polygon is very
normalized<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.900> better<00:01:40.259> than<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.280> Eddie<00:01:41.850> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
normalized is better than you Eddie this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.800 
normalized is better than you Eddie this
polygon<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.829> their<00:01:44.159> Paris<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.880> hanussen

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810

Oscar<00:01:46.140> stop<00:01:46.350> granule<00:01:47.250> found<00:01:47.490> start<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
Oscar stop granule found start with the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.590 
Oscar stop granule found start with the
plate<00:01:48.990> ok<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.399> first<00:01:50.610> thing<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.450> need

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
plate ok so the first thing is we need

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.020 
plate ok so the first thing is we need
to<00:01:51.720> define<00:01:52.140> which<00:01:52.409> surface<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.670> want<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
to define which surface we want to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.120 
to define which surface we want to
create<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> hole<00:01:54.630> I'm<00:01:55.409> first<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.799> doesn't

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
create the hole I'm first I'm doesn't

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.899 
create the hole I'm first I'm doesn't
want<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> create<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.360> hole<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> server<00:01:58.140> so

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
want to create a hole in the server so

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.730 
want to create a hole in the server so
the<00:01:59.909> first<00:02:00.210> thing<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.899> need<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> draw

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the first thing is you need to draw

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.830 
the first thing is you need to draw
across

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
across

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.249 
across
okay<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:04.020> need<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> draw<00:02:04.590> two<00:02:05.369> line<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.259> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
okay we need to draw two line and the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.619 
okay we need to draw two line and the
intersection<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> line<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> center

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
intersection of the line is the center

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.960 
intersection of the line is the center
of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> hole<00:02:10.289> ok<00:02:11.099> there

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
of the hole ok there

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.650 
of the hole ok there

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
to create the point you can see the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.160 
to create the point you can see the
perfect<00:03:11.980> place<00:03:12.400> for<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.970> point<00:03:13.240> will<00:03:13.810> be<00:03:14.020> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
perfect place for the point will be the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.699 
perfect place for the point will be the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
halfway of each of the edge so I want to

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.699 
halfway of each of the edge so I want to
I'm<00:03:17.950> going<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.519> create<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:19.090> four<00:03:19.540> points<00:03:20.050> each

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
I'm going to create a four points each

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.910 
I'm going to create a four points each
will<00:03:21.459> be<00:03:21.610> halfway<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.570> each<00:03:23.050> of<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.440> segments

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
will be halfway of each of the segments

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.910 
will be halfway of each of the segments
or<00:03:24.100> each<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.580> edges<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.080> first<00:03:26.350> serve

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
or each of the edges so the first serve

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.880 
or each of the edges so the first serve
at<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.280> edge<00:03:27.519> one<00:03:28.709> two<00:03:29.820> three<00:03:30.820> four<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.780> then

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
at the edge one two three four and then

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.790 
at the edge one two three four and then
since<00:03:32.890> number<00:03:33.070> forty<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.670> can<00:03:33.910> cut<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.600> just<00:03:34.840> a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
since number forty you can cut it just a

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.940 
since number forty you can cut it just a
letter<00:03:35.980> edge<00:03:36.250> using<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.910> edge<00:03:37.330> cut<00:03:37.930> so<00:03:38.709> go<00:03:38.890> to

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
letter edge using a edge cut so go to

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.970 
letter edge using a edge cut so go to
this<00:03:39.430> structure<00:03:39.850> you<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:40.870> see<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.200> edge<00:03:41.470> cut

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
this structure you can see the edge cut

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.150 
this structure you can see the edge cut
the<00:03:42.580> edge<00:03:42.760> cut<00:03:43.269> allow<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:44.320> define<00:03:44.799> and

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
the edge cut allow you to define and

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.550 
the edge cut allow you to define and
offset<00:03:45.820> if<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.209> go<00:03:46.360> Asheville's<00:03:47.049> using

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
offset if you go Asheville's using

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.940 
offset if you go Asheville's using
offset<00:03:47.860> offset<00:03:48.959> fifty<00:03:49.959> percent<00:03:50.260> being<00:03:50.680> you

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
offset offset fifty percent being you

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.910 
offset offset fifty percent being you
cuffed<00:03:51.280> half<00:03:51.610> way<00:03:51.910> if<00:03:52.239> you<00:03:52.930> change<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.590> okay

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
cuffed half way if you change it okay

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.789 
cuffed half way if you change it okay
for<00:03:54.160> sample<00:03:54.700> 30<00:03:54.970> or<00:03:55.239> 70<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.170> will<00:03:56.200> see<00:03:56.560> the

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
for sample 30 or 70 you will see the

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.680 
for sample 30 or 70 you will see the
bone<00:03:57.370> will<00:03:58.120> close<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.290> left<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.709> alright

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
bone will close to the left and alright

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.479 
bone will close to the left and alright
so<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.720> kept<00:04:02.019> at<00:04:02.140> 50%<00:04:02.680> because<00:04:03.100> I'm<00:04:03.250> going<00:04:03.370> to

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
so I kept at 50% because I'm going to

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.060 
so I kept at 50% because I'm going to
cut<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.820> halfway<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:05.549> apply<00:04:06.930> okay<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.560> nothing

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
cut it halfway and apply okay so nothing

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.460 
cut it halfway and apply okay so nothing
happened<00:04:09.790> but<00:04:09.940> if<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.269> changed<00:04:10.810> upon<00:04:11.230> though

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
happened but if you changed upon though

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.860 
happened but if you changed upon though
you<00:04:11.680> see<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.519> nobody<00:04:12.910> will<00:04:13.060> cut<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.630> edge

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
you see that so nobody will cut the edge

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.520 
you see that so nobody will cut the edge
and<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:15.040> plan<00:04:15.610> for<00:04:15.640> me<00:04:15.970> okay<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:16.840> here<00:04:17.169> I<00:04:17.200> have<00:04:17.380> a

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
and a plan for me okay so here I have a

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.940 
and a plan for me okay so here I have a
formal<00:04:18.130> point<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.669> can<00:04:19.060> create<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:20.049> diamond

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
formal point I can create the diamond

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.969 
formal point I can create the diamond
shape<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.390> great<00:04:22.690> diamond<00:04:23.050> shakes<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.620> need

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
shape so the great diamond shakes I need

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.800 
shape so the great diamond shakes I need
to<00:04:24.160> draw<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.700> new<00:04:24.880> edge

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
to draw a new edge

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.700 
to draw a new edge
the<00:04:26.260> fast<00:04:26.560> way<00:04:27.040> is<00:04:27.370> using<00:04:27.880> knife<00:04:28.540> you<00:04:29.290> can't<00:04:29.590> go

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
the fast way is using knife you can't go

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.130 
the fast way is using knife you can't go
to<00:04:29.770> structures<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.670> I<00:04:31.240> bought<00:04:31.450> knife

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.980 
sure you are on the line no okay so you
can<00:04:39.910> then<00:04:40.630> draw<00:04:41.730> from<00:04:42.730> one<00:04:43.030> ton<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.840> you

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
can then draw from one ton to you

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.980 
can then draw from one ton to you
unimportant<00:04:44.950> okay<00:04:45.310> here<00:04:45.870> here<00:04:47.190> here<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:48.370> here

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
unimportant okay here here here and here

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.370 
unimportant okay here here here and here
and<00:04:49.990> then<00:04:50.980> I<00:04:51.310> would<00:04:51.670> create<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.240> diamond<00:04:52.960> shape

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
and then I would create a diamond shape

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.070 
and then I would create a diamond shape
okay<00:04:54.160> what's<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.490> for<00:04:54.910> this<00:04:55.690> will<00:04:55.930> be<00:04:56.020> the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
okay what's that for this will be the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.520 
okay what's that for this will be the
hole<00:04:56.260> okay<00:04:56.800> but<00:04:57.340> of<00:04:57.460> course<00:04:57.760> use<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:58.450> I<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:59.110> won

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
hole okay but of course use the I I won

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.030 
hole okay but of course use the I I won
a<00:04:59.560> very<00:04:59.980> grand<00:05:00.910> ho<00:05:01.630> but<00:05:02.050> in<00:05:02.230> this<00:05:02.440> case<00:05:02.710> if<00:05:02.950> you

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
a very grand ho but in this case if you

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.370 
a very grand ho but in this case if you
using<00:05:03.250> harmonized<00:05:03.960> automatically<00:05:04.960> change<00:05:05.290> to

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
using harmonized automatically change to

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.310 
using harmonized automatically change to
cycle<00:05:06.040> okay<00:05:06.850> so<00:05:06.910> remember<00:05:07.180> this<00:05:07.600> is<00:05:07.660> important

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
cycle okay so remember this is important

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.740 
cycle okay so remember this is important
concept<00:05:08.890> if<00:05:09.040> you<00:05:09.160> using<00:05:09.490> have<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.820> NURBS<00:05:10.150> you

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
concept if you using have a NURBS you

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.890 
concept if you using have a NURBS you
just<00:05:11.080> need<00:05:11.350> four<00:05:11.800> side<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:13.000> create<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.390> perfect

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
just need four side to create a perfect

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.880 
just need four side to create a perfect
circle<00:05:14.200> okay<00:05:15.190> so<00:05:15.250> what<00:05:15.610> does<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.480> mean<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:17.860> I

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
circle okay so what does that mean so I

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.480 
circle okay so what does that mean so I
slap<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.720> surface<00:05:19.720> first<00:05:20.110> okay<00:05:21.010> make<00:05:21.250> sure<00:05:21.280> I

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
slap the surface first okay make sure I

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.740 
slap the surface first okay make sure I
am<00:05:21.940> able<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:23.070> service<00:05:24.070> okay<00:05:24.940> one<00:05:25.570> two<00:05:26.080> three<00:05:26.410> or

okay I just let to force service and I

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.750 
okay I just let to force service and I
press<00:05:32.229> I<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:33.910> tray<00:05:34.620> ignorant<00:05:35.620> it's<00:05:35.800> true<00:05:36.160> okay

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
press I to tray ignorant it's true okay

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.820

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
you can to it or it or that but if you

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.820 
you can to it or it or that but if you
put<00:05:52.419> back<00:05:52.660> where<00:05:52.900> you<00:05:53.050> can<00:05:53.229> already<00:05:53.380> create<00:05:53.680> a

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
put back where you can already create a

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.260 
put back where you can already create a
whole<00:05:54.070> but<00:05:54.700> actually<00:05:55.090> you<00:05:55.210> see<00:05:55.390> that<00:05:55.570> I<00:05:55.810> have<00:05:56.770> a

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.840 
whole but actually you see that I have a
this<00:05:58.270> shape<00:05:58.540> okay<00:05:59.410> so<00:05:59.800> what<00:06:00.010> happened<00:06:00.550> if<00:06:00.669> I

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
this shape okay so what happened if I

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.230 
this shape okay so what happened if I
add<00:06:01.090> a<00:06:01.120> high<00:06:01.419> one<00:06:01.540> arms<00:06:02.490> right<00:06:03.490> so<00:06:03.760> you<00:06:03.820> can<00:06:04.030> see

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
add a high one arms right so you can see

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.850 
add a high one arms right so you can see
that<00:06:04.390> depart<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:04.930> hypernurbs

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
that depart and hypernurbs

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.540 
that depart and hypernurbs
I<00:06:06.120> already<00:06:07.120> create<00:06:07.690> a<00:06:07.900> hole<00:06:08.350> okay<00:06:09.280> so<00:06:09.340> of

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
I already create a hole okay so of

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.219 
I already create a hole okay so of
course<00:06:09.790> if<00:06:09.940> you<00:06:10.060> do<00:06:10.240> a<00:06:10.270> rendering<00:06:10.720> you<00:06:10.990> still

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
course if you do a rendering you still

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.710 
course if you do a rendering you still
have<00:06:11.440> some<00:06:11.710> side<00:06:11.979> here<00:06:12.310> but<00:06:12.790> you<00:06:12.970> can<00:06:13.150> increase

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
have some side here but you can increase

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.300 
have some side here but you can increase
the<00:06:14.620> hardness

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
the hardness

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
the hardness
subdivision<00:06:16.300> at<00:06:17.070> setting<00:06:18.070> if<00:06:18.310> they<00:06:18.490> increased

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
subdivision at setting if they increased

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.620 
subdivision at setting if they increased
to<00:06:19.660> three<00:06:19.960> it's<00:06:20.620> more<00:06:20.950> likely<00:06:21.310> one<00:06:22.150> if<00:06:22.479> you

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
to three it's more likely one if you

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.219 
to three it's more likely one if you
increase<00:06:23.020> more<00:06:23.380> of<00:06:23.740> course<00:06:24.070> you<00:06:24.580> see<00:06:24.910> that<00:06:25.229> to

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
increase more of course you see that to

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.010 
increase more of course you see that to
shake<00:06:26.470> your<00:06:26.650> piece<00:06:26.860> runner<00:06:27.580> okay<00:06:28.390> so<00:06:28.450> this<00:06:28.840> is

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
shake your piece runner okay so this is

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.210 
shake your piece runner okay so this is
the<00:06:29.680> perfect<00:06:30.040> way<00:06:30.430> better<00:06:30.910> than<00:06:31.630> using<00:06:32.220> going

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
the perfect way better than using going

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.420 
the perfect way better than using going
to<00:06:33.550> create<00:06:33.940> the<00:06:34.570> hole<00:06:35.169> on<00:06:35.470> the<00:06:35.620> surface<00:06:36.099> in

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
to create the hole on the surface in

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.220 
to create the hole on the surface in
case<00:06:36.760> for<00:06:37.180> seunga's<00:06:37.390> I<00:06:37.690> can<00:06:37.900> make<00:06:38.050> it

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230
