00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.230
 a 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.290
 3 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.290
 3 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.300
 in the house 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.730
 people welcome to the next 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.150
 league of the week here are back to the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.440
 speed view from afar tonic part 2 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.050
 today more a bit more modern so 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.130
 concludes moderately while he looks the same 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 from any other guitarist 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.280
 jazz blues rock metal area hears the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.890
 idea is he just look at us 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.930
 what I have done 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.180
 we are that 1 h minor that is 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.410
 our our beloved home zone finger 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.210
 sentence in the seventh bunch and actually is 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.920
 it less league than just the sequence 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.360
 you push through the scales that makes you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.300
 it's pretty easy you need 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.360
 actually only this one you need 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.830
 only the figure and the figure consists of 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.540
 three steps so you always play 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 three notes 123 down and then catch 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.060
 her on the next note at three 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.540
 minutes to play is so first 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.660
 three tones 123 then from the top tone 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.780
 next sound and it goes through the whole 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.780
 scale 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.229
 you can do it in 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.970
 practice these three parcels like me now 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:07.840
 have not connected so connect 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:09.130
 just I want here is try 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.739
 with the right hand always in exchange 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.270
 to stay so no none 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.270
 double down to the up beats 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.410
 as I said, if you make that clear 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.209
 that it's just a fig here through 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.950
 The scale effects will be very easy because 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.239
 you just have to do this movement 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.590
 exercise and then you repeat that 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.590
 each on the next two pages 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.670
 only three sequence so next exercised 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.650
 the best because you have a chance 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.530
 patrick is and will be played accurately 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.140
 there must exist with metronom 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.600
 that you play three tones per click so 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.290
 beautifully ordered your nice because we too 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:20.270
 So a 3 sequence would have been now 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:22.160
 It also offers a bit 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.900
 interesting to do if you the 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.660
 figure once under the fingers and have 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.200
 then you can play the figure in 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.710
 16 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:47.360
 that means beat and now always 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:49.190
 four notes profit so the idea is cool 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.630
 because it's not that rhythmic 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.970
 easy to see through that makes it happen 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.760
 a bit more interesting and now 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.000
 a little idea what speed is concerned when 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.050
 At least we pick all the notes 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.550
 harder for me 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.680
 build speed than when I 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.740
 install post and hennings 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.610
 a farmer in the case I need two 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.350
 be on pole 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.350
 I connect the first two tones 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.670
 So the last two are always full 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.740
 on the side 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.740
 then daily the two the next 3 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.320
 but it is important that he is the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.870
 attack 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.160
 the sounds stop in the direction like 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.780
 you would also play if you were 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.580
 all stop so not now 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.620
 changes strike from the tone to do 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.440
 but when your pool plays on note 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.440
 have you blown up in the air? 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.050
 his right hand always runs through and 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.720
 I could also if I wanted if I wanted 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.700
 alternate with legate techniques then 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.320
 again all pages strike all the notes 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.560
 because my hand stays always in the 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.560
 water 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.250
 that makes it easy to just make it easy 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.660
 not it but it does a lot 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.010
 clear because you just need 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.010
 this little mini movement 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.810
 You have to do that so that the 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.070
 Hands automatically run then you can 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.770
 send the thing through and just 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.660
 has a cool speedlink but stressful 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.710
 not with the whole thing 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.240
 speed it really build 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.660
 a matter that takes a long time 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.790
 the movement has thousands 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.770
 Millions of times until I repeat everything 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.150
 automated has reached the 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.270
 best if you really tilts slowly 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.400
 practice slowly and absolutely the movement 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.200
 control when exercising so fast now 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.670
 then comes sometime in the course of the movement 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.650
 do not just serve the control and 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.480
 then it brings practice so nothing so synonymous 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.850
 sounds like a paradox but slowly practices 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.450
 to become fast okay people have fun 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.450
 with the way
