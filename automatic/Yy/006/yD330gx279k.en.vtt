yeah I'll focus in automatically as you
can<00:02:24.780> see<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.160> then<00:02:26.160> when<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.340> click<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
can see like that then when I click the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.000 
can see like that then when I click the
picture<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.690> take<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.230> very<00:02:28.500> simple<00:02:28.740> in

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
picture is take it's a very simple in

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.920 
picture is take it's a very simple in
comparison<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.640> for<00:02:29.760> example<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.150> HTC<00:02:30.690> Zoe

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930

comparison to for example the HTC Zoe
capabilities<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> HTC<00:02:32.550> one<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
capabilities on the HTC one of the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.510 
capabilities on the HTC one of the
multiple<00:02:33.180> modes<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.170> galaxy<00:02:34.980> s4<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.460> if

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
multiple modes on the galaxy s4 so if

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.710 
multiple modes on the galaxy s4 so if
camera<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:35.940> very<00:02:36.090> important<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.630> the
