 prescribe the entire startup program 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:05.250
 Absolutely all starting from the base set 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.820
 what kind of webinars to do when 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.610
 need to do on each of these webinars 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:17.040

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.009

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:29.310
 absolutely all this is all in one day 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.659
 and my situation is such that not 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.240
 I'm launching right now 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.840
 doing a run 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.930
 and I do now completed yet, and vice versa 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.390
 I understood what mistakes I made during 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.970
 of this launch and on 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.810
 here today on this day for me 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.700
 errors showed me told that I 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.590
 did wrong how to do the next 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.800
 once and most importantly how do i fix that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.430
 a situation that just happened now 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.259
 there is a huge amount of information 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.259
 useful information only on the case 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.479
 understands everything and generally in general 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.989
 Andrei Parabellum He works very 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.020
 cool he gives very strong results 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.100
 he gives very strong content he gives 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:27.959
 very useful and practical information 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:31.000
 and if someone speaks and someone writes there 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.820
 records video about Andrei 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.850
 parabellumu nifiga does not give on type 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.040
 Only motivation gives yes she this 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.700
 motivation is not going anywhere so want 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.830
 say directly or want to say maybe 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.100
 yes it is in this case not even rude 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.459
 because if someone says so if 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.799
 someone says so then this pizdezh itself 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.880
 real pizdezh and without contentment because 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.760
 that in fact it is not so if Andrei 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.549
