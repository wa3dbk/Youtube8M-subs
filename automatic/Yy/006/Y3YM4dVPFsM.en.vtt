00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.889
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.290
 welcome to the second part of how 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.600
 install the ubuntu operating system 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.240
 ok now what we have to do in 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.440
 this second part already previously 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.740
 downloaded the image and previously 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.290
 have burned it on an usb or on a cd 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.350
 what we are going to do is turn around 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.420
 from the bios to start with the 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.540
 new operating system and so we can 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.540
 install connect the usb memory 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.610
 already once we have connected our 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.970
 usb memory, what we are going to do is 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.960
 restart our computer here we go 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.480
 to restart and let's start now with the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.210
 usb memory integrated in our 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.940
 computer we're going to type between 12 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.970
 depending on the brand in this case it is 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.590
 blue then it depends on the brand that 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.690
 have on the computer 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.620
 and here what we have to do is 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.590
 select our usb memory and give it 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.929
 enter 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.929
 and here is already loading our point 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.929
 15.04 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.640
 and here as we can see gives us the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.850
 welcome and what it gives us to choose 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.450
 it is the language and here if we want 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.580
 try or once install our 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.740
 operating system we are going to 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.440
 give in install and here it is 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.470
 configuring our profile simply 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.030
 let's give it continue and simply 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 we install now 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.140
 let's continue and this is where the 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.240
 configuration where we are 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.580
 We give you the country where we are 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.310
 we give you continue here in the same way 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.740
 to the keyboard configuration 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.640
 simply then select the one 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.400
 you want and then give in 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.520
 continue here a username on 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.190
 profile let's put him master and good 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.950
 Well, the password is just going 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.910
 to put 1 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.850
 and we continue 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.760
 and here you are already installing could you 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.740
 say the ubuntu operating system 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.560
 It should be noted that this operating system 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.680
 it does not come with a virus so it's not 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.290
 necessary to install some antivirus 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.260
 since it does not exist until now 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.080
 some virus for a world and well then 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.020
 here it simply asks us to restart 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.730
 our computer we are going to restart the 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.220
 and well then once it has 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.290
 rebooted then already asks us to 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.110
 let's login write the password 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.570
 that we had previously configured 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.240
 before and well then it will start loading 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.410
 our profile and our entire system 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.030
 operative and good because here already it gives us the 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.180
 welcome that is the operating system 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.180
 from ubuntu this is how is the appearance 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.640
 the programs are preloaded here 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.120
 that are compatible here until the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.090

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.880

 ubuntu operating system here up 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.060

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.760
 parcel already to be able to write 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.310
 calculations of how power point appeared 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.980
 the configurations here we can 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.049
 customize our desktop as 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.780
