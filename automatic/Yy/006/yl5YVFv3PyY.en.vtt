00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 the reason for meeting with ford s-max was 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.540
 the recent update of its 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.480
 touching both looks and 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.940
 internal content ford s-max and so 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.549
 did not suffer from a lack of sportiness but 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.250
 designers decided that you can still slightly 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.859
 it is a little more apparent 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.210
 in size grille 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.660
 led strip daytime lights 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.910
 bumper 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.910
 brighter and more expressive rear 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.730
 lamps from external innovations is all 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.529
 but enough to understand the move before 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.660
 us updated generation 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.270
 but under the hood of the old motor 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.170
 generating aspirated in 2 and 3 liters 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.149
 capacity of 160 one horsepower and 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 transmission five - speed traditional 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.739
 machine though ford s-max 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.480
 available with new generation stuffing 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.469
 two-liter turbo engine 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.579
 ecoboost capacity of 203 h1 and body and 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.219
 6-speed robotic box 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.649
 powershift gear but we will evaluate it 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.050
 another time for now see what's new in 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.969
 the interior of the press release claim that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.670
 finishing materials have changed 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.650
 although before ford s-max was difficult 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.170
 show something in this respect all 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.010
 very solid and pleasant to eyesight and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.740
 tactile 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.090
 up from ergonomics complete order especially 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.159
 we like onboard control 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.250
 computer using four 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.540
 steering wheel button 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 computer readings are displayed on 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.110
 large color display occupying space 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.420
 on the dashboard 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 cabin appeared additional compartments 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.280
 for little things though it was a sin 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.579
 complain about their absence ford s-max 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.340
 still offered 5 or 7 seater 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.070
 option in the second case, the chair 3 rows 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.380
 hiding in the underground trunk passengers 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.710
 middle class comfort is not deprived 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.210
 they are three separately adjustable chair 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.399
 extra water air in the backside 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.170
 front seats folding tables 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.020
 ford s-max can be converted from 5 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.210
 local to a 7 seater family car 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.909
 but it's not easy 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.909
 first fold it back then 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.909
 raise 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.680
 back and if you have long arms then you 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.260
 reach out 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:19.860
 from the trunk and if the arms are short 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.460
 you have to get into the salon and that's it 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.870
 here's the way to turn the chair cushion 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.210
 trunk transformation capabilities 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.040
 wide and its size varies from 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.130
 two hundred eighty five liters in 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.110
 seven-seater option is 2100 liters at 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.510
 the folded backs of the second and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.390
 third row key on start 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.250
 that is, our Ford C -Max button is equipped 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.620
 contactless access system and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.660
 start the engine and it's nice that 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.150
 start button does not need to hold 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.730
 and just poke her finger 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.820
 sound insulation of the engine compartment is good 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.010
 engine noise and 2 penetrates salon yes and 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.130
 with intensive acceleration does not put pressure on the ears 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.470
 passengers oh what a tasty highway 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.540
 created for crush engineers even in 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.490
 extremely civilian regimes so 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.890
 nice to feel distinctly and reactive 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.239
 the steering wheel effort is clear and 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.070
 unambiguous reactions 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.890
 minimum rolls turning and 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.110
 at the same time you want a comfortable suspension 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.220
 go on and when hot sit for 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.950
 wheel ford s-max 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.620
 the first thought is that yes probably 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.269
 it would be nice to wear racing 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.819
 overalls 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.640
 special racing 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.180
 shoes and only then go to 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.670
 road because feeling on 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.530
 driver's place just such that here 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.019
 he should go 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.420
 although with an engine of 2 and 3 liters 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.599
 five-speed automatic it's just 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.000
 cool family car for 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.290
 long journeys to travel around 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.040
 the city 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.900
 one or the whole family suitable 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.180
 option but if you want to feel 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.150
 all the beauty 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.639
 chassis with max is better of course 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.909
 look at the version with turbo 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:09.359
 engines or with powerful diesel engines 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.069
 although I repeat here is a combination of atmospheric 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.769
 gasoline engine and five-speed 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.930
 automatic ford s-max perfectly performs 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.599
 this function which in principle should 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.250
 this is a comfortable family car 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.199
 by the way the second thought that arises 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.099
 after a few kilometers behind the wheel 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.320
 ford s-max 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.660
 it would wave now on it 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.580
 fly away 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.159
 German autobahns at prohvatit 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.500
 serpentine monte carlo and then smoothly and 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.740
 imposingly patrol along the promenade down 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.110
 and 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.419
 not a Belarusian dream at all 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.669
 come down from heaven to earth and wait 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.500
 meeting with a 2-liter turbocharged port 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.960
 with mother and robotic box 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.960
 gear then there must be a little thing
