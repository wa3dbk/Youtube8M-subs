to<00:00:50.030> chemistry<00:00:50.300> sometimes<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:50.960> can<00:00:51.079> hate

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
to chemistry sometimes you can hate

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.840 
to chemistry sometimes you can hate
someone<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:51.859> have<00:00:52.010> wonderful<00:00:52.160> chemistry

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
someone and have wonderful chemistry

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.400 
someone and have wonderful chemistry
what<00:00:53.030> with<00:00:53.239> them<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:53.719> can<00:00:53.899> love<00:00:54.079> someone<00:00:54.289> and

not you know so it wasn't until we sat
down<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.430> actually<00:00:59.300> did<00:00:59.539> the<00:00:59.660> table<00:01:00.050> read

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
down and actually did the table read

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.549 
down and actually did the table read
when<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.859> voices<00:01:01.609> just<00:01:01.640> all<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:02.420> whatever<00:01:03.320> it

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559

is<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:04.100> there<00:01:04.220> was<00:01:04.339> chemistry<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.059> was

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
is and there was chemistry and it was

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:06.580 
is and there was chemistry and it was
just<00:01:05.420> it's<00:01:05.840> just<00:01:05.990> magic

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590

chemistry from the Golden Girls
you<00:01:25.009> know<00:01:25.130> Betty<00:01:25.340> knows<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.790> from<00:01:26.030> Frasier

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
you know Betty knows that from Frasier

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.270 
you know Betty knows that from Frasier
from<00:01:26.659> Cheers<00:01:27.140> that's<00:01:27.619> what<00:01:27.829> makes<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.070> show

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
from Cheers that's what makes a show

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.310 
from Cheers that's what makes a show
it's<00:01:28.610> not<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.970> concept<00:01:29.479> it's<00:01:29.750> not<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
it's not the concept it's not it's the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.710 
it's not the concept it's not it's the
chemistry<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.880> what<00:01:32.000> are<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:32.270> like<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.450> hundred

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
chemistry so what are you like a hundred

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.480 
chemistry so what are you like a hundred
I<00:01:34.240> don't<00:01:35.240> like<00:01:35.540> you

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
I don't like you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.929 
I don't like you
I<00:01:37.549> do<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:38.840> girl<00:01:39.140> from<00:01:39.409> that<00:01:39.470> show<00:01:40.009> yes<00:01:40.490> yes<00:01:40.790> I

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
I do that girl from that show yes yes I

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.520 
I do that girl from that show yes yes I
am<00:01:41.119> are<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:41.899> fan

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
am are you a fan

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.130 
am are you a fan
no<00:01:45.790> there's<00:01:46.790> nothing<00:01:47.090> better<00:01:47.509> than<00:01:47.960> this

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
no there's nothing better than this

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.200 
no there's nothing better than this
format<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.770> think<00:01:49.070> four<00:01:49.310> cameras<00:01:49.729> live<00:01:50.030> in

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
format I think four cameras live in

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.880 
format I think four cameras live in
front<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.479> studio<00:01:50.689> audience<00:01:50.780> is<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.710> way<00:01:51.830> to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
front of a studio audience is the way to

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.410 
front of a studio audience is the way to
go<00:01:52.130> for<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.399> show<00:01:52.579> like<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:52.970> there's<00:01:53.270> an

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
go for a show like this there's an

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.300 
go for a show like this there's an
energy<00:01:53.899> that<00:01:54.049> happens<00:01:54.439> when<00:01:55.039> there's<00:01:55.130> an

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
energy that happens when there's an

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.270 
energy that happens when there's an
audience<00:01:55.580> there<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.289> hearing<00:01:58.009> you

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
audience there and and and hearing you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.429 
audience there and and and hearing you
and<00:01:58.310> laughing<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.240> loving<00:01:59.720> your<00:01:59.990> character
