00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 tells stories deaf athlete crowd gives 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.120
 sport and today works will begin in the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.490
 youtube 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.500
 So you did some maneuvering that I know 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.559
 It's hard to send 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.190
 to start today or 360 flip 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.230
 outside the gringa called flip around 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.990
 world calls quique 36 flip too 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.840
 several names do not care about it she 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.630
 is very important because it is a test 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.830
 practice differentiates people from whom 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.590
 is starting for those who already know a 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.009
 Little is the mangrove area game 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.009
 check it out 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.510
 Yes, yes. 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.780
 then it is the operation of the pecnordeste 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.000
 on the flip here a good sketch so that 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.089
 You can not flip a lot. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.930
 strong only suitable for driving a foot 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.560
 behind 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.380
 even out off the skateboard as if 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.540
 application in order to dudu that as if it 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.330
 would have felt marginal 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:22.790
 it will kick weak to strong but a 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.820
 moment that makes perfect then 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.680
 put it out to pat and 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.630
 when the back foot hit him have that 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.450
 position but a mistake if you hurt your foot 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.050
 front of light just to rotate it goes 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.970
 and so it's very common for you to 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.259
 can not be in cash so 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.899
 stay like this 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:49.670
 This is a mistake the other one is going to stay like this. 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.860
 cousin call or drawing is not 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.950
 very cool hurts and runs off a little the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.100
 screws for you to hit right 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.420
 have to do both at the same time a 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.440
 chutÃ£o Chicao 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.780
 So when it hit and it will stay and 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.789
 will wait forward will return to that 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.970
 can get a screw 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.360
 He's going to do it here. 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.550
 front foot chica he will come back and take it 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.410
 It's very complicated but I started to 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.220
 difficult because you do not yet have 360 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.750
 they vary 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.080
 so this is what I recommend you 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.080
 trains a lot 37 60 varial and the flip
