00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
portion is the softer foam and as you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.889 
portion is the softer foam and as you
transition<00:00:46.680> when<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.460> run<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.940> roll<00:00:48.329> over<00:00:48.360> to

the medial side or the inside you have

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200 
the medial side or the inside you have
the<00:00:51.809> largest<00:00:52.250> portion<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> firmer<00:00:53.910> foam

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
think about a ball rolling down a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.610 
think about a ball rolling down a
decline<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.629> rolling<00:00:58.020> back<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.500> an

decline and then rolling back up an
incline<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.340> slow<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.699> down<00:00:59.780> this<00:01:00.780> wedge<00:01:01.020> works

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
incline to slow it down this wedge works

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.670 
incline to slow it down this wedge works
like<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.730> design<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.480> carrier<00:01:04.320> has

like that the design of the carrier has

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.250 
like that the design of the carrier has
these<00:01:04.949> long<00:01:05.220> horizontal<00:01:05.880> lines<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.049> think

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
these long horizontal lines if you think

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380 
these long horizontal lines if you think
about<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.770> bellows<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.700> these<00:01:08.820> lines<00:01:09.119> would

about a bellows all of these lines would

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
about a bellows all of these lines would
compress<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.260> down<00:01:10.409> exactly<00:01:11.310> how<00:01:11.430> they

the lunar lon think of it kind of like a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.010 
the lunar lon think of it kind of like a
trampoline<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.150> structure<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.900> the

of the most significant changes or

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.310 
of the most significant changes or
features<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.420> brought<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> think

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
features we brought in if you think

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.039 
features we brought in if you think
about<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.130> sit<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> sling<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.689> really

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
about when you sit in a sling it really

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.410 
about when you sit in a sling it really
kind<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.350> wraps<00:02:01.649> underneath<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.759> pulls

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
kind of wraps underneath you and pulls

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
kind of wraps underneath you and pulls
under<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.469> works<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> same<00:02:05.189> way

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
under and up this works in the same way

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.340 
under and up this works in the same way
so<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.450> pull<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.930> you're<00:02:07.140> actually

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
so when you pull on this you're actually

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.100 
so when you pull on this you're actually
pulling

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
pulling

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.730 
pulling
under<00:02:08.740> your<00:02:08.890> foot<00:02:09.479> supporting<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.710> instead<00:02:11.710> of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
under your foot supporting it instead of

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.110 
under your foot supporting it instead of
from<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.220> side<00:02:12.490> only<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:15.280> designed<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.910> sock

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
from the side only we designed the sock

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.120 
from the side only we designed the sock
liner<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.660> work<00:02:16.870> with<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.350> strap<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.680> we<00:02:17.980> did

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
liner to work with the strap and we did

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.710 
liner to work with the strap and we did
it<00:02:18.220> by<00:02:18.250> putting<00:02:18.640> these<00:02:18.850> grooves<00:02:19.210> into<00:02:19.630> the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
it by putting these grooves into the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.020 
it by putting these grooves into the
bottom<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.680> could<00:02:20.830> actually

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
bottom of it so that it could actually

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.910 
bottom of it so that it could actually
conform<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.420> kind<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:22.690> bend<00:02:22.990> around<00:02:23.260> your

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
conform and kind of bend around your

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.030 
conform and kind of bend around your
arch<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.450> heel<00:02:25.660> clip<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.530> offers

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
arch this is the heel clip that offers

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.070 
arch this is the heel clip that offers
support<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.700> stability<00:02:27.850> but<00:02:28.510> still<00:02:28.810> allows

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
support and stability but still allows

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.750

your<00:02:29.290> foot<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.650> move<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.100> really<00:02:30.550> natural
