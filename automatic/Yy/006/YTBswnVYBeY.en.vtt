 m 2 stand there 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.069
 although rkc lost 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.330
 insurers 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
 then there are to 7 though 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.360
 it's a good one 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
 as it is now the easiest way 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.030
 the change of the 3 but she gets her way from the word 3 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.540

 herein we think we have the best 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.380
 what nonsense 2 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.380
 the woman and mother were still surrounded by her seventh week 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 This nonsense the pursuit is a high one 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.550
 life 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.610
 the back to my opinion was that the profit in the base 3 you have 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 munsterman 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.149
 also very easy 11 you have it 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.810
 in the U.S 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.320

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.350
 in their own words 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.270
 for the crude oil is 9 and then go look 3 8 7 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.280
 I am going to this forum 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.290
 I had a little bit 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.290
 I can't actually handle it after a further weakening 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.020
 more than enough 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.180
 more than one 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.179
 we pick up and 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.799
 a real one 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.769

 dr 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.619
 unfortunately that was me 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:31.629
 d 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.819
 az says the audi a8 he may not be surprising it was fairly easy 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.299
 with these 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.729
 but I was lucky to mobilize the region 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.869
 governor 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.219
 for class today 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.750
 So seeing it here is great fun 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.880

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.150
