it being a nice round figure and to but
can't<00:00:40.170> believe<00:00:40.469> there's<00:00:40.680> 200<00:00:41.070> people<00:00:41.100> who

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
can't believe there's 200 people who

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
can't believe there's 200 people who
watch<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> drivel<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.870> crap<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.710> come

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
watch the drivel and crap that I come

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.190 
watch the drivel and crap that I come
out<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.420> obviously<00:00:45.420> there<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:45.960> thought

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
out with obviously there is all thought

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
out with obviously there is all thought
like<00:00:46.410> gotta<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> thread<00:00:47.460> gotta<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
like gotta do a thread gotta do a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:59.480 
like gotta do a thread gotta do a
competition<00:00:48.360> um<00:00:49.610> by<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> proof

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.380 

so<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.130> yet<00:01:02.130> competition<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.060> only<00:01:03.180> problem

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
so and yet competition the only problem

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.330 
so and yet competition the only problem
is<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.960> community's<00:01:04.530> been<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.890> some

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
is that one community's been going some

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.490 
is that one community's been going some
time<00:01:05.610> now<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> best<00:01:06.840> questions<00:01:07.320> are

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
time now and all the best questions are

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.890 
time now and all the best questions are
gone<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.070> racked<00:01:08.400> my<00:01:08.490> brains<00:01:08.970> over<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.870> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
gone and I racked my brains over what I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.310 
gone and I racked my brains over what I
could<00:01:10.260> ask<00:01:10.890> people<00:01:11.690> but<00:01:12.690> there<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.260> few

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
could ask people but there are a few

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.470 
could ask people but there are a few
things<00:01:13.860> well<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.580> came<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.150> about<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.390> dozen

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
things well I came up with about a dozen

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.980 
things well I came up with about a dozen
and<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.530> far<00:01:16.800> too<00:01:16.830> many<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.930> there's<00:01:18.930> four

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and that's far too many so there's four

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.920 
and that's far too many so there's four
questions<00:01:20.090> but<00:01:21.090> they'll<00:01:21.270> rip<00:01:21.480> I<00:01:21.660> think

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
questions but they'll rip I think

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.190 
questions but they'll rip I think
they're<00:01:22.050> real<00:01:22.230> quick<00:01:22.500> answers<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.480> but<00:01:24.480> there

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
they're real quick answers so but there

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.620 
they're real quick answers so but there
will<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.440> prize<00:01:25.710> I'll<00:01:26.010> do<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.060> most<00:01:27.210> people

question I'm going to answer him as well

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.670 
question I'm going to answer him as well
at<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.950> same<00:01:53.010> time<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:55.260> first<00:01:55.470> question

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
at the same time and the first question

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.320 
at the same time and the first question
is<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.190> record<00:01:56.610> would<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.940> like<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.300> your

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
is what record would you like in your

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.450 
is what record would you like in your
collection<00:01:57.660> but<00:01:58.410> you<00:01:58.530> would<00:01:58.650> not<00:01:58.830> bali<00:01:59.160> on

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
collection but you would not bali on

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.090 
collection but you would not bali on
principle<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.350> reason<00:02:01.650> this<00:02:01.710> question

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
principle and the reason this question

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.660 
principle and the reason this question
came<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.760> some<00:02:03.470> on<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.530> fan<00:02:05.039> of<00:02:05.250> Pink

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
came about is some on a fan of Pink

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.029 
came about is some on a fan of Pink
Floyd's<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> new<00:02:06.479> album<00:02:06.960> as<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.800> think

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
Floyd's the new album as I think

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.130 
Floyd's the new album as I think
probably<00:02:08.250> most<00:02:08.399> be<00:02:08.700> blown<00:02:08.940> away<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.110> was

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
probably most be blown away and I was
