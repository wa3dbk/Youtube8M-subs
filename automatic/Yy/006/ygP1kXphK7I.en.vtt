pretty much you will find Jade Fang now
normally<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.819> could<00:03:54.060> get<00:03:54.329> up<00:03:54.420> there<00:03:54.450> by

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
normally you could get up there by

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.690 
normally you could get up there by
having<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> daily<00:03:55.470> quest<00:03:55.769> button<00:03:56.129> by<00:03:56.310> unlocking

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
having a daily quest button by unlocking

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.300 
having a daily quest button by unlocking
all<00:03:56.970> these<00:03:57.120> other<00:03:57.299> quests<00:03:57.659> so<00:03:58.409> but<00:03:59.159> that<00:03:59.280> just

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
all these other quests so but that just

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.830 
all these other quests so but that just
takes<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.700> long<00:03:59.790> time<00:03:59.849> pretty<00:04:00.480> much<00:04:00.569> if<00:04:00.750> you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
takes a long time pretty much if you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.690 
takes a long time pretty much if you
don't<00:04:01.019> really<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.129> didn't<00:04:02.310> really<00:04:02.459> level

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
don't really if you didn't really level

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.899 
don't really if you didn't really level
in<00:04:02.909> deepholm<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.780> oh<00:04:03.870> gosh<00:04:04.560> what<00:04:05.159> a<00:04:05.370> son<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.760> a

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
in deepholm and oh gosh what a son of a

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.450 
in deepholm and oh gosh what a son of a
bitch<00:04:06.269> okay<00:04:06.720> one<00:04:07.260> second

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:17.090 

anyway<00:04:11.460> uh<00:04:11.780> yes<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:14.450> anyway<00:04:15.470> if<00:04:16.470> he<00:04:16.890> didn't

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
anyway uh yes so anyway if he didn't

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.010 
anyway uh yes so anyway if he didn't
actually<00:04:17.220> bother<00:04:17.670> to<00:04:18.000> take<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.570> time<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.930> do

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
actually bother to take the time to do

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.090 
actually bother to take the time to do
these<00:04:19.170> quests<00:04:19.440> while<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.650> were<00:04:19.739> leveling<00:04:19.980> in

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
these quests while you were leveling in

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.590 
these quests while you were leveling in
deep<00:04:20.250> home<00:04:20.430> there's<00:04:20.880> actually<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.180> much<00:04:21.330> faster

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
deep home there's actually a much faster

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.150 
deep home there's actually a much faster
way<00:04:21.810> of<00:04:21.930> getting<00:04:22.380> up<00:04:22.470> there<00:04:22.650> well<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.040> don't

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
way of getting up there well I don't

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.380 
way of getting up there well I don't
know<00:04:23.310> if<00:04:23.370> it's<00:04:23.460> faster<00:04:23.730> or<00:04:23.820> not<00:04:23.940> because<00:04:24.090> let's

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
know if it's faster or not because let's

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.030 
know if it's faster or not because let's
face<00:04:24.420> it<00:04:24.660> if<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:24.990> have<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.200> if<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.590> have<00:04:25.770> the

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
face it if you have the if you have the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.310 
face it if you have the if you have the
quest<00:04:26.670> then<00:04:27.210> it's<00:04:27.780> probably<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.170> a<00:04:28.200> whole<00:04:28.290> lot

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
quest then it's probably be a whole lot

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.350 
quest then it's probably be a whole lot
faster<00:04:28.770> so<00:04:29.220> you're<00:04:29.910> probably<00:04:30.060> going<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.300> want

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
faster so you're probably going to want

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.120 
faster so you're probably going to want
to<00:04:30.510> do<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.630> quest<00:04:30.900> but<00:04:31.440> if<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.950> don't

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
to do that quest but if you don't

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.590 
to do that quest but if you don't
actually<00:04:32.250> have<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:32.910> you're<00:04:33.300> realizing

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
actually have it and you're realizing

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.000 
actually have it and you're realizing
you<00:04:33.990> know<00:04:34.020> what<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.470> don't<00:04:34.590> have<00:04:34.680> enough<00:04:34.830> time

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
you know what I don't have enough time

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.380 
you know what I don't have enough time
because<00:04:35.400> by<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.580> time<00:04:35.610> I'm<00:04:35.820> questioning<00:04:36.000> he

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
because by the time I'm questioning he

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.360 
because by the time I'm questioning he
could<00:04:36.540> actually<00:04:36.630> spawn<00:04:36.990> so<00:04:37.770> if<00:04:38.040> you're

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
could actually spawn so if you're

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.630 
could actually spawn so if you're
impatient<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.300> think<00:04:40.220> yeah<00:04:41.220> bad<00:04:41.460> Luck's

impatient and you think yeah bad Luck's

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.800 
impatient and you think yeah bad Luck's
going<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:41.820> happen<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.270> this<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:42.630> what<00:04:42.720> you

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
there that way we can go up there and

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.640 
there that way we can go up there and
