 pachyderms in the kronberger opel-zoo 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.700

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.710

 aruba monkey and zimba have in 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.830
 the past year experienced a lot because 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.750
 the zoo has that for the trunks 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 biggest construction project in the history of 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.029
 kronberger zoos behind 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.760
 brought 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.050
 gray giant 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.200
 the animals are still in the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 getting used to the new bull 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.059
 came that I feel as well as we do 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.590
 the next months will be the phase 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.960
 we have found everyone to get together 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.350
 and then maybe someday 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.539
 we are waiting for new elephants as well 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.640
 can grow again opel to what for 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.640
 a past works very well 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.680
 has words that especially the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.140
 fallen elephant bulls 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.250
 the family of pachyderms should now 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.439
 so grow 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.150
 but not only tammo and his women 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.490
 should multiply the whole 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.560
 animal diversity in the kronberger opel zoo should 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.759
 be increased 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.210
 we are new to this year 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.340
 The largest kangaroos have this 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.579
 Gives the red giants big and one 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.090
 small kangaroo style brushing tail 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.400
 rat kangaroos we have some 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 more bird species but especially 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.399
 Of course, as an animal itself is the new 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.979
 elephants problem-free against also 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.100
 moved the red deer with the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.329
 elephant enclosure to make room 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.270
 Also new is the signage in the 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.149
 zoo both for the roundabout animal 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.310
 information as well as the location plan is 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.509
 redesigned and designed for the visitor 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.000
 make it more attractive 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.290
 It will also be a novelty of 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.850
 give annual cards 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.140

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.800
 Annual pass check form give there 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.750

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.210
 made by the year ticket holder and in 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.370
 This check card integrates and these 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.890
 Can you then after specified time 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.110
 extend again after one year 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.390
 Leave the actual process 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.300
 at the ticket offices will shorten and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.530

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.150
 no longer visited these days 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.900
 Waiting at the cards at the ticket booths 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.000
 do not have a long waiting time so to yourself 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.860
 to look at the innovations and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.260
 certainly also an incentive for the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.660
 Visitors not too long on the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.280
 next visit to wait for the zoo 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.720
