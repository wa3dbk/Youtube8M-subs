00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.320
 Uuu 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.400
 me 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:30.930
 Hi everyone this time of guitar courses code of good but I got the look I at the beginning 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:36.390
 Used to draw this stroke pattern 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:40.840
 In this stroke pattern hat seems to be a little difficult, but corresponds quite well 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.650
 Please try to learn on this occasion as it is a pattern 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.379
 In the case of such a difficult pattern, one night each as reading 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.860
 Let's look at one chunk at a time 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.400
 At first I think that it is easy to understand 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.010
 Tanta worked! 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.300
 Was was turn Tan only 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:05.399
 Tintin turn nothing but but is not going to read and was indifferently 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.930
 Generally I think you know the first night the 8 bond has listed 2 Tsusura because of 200 people a month 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:15.480
 1 part 16 16 bun has become two 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 The 16 distribution is half of the length of 85, so it depends on the table tennis 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:23.350
 Third night is sixteen minutes note I'm pattern of the reverse is coming ahead 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.020
 So I read it like a pattern 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.719
 In the case of 8 twilight, it is same with 200 people 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.100
 Pick also with it the highlight symbol to some extent but not you go is taken from some familiarity 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:38.020
 Please 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:44.120
 Because if you try to do it one at a time, you will be confused 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:48.010
 Of its stroke Kedomo so is everybody I sound the same difficult is 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:54.579
 It is a variation that says that the stroke up stroke car of 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:02:00.490
 I will talk about it, but I will talk about this later using a guitar 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:01.179
 In such cases, there are many 16th notes, so 16 beats from that 8 beats 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.689
 beat 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.689
 a treat is goodbye. 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:17.800
 If it feels like it's like a bald day, if it's 16 beats then someone or someone someone or someone 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:22.660
 Someone someone who but it is not going to feel Fu say selfish feeling the 16-beat or 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.910
 I think it might be easy to draw the slot pattern that said when I play it 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.280
 Though 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:34.830
 Because I think that in some people come or different people I fire the sides bone Toka point pull 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.130
 While trying to learn that, please use the guitar after this to talk 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.130
 I will 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:47.020
 Then I will talk using a guitar, but this time it is easy to understand 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.920
 In order to see it, I will mute the original completely and talk. 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:57.090
 First of all the first night of bread 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:59.440
 Lost Room second floor which is standing probe 200 people but I think that I bought it 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:05.870
 Down is attached 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.350
 Burn This is Mr. in I'm 200 people white surface there A'a' 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.190
 Standing 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.190
 Oh 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.550
 It is supposed to say booboo 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.300
 Hmm 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:38.140
 And as you saw at the beginning, wool 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.140
 me 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.450
 It's not going to feel
