00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.349
 you quickly left and my second like 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.430
 also in the description box below 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.739
 find this video 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.149
 an example for you the chrome cas 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.040
 not have to lie or the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.160
 maybe not even know what that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.920
 Exactly and that's how I do the good thing 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.039
 that is a hdmi stick of the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.440
 Internet capable is the comes in the tv 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.539
 and there came from his mobile terminal 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.440
 or from his pc or from his mac 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.329
 computer content streams on the big one 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.449
 tv screen but there's more to it 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.270
 as I said in my second video that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.439
 Whole also needs an external 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.430
 energy supply for this is cable 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.320
 been supplied 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.479
 You can also go directly to the tv 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.670
 Include almost a USB port 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.510
 otherwise just this power plug 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.880
 use 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.570
 and since the other end comes just pure 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.970
 this is a micro usb connection and that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.430
 second cable is a hdmi 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.159
 extension cable if the hdmi the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.920
 hdmi-connection from tv widum then sits 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.200
 you can here around the corner laid the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.479
 depends on my tv is also with 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.610
 so we are supplied with electricity 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.140

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.079
 sounds good so this short app 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.079
 download and install 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.520
 We have to load the motto 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:09.340
 data protection and conditions of use 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:12.990
 then we can accept 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.460
 connect cromcast with our wifi 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.240
 You see, you already have masters 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.090
 found cromcast 27 83 that's exactly what it is 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.170
 me also on the tv displayed com cars 2 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.200
 783 bond a bit in the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.200
 then we watch TV set up and 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:38.070
 then we will be here on the screen 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.120
 on my pc screen see n4 f3 like that 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.100
 the same code we see on the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.350
 TV so this is my god 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.080
 not in the directly from the neighbor everything 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.230
 fits here wlan set up new 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.250
 wlan select that mainz then determines 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 Enter password 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.530
 and here below we can still name 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.300
 of the device I change now 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:05.530
 my name in front of it a bit 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:07.570
 is more personal and on and on 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.550
 this place begins the frustration 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.800
 I just can not handle my 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.090
 Wlan connect I have everything password 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.530
 of course I have to enter correctly 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.330
 I tried several times then 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.310
 googled and really many people 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.910
 have the same problem as I do not care what 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.590
 Do you 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.239
 The cromcast can not handle her 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.489
 wireless I connect then also got the 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.170
 boarding the fritzbox played around and 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.850
 it just does not want to go and see 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.340
 you also the cromcast still has his 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.470
 are now still in the beta phase to 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.940
 luck I have a second wlan 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.280
 the old contract that we actually 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.380
 use more but now pitch and 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.769
 try again with the new day 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.630
 happiness incited my second again is 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.340
 now selected my password 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.950
 entered and the name is alex cromcast 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.049
 2783 on a new hopefully it works 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.510
 now with the connection to the internet 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.180
 who really laughs when you are us 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.269
 my two wlans not to success 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.739
 I am very bad luck me 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.820
 Do not hope the problems are over you 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.680
 works perfect immediately it seems perfect 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.300
 to blaze and the cromcast brings itself 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:17.170
 stood on the latest 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:18.940
 Let's get started, you have to google it 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.500
 chrome karstens restart quickly 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.500
 so that will also actively update 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.599
 and we have to wait again 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.800
 well so it worked the cromcast is 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.450
 ready 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.490
 I'm quick on the 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.960
 desktop and close it can be here 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.070
 also from her device is now ready to go 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.740
 now , this extension must also be 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.100
 so we can also download it with ours 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.540
 chrome browser on our tv 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.880
 So just stream them 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:56.910
 Add small extension and that 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.980
 lasts about 23 seconds and then 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.690
 we can start immediately and funny 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:06.420
 Show things on our tv 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:10.560
 and up here we already have that 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.270
 symbol that we can trust and 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.280
 The above is the new symbols to come 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.960
 So these extensions the grade 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.890
 have added and now we can 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:24.030
 show this tab on our device 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:27.770
 leave and how should we get out now 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.770
 that on the television 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.270
 Ok, let's see what's here 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.220
 Delay is not what you see now 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.919
 but if I scroll down here 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.980
 the delay is about one second 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.900
 But it works through the wifi 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.880
 The whole time is always a small one 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.220
 Production is pure, therefore, to work 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.229
 probably not suitable but around 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.700
 to stream with videos or pictures 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.500
 to watchers perfectly 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.870
 Now we are already looking at it 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.070
 on my android smartphone to the 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.900
 of course with the tablet as well 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.210
 look and if you get an ios 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.900
 You can also find this app used 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.750
 There in the app store price cromcast easy 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.020
 install and download if you like 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:13.080
 She opens it already checks whether in the wlan 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.870
 he has a chrome review right away 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.330
 found with me is also ready to start 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.040
 her until just from youtube I go to the 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.229
 app and I would now have to be able 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.090
 gets the cromcast on a tv 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.919
 to run videos 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.230
 now move around to connect and 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.500
 then videos on the tv 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.470
 ok to see if much has occurred 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.940
 sensationally so normalized and it 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.270
 works up here is ours again 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.310
 cromcast symbol and i can go here now 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.200
 determine on a smartphone which 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.740
 we are shown on my tv 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.740
 top
