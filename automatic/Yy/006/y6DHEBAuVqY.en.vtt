00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.559 
typically in one beat and I don't know
if<00:02:23.469> y'all<00:02:23.650> catching<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.249> but<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.269> is

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
if y'all catching it but this is

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.479 
if y'all catching it but this is
actually<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.139> little<00:02:26.319> bit<00:02:26.500> browner<00:02:26.829> than<00:02:27.189> my

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
actually a little bit browner than my

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.099 
actually a little bit browner than my
hair<00:02:27.870> which<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.290> essence<00:02:30.099> it<00:02:30.219> doesn't<00:02:30.549> really

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
hair which in essence it doesn't really

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.869 
hair which in essence it doesn't really
look<00:02:32.109> that<00:02:32.170> because<00:02:32.889> it<00:02:33.040> looks<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:33.519> my<00:02:33.700> hair

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
look that because it looks like my hair

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.170 
look that because it looks like my hair
is<00:02:33.939> kind<00:02:34.329> of<00:02:34.419> Umbridge<00:02:35.340> since<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.579> have<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.849> tiny

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
is kind of Umbridge since I have a tiny

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.929 
is kind of Umbridge since I have a tiny
bit<00:02:37.329> of<00:02:37.480> length<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:38.139> it<00:02:38.319> but<00:02:38.980> let's<00:02:39.459> say<00:02:39.669> if<00:02:39.790> my

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
bit of length to it but let's say if my

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.089 
bit of length to it but let's say if my
hair<00:02:40.150> was<00:02:40.299> a<00:02:40.329> lot<00:02:40.599> shorter<00:02:40.659> than<00:02:41.169> this<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.799> would

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
hair was a lot shorter than this I would

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.030 
hair was a lot shorter than this I would
have<00:02:42.189> probably<00:02:42.519> had<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:43.150> dye<00:02:43.389> these<00:02:43.719> less<00:02:44.139> to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
have probably had to dye these less to

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.990 
have probably had to dye these less to
match<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.549> color<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.939> my<00:02:46.090> hair<00:02:47.819> sometime<00:02:48.819> eeen
