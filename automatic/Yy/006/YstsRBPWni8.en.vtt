a<00:04:30.310> proper<00:04:30.640> group<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:31.510> like<00:04:31.660> if<00:04:31.750> you're<00:04:31.930> really

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
a proper group so like if you're really

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.630 
a proper group so like if you're really
hot<00:04:32.380> out<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.680> can<00:04:32.800> have<00:04:32.890> like<00:04:33.070> people<00:04:33.280> waiting

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
hot out you can have like people waiting

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.520 
hot out you can have like people waiting
in<00:04:33.700> town<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.210> second<00:04:34.480> someone<00:04:34.600> dies<00:04:34.870> you

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
in town so the second someone dies you

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.930 
in town so the second someone dies you
kind<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.770> pull<00:04:36.010> it<00:04:36.100> on<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.430> dead<00:04:36.610> person

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
kind of pull it on to that dead person

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.430 
kind of pull it on to that dead person
and<00:04:37.030> they<00:04:37.210> run<00:04:37.420> from<00:04:37.570> there<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.020> new<00:04:38.170> récit

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
and they run from there in the new récit

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.230 
and they run from there in the new récit
town<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.890> you<00:04:38.950> can<00:04:39.100> like<00:04:39.250> alternate<00:04:39.820> people

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
town and you can like alternate people

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.040 
town and you can like alternate people
it's<00:04:41.820> really<00:04:42.820> really<00:04:43.240> quite<00:04:43.450> advanced<00:04:43.780> guys

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
it's really really quite advanced guys

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.810 
it's really really quite advanced guys
quite<00:04:44.350> advanced<00:04:44.830> quite<00:04:45.100> advanced<00:04:45.400> techniques

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
quite advanced quite advanced techniques

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.700 
quite advanced quite advanced techniques
what<00:04:46.000> can<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.240> say<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:46.660> so<00:04:46.960> you<00:04:47.410> know<00:04:47.440> you've

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
what can I say and so you know you've

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.070 
what can I say and so you know you've
got<00:04:47.740> various<00:04:48.520> strategies<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.630> one<00:04:49.780> good

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
got various strategies and the one good

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.900 
got various strategies and the one good
thing<00:04:50.110> about<00:04:50.290> it<00:04:50.530> i<00:04:50.680> guess<00:04:50.890> might<00:04:51.250> as<00:04:51.430> well<00:04:51.670> was

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
thing about it i guess might as well was

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.260 
thing about it i guess might as well was
kind<00:04:52.120> of<00:04:52.180> like<00:04:53.280> completely<00:04:54.280> based<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.790> orangey

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
kind of like completely based on orangey

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.180 
kind of like completely based on orangey
whereas<00:04:55.900> this<00:04:55.990> is<00:04:56.140> going<00:04:56.320> to<00:04:56.380> be<00:04:56.470> consistent

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
whereas this is going to be consistent

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.240 
whereas this is going to be consistent
all<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.400> way<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.700> 70<00:04:58.180> it's<00:04:58.900> t6<00:04:59.410> experience<00:05:00.040> and

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
all the way to 70 it's t6 experience and

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.500 
all the way to 70 it's t6 experience and
you<00:05:00.370> get<00:05:00.550> your<00:05:00.700> kind<00:05:00.850> of<00:05:00.940> getting<00:05:01.090> t6

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
you get your kind of getting t6

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.020 
you get your kind of getting t6
experience<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.020> whole<00:05:02.140> time<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:03.310> guess<00:05:03.790> it

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
experience the whole time and I guess it

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.840 
experience the whole time and I guess it
kind<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.390> is<00:05:04.600> a<00:05:04.660> speedrun<00:05:05.580> so<00:05:06.580> there's<00:05:06.760> a

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
kind of is a speedrun so there's a

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.390 
kind of is a speedrun so there's a
little<00:05:07.150> bit<00:05:07.330> of<00:05:07.510> I<00:05:07.870> mean<00:05:08.350> if<00:05:08.500> you<00:05:08.590> min<00:05:08.920> max<00:05:09.190> it

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
little bit of I mean if you min max it

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.010 
little bit of I mean if you min max it
you<00:05:09.580> can<00:05:09.850> do<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.180> little<00:05:10.360> bit<00:05:10.570> better<00:05:10.690> of<00:05:10.900> your

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
you can do a little bit better of your

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.690 
you can do a little bit better of your
team<00:05:11.230> as<00:05:11.380> faster<00:05:11.860> than<00:05:11.980> another<00:05:12.250> team<00:05:12.490> you

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
team as faster than another team you

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.400 
team as faster than another team you
could<00:05:12.910> be<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:13.660> know<00:05:13.750> beat<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.080> other<00:05:14.140> team

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
could be you know beat the other team

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.190 
could be you know beat the other team
but<00:05:15.010> whatever<00:05:15.420> this<00:05:16.420> is<00:05:16.570> there<00:05:16.720> anyway<00:05:17.020> guys

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
but whatever this is there anyway guys

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.690 
but whatever this is there anyway guys
that's<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:17.830> then<00:05:18.040> you<00:05:18.100> just<00:05:18.250> run<00:05:18.460> back<00:05:18.640> and

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
that's it then you just run back and

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.120 
that's it then you just run back and
commits<00:05:19.510> suicide<00:05:19.660> hand<00:05:20.290> this<00:05:20.410> bad<00:05:20.620> boy<00:05:20.800> in<00:05:20.860> and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
commits suicide hand this bad boy in and

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.910 
commits suicide hand this bad boy in and
then<00:05:21.820> boom<00:05:22.060> and<00:05:22.480> you'd<00:05:22.960> already<00:05:23.080> see<00:05:23.320> so<00:05:23.590> that

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
then boom and you'd already see so that

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.010 
then boom and you'd already see so that
was<00:05:24.040> about<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.730> was<00:05:24.850> about<00:05:25.120> five<00:05:25.480> minutes<00:05:25.810> of

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
was about it was about five minutes of

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.780 
was about it was about five minutes of
gameplay<00:05:26.230> time<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.650> tats<00:05:27.010> fed<00:05:27.160> up<00:05:27.280> I<00:05:27.430> did<00:05:27.700> it

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
gameplay time I tats fed up I did it

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.940 
gameplay time I tats fed up I did it
spit<00:05:28.240> up<00:05:28.330> twice<00:05:28.540> as<00:05:28.690> fast<00:05:28.870> about<00:05:29.560> five<00:05:29.770> minutes

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
spit up twice as fast about five minutes

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.070 
spit up twice as fast about five minutes
I<00:05:30.250> did<00:05:30.460> so<00:05:30.880> it<00:05:30.970> took<00:05:31.060> me<00:05:31.120> like<00:05:31.300> 30<00:05:31.570> minutes<00:05:31.870> to

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
I did so it took me like 30 minutes to

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.390 
I did so it took me like 30 minutes to
get<00:05:32.170> to<00:05:32.230> level<00:05:32.380> 10<00:05:32.680> last<00:05:32.860> night<00:05:33.100> when<00:05:33.280> I<00:05:33.310> was

just testing bounties so you know and
you<00:05:36.940> can<00:05:37.060> imagine<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.510> can<00:05:37.600> do<00:05:37.750> they<00:05:38.140> can<00:05:38.170> do

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
you can imagine you can do they can do

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.620 
you can imagine you can do they can do
12<00:05:38.860> 50<00:05:39.250> in<00:05:39.370> about<00:05:39.580> 40<00:05:39.940> minutes<00:05:39.970> and<00:05:40.420> then<00:05:40.510> you

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
12 50 in about 40 minutes and then you

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.920 
12 50 in about 40 minutes and then you
do<00:05:40.810> it's<00:05:41.050> like<00:05:41.140> 50<00:05:42.130> to<00:05:42.280> 65<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.480> like<00:05:43.600> another

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
do it's like 50 to 65 and like another

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.360 
do it's like 50 to 65 and like another
it's<00:05:44.230> like<00:05:44.290> it<00:05:44.530> depends<00:05:44.800> how<00:05:44.890> fast<00:05:45.070> you<00:05:45.220> guys

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
it's like it depends how fast you guys

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.210 
it's like it depends how fast you guys
can<00:05:45.520> go<00:05:45.640> but<00:05:46.510> if<00:05:47.320> you're<00:05:47.530> going<00:05:47.830> like<00:05:47.950> in<00:05:48.100> an

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
average pace you should be able to head

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.290 
average pace you should be able to head
70<00:05:50.620> within<00:05:50.980> two<00:05:51.250> to<00:05:51.370> three<00:05:51.400> hours<00:05:51.640> if<00:05:52.060> you're

70 within two to three hours if you're

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.970 
70 within two to three hours if you're
going<00:05:52.450> really<00:05:52.780> fast<00:05:53.050> people<00:05:53.560> are<00:05:53.650> saying<00:05:53.830> that

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
going really fast people are saying that

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
a band hey was saying you could get it

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.720 
a band hey was saying you could get it
technically<00:05:56.170> you<00:05:56.380> get<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.770> level<00:05:57.280> soon<00:05:57.550> me
