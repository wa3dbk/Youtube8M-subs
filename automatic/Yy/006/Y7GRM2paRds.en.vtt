pole<00:00:25.470> beans<00:00:25.710> really<00:00:25.920> need<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> climb<00:00:26.369> up

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
pole beans really need to climb up

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.740 
pole beans really need to climb up
something<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.000> they're<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> grow<00:00:27.449> good

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
something if they're going to grow good

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.630 
something if they're going to grow good
beans<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.590> see<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:28.830> these<00:00:28.949> blossoms<00:00:29.279> I'll

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
beans you see all these blossoms I'll

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.669 
beans you see all these blossoms I'll
give<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> close-up<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.599> they're<00:00:31.470> going<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
give you a close-up and they're going to

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.410 
give you a close-up and they're going to
start<00:00:31.859> producing<00:00:32.130> beans<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.820> crazy<00:00:33.090> right

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
start producing beans like crazy right

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
start producing beans like crazy right
away<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.170> are<00:00:34.260> some<00:00:34.380> nice<00:00:34.559> blossoms<00:00:35.370> on

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
away so here are some nice blossoms on

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.360 
away so here are some nice blossoms on
the<00:00:36.059> pole<00:00:36.780> beans<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.500> see<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> group

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the pole beans you see here as a group

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.700 
the pole beans you see here as a group
here<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:38.940> there's<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.809> tiny<00:00:40.110> baby<00:00:40.379> bean

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
here in here there's a tiny baby bean

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.479 
here in here there's a tiny baby bean
right<00:00:41.010> there

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
right there

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.130 
right there
and<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:41.969> sure<00:00:42.239> there's<00:00:42.450> some<00:00:42.600> bigger<00:00:42.750> ones<00:00:42.840> in

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and I'm sure there's some bigger ones in

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.729 
and I'm sure there's some bigger ones in
here<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.950> looked<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.809> I<00:00:45.809> don't<00:00:46.649> know

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
here if I just looked but I don't know

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.229 
here if I just looked but I don't know
where<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.219> are<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.120> don't

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
where they are but as you see they don't

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.850 
where they are but as you see they don't
start<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> preusse<00:00:48.809> produce<00:00:49.289> until<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:49.680> get

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
start to preusse produce until they get

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.139 
start to preusse produce until they get
up<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.219> bit<00:00:50.399> higher<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> trellis

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
up a little bit higher on the trellis

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
up a little bit higher on the trellis
and<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.350> start<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> blossom<00:00:52.920> as

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and then they really start to blossom as

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.529 
and then they really start to blossom as
they<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.520> higher<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> way<00:00:54.449> up

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
they go up higher you see all the way up

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
they go up higher you see all the way up
to<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> top<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.739> kind<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> coil<00:00:56.460> around

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
to the top they just kind of coil around

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
to the top they just kind of coil around
each<00:00:57.000> other<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.449> keep<00:00:58.379> climbing<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.039> like

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
each other and keep climbing just like

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.260 
each other and keep climbing just like
Jack<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> Beanstalk

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
Jack and the Beanstalk

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
Jack and the Beanstalk
so<00:01:00.570> what's<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> difference<00:01:01.020> between<00:01:01.320> pole

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
so what's the difference between pole

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.160 
so what's the difference between pole
beans<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.460> bush<00:01:02.609> beans<00:01:02.910> pole<00:01:03.600> beans<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.049> need

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
beans and bush beans pole beans you need

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
beans and bush beans pole beans you need
them<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.500> climb<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.129> sort<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.460> trellis

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
them to climb up some sort of trellis

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.670 
them to climb up some sort of trellis
like<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.150> showed<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.750> full<00:01:07.260> beans<00:01:07.500> are

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
like I showed you my full beans are

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
like I showed you my full beans are
growing<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.189> they<00:01:09.000> need<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.299> grow<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.510> before

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
growing on they need to grow up before

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.480 
growing on they need to grow up before
they<00:01:10.140> start<00:01:10.380> producing<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.920> beans<00:01:11.220> really

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
they start producing the beans really

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
they start producing the beans really
well<00:01:11.790> bush<00:01:12.450> beans<00:01:12.780> they'll<00:01:13.110> grow<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
well bush beans they'll grow about a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.080 
well bush beans they'll grow about a
foot<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.040> two<00:01:14.189> off<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> ground<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:14.939> will

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
foot or two off the ground they will

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.840 
foot or two off the ground they will
climb<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.659> some<00:01:16.229> short<00:01:16.470> trellises<00:01:17.070> because

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
climb up some short trellises because

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.240 
climb up some short trellises because
they<00:01:18.000> send<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.360> these<00:01:18.600> shoots<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.530> really

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
they send out these shoots but really

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
they send out these shoots but really
bush<00:01:20.970> beans<00:01:21.240> are<00:01:21.420> great<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.810> don't<00:01:21.869> want

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
bush beans are great if you don't want

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.179 
bush beans are great if you don't want
to<00:01:22.110> grow<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.350> trellises<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.040> they'll

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
to grow on trellises because they'll

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.920 
to grow on trellises because they'll
produce<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.580> ton<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.790> beans<00:01:24.119> without<00:01:24.479> actually

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
produce a ton of beans without actually

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
produce a ton of beans without actually
crawling<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:26.430> keep<00:01:26.640> producing<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
crawling up and they keep producing and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
crawling up and they keep producing and
producing<00:01:27.330> usually<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> fruit<00:01:28.229> crop<00:01:28.470> few<00:01:28.799> crops

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
producing usually a fruit crop few crops

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.429 
producing usually a fruit crop few crops
for<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:30.240> best<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.780> pull<00:01:31.259> off<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
for you it's best if you pull off the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.590 
for you it's best if you pull off the
beans<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:32.009> there<00:01:32.189> about<00:01:32.579> Oh<00:01:32.820> three<00:01:33.210> inches

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
beans on there about Oh three inches

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.450 
beans on there about Oh three inches
three<00:01:33.869> three<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> half<00:01:34.380> inches<00:01:34.710> long<00:01:34.770> so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
three three and a half inches long so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.310 
three three and a half inches long so
they<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.939> keep<00:01:36.090> blossoming<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.810> producing

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
they can keep blossoming and producing

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.649 
they can keep blossoming and producing
more<00:01:37.560> beans<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.640> let<00:01:39.119> me<00:01:39.180> give<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> closer

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.190 
to eat already you want to pull them off
before<00:01:50.070> they<00:01:50.159> get<00:01:50.280> too<00:01:50.820> much<00:01:50.850> bean<00:01:51.570> formation

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
before they get too much bean formation

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.810 
before they get too much bean formation
because<00:01:52.619> they<00:01:52.740> need<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.310> unless<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
because they need one unless you

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.310 
because they need one unless you
actually<00:01:53.970> want<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.299> grow<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:54.810> beans<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
actually want to grow them for beans and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.719 
actually want to grow them for beans and
you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.560> let<00:01:55.710> them<00:01:55.890> grow<00:01:56.369> until<00:01:56.520> they

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you can let them grow until they

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.300 
you can let them grow until they
actually<00:01:56.909> turn<00:01:57.390> hard<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.680> dry<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.040> then<00:01:59.219> you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
actually turn hard and dry out then you

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
actually turn hard and dry out then you
can<00:01:59.430> actually<00:01:59.549> keep<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> beans<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.719> you

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
can actually keep the beans but if you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.480 
can actually keep the beans but if you
want<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.990> eat<00:02:01.079> them<00:02:01.229> fresh<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.860> then

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
want to eat them fresh like this then

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.830 
want to eat them fresh like this then
pick<00:02:03.000> them<00:02:03.119> before<00:02:03.420> they<00:02:03.540> actually<00:02:03.659> start

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
pick them before they actually start
