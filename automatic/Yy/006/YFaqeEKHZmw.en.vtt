00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.250
 a special game for us can be me 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.510
 still remember what happened last time 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.770
 sold out was that we against frankfurt 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.270
 as we then descended in this 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.220
 year and that is something special for us 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.070
 here before our fans before sold out 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 to play house and that's exactly what we want 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.949
 also show with passion and play 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.809
 lie down here in a hot fight 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.960
 that is we believe the people the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.940
 here to come to us constantly and guilty 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.020
 that's us the team too 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.030
 bring in it has set itself 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.409
 also to do better than he did in cologne 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.170
 and of course 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:52.070
 footballing and easy here 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.070
 to lay a good game 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.020
 there are some things that suggest there 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.030
 against the idea I had before that one 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.830
 so do what I could but neige 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.030
 not now after the error though 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.430
 I take out everyone because a mistake 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.910
 but then I did pretty much alone 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.260
 because it's just that way 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.190
 mostly out of a chain or out 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.000
 errors or from a failure chain 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.170
 happen aware of the error and aware 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.090
 We also realize that something like that 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.720
 that's why I'm wearing it there 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.200
 Nothing about me did not feel like that 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.270
 that it is decisive game we are now 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.220
 until then did not have the impression 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.470
 made was that was with cologne on 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.380
 are eye level 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.729
 it is of course annoying 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.750
 just ran his second half time ran 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.220
 to play a bit better 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.850
 maybe the game is more balanced too 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.770
 shape 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.090
 But that's part of a round 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.320
 footballers to wear there is nothing to have 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.509
 Nevertheless , with the thought 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.920
 of course played all alone 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.080
 not because of the mistake, but because of it 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.759
 the alignment of the opponent with la 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.200
 cage idrissou are quite 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.119
 good football player there 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.450
 that could be with dietz for that 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.159
 better gordon to your but beware 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.210
 as I said if that's how it should be 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.170
 that certainly has nothing to do with it 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.700
 to do any 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.040
 everything is not normal and mistakes 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.399
 but some have played 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.399
 others more 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.770
 yes I think in total triggered by the 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.590
 Last results I believe a lot 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.790
 very good squad a team and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.530
 then he joined the flags 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.380
 also wants to go up with you 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.910
 the use that they operate there also in the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.280
 winter again players nachverpflichtet 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.950
 to have with certainty one of the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.400
 strongest squad in the second 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.600
 league and that's what I expect that one 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.160
 team with a lot of quality up 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.160
 to come to us with very good 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.600
 singles and that will 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.600
 accordingly a hard nut 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.360
 thanks, we will be first 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.420
 google too over the fight 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.260
 we have in cologne that one without 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.790
 battles we will not get along 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.880
 Definitely full against it 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.230
 first find our order and what 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.460
 yes we have done our strength 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.670
 and to come into play about it 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.440
 I think everything else has been seen 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.640
 does not bring to us they might 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.640
 playfully want to measure 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.110
 with stronger opponents I believe that 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.060
 The same applies to Cologne 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.800
 kaiserslautern is that it is individual 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.590
 very strong players are those with 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.000
 safety of the cadre strength and of 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.040
 the fortune with security us 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.720
 We have to make up for that and we have to balance that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.230
 Often already have something obvious 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.160
 failed in the last week 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.940
 that's not enough on wednesday 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.530
 compensate 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.910
 and because we have to get back again because 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.160
 it is the first time properly into the game too 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.090
 find the right ones with the karlsruher 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.350
