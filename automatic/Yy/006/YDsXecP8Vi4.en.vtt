00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.249 
show them about the school today well I
just<00:01:54.700> think<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.239> biggest<00:01:55.450> thing<00:01:55.629> is<00:01:55.869> when<00:01:56.140> you

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
just think the biggest thing is when you

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.830 
just think the biggest thing is when you
start<00:01:56.319> here<00:01:56.890> with<00:01:57.069> the<00:01:57.819> new<00:01:57.939> medical<00:01:58.390> facility

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
start here with the new medical facility

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.330 
start here with the new medical facility
going<00:01:59.110> up<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.649> know<00:01:59.770> adjacent<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.819> field

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
going up you know adjacent to the field

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.410 
going up you know adjacent to the field
you<00:02:03.340> know<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.549> infrastructure<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.149> we're

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
you know the infrastructure that we're

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.649 
you know the infrastructure that we're
doing<00:02:04.509> here<00:02:04.869> with<00:02:05.049> our<00:02:05.530> turf<00:02:05.890> fields<00:02:06.369> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
doing here with our turf fields and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.619 
doing here with our turf fields and
things<00:02:07.659> of<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.379> and<00:02:08.619> then

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
things of that like that and then

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.420 
things of that like that and then
obviously<00:02:10.629> the<00:02:10.899> facility<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:11.410> new<00:02:11.560> players

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
obviously the facility the new players

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.550 
obviously the facility the new players
locker<00:02:12.700> room<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.150> lounge<00:02:13.540> academic<00:02:14.170> support

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560

the<00:02:14.650> training<00:02:15.010> room<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:16.239> next<00:02:16.450> thing<00:02:16.569> would

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
the training room the next thing would

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.360 
the training room the next thing would
be<00:02:16.900> obviously<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.620> training<00:02:17.950> table<00:02:18.129> that

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
be obviously the training table that

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.910 
be obviously the training table that
would<00:02:18.430> be<00:02:18.549> done<00:02:18.700> by<00:02:18.879> August<00:02:19.450> for<00:02:19.690> us<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.500> then

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
would be done by August for us and then

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.390 
would be done by August for us and then
obviously<00:02:21.579> the<00:02:21.970> student<00:02:22.810> center<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.950> we'll

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
obviously the student center so we'll

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.009 
obviously the student center so we'll
get<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:24.549> chance<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:25.000> expose<00:02:25.329> them<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.569> that<00:02:25.720> and

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
get a chance to expose them to that and

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.180 
get a chance to expose them to that and
more<00:02:26.230> importantly<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:26.739> get<00:02:26.859> around<00:02:27.040> our

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
more importantly just get around our

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.270 
more importantly just get around our

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
players in a real casual setting and I

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.550 
players in a real casual setting and I
think<00:02:30.609> that's<00:02:30.760> more<00:02:30.940> important<00:02:31.269> in<00:02:31.329> anything

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
