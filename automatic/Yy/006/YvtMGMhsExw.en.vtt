how's it going guys baba start here

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.770 
how's it going guys baba start here
again<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.429> think<00:00:02.550> computers<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.360> today

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
again and think computers and today

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.809 
again and think computers and today
we're<00:00:03.929> taking<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.290> look<00:00:04.319> at<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.650> video<00:00:05.009> card<00:00:05.460> from

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
we're taking a look at a video card from

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.410 
we're taking a look at a video card from
Asus<00:00:06.299> it's<00:00:06.600> their<00:00:07.020> gtx<00:00:08.030> 560<00:00:09.030> TI<00:00:09.410> directcu<00:00:10.410> two

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
Asus it's their gtx 560 TI directcu two

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.650 
Asus it's their gtx 560 TI directcu two
topics<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.599> lot<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.990> words<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.070> there<00:00:14.849> gtx

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
topics a lot of words it is there gtx

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.170 
topics a lot of words it is there gtx
560ti<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.070> overclocked<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.060> it's

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
560ti that is overclocked so it's

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.720 
560ti that is overclocked so it's
running<00:00:18.420> at<00:00:18.510> 900<00:00:19.140> megahertz<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:20.490> their

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
running at 900 megahertz and it's their

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.480 
running at 900 megahertz and it's their
directcu<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.720> top<00:00:22.170> version<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.279> means

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
directcu to top version what that means

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.370 
directcu to top version what that means
is<00:00:23.640> using<00:00:24.090> their<00:00:24.180> special<00:00:24.689> cooler<00:00:24.930> that's

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
is using their special cooler that's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.839 
is using their special cooler that's
going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.130> lot<00:00:26.340> better<00:00:26.519> than<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
going to be a lot better than the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:38.800 
going to be a lot better than the
reference<00:00:27.029> design<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.080> let's<00:00:28.199> take<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> look

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.630 

take<00:00:39.810> a<00:00:39.840> look<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> box<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.710> asus<00:00:41.610> has

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
take a look at the box here asus has

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.180 
take a look at the box here asus has
some<00:00:42.090> type<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.330> night<00:00:42.720> guy<00:00:42.960> riding<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.650> horse<00:00:43.830> or

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
some type of night guy riding a horse or

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
some type of night guy riding a horse or
something<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:46.260> lets<00:00:46.440> us<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.650> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
something like that it lets us know that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.070 
something like that it lets us know that
it<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.670> 900<00:00:48.120> megahertz<00:00:48.330> overclocked

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
it is the 900 megahertz overclocked

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.050 
it is the 900 megahertz overclocked
version<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:49.680> 80<00:00:49.920> megahertz<00:00:50.430> faster<00:00:50.910> than

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
version that's 80 megahertz faster than

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
our graphics card which you can see

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.310 
our graphics card which you can see
right<00:02:31.530> there<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:32.490> in<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:33.000> side<00:02:33.330> what

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
right there and then in this side what

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.210 
right there and then in this side what
do<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.440> have<00:02:34.650> over<00:02:34.860> here<00:02:35.040> we<00:02:35.910> have<00:02:36.950> these<00:02:37.950> which

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
do we have over here we have these which

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.990 
do we have over here we have these which
i'm<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.790> used<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> seen<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.750> these<00:02:40.020> are<00:02:40.380> your

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
i'm not used to seen but these are your

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.790 
i'm not used to seen but these are your

PCI Express power to molex power
connection<00:02:44.280> see<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.520> two<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.850> those<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:46.709> have

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
connection see of two of those you have

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.750 
connection see of two of those you have
it<00:02:47.760> looks<00:02:48.180> like<00:02:48.420> mini<00:02:48.780> HDMI<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.920> full<00:02:50.160> HD<00:02:50.550> line

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
it looks like mini HDMI to full HD line

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.430 
it looks like mini HDMI to full HD line
and<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.769> course<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.519> have<00:02:53.760> your<00:02:54.090> DVI<00:02:54.720> to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and you of course you have your DVI to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.910 
and you of course you have your DVI to
VGA<00:02:55.890> adapter<00:02:56.040> right<00:02:56.610> there<00:02:57.590> taking<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.650> look<00:02:58.769> at

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
VGA adapter right there taking a look at

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.190 
VGA adapter right there taking a look at
the<00:02:59.010> card<00:02:59.280> here<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.910> can<00:03:00.120> see<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.690> asus<00:03:01.170> has

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the card here you can see that asus has

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.009 
the card here you can see that asus has
gone<00:03:01.709> with<00:03:01.980> their<00:03:02.220> black<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:03.120> red<00:03:03.450> design<00:03:03.810> this

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
gone with their black in red design this

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.180 
gone with their black in red design this
is<00:03:04.170> something<00:03:04.470> they've<00:03:04.620> been<00:03:04.650> doing<00:03:05.010> for

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
is something they've been doing for

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.340 
is something they've been doing for
quite<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.519> while<00:03:05.730> now<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.989> direct

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
quite a while now and this is the direct

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.920 
quite a while now and this is the direct
see<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.680> too<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.660> cooling

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
see you too so that is the cooling

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.030 
see you too so that is the cooling
system<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.260> they're<00:03:10.470> using<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.890> have

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
system that they're using so you have

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.220 
system that they're using so you have
two<00:03:11.190> cooling<00:03:11.549> fans<00:03:11.820> one<00:03:12.570> that's<00:03:12.810> actually

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
two cooling fans one that's actually

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.620 
two cooling fans one that's actually
right<00:03:13.500> on<00:03:13.769> top<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.850> GPU<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.510> other

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
right on top of the GPU and the other

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.750 
right on top of the GPU and the other
one<00:03:15.840> that's<00:03:15.959> on<00:03:16.170> top<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.040> memory<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:17.579> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
one that's on top of the memory here and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.910 
one that's on top of the memory here and
then<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.209> have<00:03:18.239> two<00:03:19.079> large<00:03:19.260> heat<00:03:19.560> sinks

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
then you do have two large heat sinks

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.990 
then you do have two large heat sinks
both<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:21.440> GPU<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.799> then<00:03:22.950> one<00:03:23.250> over<00:03:23.700> here

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
both on the GPU and then one over here

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.060 
both on the GPU and then one over here
that<00:03:24.420> don't<00:03:25.019> know<00:03:25.170> if<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.290> can<00:03:25.410> see<00:03:25.709> if<00:03:25.829> I<00:03:25.920> can

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
that don't know if you can see if I can

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.710 
that don't know if you can see if I can
get<00:03:26.160> in<00:03:26.310> close<00:03:26.519> enough<00:03:26.549> for<00:03:26.820> me<00:03:27.060> move<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.360> fan

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
get in close enough for me move this fan

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.300 
get in close enough for me move this fan
a<00:03:27.750> little<00:03:28.049> bit<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.350> can<00:03:28.500> see<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.890> heat<00:03:29.070> pipes

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
a little bit you can see the heat pipes

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.520 
a little bit you can see the heat pipes
going<00:03:29.730> from<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.600> cooler<00:03:30.840> that's<00:03:31.049> on<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.230> GPU

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
going from the cooler that's on the GPU

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.229 
going from the cooler that's on the GPU
to<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:31.980> heat<00:03:32.220> sink<00:03:32.459> over<00:03:32.670> here<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.060> what

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
to this heat sink over here so what

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.330 
to this heat sink over here so what
that's<00:03:33.480> actually<00:03:33.900> going<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.110> do<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.590> that's

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
that's actually going to do is that's

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.240 
that's actually going to do is that's
going<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.670> transfer<00:03:36.470> transfer<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.620> heat<00:03:37.650> from

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
going to transfer transfer the heat from

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.300 
going to transfer transfer the heat from
the<00:03:38.750> GPU<00:03:39.750> over<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.560> other<00:03:40.709> heat<00:03:40.980> sing<00:03:41.190> and

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
the GPU over to this other heat sing and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.740 
the GPU over to this other heat sing and
then<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.489> fan<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.790> going<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.120> cool<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.540> all

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
then this fan is going to cool that all

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.400 
then this fan is going to cool that all
off<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.799> also<00:03:44.010> see<00:03:44.750> if<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.959> can<00:03:46.110> see

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
off you can also see if you can see

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.069 
off you can also see if you can see
there<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:47.160> can<00:03:47.340> see<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:48.150> heat<00:03:48.630> sinks<00:03:48.959> down

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
there you can see the heat sinks down

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.949 
there you can see the heat sinks down
here<00:03:49.350> also<00:03:49.560> on<00:03:49.860> other<00:03:49.980> components<00:03:50.660> very<00:03:51.660> very

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
here also on other components very very

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.360 
here also on other components very very
nice<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.320> see<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.860> going<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.010> keep<00:03:53.130> this

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
nice to see that it's going to keep this

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.750 
nice to see that it's going to keep this
card<00:03:53.760> nice<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.660> cool<00:03:55.049> now<00:03:55.829> on<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.220> opposite

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
card nice and cool now on the opposite

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.580 
card nice and cool now on the opposite
side<00:03:57.000> here<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.690> can<00:03:57.810> see<00:03:57.930> there<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.140> an<00:03:58.260> Asus

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
side here you can see there is an Asus

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.470 
side here you can see there is an Asus
logo<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.250> going<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.430> sit<00:03:59.670> in<00:03:59.850> your<00:03:59.910> in

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
logo so this is going to sit in your in

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.050 
logo so this is going to sit in your in
your<00:04:00.540> taste<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.370> Asus<00:04:02.700> logo<00:04:02.760> is

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
your taste like this so the Asus logo is

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.319 
your taste like this so the Asus logo is
going<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.269> be<00:04:03.329> visible<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.870> course<00:04:04.590> now<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:06.120> do
