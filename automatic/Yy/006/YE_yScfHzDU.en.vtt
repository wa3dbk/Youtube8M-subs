00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.990
 Jacquat 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.620
 I think we went straight away we will download a file of seven 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.180
 hectares specified m 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 I will put the download link 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.900
 % and tumultuous 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.820
 proof 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.010
 work 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.860
 the goal 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 really when the whole family gets here 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.630
 you have the choice between two versions of software 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.470
 according to the night is that if these explanations have no problem in 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.960
 a press release 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.960
 you download your room and I can do what you did 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.720
 download installed 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.740
 once installed you will restart your computer because

 let it be 91 hours tomorrow limits 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.830
 so 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.830
 once at this stage 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.150
 it's very promising 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
 but what do you have to be chosen and hate 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.170
 you will surely be 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.170

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.810
 benisti d adana curious hate 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.670
 I put this site 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 in the world on which points 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.140
 do it customers 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 by day 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.650

 you excite dear and stops on this page with whom he is adorable 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.020
 Secondly 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.240
 then pushed back clause to take anyway not anything for example one 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:12.709
 a ps3 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.929
 so messi will be so you click on a year and a half 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:17.289

 so we will set aside internet 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.709
 so far on the desk 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.239

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.549
 she has raised the record according to the world gives it I understand door 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:37.439
 who cares 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.119
 take anything really what I would put first to save 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.369
 can be installed in two weeks 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.849
 so I was 6 3 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.629
 it's been eight months since I was born scm these cases not so much 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.399
 a small window opens 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.539
 that's it 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.209
 I go back on the internet it is copied 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.209
 average so copy the lines 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.079
 I think in the office

 once these copy 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.059
 his call 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.059
 an adult according to m 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.239
 plozÃ©vet 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.279
 click on ok 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.109
 a little mansoura rehearsal 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.569
 and it's downloading 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.599
 I do not have to download it because I was wise 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.419
 so off to say it's over 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.669
 very touched 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.669
 guys last brent points 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.099
 it's delete the filming your names you're going to have a record 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.509
 the gives 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.559
 the Toulon 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:00.009
 a month but I had already downloaded stage so to go on the 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.559
 search 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.559
 in this folder give rhythm 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.239
 for 100 m 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.809
 normally 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:14.269
 agent had to but these files on the desktop 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.459
 but percent 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.880
 the league asks if he again came up with the idea that this file 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.059
 that I need a hot summer of offices so we were going to make 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.430
 like that drunk 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.449
 this recourse to the agencies of the group 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:27.450
 you go 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.289
 open 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.930
 I know that I was the most sacred 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.680
 So here is 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.099
 and normally 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.340
 If you had 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.309
 hatchi that this info of external pointer 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.629
 as far as they are an office and move the folder 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.419
 connected on the lands of hers 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.479
 what I did me and so well 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.499
 so bad on the tuta so 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.839
 usually they tortoise we got a little green logo saying that his 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:56.839
 reserve to identify scene files 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.139
 so here you have a subscription 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.990
 download and install 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.080
 then if we want 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.949
 update it right click on it and make you hesitate dates 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.330
 very easy 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
 we have a name the whole team and people who often 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.669
 with regard to rosso takes 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.680
 So here is the part mans and nothing 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 this update but if you have other suspects 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.089
 at 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.439
 here it is 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.710
 and by side a tick region so apparently at bridging text in 

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:31.969
 the file to dole it is necessary to make a small unit it is necessary to copy the 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.830
 records that inside one of his acts 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.020
 so you do not understand you have a passage under forum and I you 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.349
 Explain 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.289
 otherwise it was not too fast 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.750
 because at the break after a first set where except that it exceeded 6 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:46.809
 minutes it is where the 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.529
 so that's all I think 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:51.930
 where is this steve 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.430
 so I mean my next tutorial 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.770
 alas more this forum for years at the APS
