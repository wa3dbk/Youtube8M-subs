that you've got your grid shown you're

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.840 
that you've got your grid shown you're
going<00:00:14.019> to<00:00:14.080> want<00:00:14.290> your<00:00:14.380> paintbrush<00:00:15.070> and<00:00:15.400> this

going to want your paintbrush and this

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.710 
going to want your paintbrush and this
tool<00:00:16.269> is<00:00:16.539> right<00:00:17.289> below<00:00:17.470> the<00:00:17.679> line<00:00:17.859> tool<00:00:18.720> right

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
tool is right below the line tool right

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.929 
tool is right below the line tool right
next<00:00:19.900> to<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.019> pencil<00:00:20.169> tool<00:00:20.499> and<00:00:20.820> you're<00:00:21.820> going

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
next to the pencil tool and you're going

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.159 
next to the pencil tool and you're going
to<00:00:21.999> want<00:00:22.179> it<00:00:22.300> doesn't<00:00:22.570> really<00:00:22.689> matter<00:00:22.929> what

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
to want it doesn't really matter what

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.749 
to want it doesn't really matter what
color<00:00:23.320> you<00:00:23.560> use<00:00:23.769> is<00:00:23.980> all<00:00:24.189> depending<00:00:24.579> on<00:00:24.609> you

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
color you use is all depending on you

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.450 
color you use is all depending on you
but<00:00:25.060> one<00:00:25.659> thing<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:26.019> absolutely<00:00:26.739> make<00:00:26.859> sure<00:00:27.310> of

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
but one thing to absolutely make sure of

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.479 
but one thing to absolutely make sure of
is<00:00:27.759> that<00:00:28.029> you<00:00:28.810> have<00:00:29.019> no<00:00:29.289> color<00:00:29.619> in<00:00:30.009> the<00:00:30.159> fill

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
is that you have no color in the fill

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.820 
is that you have no color in the fill
panel<00:00:31.179> but<00:00:31.390> in<00:00:31.509> your<00:00:31.599> stroke<00:00:31.989> panel<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:32.560> do

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
panel but in your stroke panel you do

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.130 
panel but in your stroke panel you do
have<00:00:33.160> color<00:00:33.430> because<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:35.050> you're

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
have color because what you're

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.780 
have color because what you're
essentially<00:00:35.500> drawing<00:00:35.920> is<00:00:36.010> lines<00:00:36.310> but<00:00:36.700> if

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
essentially drawing is lines but if

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.970 
essentially drawing is lines but if
you're<00:00:36.910> making<00:00:37.270> bubble<00:00:37.600> text<00:00:38.020> then<00:00:38.320> that's

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
you're making bubble text then that's

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.560 
you're making bubble text then that's
when<00:00:39.280> you're<00:00:39.430> going<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.610> want<00:00:39.790> your<00:00:39.910> fill<00:00:40.180> but

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
when you're going to want your fill but

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.220 
when you're going to want your fill but
for<00:00:40.900> now<00:00:41.020> we're<00:00:41.200> just<00:00:41.230> going<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.530> do<00:00:41.890> line<00:00:42.700> text

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
for now we're just going to do line text

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.440 
for now we're just going to do line text
so<00:00:44.230> zoom<00:00:44.530> in<00:00:44.710> close<00:00:45.700> enough<00:00:45.880> where<00:00:46.210> you<00:00:46.300> can

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
so zoom in close enough where you can

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
so zoom in close enough where you can
really<00:00:46.690> get<00:00:46.810> a<00:00:46.870> good<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.970> good<00:00:48.970> view<00:00:49.360> of<00:00:49.690> you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
really get a good a good view of you

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.090 
really get a good a good view of you
know<00:00:50.970> how<00:00:51.970> big<00:00:52.300> you<00:00:52.720> want<00:00:52.960> your<00:00:53.230> letter<00:00:53.740> to<00:00:53.950> be

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
know how big you want your letter to be

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.160 
know how big you want your letter to be
suppose<00:00:54.490> maybe<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:54.910> want<00:00:55.120> it<00:00:55.150> to<00:00:55.270> be<00:00:55.420> your

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
suppose maybe you want it to be your

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.230 
suppose maybe you want it to be your
capital<00:00:56.710> letters<00:00:57.040> where<00:00:57.400> an<00:00:57.490> entire<00:00:59.070> square

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
capital letters where an entire square

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.649 
capital letters where an entire square
so<00:01:01.240> it's<00:01:01.690> easy<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.200> define<00:01:02.650> this<00:01:02.890> just<00:01:03.280> by

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
so it's easy to define this just by

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.670 
so it's easy to define this just by
drawing<00:01:04.659> it<00:01:04.930> in<00:01:05.050> and<00:01:06.990> maybe<00:01:07.990> you're<00:01:08.230> deciding

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
drawing it in and maybe you're deciding

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.250 
drawing it in and maybe you're deciding
that<00:01:08.800> it's<00:01:08.980> too<00:01:09.250> small<00:01:09.610> but<00:01:10.000> that's<00:01:10.510> okay<00:01:10.930> for

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
that it's too small but that's okay for

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.440 
that it's too small but that's okay for
now<00:01:11.320> you<00:01:11.500> should<00:01:11.770> just<00:01:11.970> stick<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.240> grid

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
now you should just stick to the grid

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.950 
now you should just stick to the grid
because<00:01:14.220> later<00:01:15.220> on<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:16.150> can<00:01:16.300> make<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.659> bigger

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
because later on you can make it bigger

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.310 
because later on you can make it bigger
now<00:01:17.950> suppose<00:01:18.340> you're<00:01:19.000> not<00:01:19.600> very<00:01:19.870> comfortable

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
now suppose you're not very comfortable

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.740 
now suppose you're not very comfortable
with<00:01:20.590> how<00:01:20.830> thick<00:01:21.820> your<00:01:21.940> line<00:01:22.180> is<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.630> this<00:01:22.690> is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
with how thick your line is and this is

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.930 
with how thick your line is and this is
very<00:01:22.900> changeable<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.430> just<00:01:24.640> go<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.790> your

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
very changeable you just go to your

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.390 
very changeable you just go to your
selection<00:01:25.330> tool<00:01:25.720> which<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.229> on<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.950> left<00:01:27.190> up

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
selection tool which is on the left up

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.719 
selection tool which is on the left up
here

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
here

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.740 
here
and<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:30.040> select<00:01:30.370> your<00:01:30.940> what<00:01:31.630> you've

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
and then you select your what you've

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.230 
and then you select your what you've
drawn<00:01:32.049> your<00:01:32.140> path<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:32.770> up<00:01:33.670> in<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.000> top

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
drawn your path and up in the top

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.170 
drawn your path and up in the top
there's<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.960> stroke<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.560> stroke<00:01:36.159> panel<00:01:36.400> so<00:01:36.820> you

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
there's the stroke a stroke panel so you

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.110 
there's the stroke a stroke panel so you
can<00:01:37.390> change<00:01:37.780> your<00:01:37.930> stroke<00:01:38.200> weight<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.729> you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
can change your stroke weight if you

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.450 
can change your stroke weight if you
want<00:01:40.360> I'm<00:01:40.570> going<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.780> change<00:01:40.990> mine<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.320> 4<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
want I'm going to change mine to 4 and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.130 
want I'm going to change mine to 4 and
then<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:45.909> can<00:01:46.180> simply<00:01:46.479> just<00:01:46.630> go<00:01:46.780> back<00:01:46.960> to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
then you can simply just go back to

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.590 
then you can simply just go back to
drawing

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.550 

and<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.970> really<00:01:56.270> helps<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.840> count<00:01:57.200> how<00:01:57.500> many

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
and it really helps to count how many

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.020 
and it really helps to count how many
blocks<00:01:58.040> you're<00:01:58.430> using<00:01:59.290> for<00:02:00.290> example<00:02:00.380> I

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
blocks you're using for example I

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.000 
blocks you're using for example I
believe<00:02:02.030> there's<00:02:02.540> 8<00:02:02.810> yeah<00:02:03.140> there's<00:02:03.350> 8<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.830> it's

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
believe there's 8 yeah there's 8 so it's

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.910 
believe there's 8 yeah there's 8 so it's
8<00:02:04.220> tall<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:04.820> I'm<00:02:05.030> going<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.240> make<00:02:05.420> my<00:02:05.750> e<00:02:06.050> 4<00:02:06.620> tall

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
8 tall so I'm going to make my e 4 tall

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.850 
8 tall so I'm going to make my e 4 tall
because<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.510> want<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.869> be<00:02:09.020> about<00:02:09.320> half<00:02:09.560> way

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
because you want it to be about half way

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.060 
because you want it to be about half way
for<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> lowercase<00:02:10.790> or<00:02:11.890> if<00:02:12.890> you're

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
for a lowercase or if you're

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.500 
for a lowercase or if you're
uncomfortable<00:02:13.460> that<00:02:13.850> like<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.120> said<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.390> can

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
uncomfortable that like I said you can

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.140 
uncomfortable that like I said you can
change<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:16.220> I'm<00:02:16.340> just<00:02:16.490> doing<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.880> now<00:02:17.090> to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
change it but I'm just doing that now to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.870 
change it but I'm just doing that now to
keep<00:02:17.450> track<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.810> how<00:02:18.110> big<00:02:18.380> my<00:02:18.560> letters<00:02:18.860> are<00:02:19.040> now

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
keep track of how big my letters are now

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.350 
keep track of how big my letters are now
I'm<00:02:20.780> going<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.170> zoom<00:02:21.470> out<00:02:21.650> because<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.940> had<00:02:23.330> a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
I'm going to zoom out because I had a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.000 
I'm going to zoom out because I had a
hundred<00:02:23.630> percent<00:02:24.080> my<00:02:24.170> letters<00:02:24.470> seem<00:02:24.710> kind<00:02:24.950> of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
hundred percent my letters seem kind of

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.520 
hundred percent my letters seem kind of
small<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:26.240> I'm<00:02:26.750> going<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.050> go<00:02:27.170> ahead<00:02:27.260> and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
small so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.780 
small so I'm going to go ahead and
select<00:02:27.950> them<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.550> move<00:02:28.760> them<00:02:29.030> down<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.790> then

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
select them and move them down and then

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.130 
select them and move them down and then
I'm<00:02:31.910> just<00:02:32.060> going<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.330> change<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.780> size<00:02:32.990> of<00:02:33.050> my

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
I'm just going to change the size of my

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.310 
I'm just going to change the size of my
e<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.680> as<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.610> can<00:02:34.760> see<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.480> really<00:02:35.840> doesn't

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
e and as you can see it really doesn't

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.010 
e and as you can see it really doesn't
affect<00:02:36.350> at<00:02:36.800> all<00:02:37.010> when<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:39.940> when<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.120> resize

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
affect at all when you when you resize

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.280 
affect at all when you when you resize
it<00:02:42.260> because<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:44.450> illustrator<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.230> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
it because it's illustrator it's a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.800 
it because it's illustrator it's a
vector<00:02:45.470> program<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.090> definitely<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
vector program so this is definitely the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.960 
vector program so this is definitely the
ideal<00:02:48.560> program<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:49.190> use<00:02:49.280> when<00:02:49.730> you're

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
ideal program to use when you're

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.960 
ideal program to use when you're
designing<00:02:50.360> text<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:52.459> then<00:02:52.580> when<00:02:52.670> you're<00:02:52.790> done

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
designing text and then when you're done

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.660 
designing text and then when you're done
if<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.290> have<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> font<00:02:54.830> program<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.489> can

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
if you have a font program you can

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.800 
if you have a font program you can
probably<00:02:56.150> just<00:02:56.680> bring<00:02:57.680> these<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.070> that<00:02:58.810> but

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
probably just bring these in to that but

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.900 
probably just bring these in to that but
you<00:02:59.930> can't<00:03:00.140> make<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.380> font<00:03:00.739> on<00:03:01.010> illustrator<00:03:01.730> but

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
you can't make a font on illustrator but

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.780 
you can't make a font on illustrator but
this<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.150> great<00:03:02.330> place<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.570> design<00:03:03.050> it<00:03:03.790> my

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
this is a great place to design it my

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.490 
this is a great place to design it my
name<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.090> Alex<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:05.930> how<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.170> create

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
name is Alex and this is how you create

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.960 
name is Alex and this is how you create
custom<00:03:06.830> fonts<00:03:07.280> with<00:03:07.400> illustrator

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
custom fonts with illustrator

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.660 
custom fonts with illustrator
thank<00:03:08.480> you
