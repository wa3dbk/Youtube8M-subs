was watching them you're talking about
you<00:03:03.610> know<00:03:03.760> 3,000<00:03:04.480> views<00:03:04.570> versus<00:03:05.410> our<00:03:05.560> regular

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
you know 3,000 views versus our regular

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.730 
you know 3,000 views versus our regular
you<00:03:06.370> know<00:03:06.520> 10<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.350> 15,000<00:03:08.350> for<00:03:08.440> dumb<00:03:08.590> and

you know 10 to 15,000 for dumb and
dumber<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.100> we<00:03:09.220> have<00:03:09.490> to<00:03:09.670> think<00:03:09.700> about<00:03:10.090> the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
dumber so we have to think about the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.750 
dumber so we have to think about the
majority<00:03:10.630> put<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> ideas<00:03:11.710> down<00:03:11.950> I'll<00:03:12.220> put<00:03:12.730> a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
majority put the ideas down I'll put a

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.880 
majority put the ideas down I'll put a
pull-out<00:03:13.060> will<00:03:13.660> experiment<00:03:14.170> with<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.560> but

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
pull-out will experiment with it but

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.520 
pull-out will experiment with it but
again<00:03:15.190> if<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.300> don't<00:03:16.570> watch<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:17.050> we're<00:03:17.290> not

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
again if you don't watch it we're not

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.530 
again if you don't watch it we're not
going<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:17.830> continue<00:03:18.100> doing<00:03:18.550> them<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:18.910> this<00:03:19.360> is

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
going to continue doing them so this is

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.170
