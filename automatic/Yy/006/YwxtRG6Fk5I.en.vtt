00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.609
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.439
 tutorial 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.410
 today I come to show you how 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:14.370
 install the force for the main kraft 1 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.150
 point 6.4 in windows 8 is worth what 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.910
 You can first tell him that the forum is a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.000
 installer since motorcycle or charger is worth 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.340
 for minecraft 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.250
 Then the first thing we should do is 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.650
 download the file that will be in 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.489
 the description of the video in this case I 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.980
 I have it here it's worth here because I'm going to open 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.430
 you do not have to have this icon that is the 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.610
 java icon in this case remind you 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.699
 that if they have a windows 8 of 64 bits 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.879
 then they have to have installed the java 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:54.850
 of 32 and 64 to make them work 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.850
 well, then we're going to execute it 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.560
 OK, the installer opened it 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.290
 that we need first because it is the route 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.700
 of installation that as such the route that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.740
 stands out in the bottom part from the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.190
 original minecraft then that does not 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.700
 it serves we can get it then opening 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.490
 the minecraft is worth then I hope that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.729
 load us here at the bottom 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.210
 right where says edith profile him 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.010
 we click and a window opens in 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.270
 this window we enable the option that 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.030
 says game directory and the route that is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.869
 next we are going to copy it here we give 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.240
 cancel we close the minecraft and in the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.500
 installer of the forum in the three points 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.630
 suspensive 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.570
 we click on it, a new one opens 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.970
 window and it's in the lower part where 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 they are blue which is the route that is 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.260
 currently we delete it and paste the one 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.440
 we just copied 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.920
 we give in open 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.070
 and then marked again the option that 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.130
 the customer is urged 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.060
 we accept 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.679
 there he tells us that they have installed 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.520
 satisfactorily as the porsche 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.670
 We give in accept it now we execute 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.090

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.560

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.560
 Well , we are going to start the minecraft 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.620
 You see it here as it has already begun 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.980

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.450

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.850
 OK 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.330
 that has loaded three motorcycles those three 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.819

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.480

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.700
