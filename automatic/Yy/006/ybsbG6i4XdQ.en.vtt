00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
materials are we looking at here well at

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.920 
materials are we looking at here well at
the<00:01:23.670> time<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> review<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.600> knife<00:01:24.780> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930

the time of the review the knife is
about<00:01:25.110> 20<00:01:25.439> bucks<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.890> expect<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> popular

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
about 20 bucks so expect the popular

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.929 
about 20 bucks so expect the popular
440c<00:01:27.720> stainless<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.500> said<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> edge<00:01:29.759> is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939

440c stainless that said the edge is
fine<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.540> found<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.110> could<00:01:31.829> cut<00:01:31.979> through<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
fine and I found I could cut through a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.620 
fine and I found I could cut through a
ton<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> shit<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> blade<00:01:33.119> stay<00:01:33.360> pretty

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
ton of shit and the blade stay pretty

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.560 
ton of shit and the blade stay pretty
sharp<00:01:34.729> long-term<00:01:35.729> testing<00:01:36.150> we'll<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.420> how

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
sharp long-term testing we'll see how

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.840 
sharp long-term testing we'll see how
well<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.140> made<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.530> hold<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.860> with

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
well it can be made to hold up with

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.580 
well it can be made to hold up with
regular<00:01:39.270> maintenance<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.200> has<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> heavy

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
regular maintenance but it has a heavy

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
and it carries deep in your pocket so it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.990 
and it carries deep in your pocket so it
doesn't<00:02:09.959> appear<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.200> big<00:02:10.610> if<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.819> don't

is not ideal for deployment the clip can
be<00:02:22.630> moved<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.650> scale<00:02:23.890> side<00:02:24.190> but

be moved so it's on the scale side but

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.330 
be moved so it's on the scale side but
still<00:02:24.850> only<00:02:24.970> tip<00:02:25.270> up<00:02:25.450> which<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.890> know<00:02:26.980> tip<00:02:27.220> up

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
still only tip up which you know tip up

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.680 
still only tip up which you know tip up
is<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.550> way<00:02:27.640> most<00:02:27.760> people<00:02:28.060> carry<00:02:28.270> them<00:02:28.420> anyway

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
is the way most people carry them anyway

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.500 
is the way most people carry them anyway
I<00:02:28.900> prefer<00:02:29.740> blade<00:02:30.130> forward<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:30.970> either<00:02:31.300> need

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
I prefer blade forward so I either need

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.000 
I prefer blade forward so I either need
to<00:02:31.570> switch<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:31.990> clip<00:02:32.320> or<00:02:32.560> carry<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:32.980> my

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
to switch the clip or carry it in my

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.640 
to switch the clip or carry it in my
right<00:02:33.190> pocket<00:02:33.250> using<00:02:34.180> my<00:02:34.450> v<00:02:34.780> gene<00:02:35.200> pocket

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
right pocket using my v gene pocket

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.460 
right pocket using my v gene pocket
which<00:02:36.550> makes<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:37.000> more<00:02:37.180> conspicuous<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:38.320> now

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
which makes it more conspicuous but now

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.750 
which makes it more conspicuous but now
it's<00:02:38.650> easier<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.040> match<00:02:39.190> your<00:02:39.340> orange<00:02:39.610> shirt

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
it's easier to match your orange shirt

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.310 
it's easier to match your orange shirt
with<00:02:39.910> something<00:02:40.240> right<00:02:40.390> because<00:02:41.050> that's<00:02:41.140> a

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
with something right because that's a

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.090 
with something right because that's a

hair close-ups cool alright first here's
a<00:03:18.790> super<00:03:19.180> scientific<00:03:19.570> stick<00:03:19.960> test<00:03:20.200> first<00:03:20.770> to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
a super scientific stick test first to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.890 
a super scientific stick test first to

get a stick preferably from the ground

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.350 
get a stick preferably from the ground
and<00:03:23.170> see<00:03:24.130> how<00:03:24.250> long<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.460> takes<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.820> cut

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
and see how long it takes you to cut

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.840 
and see how long it takes you to cut
through<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.720> roadkill<00:03:26.680> works<00:03:27.160> too<00:03:27.430> although<00:03:27.730> I

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
through it roadkill works too although I

ok<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.240> now<00:03:34.990> let's<00:03:35.020> see<00:03:35.290> if<00:03:35.350> we<00:03:35.410> can<00:03:35.530> find<00:03:35.680> a

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
ok so now let's see if we can find a

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.300 
ok so now let's see if we can find a
shrub<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.810> prune<00:03:37.810> personal<00:03:38.680> safety<00:03:39.040> aside
