00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
easy just kind of look at the design a

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.830 
easy just kind of look at the design a
little<00:02:55.530> bit<00:02:55.769> closer<00:02:55.980> as<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.510> start<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.540> look<00:02:57.629> at

little bit closer as we start to look at
the<00:02:57.930> back<00:02:59.269> it's<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.480> smooth<00:03:01.040> design<00:03:02.040> there's<00:03:02.400> no

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
the back it's a smooth design there's no

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.490 
the back it's a smooth design there's no
kind<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.790> imprints<00:03:03.239> or<00:03:03.329> anything<00:03:03.569> like<00:03:03.629> that
