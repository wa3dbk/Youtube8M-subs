00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.439
 tasty zucchini in hours and that 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.060
 boiled nothing else in salt water look what 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.230
 I 'm going to do what I 'm going to need 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.770
 it's pumpkin maybe my zucchini I'm going to 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.279
 need garlic a clove of garlic and a 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.790
 piece of onion I will need salt and 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.739
 is the salt and a little cilantro if not 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.500
 They have cilantro can also add 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.079
 peace or tea and to serve them 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.239
 I'm going to need lemon and a green chile 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.609
 so the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.900
 say it is to take the shot 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.780
 zucchini 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.810
 I'm not going to cook it with fat, not nothing 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.560
 now I take it away 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.700
 what is the shot the good seat 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.000
 then he grabbed and beak my pumpkin 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.920
 look, I'm going to make big pieces 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.920
 I'm not going to do it in very small pieces 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.280
 is more let's change we're going to 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.200
 do it in hairlines 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.270
 in rajas nothing else I'm going to do for 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.750
 so that it does not get lost and enters the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.750
 casserole 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.530
 big too so so small because 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.530
 with the pumpkin family is girl 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.020
 then there is 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.180
 Creole squash is the zucchini if 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.430
 you do not find them where 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.979
 you live by so when it 's 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.509
 temporary water so many people the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.509
 sowing in the field and 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.030
 but if they do not have these zucchini, 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.950
 worry that they can be 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.570
 this 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.570
 can do the other 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.440
 ah 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.700
 adding it to the pan but not yet 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.700
 there is the added in the pot 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.959
 Once my zucchini is gone 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.780
 then I have my little house 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.710
 then I will add water in the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.610
 casserole 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.810
 a little water 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.350
 with this water because if not then here 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.330
 same added the crushed garlic with the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.970
 knife or with molcajete stone 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.680
 we can crush him then he added the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.939
 garlic added the onion 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.640
 added so much salt so much salt nothing else goes 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.620
 to taste 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.680
 no high arias and I need you 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.230
 I would put more then I put it to boil 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.990
 for 5 minutes just boil the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.660
 water with that boil and then I go and you 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.700
 loose the zucchini let boil 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.600
 water and now I show them to 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.600
 take advantage of the zucchini 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.579
 as you can see then and our 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.099
 orbit boiled together with the onion and the 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:19.609
 waved noyola 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.069
 so the garlic already I know that it is a co 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.459
 whole truth 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.650
 and a clove of garlic and onion in 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.870
 slices and I want to get them out now yes 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.819
 I can take it out before eating melo 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.470
 but the onion also very delicious 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:38.890
 then I'm going added in the zucchini 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.800
 it is a fat-free but very tasty meal 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.610
 very delicious 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.940
 in the middle I told them I'm going to do some 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.550

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.610
 and me so eating very very healthy very 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.100

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.489

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.720
 onion that many have to say what 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.980
 food so more more this simple truth 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.459
 but it's not very tasty 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.010
 This food is like a diet for many 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.650
 people who forbid them to eat fat or 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:27.910

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.950

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.750
 prepared as well as I tell him if they want 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.050
 they can remove the onion and garlic 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.410
 to be able to eat it but if they are not like that 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.330
 that goes inside everything and then I 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.139
 I'm going to do it, I'm going to accompany it with 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.110
