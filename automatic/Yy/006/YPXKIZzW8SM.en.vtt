00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.939
 taxed jacob because I'm with 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.610
 him rule more time let's clarify 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.070
 Renesmee who is Jacob Jacob is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.009
 Monster project operator is a bachelor though 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.420
 already a former operator so what did you do 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.820
 on a date which was 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.159
 designed to communicate with the hulk I 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 before gluing you was not familiar but 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.500
 when well I saw him on the project we 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.479
 they talked to him he told not a couple 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.740
 jokes and for me this time has flown by 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.060
 very quickly and hold on me offended 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.060
 market estimate realized that you 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.630
 it was more interesting to communicate jake than you 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.509
 with holt 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.430
 you can say that and the girl I love 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.159
 soup with me on the contrary, they tended 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.600
 and for the first time in so much time i am with you 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.600
 felt the attention of men 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.060
 let me ask jacob jacob 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.670
 still working on the project no I'm not 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.100
 I work on a project because I thought 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.219
 what if I became the cause of leaving the Rennesmee 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.829
 then I must go too, send and 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.770
 so enough operators and without me you 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.470
 now there is no spectrum until you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.200
 just friends and we'll see 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.960
 Now let's move on to another topic with us. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.940
 Yesterday was a fortune teller 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.070
 who predicted which of the girls 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.590
 best suited to our bachelor 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.770
 she predicted that most 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.230
 hall fit torrey let's meet 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.810
 grandmother fortune teller hello 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.150
 all yes really the hand of God tail 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.900
 just fit the tour or for her right away 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.150
 saw yes indeed but we have 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.340
 information to shoot relatives 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.490
 so we think it was 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.270
 arrangement yes I know this is grandma 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.990
 torment me with unfamiliar grandmothers 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.990
 grandma and my granddaughters are the best 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.420
 so winning access is up to the side only 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.060
 she purposely learned that the fortune teller 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.590
 prophetess relative Torelli 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.530
 so we will count the number of all the girls 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.920
 equal chance of winning a prediction 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.560
 was false and it was a post show project 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.600
