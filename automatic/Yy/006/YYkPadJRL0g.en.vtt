00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:11.260
 This is the world's fastest helicopter 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.260
 August was long lance 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.320
 military helicopters like these are not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.860
 could function without integer 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.970
 loses sensors and cameras to protect them 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.970
 ordinary glass will do 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.190
 durable glass is not made of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.810
 sapphires 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.810
 but how is it made 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.840
 sapphire are not the most valuable gems they 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.239
 rarely found in nature and stone 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 the size of a pea will cost 2000 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:56.480
 dollars but even for the costly other 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.480
 equipment is too high price 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.400
 Well, that was found a way to help 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
 Mother Nature 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.680
 80 kilometers south of perth at the very 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.510
 the edge of the australian wastelands is located 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.510
 baxi goods days i can't lie 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.370
 on this one the springs get more 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.370
 12 million tons of bauxite and ore per year 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.000
 ore is transported to nearby 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.610
 mining and processing plant 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.830
 pindara where it is converted to aluminum oxide 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.710
 white powder is oxide and you menu 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.330
 raw material for making lumia but this 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.369
 unremarkable white powder has and 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.630
 another amazing quality if its 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.450
 heat it to the desired temperature it 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.399
 will turn sapphire 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.680
 natural sapphire formed millions 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.570
 years ago small patches of cocido 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.200
 high altitude lumen mountain tour 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.670
 turned into strong gems 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.679
 but the army cannot wait for millions of years 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.450
 some kind of glass and so we 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.810
 go to the other end of the earth 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.810
 of the ball 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.640
 combine operator after all he is a technology in chicago 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.640
 grown drunk in just a couple of weeks 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.530
 the process starts with 200 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.599
 kilograms of alumina alumina 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.730
 load special wanted and heated 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.190
 to a temperature of two thousand 200 degrees 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.319
 it's only half as hot 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.330
 surface of the sun then into the melting 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:31.819
 boiler with alumina lowered open 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.690
 rod called priming under 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.930
 high temperature exposure 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:41.030
 alumina cry then operator 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.269
 begin to slowly reduce the temperature in 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.269
 the boiler 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.050
 as the molten mass cools 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.970
 starts to crystallize around 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.420
 delivery to the turned not sapphires so 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.470
 it takes up to two weeks 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.060
 the resulting transparent 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.910
 huge drop-shaped stone 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.030
 it is called a Statement 200 kilograms 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:13.240
 he has light since it is the purest 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.710
 sapphire blue sapphires gain 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.150
 characteristic color from the admixture of others 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.560
 substances such as iron and chrome this 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.570
 giant gem hardly impresses 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.240
 your girlfriend for the day you are such to her 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.520
 finger moreover he is that finger and 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.140
 crush but from such a crystal can 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.190
 make any products that require 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.190
 high strength 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.170
 no matter what sapphire glass is for 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.420
 designed for helicopter camera for 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.220
 lasers or for watches it should be 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.810
 transparent 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.310
 Firstly it is a solid crystal need 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.930
 somehow start to cut usually 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.600
 blanks for different diameters 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.350
 but cut 2 hardness mineral on 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.610
 the planet is far from being so simple 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.440
 It is obvious that the problem is solved most 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.440
 solid mineral and we 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.880
 this course is diamond tipped 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.650
 rotating at a speed of one and a half thousand 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.660
 rpm cuts out bully 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.410
 cylinder and like a knife involved in 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.410
 apple wine 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.460
 the end remains an empty shell which 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.460
 send the smelter 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.850
 these white crystal cylinders are similar 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.850
 on ice sculpture 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.070
 but so they will not be long 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.449
 for making clear glass 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.110
 plates sort cylinder cut 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.110
 like a sausage stick 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.360
 similar task requires high accuracy 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.260
 as each plate should be 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.260
 millimeter thick 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.509
 the cut is made by steel wire 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.509
 thick human hair 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.840
 ring wire 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.840
 cuts simultaneously up to 300 cylinders 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.550
 the catch is that it is only steel not 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.870
 able to cut sapphire it will tear 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.240
 overheating 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.070
 solution to the problem of abrasive slurry with 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.520
 the addition of diamond dust which 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.690
 water right 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.450
 the wire slides over the cylinders with 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.940
 speed of 9 meters per second swinging 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.680
 movements diamond dust allows 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.080
 to cut akter as easily as 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.060
 this set is smooth as a result 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.510
 surface and evenness of five thousandths 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.510
 millimeter 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.620
 which is enough 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.820
 after all the glass on the infrared camera 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.980
 the helicopter should be perfect 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.600
 transparent flat and durable to 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.050
 coping work even in the most 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.350
 the harsh conditions of which she is required 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.350
 will turn out 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.540
 but
