00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.509 
now originally I was using this just
this<00:02:38.900> for<00:02:39.139> my<00:02:39.230> lightsaber<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.129> of<00:02:40.219> course<00:02:40.430> see

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
this for my lightsaber and of course see

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.679 
this for my lightsaber and of course see
you<00:02:40.609> know<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.849> little<00:02:41.060> flat

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
you know it's a little flat

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.599 
you know it's a little flat
so<00:02:41.870> what<00:02:42.409> I<00:02:42.439> did<00:02:42.650> was<00:02:42.950> take<00:02:43.099> a<00:02:43.159> little<00:02:43.459> duct

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
so what I did was take a little duct

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.819 
so what I did was take a little duct
tape<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:44.180> know<00:02:44.269> put<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:47.290> poster<00:02:48.290> board<00:02:48.470> wrap

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
tape you know put the poster board wrap

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.849 
tape you know put the poster board wrap
it<00:02:49.010> around<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.400> now<00:02:49.909> what<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.209> can<00:02:50.450> do<00:02:50.599> is<00:02:50.959> if<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
it around it now what I can do is if the

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.860 
it around it now what I can do is if the
scene<00:02:52.069> calls<00:02:52.939> for<00:02:53.150> me<00:02:53.359> to<00:02:53.480> turn<00:02:53.689> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
scene calls for me to turn the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.170 
scene calls for me to turn the
lightsaber<00:02:54.200> on<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.799> can<00:02:56.109> take<00:02:57.109> my<00:02:57.260> base<00:02:58.000> show<00:02:59.000> it

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
lightsaber on I can take my base show it

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.229 
lightsaber on I can take my base show it
as<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.599> then<00:03:00.560> after<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.129> lightsabers<00:03:01.639> on

using the lightsaber you've got to do

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.589 
using the lightsaber you've got to do
key<00:04:09.709> framing<00:04:10.009> and<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.790> realize<00:04:11.150> that<00:04:11.180> it's<00:04:11.509> a

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
key framing and I realize that it's a

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.110 
key framing and I realize that it's a
pain<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:12.530> if<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.549> want<00:04:13.699> to<00:04:13.729> make<00:04:13.849> it<00:04:13.939> a<00:04:13.970> 5

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
pain so if you want to make it a 5

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.089 
pain so if you want to make it a 5
second<00:04:14.509> clip<00:04:14.659> that's<00:04:15.079> fine<00:04:15.349> too

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
because like I said I understand the key

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.680 
because like I said I understand the key
