00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.300 
them as a backup striker with ederoar
Martinez<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.890> build<00:01:29.070> them<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
Martinez or you can build them in a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.950 
Martinez or you can build them in a
Spanish<00:01:29.670> team<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.210> entirely<00:01:30.479> sure<00:01:30.630> how

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
