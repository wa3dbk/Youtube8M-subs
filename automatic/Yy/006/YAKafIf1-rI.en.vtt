00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.260
 introduce the new tripod 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.269
 235 had for travelers 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.639
 demanding to be able to take a 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.690
 tripod at the same time light and allowing 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.970
 bear to my size I'm worth 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.340
 it is gone this compound triptych 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.590
 entirely of aluminum with five cubes 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.099
 in rubber flu helps to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.380
 carry the central column 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.210
 folds inside the pine which 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.660
 allows compactness and transport 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.489
 ease to open it one to dismiss 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.270
 the feet get out the central column and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.149
 greenhouse and the little screw here is the foot 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.980
 is ready is used so the tripod is 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.649
 unfolds thanks to valves so very 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.539
 simply if you want to adjust the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.039
 rigidity of youtube you can aim or 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.930
 unscrew with an allen foot 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.090
 so it's very handy over time 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.579
 to just always have a 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.660
 visit erige been optimal or for yves 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.670
 and the spacing of the tripod 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 we can use this button which allows 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.659
 three levels of spacing up 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.460
 about 85 degrees so that's more 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.680
 practical if you want to make a catch 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.600
 very close to the ground or enlarge 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.760
 spacing to have stability 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.380
 more important 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.400
 so this tripod can support up to 6 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.990
 kg of load 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.850
 you may well put it 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.060
 hybrid or in SLRs like this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.729
 nikon d7000 with a goal plays 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.340
 focal fixed without problem if 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.570
 you have a full frame box there that 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.430
 always get in the nails at the level 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.590
 weight but the tripod could 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.130
 may have tended to lacked 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.869
 stability 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.360
 so this tripod is provided with the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.930
 50 years old tbh patella which is very easy 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.970
 of use 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.210
 you can use the setting of 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.270
 horizontal level this way for 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.430
 adjust the ball head 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.810
 you can turn us this mechanism 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.790
 is there you have the choice until all 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.500
 the settings possibilities we have 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.869
 also a spirit level present on 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.520
 the on the hoof that helps maintain 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.979
 the device to be able to always have 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.420
 the housing align the central bar is 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.090
 also adjustable in height for a 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.780
 bridge he justly facilitated 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.420
 in this way then if you ever 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.010
 want to do one more plans 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.970
 near the floor so you can the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.660
 return this way check well 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.069
 that your device is well fixed 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:34.410
 then we make the settings 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:36.209
 corresponding but for example there as 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.739
 these one is near the ground 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.420
 so it is possible to replace the 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.209
 central column by this small accessory 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.610
 macro that comes to take the place of the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.220
 central column and which therefore allows 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.880
 able to align the tripod almost 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.069
 ground level 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.319
 you can still screwed the kneecap 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.720
 present on the tripod on this on this 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.340
 small accessory that will allow you to 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.629
 able to take very macro shots 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.459
 close to the ground so as on 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.790
 many models to have only vanguard 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.310
 you have in the end the possibility of 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.510
 adjust the foot so with a small peak 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.930
 when you are on a field 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.180
 sandy where the land is a rubber 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.280
 so that makes it easy to use 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.079
 so in town on the tar rocks 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.239
 to accompany this tripod look at it 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.630
 offers the bag vo 37 which is a 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.519
 compartment so dedicated to the tripod so 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.980
 there as you see he can go there a 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.880
 tripod in the bag so is the tripod 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.459
 is not stingy in so that's enough 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.019
 interesting if you want discrete and at 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.720
 the inside of the ca which also so 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.030
 of course a behavior so for 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.889
 able to carry photo material and 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.989
 if you want to use this bag without the 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:43.200
 tripod you can change the inserts 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.849
 photo for a deeper insert that 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.500
 you will carry a case 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.049
 with a bigger zoom so for 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.780
 conclude the vanguard 235 ab but a 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.810
 tripod both compact and lightweight with 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.239
 its 1 kg 5 and its maximum support of 6 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.260
 kg it will be an ideal companion for your 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.190
 traveling 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.769
 what we liked is his 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.049
 compactness and the clever system of 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.269
 storage of the central column at 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.040
 inside the tripods 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.930
 negatives are its stability 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.120
 average where it is indicated for a 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.669
 maximum program of 6 kg we made 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.320
 tests with a school of 800 and 24 70 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.940
 we are much more 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.590
 low compared to these six kilos and one 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.150
 find that stability is already a little 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.800
 less less good so you 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.380
 advise to use this tripod for 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.730
 a mid range SLR but not 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.180
 necessarily for a camera of 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.800
 heavy 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.600
 if you want an even more tripod 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.490
 lightweight and sturdy you can also 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.470
 you turn on the carbon range that 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.630
 will be there a little more expensive so there for 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.170
 the rates are 199 euros for this 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.350
 tripod and patella at 99 euros for the 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.870
 bag that is also adapted vocal 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.400
 tripod here for this test thank you for us 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.240
 have followed and see you very soon for 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.240
 new hardware tests
