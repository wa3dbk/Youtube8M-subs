very first version of this story it was
not<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> clone<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:07.080> was<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> child<00:00:07.849> it<00:00:08.849> was<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> an

not a clone it was a child it was a an
unknown<00:00:11.370> summer<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:13.490> I<00:00:14.690> felt<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.929> was

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
unknown summer and I felt that was

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.570 
unknown summer and I felt that was
territory<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.400> had<00:00:17.490> been<00:00:17.699> covered<00:00:18.690> before

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
territory that had been covered before

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.290 
territory that had been covered before
rather<00:00:20.580> regularly<00:00:21.439> and<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.789> might<00:00:24.060> lead

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
rather regularly and that it might lead

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.189 
rather regularly and that it might lead
to<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.769> somewhat<00:00:25.769> sentimental<00:00:26.580> or<00:00:27.199> emotionally

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
to a somewhat sentimental or emotionally

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.299 
to a somewhat sentimental or emotionally
inappropriate<00:00:28.980> development<00:00:30.380> then<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
inappropriate development then the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.370 
inappropriate development then the
notion<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> clone<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.570> suggested<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
notion of the clone was suggested and I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.400 
notion of the clone was suggested and I
thought<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.040> brilliant<00:00:36.410> because

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
thought that it was brilliant because

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.139 
thought that it was brilliant because
all<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> same<00:00:38.340> connections<00:00:38.879> are<00:00:39.030> there

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
all the same connections are there

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
all the same connections are there
except<00:00:39.570> they're<00:00:39.719> even<00:00:39.989> more<00:00:40.020> intense<00:00:40.500> you're

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
except they're even more intense you're

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.170 
except they're even more intense you're
not<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.219> looking<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.610> somebody<00:00:41.940> who<00:00:42.090> is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
not just looking at somebody who is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.920 
not just looking at somebody who is
genetically<00:00:42.920> similar<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.430> looking<00:00:44.730> at

genetically similar you're looking at

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.190 
genetically similar you're looking at
yourself<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.940> rather<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.899> might<00:00:49.079> have

yourself or rather as you might have

even first six months that's something
that<00:01:18.869> I've<00:01:19.140> always<00:01:19.430> felt<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.270> most<00:01:21.509> potent

that I've always felt is the most potent

that I've always felt is the most potent
influence<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.790> world<00:01:23.970> around<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.509> how

influence it is the world around you how

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.679 
influence it is the world around you how
you<00:01:24.780> were<00:01:24.990> treated<00:01:25.610> how<00:01:26.610> people<00:01:26.970> respond<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689

you that lay down the foundations of a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.100 
you that lay down the foundations of a
personality<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.329> in<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.479> case<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:34.020> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
personality and in this case we see it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.450 
personality and in this case we see it
vividly<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.680> course<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
vividly of course because of the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730 
vividly of course because of the
contrasting<00:01:36.090> background<00:01:36.270> shins<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.470> card

contrasting background shins on the card

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.289 
contrasting background shins on the card
I<00:01:39.259> know<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.650> tom<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:40.920> nervous<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
I know that tom was nervous the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.780 
I know that tom was nervous the
beginning<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.170> think<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.860> perhaps<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
beginning I think this is perhaps the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.060 
beginning I think this is perhaps the
largest<00:01:45.600> screen<00:01:46.110> role<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.380> he's<00:01:46.530> had<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
largest screen role that he's had and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.340 
largest screen role that he's had and
it's<00:01:47.850> much<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> large<00:01:48.780> role<00:01:49.079> but

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it's much as that it's a large role but

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.600 
it's much as that it's a large role but
he<00:01:49.530> has<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> carry<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.610> weight<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
he has to carry the weight of the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.380 
he has to carry the weight of the
antagonist<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.829> Star<00:01:56.460> Trek<00:01:56.490> movie

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
months in filming this I felt that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.090 
months in filming this I felt that
keeping<00:02:41.790> some<00:02:41.970> distance<00:02:42.390> between<00:02:42.630> us<00:02:43.100> was

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
keeping some distance between us was

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.150 
keeping some distance between us was
proper<00:02:45.260> if<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.410> don't<00:02:46.590> know<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:46.800> much<00:02:47.100> about

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
life to be a life in front of the camera

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.850 
life to be a life in front of the camera
and<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:57.510> course<00:02:57.720> well<00:02:57.990> from<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.320> small<00:02:58.650> talk

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and of course well from the small talk

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.410 
and of course well from the small talk
of<00:02:59.100> sitting<00:02:59.490> around<00:02:59.550> waiting<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.060> work<00:03:00.270> of

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
of sitting around waiting to work of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.820 
of sitting around waiting to work of
which<00:03:00.540> even<00:03:00.870> then<00:03:01.020> there<00:03:01.260> was<00:03:01.350> very<00:03:01.590> very

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
which even then there was very very

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.530 
which even then there was very very
little<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:03.769> wanted<00:03:04.769> if<00:03:05.430> there<00:03:05.640> was<00:03:05.760> an<00:03:05.910> edge<00:03:06.150> in

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
little I wanted if there was an edge in

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.090 
little I wanted if there was an edge in
the<00:03:06.630> relationship<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.380> wanted<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.950> be

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the relationship I wanted it to be

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.720 
the relationship I wanted it to be
visible<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.420> camera<00:03:09.750> rolled<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:11.250> to

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
visible and the camera rolled and so to

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.479 
visible and the camera rolled and so to
that<00:03:11.880> extent<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.769> think<00:03:13.769> we<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.670> both<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.090> us

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
that extent I think we we both of us

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.380 
that extent I think we we both of us
were<00:03:17.630> cautious<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.989> other<00:03:19.230> one<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.820> her

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
were cautious of the other one so her

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.970 
were cautious of the other one so her
somewhat<00:03:21.720> late<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.110> life<00:03:22.260> yes<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.800> have

somewhat late in life yes I have

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.530 
somewhat late in life yes I have
developed<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.489> real<00:03:23.700> interest<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.209> one<00:03:24.390> that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
developed this real interest to one that

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.530 
developed this real interest to one that
I'd<00:03:24.690> like<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.230> pursue<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.860> little<00:03:26.100> further<00:03:26.540> and
