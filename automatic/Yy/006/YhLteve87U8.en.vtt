00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
home they can you know treat brown

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
home they can you know treat brown
people<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.110> foreign<00:01:40.470> land<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.920> terrorists

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
people in a foreign land as terrorists

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.830 
people in a foreign land as terrorists
but<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.610> gonna<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.850> very<00:01:41.909> difficult<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.630> make

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
but it's gonna be very difficult to make

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.520 
but it's gonna be very difficult to make
Joe<00:01:43.619> Smith<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.189> Milwaukee<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.479> terrorist<00:01:46.290> when

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
Joe Smith in Milwaukee a terrorist when

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.920 
Joe Smith in Milwaukee a terrorist when
he<00:01:46.649> looks<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> breathes<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> goes<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.750> church

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
he looks and breathes and goes to church

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
he looks and breathes and goes to church
and<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.409> other<00:01:49.500> stuff<00:01:49.619> simply<00:01:50.520> because

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and all that other stuff simply because

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.219 
and all that other stuff simply because
he<00:01:51.000> has<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> gun<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.509> we've<00:01:51.750> been<00:01:51.869> doing<00:01:52.200> for

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
he has a gun that we've been doing for

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.789 
he has a gun that we've been doing for
200<00:01:53.009> years<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.659> don't<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.530> gun

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
200 years so I don't think that this gun

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.310 
200 years so I don't think that this gun
control<00:01:56.430> thing<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.759> going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.990> far

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
control thing is going to go very far

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.980 
control thing is going to go very far
despite<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> does<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.930> sure

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
despite all that and if it does I'm sure

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.630 
despite all that and if it does I'm sure
a<00:02:01.170> lot<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.409> politicians<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> go<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
a lot of politicians are going to go and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.010 
a lot of politicians are going to go and
if<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> does<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.450> lot<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.630> people<00:02:03.719> are

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
if it does I think a lot of people are

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
if it does I think a lot of people are
simply<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> ignore<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.790> there's<00:02:06.000> no

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
simply going to ignore it but there's no

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.940 
simply going to ignore it but there's no
way<00:02:06.479> we're<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> point<00:02:07.829> where

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
way we're going to get to a point where

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.880 
way we're going to get to a point where
I<00:02:08.069> United<00:02:08.759> States<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.060> disarmed<00:02:09.569> yeah<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.739> is

I United States is disarmed yeah this is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.470 
I United States is disarmed yeah this is

just a talking point they're certainly
not<00:02:12.569> going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.959> go<00:02:13.080> into<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.410> homes<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.739> you

their heads blown off and you know

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.630 
their heads blown off and you know
another<00:02:19.500> thing<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.860> comes<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.250> part<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.550> this

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
another thing that comes as part of this

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.210 
another thing that comes as part of this
question<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.270> you're<00:02:22.170> talking<00:02:22.500> about<00:02:22.620> you

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
question is you're talking about you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.979 
question is you're talking about you
know<00:02:23.340> how<00:02:23.580> will<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.849> people<00:02:23.970> react<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.750> I

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
know how will the people react and I

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.589 
know how will the people react and I
almost<00:02:25.590> took<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.040> question<00:02:26.430> asking<00:02:27.300> about

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
almost took the question asking about

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.540 
almost took the question asking about
would<00:02:27.900> there<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.080> potential<00:02:29.010> secession

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
would there be potential secession

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.820 
would there be potential secession
movements<00:02:30.090> going<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.170> nation<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.770> in

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
movements going on in this nation and in

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.250 
movements going on in this nation and in
Europe<00:02:32.239> for<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.390> matter<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> coming

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
Europe for that matter in the coming

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.540 
Europe for that matter in the coming
years<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.680> believe<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> hundred<00:02:35.459> percent

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
years and I believe a hundred percent

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.160 
years and I believe a hundred percent
that<00:02:35.940> that's<00:02:36.300> going<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.600> be<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> endgame<00:02:37.110> I

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
that that's going to be the endgame I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.530 
that that's going to be the endgame I
think<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:38.459> like<00:02:38.580> Greece<00:02:38.910> will<00:02:39.150> either<00:02:39.300> be

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
think just like Greece will either be

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.240 
think just like Greece will either be
expelled<00:02:39.959> or<00:02:40.200> all<00:02:40.380> totally<00:02:40.800> kicked<00:02:41.040> out<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
expelled or all totally kicked out I

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.650 
expelled or all totally kicked out I
think<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.640> same<00:02:41.819> thing<00:02:42.000> will<00:02:42.120> happen<00:02:42.150> over

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
think the same thing will happen over

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.449 
think the same thing will happen over
here<00:02:42.690> there's<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.290> be<00:02:43.319> groups<00:02:44.250> of

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
here there's going to be groups of

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.520 
here there's going to be groups of
people<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:45.060> feel<00:02:45.599> strongly<00:02:45.989> enough<00:02:46.260> about

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
people that feel strongly enough about

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.309 
people that feel strongly enough about
about<00:02:47.250> how<00:02:47.489> powerful<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.150> go<00:02:48.300> how<00:02:48.840> evil<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
about how powerful to go how evil the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.630 
about how powerful to go how evil the
government's<00:02:49.709> getting<00:02:50.040> particularly

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
government's getting particularly

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.699 
government's getting particularly
self-sufficient<00:02:51.569> states<00:02:51.810> like<00:02:52.049> Texas<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
self-sufficient states like Texas and

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.809 
self-sufficient states like Texas and
you're<00:02:52.799> going<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> see<00:02:53.190> things<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.519> that

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
you're going to see things like that

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.490 
you're going to see things like that
happen<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.390> mean<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.900> government's<00:02:55.290> not<00:02:55.470> going

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
happen I mean the government's not going

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.559 
happen I mean the government's not going
to<00:02:55.739> be<00:02:55.830> able<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.190> impose<00:02:56.459> ridiculous<00:02:57.299> things

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
to be able to impose ridiculous things

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.199 
to be able to impose ridiculous things
as<00:02:58.440> chris<00:02:58.830> says<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.400> people<00:02:59.700> without<00:02:59.940> them

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
as chris says on the people without them

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.780 
as chris says on the people without them
eventually<00:03:00.750> fighting<00:03:01.440> back<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.280> moving<00:03:02.640> on

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
eventually fighting back so moving on

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.729 
eventually fighting back so moving on
this<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.420> last<00:03:03.660> few<00:03:03.959> years<00:03:03.989> question<00:03:04.530> and

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
this is the last few years question and

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.789 
this is the last few years question and
it<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.370> from<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> big<00:03:06.000> money<00:03:06.360> magnet<00:03:06.720> what<00:03:07.650> is

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
it is from a big money magnet what is

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.460 
it is from a big money magnet what is
the<00:03:08.010> probability<00:03:08.280> however<00:03:09.269> remote<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the probability however remote that the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.430

dollar you know silver is silver and
that's<00:03:29.459> why<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.670> has<00:03:29.910> value<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.900> only

the first element on the chart to
disappear<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.230> when<00:04:56.130> I<00:04:56.160> wrote<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.550> guy

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
disappear and when I wrote the guy

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:57.860 
disappear and when I wrote the guy
saying<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.150> know<00:04:57.240> you<00:04:57.419> be<00:04:57.600> more<00:04:57.750> specific

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
saying you know you be more specific

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.080 
saying you know you be more specific
they<00:04:58.440> said<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.400> only<00:04:59.580> thing<00:04:59.700> that<00:04:59.970> would

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
they said that the only thing that would

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.030 
they said that the only thing that would
stop<00:05:00.120> that<00:05:00.540> is<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.720> dramatically<00:05:01.320> higher<00:05:01.620> price

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
stop that is a dramatically higher price

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.820 
stop that is a dramatically higher price
so<00:05:02.250> that<00:05:02.400> people<00:05:02.669> start<00:05:02.970> using<00:05:03.030> better<00:05:03.900> use<00:05:04.800> of

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
so that people start using better use of

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.740 
so that people start using better use of
the<00:05:05.100> silver<00:05:05.460> and<00:05:05.490> bring<00:05:05.880> on<00:05:06.030> more<00:05:06.210> production

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
the silver and bring on more production

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.350 
the silver and bring on more production
so<00:05:07.230> it<00:05:07.740> this<00:05:08.040> is<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.220> gift<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.669> stop<00:05:08.970> thinking

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
so it this is a gift and stop thinking

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.390 
so it this is a gift and stop thinking
in<00:05:09.390> dollar<00:05:09.600> terms<00:05:09.690> about<00:05:10.169> silver<00:05:10.500> yeah<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.190> mean

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
in dollar terms about silver yeah I mean

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.670 
in dollar terms about silver yeah I mean
as<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.910> cost<00:05:12.150> I<00:05:12.510> just<00:05:12.750> read<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.169> great<00:05:13.440> piece

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
as to the cost I just read a great piece

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.040 
as to the cost I just read a great piece
as<00:05:13.980> a<00:05:14.160> guy<00:05:14.400> SRS<00:05:15.000> Rocco<00:05:15.510> we've<00:05:15.720> been<00:05:15.840> writing

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
as a guy SRS Rocco we've been writing

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.110 
as a guy SRS Rocco we've been writing
and<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:16.590> he's<00:05:16.950> doing<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.340> math<00:05:17.520> showing<00:05:17.970> that

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
and and he's doing the math showing that

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.450 
and and he's doing the math showing that
the<00:05:18.270> production<00:05:18.780> cost<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.290> upwards<00:05:20.130> of<00:05:20.250> thirty

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
the production cost is upwards of thirty

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.150 
the production cost is upwards of thirty
dollars<00:05:20.820> an<00:05:20.970> ounce<00:05:21.090> right<00:05:21.360> now<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:22.650> it's<00:05:22.919> it's

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
dollars an ounce right now and it's it's

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.409 
dollars an ounce right now and it's it's
only<00:05:23.430> going<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:23.610> go<00:05:23.760> higher<00:05:23.940> for<00:05:24.240> all<00:05:24.300> the

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
only going to go higher for all the

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:25.610 
only going to go higher for all the
reasons<00:05:24.540> we've<00:05:24.840> talked<00:05:25.110> about<00:05:25.260> so<00:05:25.560> if

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
reasons we've talked about so if

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.469 
reasons we've talked about so if
anyone's<00:05:25.950> truly<00:05:26.400> worried<00:05:26.729> that<00:05:26.910> silver<00:05:27.300> is

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
anyone's truly worried that silver is

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.900 
anyone's truly worried that silver is
going<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:27.960> fall<00:05:28.200> below<00:05:28.380> thirty<00:05:28.860> dollars<00:05:29.280> for<00:05:29.880> a

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
going to fall below thirty dollars for a

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.760 
going to fall below thirty dollars for a
significant<00:05:30.419> amount<00:05:30.479> of<00:05:30.690> time<00:05:30.750> but<00:05:31.380> mine's<00:05:31.620> a

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
significant amount of time but mine's a

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.840 
significant amount of time but mine's a
go<00:05:31.890> out<00:05:32.010> of<00:05:32.100> business<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.520> of<00:05:32.640> course

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
go out of business and of course

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.400 
go out of business and of course
remember<00:05:33.240> most<00:05:33.450> of<00:05:33.540> those<00:05:33.660> mines<00:05:33.930> aren't<00:05:34.169> even

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
remember most of those mines aren't even

margin so just from a man standpoint the

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.750 
margin so just from a man standpoint the
odds<00:05:40.470> of<00:05:40.680> them<00:05:40.860> being<00:05:41.070> able<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.340> keep<00:05:41.460> it<00:05:41.580> down

odds of them being able to keep it down
this<00:05:42.510> lower<00:05:42.780> are<00:05:43.080> very<00:05:43.560> little<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:43.979> again<00:05:44.280> you

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
this lower are very little and again you

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.370 
this lower are very little and again you
know<00:05:44.820> can<00:05:45.090> they<00:05:45.300> keep<00:05:45.510> it<00:05:45.660> indefinitely<00:05:45.960> well

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
know can they keep it indefinitely well

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.960 
know can they keep it indefinitely well
can<00:05:46.590> you<00:05:46.710> keep<00:05:46.919> a<00:05:47.130> beach<00:05:47.400> ball<00:05:47.640> held

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
can you keep a beach ball held

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.850 
can you keep a beach ball held
underwater<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.720> definitely<00:05:49.140> no<00:05:49.440> of<00:05:49.620> course

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.500 
underwater and definitely no of course
it's<00:05:50.039> going<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:50.250> come<00:05:50.400> up<00:05:50.550> because<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.300> lower

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
it's going to come up because the lower

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.080 
it's going to come up because the lower
that<00:05:51.780> they<00:05:51.960> push<00:05:52.740> down<00:05:53.010> the<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.460> paper<00:05:53.729> price

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
that they push down the the paper price

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.969 
that they push down the the paper price
the<00:05:54.390> more<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.720> physical<00:05:55.260> demand<00:05:55.620> like<00:05:55.770> we're

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
the more the physical demand like we're

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.340 
the more the physical demand like we're
seeing<00:05:56.220> right<00:05:56.370> now<00:05:56.510> increases<00:05:57.510> and<00:05:57.660> once<00:05:57.840> once

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
seeing right now increases and once once

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.750 
seeing right now increases and once once
you<00:05:58.470> get<00:05:58.590> to<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:58.830> point<00:05:59.039> where<00:05:59.220> the<00:05:59.340> critical

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
you get to the point where the critical

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.480 
you get to the point where the critical
mass<00:05:59.940> of<00:06:00.150> physical<00:06:00.840> demand<00:06:01.169> where<00:06:02.160> you<00:06:02.250> get<00:06:02.370> to

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
mass of physical demand where you get to

mass of physical demand where you get to
that<00:06:02.610> point<00:06:02.850> you<00:06:03.240> run<00:06:03.479> out<00:06:03.660> of<00:06:03.690> silver<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.229> we

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
that point you run out of silver and we

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.390 
that point you run out of silver and we
had<00:06:05.010> we<00:06:05.430> had<00:06:05.610> it<00:06:05.640> happen<00:06:05.910> in<00:06:06.180> 2018<00:06:06.960> in<00:06:07.560> 2009<00:06:08.190> and
