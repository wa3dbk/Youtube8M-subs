00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.639
 today we are testing five mini-notebook computers or netbooks bisonÃ³ 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.640
 category that is achieving the expected success for many thanks to the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.449
 combination of lightness and economic 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.159
 the first netbooks had 7-inch screens are molecules for 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.459
 storage but it seems that it is not a combination that has liked too much 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.839
 so for this comparison asked about the performance we are 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:31.550
 popular 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.070
 battles of 9 or 10 inches hard drive the windows xp installed 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.550
 we have also demanded that the price does not exceed 400 euros 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.630
 with these characteristics we have received the equipment to make airis 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.530
 fujitsu siemens 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.010
 half constitution 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.850
 whose nominations usually match 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.490
 all use the intel atom n270 processor and the intel 1 2 4 5 chipset with 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.290
 conrado hernandez 20 degrees 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.690
 and everyone voted played and that governs us 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 this makes the performance tests the differences have been miss 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.400
 also all of them have three by two or three to the Columbian if they want to vote 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.400
 flash card reader and with options to cut 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.340
 the most obvious differences are found in the size of the screen 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.410
 the hard disk capacity and the sizes of the keyboard and of the 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.890
 little bit 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.260
 as well as in autonomic 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
 two 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.610
 I 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.230
 seen like this 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.150
 The asp asp one has a led screen of eight as an inch 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.820
 but it's the biggest team and one of the heaviest 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 this allows your keyboard to also have more generous dimensions 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.010
 plus a comfortable keyboard with well-defined keys the size 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.170
 Right 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.170
 however in this space it is the smallest 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.260
 the hard disk is 120 gigabytes is not the maximum but almost 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.759
 as for the battery it is completely integrated in the portal and 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.200
 has offered us autonomy of almost two hours being the second worst in this 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.340
 aspect one point against this laptop is that just like that of 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 half the world including cars 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.189
 phishing 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.189
 sun 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.439
 I 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.439
 In series gp2 series asia the 10 inch screen 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.629
 is one of the largest laptops and also the heaviest with almost a 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.069
 film 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.230
 his touchpad is the greatest of all along with that of the controversy and the keyboard is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.890
 large 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.450
 but the lack of some highlight your keys makes it very clear and 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.940
 hardly distinguishes upwards another feature that shares with them 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.260
 is the 160gb hard drive fences the maximum allowed in the box currently 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.220
 In addition to the iss access to the disk and the improvement, a couple of 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.279
 screws and raising a record 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.339
 although to dismount the disk it would be necessary to remove more common 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.829
 our test unit was really a unique 750 neck difference this 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.790
 includes a model that is desired integrated which increases its price 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.400
 100 euros but in the face of the comparison we have not taken into account and what 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.799
 we value as Kira 700 of 399 euros where we must stand out the most 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.180
 matter that got more than three hours and is the team with the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 what more time can we work 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.509
 6 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:24.049
 finish 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.469
 If what is involved is that the agreement is small without doubt the amyl 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.889
 minilla advantage despair keyboard is also the smallest here that the 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.409
 screen have been made as unproven 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.389
 the three characteristics together with a reduced tuxpan shares them with him in 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.159
 the end of that city that is only a few millimeters fails 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.739
 have friends I have chosen to dispense with one of the three ports as it should 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:45.540
 usual 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.290
 but in exchange it has an expresscard slot replacing the pieces 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.139
 perfect 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.259
 that allows you to use peripherals specifically designed to 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:57.409
 laptops besides that fujitsu siemens is the only model that on this disk 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.669
 Hard is really easy to access just by removing a screw 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.669
 is to join the smallest of all with only 60 senators 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.129
 your battery excels wait 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.329
 this line of the housing and lasts 2 hours 20 minutes 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:14.209
 also with the plane a casing of another color is included to customize 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.310
 the popular akoya mini medion is one of the documents prepared just 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.479
 we are in need of a lock connection 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.740
 but in exchange for being unique that supports e-type wifi networks 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.590
 highlights its keyboard that is the largest as two of the five tested 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.360
 the 10-inch screen and syphilis technology a hard drive of 160gb banks 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.099
 Inc that second largest laptop after doing 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.870
 but the weight is limited to a click instead can not boast of autonomy 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.550
 because it is the organ that has lasted the longest battery with only 1 hour and 40 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.580
 minutes 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.169
 finish 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.050
 the toshiba challenge only a few millimeters bigger than the millions 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.780
 and shares with the features like the fact screen like 9 inches that 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.389
 in this case it is technology led 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.719
 by the reduced their parents and keyboard 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:14.709
 even though they take advantage of the available space if in April the disk was very 

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:18.689
 accessible people are going have opted to leave memory by hand in this case the 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.630
 120 gigabyte hard drive 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.160
 in the emelec and in the battery excels, say mind from behind 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.660
 but that it was better duration together with the law surpassing both the three hours 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.680
 of operation 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.710
 but we have to take into account the computers it is also convenient that we 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.490
 we fix on food 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.199
 and that is that in this field none of the manufacturers take advantage in case of 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.990
 Especially comfortable injuries with clearly excessive dimensions for 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.479
 computer that boasts of tenerife 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.800
 in others like you if I'm going to do it if you use a nosocomio with grounding 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.289
 that occupies more of the transformer itself but in any case all of them 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.980
 they entered with a power cord of almost two meters 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.910
 would be much more practical passports like this from about 20 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.530
 meters the difference would be profitable
