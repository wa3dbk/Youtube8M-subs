picture if I have been able to that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.400 
picture if I have been able to that
would<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:44.460> helped<00:00:45.329> me<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.379> that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
would have really helped me to know that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.340 
would have really helped me to know that
they<00:00:46.710> were<00:00:46.770> fake<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:49.140> look

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
they were fake so and they look

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
they were fake so and they look
brand-new<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.670> actually<00:00:51.210> purchased

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
brand-new because I actually purchased

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.869 
brand-new because I actually purchased
these<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.020> long<00:00:52.289> long<00:00:52.500> time<00:00:52.710> ago<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.610> I've<00:00:53.730> only

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
these a long long time ago but I've only

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.279 
these a long long time ago but I've only
ever<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.510> little<00:00:54.780> once<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
ever use them little once because I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.830 
ever use them little once because I
figured<00:00:55.530> I'd<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.739> ahead<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.039> try<00:00:56.219> them<00:00:56.430> out

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
figured I'd go ahead and try them out

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.830 
figured I'd go ahead and try them out
and<00:00:58.820> some<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.910> them<00:01:00.000> are<00:01:00.149> solved<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> lot<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and some of them are solved a lot of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
and some of them are solved a lot of
them<00:01:00.960> aren't<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> guess<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.149> way

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
them aren't so that I guess it's one way

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.700 
them aren't so that I guess it's one way
to<00:01:03.300> tell<00:01:03.570> they're<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.719> resolved<00:01:04.199> Mac<00:01:04.379> brushes

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to tell they're not resolved Mac brushes

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.219 
to tell they're not resolved Mac brushes
are<00:01:04.860> usually<00:01:05.129> pretty<00:01:05.309> soft<00:01:06.049> like<00:01:07.049> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
particular one is pretty soft but a lot

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.359

it's<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.299> essentially<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.320> pretty<00:01:46.560> flat

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
it's like essentially it's pretty flat

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
it's like essentially it's pretty flat
and<00:01:49.619> sometimes<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.520> links<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and sometimes like the links on the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
and sometimes like the links on the
handles<00:01:52.079> will<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.470> completely<00:01:53.340> different

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
handles will be completely different

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.480 
handles will be completely different
especially<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:54.119> say<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> Mac<00:01:55.680> 116<00:01:56.310> say

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
especially if say this is a Mac 116 say

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
especially if say this is a Mac 116 say
that<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.759> was<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.090> 116<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:57.869> something

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that this was on 116 or something

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.859 
that this was on 116 or something
see<00:01:59.490> how<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.790> one's<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.090> way<00:02:00.390> longer

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
see how this one's like way longer

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.389 
see how this one's like way longer
sometimes<00:02:01.380> they'll<00:02:01.740> they'll<00:02:01.979> mess<00:02:02.189> things

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
sometimes they'll they'll mess things

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.609 
sometimes they'll they'll mess things
like<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:03.060> these<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.290> supposed<00:02:04.590> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
like that up these are not supposed to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.990 
like that up these are not supposed to
be<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> same<00:02:05.070> brush<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.560> sometimes<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.759> lot<00:02:08.970> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
be the same brush so sometimes a lot of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.219 
be the same brush so sometimes a lot of
times<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> way<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.720> tell<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.050> like

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
times the way that you can tell is like

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.500 
times the way that you can tell is like
the<00:02:10.800> number<00:02:11.310> whatever<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:12.030> if<00:02:12.120> they're<00:02:12.270> sold

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
the number whatever or if they're sold

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.540 
the number whatever or if they're sold
in<00:02:12.629> big<00:02:12.870> sets<00:02:13.140> matter

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
in big sets matter

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.130 
in big sets matter
only<00:02:13.790> ever<00:02:13.910> done<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.180> like<00:02:14.420> maybe<00:02:14.690> once<00:02:15.020> or

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
only ever done that like maybe once or

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.310 
only ever done that like maybe once or
twice<00:02:16.090> aside<00:02:17.090> from<00:02:17.300> like<00:02:17.450> their<00:02:17.630> holiday<00:02:18.050> sets

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
twice aside from like their holiday sets

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.870 
twice aside from like their holiday sets
or<00:02:18.560> like<00:02:18.740> their<00:02:18.890> little<00:02:19.070> travel<00:02:19.550> ones<00:02:19.670> that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
or like their little travel ones that

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.510 
or like their little travel ones that
they<00:02:19.970> come<00:02:20.120> out<00:02:20.240> with<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.740> they've<00:02:22.190> only<00:02:22.340> ever

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
they come out with and they've only ever

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.810 
they come out with and they've only ever
done<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.910> few<00:02:22.970> times<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:24.610> another<00:02:25.610> way<00:02:25.790> to

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
done that a few times so another way to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.060 
done that a few times so another way to
tell<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.940> engraving<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.440> very<00:02:30.830> very

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
tell is the the engraving is very very

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.010 
tell is the the engraving is very very
smooth<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.610> fake<00:02:31.790> one<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.240> it's<00:02:32.810> got<00:02:32.990> a

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
smooth on the fake one and it's got a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.050 
smooth on the fake one and it's got a
little<00:02:33.290> bit<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.530> texture<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.490> yellow

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
little bit of a texture on the yellow

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.140 
little bit of a texture on the yellow
one<00:02:35.480> now<00:02:36.320> on<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.010> row<00:02:37.160> brushes<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.790> letters

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
one now on the row brushes the letters

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.120 
one now on the row brushes the letters
and<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.140> words<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.590> stuff<00:02:39.710> that<00:02:39.830> they<00:02:39.920> will

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
and the words and stuff that they will

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.250 
and the words and stuff that they will
rub<00:02:40.400> off<00:02:40.610> after<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.300> use<00:02:41.540> them<00:02:41.780> for<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:42.110> while

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
rub off after you use them for a while

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.190 
rub off after you use them for a while
as<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.130> can<00:02:43.370> see<00:02:43.550> this<00:02:43.700> one's<00:02:43.990> rubbed<00:02:44.990> off

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
as you can see this one's rubbed off

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.780 
as you can see this one's rubbed off
some<00:02:46.570> but<00:02:47.570> I<00:02:47.930> don't<00:02:48.320> know<00:02:48.560> if<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:49.460> one<00:02:49.640> will

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
some but I don't know if this one will

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.400 
some but I don't know if this one will
do<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:50.210> well<00:02:50.390> I'm<00:02:50.690> assuming<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.260> would

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
do that as well I'm assuming it would

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.690 
do that as well I'm assuming it would
because<00:02:51.740> it<00:02:51.830> doesn't<00:02:52.070> feel<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.400> feels<00:02:52.580> like

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
because it doesn't feel it it feels like

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.970 
because it doesn't feel it it feels like
it's<00:02:52.820> just<00:02:53.000> printed<00:02:53.450> on<00:02:53.570> here<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:57.260> haven't

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
it's just printed on here so I haven't

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.590 
it's just printed on here so I haven't
used<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.610> don't<00:02:58.850> know<00:02:59.090> how<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.510> would

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
used it so I don't know how that would

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.960 
used it so I don't know how that would
really<00:02:59.840> work<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.980> then<00:03:01.550> we're<00:03:01.640> gonna<00:03:01.730> get<00:03:01.910> me

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
really work and then we're gonna get me

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.460 
really work and then we're gonna get me
down<00:03:02.150> here<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.600> bottom<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:03.050> this<00:03:03.170> side

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
down here to the bottom of this side

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.680 
down here to the bottom of this side
this<00:03:03.590> up<00:03:03.740> see<00:03:03.860> doesn't<00:03:04.190> see<00:03:04.430> where<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.510> the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
this up see doesn't see where like the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.310 
this up see doesn't see where like the
maid<00:03:05.960> or<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.950> little<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.300> like<00:03:11.630> stamped

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
maid or the little it is like stamped

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.710 
maid or the little it is like stamped
into<00:03:12.530> there<00:03:12.890> like<00:03:13.130> engraved<00:03:13.640> in<00:03:13.970> there<00:03:14.180> but

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
into there like engraved in there but

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.449 
into there like engraved in there but
this<00:03:14.870> one<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.200> lot<00:03:16.090> as<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.150> can<00:03:17.330> see<00:03:18.459> this

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
this one is a lot as you can see this

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.979 
this one is a lot as you can see this
one<00:03:19.610> is<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> little<00:03:19.880> bit<00:03:20.120> more<00:03:20.239> rigid<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:20.870> not

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
one is a little bit more rigid it's not

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.720 
one is a little bit more rigid it's not
as<00:03:21.110> smooth<00:03:21.500> as<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.070> real<00:03:22.310> brush<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:25.580> is

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
as smooth as the real brush so that is

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.479 
as smooth as the real brush so that is
another<00:03:26.000> way<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.239> tell<00:03:26.600> like<00:03:27.340> it's<00:03:28.340> probably

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
another way to tell like it's probably

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.750 
another way to tell like it's probably
not<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.940> best<00:03:28.970> way<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.480> tell<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.760> essentially

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
not the best way to tell but essentially

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.850 
not the best way to tell but essentially
like<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:32.690> pretty<00:03:33.350> noticeable<00:03:33.650> especially

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
like it's pretty noticeable especially

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.290 
like it's pretty noticeable especially
if<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.250> have<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.400> fake<00:03:34.640> one<00:03:34.790> beside<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.120> real<00:03:35.360> one

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
if you have a fake one beside a real one

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.670 
if you have a fake one beside a real one
okay<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.450> then<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.690> last<00:03:38.959> thing<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.530> one

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
okay and then the last thing the one

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.300 
okay and then the last thing the one
that<00:03:39.860> stood<00:03:40.220> out<00:03:40.280> for<00:03:40.550> me<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.820> most<00:03:40.850> is<00:03:42.310> that

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
that stood out for me the most is that
