00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.120
 inside the fight night games 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.280
 frikis mangle is one of the characters 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.500
 more enigmatic and many theories have been 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.420
 proposed in order to explain from 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.130
 its physical characteristics until the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.240
 disturbing sound that it emits when 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.240
 appears on camera 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.680
 because freddy fast bar pizza is a 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.690
 place of children's fun and 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.910
 observe the white color of your face and the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.830
 makeup that some have come 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.020
 to think that mangle was supposed to 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.640
 being originally a clown with whom 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.640
 could children interact 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.040
 as surely you already know mangle has 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.870
 a second head a characteristic 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.240
 remarkable is that this one is missing the eye 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.920
 if you have no mangle and vice versa 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.479
 who came to believe that this 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.550
 second head was part of his 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.530
 endoskeleton but seeing inside his 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.450
 mouth you can see the second game of 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.670
 teeth that accompanies the head of each 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.979
 animatronic or 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.229
 from here I could start the theory that 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.150
 man tries to repair himself to 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.460
 several of the old animatronics them 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.380
 missing pieces this might not be something 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.810
 rare because according to the subject of the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.700
 telephone these were left in disuse 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.590
 and his pieces would be used to 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.259
 make repairs in the new ones 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.360
 animatronics you are also told that 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.700
 staff get fed up rearming mangrove 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.320
 every day is because of this that it 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.119
 believes that this animatronic is 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.560
 trying to repair itself 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.750
 using the pieces of the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.970
 old animatronics will be this the reason 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.120
 why bonnie and girl have parties 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.400
 missing 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.869
 even golden freddy has wires 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.790
 loose that suggest they were 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.310
 ripped electronic components 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.800
 and he does not seem to have anything in his head but 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.600
 yes it has joints even there 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.760
 who came to suggest that that second 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.950
 head is the endoskeleton of the co cake 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.140
 staff I really do not believe in this 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.360
 because a decoration figure would have 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.820
 an endoskeleton 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.380
 good though you have to admit that those 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.180
 eyes look very well made 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.500
 it would seem that they can get to blink 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.500
 anytime 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.100
 although the best known theory about this 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.140
 second head is that it is a 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.270
 parrot that accompanies the toy version of 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.490
 fox and the pirate some game fans 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.319
 have thought about the possibility that that 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.569
 second head be a doll of 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.489
 ventriloquist based on rolfi 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.350
 of golf and a member of a band of 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.800
 animatronics known as the rock a 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.080
 fire explosion 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.910
 as you can see in the image this 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.950
 character has a little doll and 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.630
 could have been the inspiration for the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.880
 second mangrove head and this 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.740
 animatronic or white could actually 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.740
 having originally been a ventriloquist 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.360
 At this point many should 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.920
 wonder why I talk about mangle like 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.300
 if he were a man when his appearance 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.180
 says the opposite 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.190
 good the phone subject refers 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.020
 to this animatronic or like him and this guy 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.180
 knows every detail of the place and its 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.100
 animatronics if someone knows the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.720
 Mangrove genus would have to be that 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.490
 you are teaching everything 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.460
 you need to know to do well 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.010
 work or in this case survive him 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.930
 it is said that man appears in ladies 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.940
 night because it would not be a challenge if 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.780
 only the two versions of 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.240
 girl 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.920
 because he probably does not have a voice 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.350
 because he lost his voice box or the 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.200
 they broke the children it is not possible to know 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.660
 its gender based on its tone 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.790
 Although this is not conclusive 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.040
 There is always the question of why it is 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.769
 man or is it supposed to be it looks so 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.989
 rose could be the case that the subject 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.629
 The phone was wrong to call him 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.489
 in any way continue the video 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.489
 under the assumption that he is male 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.250
 some have assured that the peak of 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.290
 girl is in the mangrove endoskeleton 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.330
 it is believed that girl was trying to 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.520
 help him to get up or try 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.949
 rebuild it and its beak got stuck 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.139
 in your neck but this is false if you 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.120
 they fix well in this picture you can see that 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.710
 it's just about your bow tie and not 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.710
 there is no other indication of the peak 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.690
 with respect to the sound it emits it seems 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.790
 be a radiofrequency similar to that 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.470
 it's heard on police radios and it's 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.479
 that is why it is believed that mangle was 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.520
 witness of some of the murders and 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.530
 is trying to call the police and 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.259
 as proof of this they mention that between 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.449
 the sounds you can hear 10-1 that 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.930
 in the police code means bad 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.930
 reception 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.099
 if true, this would mean that 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.020
 mangle no matter how hard you try it will never be 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.909
 able to alert the authorities about 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.960
 the crime and he has only left to try 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.060
 catch the criminal on his own 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.039
 another theory mentions that what is 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.949
 Listen is the description of the scene 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.930
 after the bite of 87 according to this 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.390
 theory what is said could be something 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.090
 A) Yes 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.240
 we have a little boy who lost his 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.640
 frontal lobe but since according to the 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.100
 theories of the game this event has not yet 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.790
 happened I think this theory could be 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.790
 discarded 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.750
 the latest theory says that this sound 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:52.810
 Take the phrases I'll be there soon as 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.909
 these are believed to be a conversation 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.310
 that mangle is holding with foxy 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.139
 perhaps these two animatronics could 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.740
 be working together to achieve 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.740
 get to you
