when<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.090> kicks<00:03:00.299> in<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.049> glare<00:03:01.319> will<00:03:01.470> go<00:03:01.650> away

it's<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.349> bit<00:03:04.500> slow<00:03:04.799> on<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.099> start<00:03:05.160> up<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.880> think

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
it's a bit slow on the start up I think

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.750 
it's a bit slow on the start up I think
it's<00:03:06.330> very<00:03:06.510> similar<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.340> time<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
it's very similar to the time that the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.229 
it's very similar to the time that the
Rory<00:03:09.080> from<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.290> BBC<00:03:10.620> did<00:03:11.130> his<00:03:11.340> little<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:12.090> on

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
Rory from the BBC did his little one on

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.280 
Rory from the BBC did his little one on
the<00:03:12.330> next<00:03:13.400> Android<00:03:14.400> tablet<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.180> came<00:03:15.420> out<00:03:15.630> it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
the next Android tablet that came out it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.750 
the next Android tablet that came out it
was<00:03:16.380> about<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.620> same<00:03:16.829> sort<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.190> speed<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.579> that

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
was about the same sort of speed of that

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.479 
was about the same sort of speed of that
but<00:03:18.630> if<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.900> keep<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.260> charged<00:03:19.890> up<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.280> stuff

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.949 
but if you keep it charged up and stuff
it's<00:03:20.640> very<00:03:20.700> rare<00:03:21.120> you'd<00:03:21.269> actually<00:03:21.390> need<00:03:21.750> to

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
and like this one for example this

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
about this one is it actually does work

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.319 
about this one is it actually does work
in<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.630> full<00:04:03.810> 7-inch<00:04:04.410> rather<00:04:05.280> than<00:04:05.639> worrying

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
in the full 7-inch rather than worrying

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.229 
in the full 7-inch rather than worrying
about<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:07.019> small<00:04:07.350> size<00:04:07.709> things<00:04:08.130> if<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:08.910> flip

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
about the small size things if I flip

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.050 
about the small size things if I flip
that<00:04:09.420> around<00:04:09.600> as<00:04:09.959> well<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.410> got<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.850> yep<00:04:11.850> there

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
that around as well it's got a yep there

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.340 
that around as well it's got a yep there
you<00:04:12.120> go<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.510> works<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.870> out<00:04:12.959> straight<00:04:13.290> away

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
you go so it works it out straight away

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.370 
you go so it works it out straight away
now<00:04:13.739> if<00:04:13.859> you<00:04:13.950> noticed<00:04:14.280> how<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:15.660> changed<00:04:16.169> there

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
now if you noticed how it changed there

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.069 
now if you noticed how it changed there
it<00:04:16.530> dimmed<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.310> then<00:04:17.700> changed<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.389> which

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
it dimmed it and then changed it which

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.599 
it dimmed it and then changed it which
I've<00:04:19.289> seen<00:04:19.530> ones<00:04:19.799> where<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.100> do<00:04:20.220> small

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
I've seen ones where it do small

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.270 
I've seen ones where it do small
animation<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.109> one's<00:04:22.320> quite<00:04:22.530> nice<00:04:22.860> and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
animation but this one's quite nice and

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.219 
animation but this one's quite nice and
it's<00:04:23.520> not<00:04:23.580> that's<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.599> know<00:04:24.690> slow<00:04:24.990> either

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
it's not that's you know slow either

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.390 
it's not that's you know slow either
which<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.590> good

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
which is good

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.790 
which is good
inside<00:04:27.300> here<00:04:27.630> you've<00:04:27.780> got<00:04:27.990> Wi-Fi<00:04:28.290> you've<00:04:28.919> got

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
inside here you've got Wi-Fi you've got

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.409 
inside here you've got Wi-Fi you've got
I<00:04:31.800> think<00:04:32.340> it's<00:04:32.490> yet<00:04:32.910> two<00:04:33.150> gigabytes<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.870> memory

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
I think it's yet two gigabytes of memory

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.210 
I think it's yet two gigabytes of memory
as<00:04:36.419> well<00:04:36.660> which<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.020> kind<00:04:37.440> of<00:04:37.530> cool<00:04:37.710> and

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
as well which is kind of cool and

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.490 
as well which is kind of cool and
there's<00:04:38.699> two<00:04:38.970> two<00:04:39.240> speakers<00:04:39.630> at<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.870> top<00:04:40.110> here

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
there's two two speakers at the top here

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.820 
there's two two speakers at the top here
as<00:04:40.650> well<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.100> does<00:04:41.340> playback<00:04:41.940> Full<00:04:42.449> HD<00:04:42.830> memory

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
as well and does playback Full HD memory

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.460 
as well and does playback Full HD memory
so<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.510> pictures<00:04:45.510> which<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.810> good<00:04:46.139> as<00:04:46.290> well

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
so that pictures which is good as well

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.760 
so that pictures which is good as well
so<00:04:46.740> let's<00:04:46.919> press<00:04:47.699> that<00:04:47.940> button<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.449> go<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.290> the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
so let's press that button and go to the

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.120 
so let's press that button and go to the
video<00:04:50.010> player<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:52.940> show<00:04:53.940> this<00:04:54.150> one<00:04:55.010> last<00:04:56.010> week

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.940 

so<00:05:21.650> it's<00:05:21.800> not<00:05:21.920> bad<00:05:22.130> really<00:05:22.340> 400-pound<00:05:23.150> I<00:05:23.950> would

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
so it's not bad really 400-pound I would

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.370 
so it's not bad really 400-pound I would
certainly<00:05:25.160> recommend<00:05:25.720> looking<00:05:26.720> at<00:05:26.870> it<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:27.260> in

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
fact you can get this first a little bit

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.060 
fact you can get this first a little bit
more<00:05:30.910> via<00:05:31.910> I<00:05:32.540> think<00:05:32.990> it's<00:05:33.110> Maplin<00:05:33.680> actually

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
more via I think it's Maplin actually

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.100 
more via I think it's Maplin actually
that<00:05:34.250> we're<00:05:34.430> selling<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.910> one<00:05:35.510> this<00:05:35.810> very

but that's yes this first go and I've
just<00:05:53.630> realized<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.230> course<00:05:54.260> there<00:05:54.740> I<00:05:54.770> am

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
just realized of course there I am

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.650 
just realized of course there I am
unboxing<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:55.910> all<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.030> was<00:05:56.240> doing<00:05:56.510> was<00:05:56.540> just

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
unboxing and all I was doing was just

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.180 
unboxing and all I was doing was just
playing<00:05:57.050> with<00:05:57.140> the<00:05:57.290> machine

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
playing with the machine

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.610 
playing with the machine
so<00:05:58.670> just<00:05:58.940> to<00:05:59.060> let<00:05:59.180> you<00:05:59.330> know<00:05:59.360> also<00:05:59.720> I<00:05:59.990> in<00:06:00.380> there

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
so just to let you know also I in there

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.890 
so just to let you know also I in there
you<00:06:00.770> get<00:06:01.040> a<00:06:01.100> leather<00:06:01.430> case<00:06:01.730> which<00:06:02.540> I<00:06:02.720> thought

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
you get a leather case which I thought

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.250 
you get a leather case which I thought
was<00:06:03.050> very<00:06:03.140> cool<00:06:03.590> and<00:06:03.950> it's<00:06:04.130> it's<00:06:04.840> any<00:06:05.840> of<00:06:06.140> that

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
was very cool and it's it's any of that

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.320 
was very cool and it's it's any of that
it's<00:06:06.410> quite<00:06:06.590> hard<00:06:06.890> as<00:06:07.130> well<00:06:07.400> so<00:06:07.790> it's<00:06:08.150> quite

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
it's quite hard as well so it's quite

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.770 
it's quite hard as well so it's quite
good

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
good

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.660 
good
I<00:06:08.810> should<00:06:09.110> really<00:06:09.260> use<00:06:09.530> that<00:06:09.560> you<00:06:10.430> get<00:06:10.580> an

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
I should really use that you get an
