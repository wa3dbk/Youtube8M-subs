00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.850
 in the heart of the highest massifs of the world 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.850
 sleep of strange ice monsters 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.420
 the agglomerated stalactites that stretch 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.960
 to the ground 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.960
 she tentacles 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.360
 born from rainwater runoff 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.610
 which congeals during the winter 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.640
 ice cascades became the terrain 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.750
 set of a handful of enthusiasts 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.900
 Stephane Husson is one of the pioneers 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.740
 of this discipline out of the ordinary guide 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.540
 high mountain 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.850
 vice-world champion climbed on 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.620
 ice it travels the planet since 20 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.490
 years in the onslaught of ice walls and 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.490
 more dizzying 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.830
 stéphane today by climbing a 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.250
 waterfall located in the alpine massif of the 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.820
 vanoise at 1800 meters altitude 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.070
 outside temperature - 5 ° facing him 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.320
 a frozen waterfall of a hundred 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.440
 meters the equivalent of a building of 30 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.440
 floors 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.840
 as before each step stéphane 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.210
 carefully prepare the material that 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.210
 ensure its safety over the void 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.920
 he then tests the resistance of the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.510
 ice and make sure she will be pretty 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.690
 solid to resist those shots of 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.690
 ice ax there is great 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.280
 as a rule when I start a 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.810
 waterfall like that I'm pretty serene 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.239
 I take the opportunity to look a little closer 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.830
 where are I going to climb so there I 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.819
 will take the area of weakness of the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.250
 ice cream ie I'm going to end and 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.349
 shifted it to the right by putting my 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.610
 feet so on the steps and after I 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.420
 go back on the left there is a 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:34.319
 kind of natural line there that is 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:36.160
 perfect for climbing you have to engage 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.459
 stéphane stays on the lookout for the lesser 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.069
 suspicious noise he perceives each of 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.280
 reactions of the ice the dangers he the 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.250
 know the snow with only one casting 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.620
 would be enough to destabilize him 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.650
 the wind taking off the ice from the rock 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:01.019
 and the cold that weakens it and makes it 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.019
 brittle like crystal and stones 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.790
 Stéphane reaches a first level 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.250
 it remains to defeat the most 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.980
 difficult of the waterfall a huge 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.830
 stalactites of a meter in diameter posed 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.810
 balancing on the rock before getting there 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.180
 attack he has to check the stability 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.260
 of the building and especially watch the 6 1 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.730
 then the ice creams all that he can very 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.210
 although land on snow seen 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.130
 well and if you go goblet school 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.350
 below for that's real bearings 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.700
 ball can be completely slipped 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.730
 go both well look at the 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.090
 really the task noise we're going to look 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.090
 under the ice 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.840
 there is still ice see several 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.640
 layers 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.790
 there was snow that fell 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.720
 after that redo ice 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.910
 then the other part that is very 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.310
 important is the task at the level of 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.260
 rock the wheel here it's not taken off 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.360
 there it seems good to me to come 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.190
 it seems to be good paste I saw 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.860
 to ice that only rolled along 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.660
 from the rock behind so that's a 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.370
 good thing 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.840
 which is what's great in in the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.250
 ice cream and that in fact you come every 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.850
 year then in fact you make a way 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.220
 different 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.410
 that's really why it's really 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.760
 it's the ephemeral side that makes 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.410
 that you are actually climbing a volume 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.610
 of water that has frozen during the winter 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.500
 it's a gift of nature 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.540
 just enough time to climb 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.880
 above and then he's springing down 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.340
 sassandra course 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.430
 time is pressing the sun is coming and its 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.450
 in nine rays already cascading ice 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.250
 begins to melt 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.270
 a phenomenon that is increasing 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.780
 considerably the risk 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.780
 collapse 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.620
 stéphane has only 20 minutes to 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.550
 climb before the ascent 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.550
 become too dangerous 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:19.060
 ice in this type of cascades 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.650
 we are still on a structure that 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.330
 is very fragile so the idea is 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.460
 to really be one with the element 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.070
 of iliad to marry the element of trying to 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.470
 to understand a bit about his morphology of 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.389
 c2 to let ourselves be guided by 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.360
 the ice fair but by no means 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.600
 fight and hit she martyred 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.380
 really climb there the finest possible 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.380
 yes 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.770
 to live his passion by minimizing 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.810
 stéphane risks imagined a tower 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.530
 artificial metal covered with 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.620
 ice an ideal structure bringing together 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.400
 all levels of difficulty 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.800
 the opportunity to create shapes 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.050
 not found in nature like this 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.160
 inclined part to which he hangs 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.400
 feet in the void 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.830
 twenty meters above ground history 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.120
 to push a little further 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.120
 limits of his discipline
