this walkthrough without those controls
as<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.610> were<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> real<00:01:09.659> NES

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
as if it were just like on the real NES

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.469 
as if it were just like on the real NES
and<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.950> will<00:01:11.130> warn<00:01:11.369> GameCube<00:01:11.939> owners<00:01:12.240> though

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that controller is a bit awkward for

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
that controller is a bit awkward for
this<00:01:15.210> game<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:16.080> definitely<00:01:16.229> takes<00:01:16.619> some

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
this game and it definitely takes some

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.340 
this game and it definitely takes some
