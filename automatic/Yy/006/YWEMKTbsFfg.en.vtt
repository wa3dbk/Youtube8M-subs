00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
heart of it is certainly the register

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.520 
heart of it is certainly the register
module<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:33.989> you're<00:00:34.110> looking<00:00:34.410> at

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
module which is what you're looking at

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.340 
module which is what you're looking at
now<00:00:35.210> our<00:00:36.210> software<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.660> designed<00:00:36.989> from<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
now our software is designed from the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
now our software is designed from the
ground<00:00:37.380> up<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:38.070> used<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.149> touchscreen

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
ground up to be used with a touchscreen

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.660 
ground up to be used with a touchscreen
so<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.290> literally<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.100> need<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.489> use<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
so you literally do not need to use a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.330 
so you literally do not need to use a
keyboard<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.540> order<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.200> make<00:00:43.649> sales<00:00:43.920> happen

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
keyboard in order to make sales happen

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.990 
keyboard in order to make sales happen
so<00:00:45.210> let's<00:00:45.420> sign<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.930> employee<00:00:46.289> number<00:00:46.379> two

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
so let's sign in as employee number two

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.569 
so let's sign in as employee number two
it<00:00:48.000> turns<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.450> she<00:00:48.600> has<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> password<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
it turns out she has a password and I

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
it turns out she has a password and I
will<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:50.910> type<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.329> my<00:00:51.360> physical<00:00:51.870> keyboard

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
will now type on my physical keyboard

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.560 
will now type on my physical keyboard
you<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.789> whether<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> use<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you can see that whether you use the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
you can see that whether you use the
on-screen<00:00:54.719> keyboard<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.739> physical<00:00:56.280> one

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
on-screen keyboard or the physical one

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.400 
on-screen keyboard or the physical one
it's<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.289> definitely

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it's up to you but you can definitely

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.080 
it's up to you but you can definitely
save<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> lot<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:58.980> counter<00:00:59.399> space<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
save a lot of counter space at the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.240 
save a lot of counter space at the
point-of-sale<00:01:00.420> by<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:01.440> having<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> keyboard

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
point-of-sale by not having a keyboard

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.329 
point-of-sale by not having a keyboard
there<00:01:03.019> Mary<00:01:04.019> Jones<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> turns<00:01:04.920> out<00:01:05.040> has<00:01:05.159> not

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
there Mary Jones as it turns out has not

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.730 
there Mary Jones as it turns out has not
actually<00:01:05.729> punched<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> clock<00:01:06.479> today<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
actually punched the clock today and so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440 
actually punched the clock today and so
the<00:01:07.890> software<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.310> automatically<00:01:08.939> reminding

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the software is automatically reminding

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
the software is automatically reminding
her<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.659> sign<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:10.650> will<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:10.979> ahead<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
her to sign in which will go ahead and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.590 
her to sign in which will go ahead and
do<00:01:12.170> if<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.710> am<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.159> retail<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.790> best<00:01:15.060> thing<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
do if I am in retail the best thing I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
do if I am in retail the best thing I
can<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:15.930> selling<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.040> use<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> barcode

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
can do for selling is to use a barcode

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.420 
can do for selling is to use a barcode
scanner<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:19.200> support<00:01:19.650> virtually<00:01:20.220> every

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
scanner and we support virtually every

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.010 
scanner and we support virtually every
barcode<00:01:20.759> scanner<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.270> market<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
barcode scanner on the market out of the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830 
barcode scanner on the market out of the
box<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> let's<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:23.640> ahead<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.659> will

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
box so let's go ahead and I will

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.719 
box so let's go ahead and I will
simulate<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.590> don't<00:01:25.920> actually<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.400> barcode

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
simulate I don't actually have a barcode

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.760 
simulate I don't actually have a barcode
scanner<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:28.130> there<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:31.140> equivalent

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
scanner here but there is the equivalent

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.140 
scanner here but there is the equivalent
of<00:01:31.890> scanning<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.400> barcode<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:33.509> an<00:01:33.810> azalea<00:01:34.229> item

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
of scanning a barcode for an azalea item

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.370 
of scanning a barcode for an azalea item
so<00:01:36.150> there's<00:01:36.600> no<00:01:36.720> need<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> touch<00:01:37.140> any<00:01:37.320> buttons

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
so there's no need to touch any buttons

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.190 
so there's no need to touch any buttons
simply<00:01:38.250> scan<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.729> items<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.509> they'll<00:01:39.990> ring

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
simply scan the items and they'll ring

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.399 
simply scan the items and they'll ring
right<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:41.060> if<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> some<00:01:43.049> item

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
right up if you do get to some item

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.980 
right up if you do get to some item
where<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.270> number<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
where you can see the number but the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080 
where you can see the number but the
barcode<00:01:46.409> scanner<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.100> able<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.610> pick<00:01:47.939> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
barcode scanner is not able to pick it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630 
barcode scanner is not able to pick it
up<00:01:48.180> directly<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.799> actually<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.280> punch

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
up directly you can actually then punch

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.630 
up directly you can actually then punch
it<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.970> button<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:52.680> go<00:01:52.860> ahead<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> type<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
it a button to go ahead and type in the
