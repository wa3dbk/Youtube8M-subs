00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.840 

our<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.500> last<00:01:22.530> exercise<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.790> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
our the last exercise is going to be a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.610 
our the last exercise is going to be a
push<00:01:24.060> through<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.960> targets<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.380> upper

push through and it targets your upper

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.260 
push through and it targets your upper
abs<00:01:25.800> I<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.370> to<00:01:26.460> put<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:26.640> hands<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.910> front<00:01:27.000> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
abs I like to put my hands in front of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.180 
abs I like to put my hands in front of
me<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.600> push<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.170> far<00:01:28.440> as<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.860> through<00:01:29.070> my

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
me and push as far as I can through my

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.800 
me and push as far as I can through my
legs<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:29.910> it<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.210> contracts<00:01:30.630> my

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
legs because it really contracts my

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.780 
legs because it really contracts my
perhaps<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.010> little<00:01:32.040> different<00:01:32.460> than<00:01:32.760> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
perhaps it's a little different than a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
perhaps it's a little different than a
regular<00:01:32.850> crunch<00:01:33.360> because<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.230> don't<00:01:34.380> have

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
regular crunch because you don't have

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.230 
regular crunch because you don't have
your<00:01:34.530> hands<00:01:34.740> behind<00:01:34.890> your<00:01:35.160> head<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:36.030> you'll

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
your hands behind your head but you'll

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.520 
your hands behind your head but you'll
be<00:01:36.270> able<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.510> squeeze<00:01:36.660> a<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:37.110> harder

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
be able to squeeze a little bit harder

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.570 
be able to squeeze a little bit harder
which<00:01:37.830> will<00:01:38.040> help<00:01:38.280> build<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.610> muscles

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.610 

so<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.360> do<00:01:46.480> these<00:01:46.720> three<00:01:46.960> exercises<00:01:47.350> as<00:01:47.590> a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
so I do these three exercises as a

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.070 
so I do these three exercises as a
circuit<00:01:48.040> at<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.250> end<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.400> my<00:01:48.460> workout<00:01:48.790> and

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
circuit at the end of my workout and

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.560 
circuit at the end of my workout and
I'll<00:01:50.080> take<00:01:50.410> about<00:01:50.650> 45<00:01:51.130> seconds<00:01:51.550> per<00:01:52.150> break<00:01:52.420> in

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
I'll take about 45 seconds per break in

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.480 
I'll take about 45 seconds per break in
between<00:01:52.870> each<00:01:53.080> circuit<00:01:53.530> but<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:53.950> don't<00:01:54.130> rest<00:01:54.340> in

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
between each circuit but I don't rest in

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.340 
between each circuit but I don't rest in
between<00:01:54.550> exercises<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.690> I'll<00:01:55.780> go<00:01:55.870> from<00:01:56.080> one<00:01:56.260> to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
between exercises so I'll go from one to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.380 
between exercises so I'll go from one to
the<00:01:56.410> next<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.770> next<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.190> also<00:01:57.910> I'll<00:01:58.270> do

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
the next to the next and also I'll do

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.040 
the next to the next and also I'll do
between<00:01:58.540> 15<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.380> 20<00:02:00.010> reps<00:02:00.220> on<00:02:00.490> each<00:02:01.240> exercise

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
between 15 and 20 reps on each exercise

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.980 
between 15 and 20 reps on each exercise
and<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:03.130> also<00:02:03.280> make<00:02:03.610> sure<00:02:03.760> I<00:02:03.790> hit<00:02:03.970> each<00:02:04.450> side

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
and I also make sure I hit each side

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.170 
and I also make sure I hit each side
