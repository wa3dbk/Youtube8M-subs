00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.440 
branch here and move it down a little
bit<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.860> you<00:01:20.920> line<00:01:21.220> it<00:01:21.250> up<00:01:21.490> it<00:01:21.820> lines<00:01:22.270> up

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
bit so you line it up it lines up

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.570 
bit so you line it up it lines up
perfectly<00:01:22.870> with<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.200> tree<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:24.430> gotta

perfectly with that tree and you gotta
wait<00:01:24.790> for<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:25.150> little<00:01:25.330> radar<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.900> pass

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.100 

I<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:36.610> spot<00:01:36.820> because<00:01:37.090> once<00:01:37.960> you're

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
I like this spot because once you're

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.450 
I like this spot because once you're
locked<00:01:38.380> in<00:01:38.590> there<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.010> you<00:01:39.070> line<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.280> up

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
locked in there and you line it up

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.730 
locked in there and you line it up
perfect<00:01:40.020> you're<00:01:41.020> going<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.229> hit<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.409> pretty

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
perfect you're going to hit it pretty

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.100 
perfect you're going to hit it pretty
much<00:01:42.010> every<00:01:42.310> time<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:46.450> next<00:01:46.750> one<00:01:46.930> I'm<00:01:47.020> going

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
much every time this next one I'm going

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.600 
much every time this next one I'm going
to<00:01:47.200> show<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.830> little<00:01:48.070> bit<00:01:48.310> more

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
to show you is a little bit more

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.520 
to show you is a little bit more
difficult<00:01:48.790> because<00:01:49.390> it's<00:01:49.960> hard<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.290> get<00:01:50.380> to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
difficult because it's hard to get to

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.530 
difficult because it's hard to get to
the<00:01:50.650> small<00:01:50.890> site<00:01:51.190> if<00:01:51.430> you're<00:01:52.119> going<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.300> try<00:01:52.450> to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
the small site if you're going to try to

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.420 
the small site if you're going to try to
hit<00:01:52.720> this<00:01:52.869> spot<00:01:53.140> then<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.830> would<00:01:54.040> recommend

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
hit this spot then I would recommend

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.469 
hit this spot then I would recommend
waiting<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.540> little<00:01:55.750> bit<00:01:56.220> but<00:01:57.220> once<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.180> plant

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
waiting a little bit but once you plant

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.180 
waiting a little bit but once you plant
it<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:58.780> get<00:01:59.140> in<00:01:59.259> your<00:01:59.320> spot<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.920> should<00:02:00.100> be

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
it and get in your spot it should be

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.680 
it and get in your spot it should be
pretty<00:02:00.369> easy<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.850> hit<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.390> you're<00:02:07.509> going<00:02:07.630> to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
pretty easy to hit so you're going to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.229 
pretty easy to hit so you're going to
run<00:02:07.810> back<00:02:08.019> here<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> be<00:02:08.679> bomb<00:02:08.920> site<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
run back here to the be bomb site and

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.600 
run back here to the be bomb site and

crosshair<00:02:43.000> up<00:02:43.150> with<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:44.140> edge<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:45.010> this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
crosshair up with the edge of this

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.150 
crosshair up with the edge of this
branch<00:02:45.519> of<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:46.060> tree<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
branch of this tree and just like the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.830 
branch of this tree and just like the
last<00:02:48.310> one<00:02:48.489> I<00:02:48.579> showed<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.180> one<00:02:49.420> lines<00:02:49.660> up

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
last one I showed you this one lines up

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.930 
last one I showed you this one lines up
really<00:02:50.110> well<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.680> as<00:02:51.160> long<00:02:51.310> as<00:02:51.489> you'll<00:02:51.640> end<00:02:51.820> up

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
really well and as long as you'll end up

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.270 
really well and as long as you'll end up
with<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.239> edge<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:52.720> tree<00:02:53.019> here<00:02:53.290> it'll

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
with the edge of this tree here it'll

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.620 
with the edge of this tree here it'll
land<00:02:54.489> exactly<00:02:54.700> where<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.390> planted<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> bomb

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
land exactly where you planted the bomb

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.240 
land exactly where you planted the bomb
so<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.750> first<00:02:58.930> two<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.200> showed<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.620> guys<00:02:59.769> are

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
so the first two I showed you guys are

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.210 
so the first two I showed you guys are
really<00:03:00.549> easy<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.940> line<00:03:01.120> up<00:03:01.239> with<00:03:01.420> trees<00:03:01.720> and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
really easy to line up with trees and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.500 
really easy to line up with trees and
are<00:03:03.220> going<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> hit<00:03:03.579> all<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.820> time<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.329> this

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
are going to hit all the time and this

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.410 
are going to hit all the time and this

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
third one is a little bit different than

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.410 
third one is a little bit different than
the<00:03:07.540> spots<00:03:07.780> i<00:03:07.900> showed<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.140> before<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:10.360> a

really short spot but it's a it's really

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.880 
really short spot but it's a it's really
good<00:03:13.209> for<00:03:13.420> just<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.870> situations<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.650> Search
