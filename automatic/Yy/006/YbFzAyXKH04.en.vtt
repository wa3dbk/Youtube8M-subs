00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
spectrum lanes with the wood lanes over

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.420 
spectrum lanes with the wood lanes over
there<00:01:49.020> typically<00:01:49.410> wood<00:01:49.680> lanes<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> little

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
there typically wood lanes have a little

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.700 
there typically wood lanes have a little
better<00:01:50.580> approaches<00:01:51.120> in<00:01:51.270> synthetic<00:01:51.570> lanes<00:01:51.960> but

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
better approaches in synthetic lanes but

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800 
better approaches in synthetic lanes but
he<00:01:52.920> he<00:01:53.790> managed<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.240> both<00:01:54.360> very<00:01:54.630> well

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
he he managed to both very well

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.740 
he he managed to both very well
obviously<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.440> get<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> top<00:01:55.920> five<00:01:56.750> imagine

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
obviously to get to the top five imagine

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780 
obviously to get to the top five imagine
if<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.900> didn't<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.200> any<00:01:58.350> trouble<00:01:58.760> well<00:01:59.760> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
if you didn't have any trouble well I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.610 
if you didn't have any trouble well I
talked<00:02:00.120> to<00:02:00.210> him<00:02:00.330> before<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.630> went<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> air

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
talked to him before we went on the air

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.020 
talked to him before we went on the air
and<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.010> said<00:02:02.040> Danny<00:02:02.430> you've<00:02:02.640> won<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:02.880> right

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and I said Danny you've won the right

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.450 
and I said Danny you've won the right
side<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.420> week<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.710> other<00:02:04.830> side<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.310> is

side this week the other side this is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
side this week the other side this is
like<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> doing

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.699 
favorite that same bad shot to be made
last<00:02:12.450> game<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.200> time<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.470> got<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
last game I think this time you got the

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.980 
last game I think this time you got the
three<00:02:13.950> up<00:02:14.100> though<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.660> wonder<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.810> lanes

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
three up though I wonder if the lanes

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.270 
three up though I wonder if the lanes
are<00:02:16.110> changing<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> little<00:02:16.770> bit<00:02:16.860> or<00:02:16.980> maybe<00:02:17.100> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
are changing a little bit or maybe the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.040 
are changing a little bit or maybe the
ball<00:02:17.490> his<00:02:17.760> ball<00:02:17.970> surface<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.540> changing<00:02:18.569> a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
ball his ball surface is changing a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.360 
ball his ball surface is changing a
little<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.410> know<00:02:19.440> these<00:02:19.650> guys<00:02:19.890> showing<00:02:20.190> them

quicker<00:02:51.630> right<00:02:51.930> yeah<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.340> they<00:02:54.030> absorb<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
quicker right yeah and they absorb the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.270 
quicker right yeah and they absorb the
oil<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.900> may<00:02:55.320> be<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.560> resin<00:02:55.860> reactive

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
on the surface of the lane and then I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.810 
on the surface of the lane and then I
got<00:03:04.019> two<00:03:04.200> major<00:03:04.440> bad<00:03:04.920> things<00:03:05.250> happening<00:03:05.670> one

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
got two major bad things happening one

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.460 
got two major bad things happening one
you<00:03:05.940> got<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> oil<00:03:06.209> leaving<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.810> lane<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.260> now

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
you got the oil leaving the lane and now

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.290 
you got the oil leaving the lane and now
you<00:03:07.530> got<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.739> compound<00:03:08.160> down<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.580> area<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.239> the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
you got a compound down the area of the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.120 
you got a compound down the area of the
lane<00:03:09.450> worried<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> guys<00:03:09.959> playing<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.980> can

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
lane worried the guys playing that can

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.319 
lane worried the guys playing that can
create<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.400> different<00:03:11.670> reaction<00:03:11.880> for<00:03:12.209> him

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
create a different reaction for him

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.940 
create a different reaction for him
don't<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.540> think<00:03:12.690> yeah<00:03:13.230> yeah<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.799> other

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
don't you think yeah yeah and the other

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.650 
don't you think yeah yeah and the other
thing<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.489> somewhat<00:03:14.910> what<00:03:15.060> other<00:03:15.390> players

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
thing is is somewhat what other players

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.420 
thing is is somewhat what other players
will<00:03:15.870> do<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:16.170> actually<00:03:16.350> sand<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.860> balls<00:03:17.070> to

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
will do is actually sand the balls to

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.430 
will do is actually sand the balls to
get<00:03:17.579> more<00:03:18.120> friction<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.690> balls<00:03:18.900> which<00:03:19.140> a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
get more friction on the balls which a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.080 
get more friction on the balls which a
lot<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.070> these<00:03:20.220> players<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.579> really<00:03:20.910> hooked

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
lot of these players that really hooked

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.340 
lot of these players that really hooked
the<00:03:21.180> ball<00:03:21.329> don't<00:03:21.450> do<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:21.900> much<00:03:22.049> but<00:03:22.200> some

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
the ball don't do that so much but some

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.449 
the ball don't do that so much but some
of<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> guys<00:03:22.620> saw<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.890> ball<00:03:23.040> go<00:03:23.070> straighter

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
of the guys saw the ball go straighter

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.880 
of the guys saw the ball go straighter
like<00:03:23.670> Danny<00:03:23.910> sometimes<00:03:24.299> myself<00:03:24.870> will<00:03:25.500> do<00:03:25.680> that

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
like Danny sometimes myself will do that

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.259 
like Danny sometimes myself will do that
to<00:03:26.070> get<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.549> ball<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.730> hook<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> little<00:03:27.090> bit

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
to get the ball to hook a little bit

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.960 
to get the ball to hook a little bit
more<00:03:27.560> well<00:03:28.560> what<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:28.860> uh<00:03:28.890> what<00:03:29.310> does<00:03:29.370> Ganz<00:03:29.670> have

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
more well what is uh what does Ganz have

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.699 
more well what is uh what does Ganz have
to<00:03:30.120> do<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.600> get<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> ball<00:03:31.110> on<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.320> one<00:03:31.470> to

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
to do to get the ball on the one to

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.890 
to do to get the ball on the one to
right<00:03:31.980> now<00:03:32.160> well<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:33.269> no<00:03:33.480> idea

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
right now well I have no idea

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.720 
right now well I have no idea
to<00:03:34.500> be<00:03:34.590> honest<00:03:34.829> with<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.280> looked<00:03:35.430> like<00:03:35.579> his

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
to be honest with you it looked like his

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.430 
to be honest with you it looked like his
first<00:03:35.970> shot<00:03:36.150> was<00:03:36.299> really<00:03:36.540> slowest<00:03:36.959> last<00:03:37.230> one

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
first shot was really slowest last one

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.840 
first shot was really slowest last one
looked<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.709> lot<00:03:37.829> better<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:38.280> he<00:03:38.370> just<00:03:38.549> wasn't

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
looked a lot better but he just wasn't

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.220 
looked a lot better but he just wasn't
quite<00:03:39.120> out<00:03:39.299> far<00:03:39.510> enough<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.840> channel<00:03:40.170> I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
quite out far enough to the channel I

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.390 
quite out far enough to the channel I
think<00:03:40.260> there<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.560> some<00:03:40.739> definite<00:03:41.070> hook<00:03:41.250> out

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
think there is some definite hook out

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.800 
think there is some definite hook out
there<00:03:41.640> but<00:03:41.820> he<00:03:42.299> doesn't<00:03:42.510> want<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.660> get<00:03:42.750> too

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
there but he doesn't want to get too

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.390 
there but he doesn't want to get too
close<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.320> because<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> just<00:03:43.829> jumps<00:03:44.160> on<00:03:44.250> him

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
close to it because it just jumps on him

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.160 
close to it because it just jumps on him
so<00:03:44.579> he's<00:03:45.090> definitely<00:03:45.269> gonna<00:03:45.510> be<00:03:45.690> careful<00:03:46.049> and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
so he's definitely gonna be careful and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.900 
so he's definitely gonna be careful and
make<00:03:46.230> some<00:03:46.560> great<00:03:46.680> shots<00:03:47.010> he's<00:03:47.640> having

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
make some great shots he's having

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.400 
make some great shots he's having
problems<00:03:48.329> finding<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.750> right<00:03:48.870> breakpoint

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
problems finding the right breakpoint

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.020 
problems finding the right breakpoint
and<00:03:49.650> getting<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.430> ball<00:03:50.579> into<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.820> break

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
and getting the ball into that break

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.430 
and getting the ball into that break
point<00:03:51.060> with<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.450> right<00:03:51.570> speed<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.110> key<00:03:52.140> if

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
point with the right speed is the key if

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.930 
point with the right speed is the key if
he<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.680> find<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.070> break<00:03:53.280> point<00:03:53.549> with<00:03:53.850> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
he can find the break point with the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.090 
he can find the break point with the
right<00:03:53.970> speed<00:03:54.390> he'll<00:03:54.570> be<00:03:54.690> alright

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
right speed he'll be alright

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.589 
right speed he'll be alright
he's<00:03:56.100> an<00:03:56.250> instinct<00:03:56.670> player<00:03:56.880> anyway

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599
