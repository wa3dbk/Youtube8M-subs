brighter<00:01:30.450> colors<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:32.729> darker<00:01:33.060> colors

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
brighter colors the darker colors

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.780 
brighter colors the darker colors
indicate<00:01:33.900> areas<00:01:34.079> were<00:01:34.439> sleet<00:01:34.770> rain<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.610> maybe

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
indicate areas were sleet rain or maybe

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.480 
indicate areas were sleet rain or maybe
even<00:01:35.880> some<00:01:36.299> freezing<00:01:36.630> rain<00:01:36.810> will<00:01:37.020> occur<00:01:37.619> we

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
even some freezing rain will occur we

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.630 
even some freezing rain will occur we
think<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.329> sleet<00:01:39.840> line<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:41.070> actually

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
think that this sleet line will actually

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.870 
think that this sleet line will actually
set<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.000> across<00:01:42.720> northern<00:01:43.680> Arkansas<00:01:44.399> tonight

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
set up across northern Arkansas tonight

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.080 
set up across northern Arkansas tonight
so<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.210> south<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> Missouri<00:01:46.470> border

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
so just south of the Missouri border

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.609 
so just south of the Missouri border
therefore<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.420> forecasting<00:01:48.750> mostly<00:01:49.560> snow

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
therefore we are forecasting mostly snow

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.730 
therefore we are forecasting mostly snow
