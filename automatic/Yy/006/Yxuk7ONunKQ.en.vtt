00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
one of my favorite guns from one over

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.710 
one of my favorite guns from one over
three<00:02:17.180> well<00:02:18.180> my<00:02:18.330> favorite<00:02:18.690> LMG<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> it's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
three well my favorite LMG it is a it's

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.979 
three well my favorite LMG it is a it's
actually<00:02:22.520> very<00:02:23.520> good<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.360> new<00:02:24.510> patch<00:02:24.780> of

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
actually very good in the new patch of

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.199 
actually very good in the new patch of
one<00:02:25.140> root<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.530> three<00:02:25.709> they<00:02:26.190> changed<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:26.970> all

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
one root of three they changed it so all

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.500 
one root of three they changed it so all
LMGs<00:02:27.870> kill<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.410> two<00:02:28.620> shots<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.280> at<00:02:30.000> long<00:02:30.270> range

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
LMGs kill in two shots and at long range

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.449 
LMGs kill in two shots and at long range
they<00:02:30.750> kill<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.050> 3<00:02:31.200> shots<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.770> LG's<00:02:32.340> are

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
they kill in 3 shots so LG's are

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.910 
they kill in 3 shots so LG's are
actually<00:02:32.790> very<00:02:33.090> useful<00:02:33.330> now<00:02:33.720> except<00:02:34.680> for<00:02:34.709> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
actually very useful now except for the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.620 
actually very useful now except for the
fact<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.250> they're<00:02:35.730> very<00:02:36.060> slow

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
fact that they're very slow

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.960 
fact that they're very slow
and<00:02:36.890> I'll<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:37.950> share<00:02:38.280> some<00:02:38.550> tips<00:02:38.730> with<00:02:38.880> you

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
and I'll just share some tips with you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.300 
and I'll just share some tips with you
that<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.480> know<00:02:39.600> about<00:02:39.810> using<00:02:40.350> LM<00:02:40.860> T's<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.190> water

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
that I know about using LM T's and water

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.280 
that I know about using LM T's and water
for<00:02:41.519> three<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.510> stay<00:02:42.720> tuned<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.080> want<00:02:43.230> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
for three so stay tuned if you want to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.949 
for three so stay tuned if you want to
hear<00:02:43.410> those<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.600> LMG<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:47.209> it's<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:48.780> about

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
hear those so the LMG is it's just about

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.850 
hear those so the LMG is it's just about
the<00:02:49.080> only<00:02:49.230> weapon<00:02:49.830> class<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.940> mana<00:02:51.120> for<00:02:51.300> 3

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
the only weapon class in mana for 3

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.920 
the only weapon class in mana for 3
where<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.160> recoil<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.910> accuracy<00:02:54.630> actually

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
where the recoil and accuracy actually

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.910 
where the recoil and accuracy actually
changes<00:02:55.410> when<00:02:55.739> you're<00:02:55.890> prone<00:02:56.190> crouching<00:02:57.180> and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
changes when you're prone crouching and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.830 
changes when you're prone crouching and
standing<00:02:58.920> up<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.610> standing<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.239> just

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
standing up so standing up it's just

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.670 
standing up so standing up it's just
regular<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.470> then<00:03:02.780> crouching<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.989> minimizes

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
regular and then crouching it minimizes

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.620 
regular and then crouching it minimizes
it<00:03:04.769> by<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> little<00:03:05.280> bit<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.610> then<00:03:05.910> prone<00:03:06.329> it's

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
it by a little bit and then prone it's

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.940 
it by a little bit and then prone it's
just<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.170> very<00:03:07.530> very<00:03:07.650> very<00:03:08.579> tight<00:03:08.850> grouping<00:03:09.269> and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
just a very very very tight grouping and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.970 
just a very very very tight grouping and
that<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.910> helm<00:03:12.030> G's<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.420> really<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.989> only<00:03:13.110> gun

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
that the helm G's is really the only gun

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.780 
that the helm G's is really the only gun
class<00:03:14.250> where<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:16.640> where<00:03:17.640> it's

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
class where that it's where it's

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.490 
class where that it's where it's
actually<00:03:18.299> useful<00:03:19.280> another<00:03:20.280> thing<00:03:20.579> is<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:20.880> um

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
actually useful another thing is that um

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.690 
actually useful another thing is that um
like<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.590> said<00:03:22.620> before<00:03:22.890> all<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.340> them<00:03:23.459> killing

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
like I said before all of them killing

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.860 
like I said before all of them killing
two<00:03:23.850> shots<00:03:24.090> except<00:03:24.510> for<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:26.630> long-range<00:03:27.630> they

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
two shots except for the long-range they

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.440 
two shots except for the long-range they
killing<00:03:28.350> 3<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:31.350> really<00:03:31.799> good<00:03:32.450> class

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
killing 3 and a really really good class

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.250 
killing 3 and a really really good class
to<00:03:33.750> use<00:03:33.959> on<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:36.829> l86<00:03:37.829> LM<00:03:38.160> G<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.230> put<00:03:40.230> a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
to use on this is a l86 LM G and put a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.500 
to use on this is a l86 LM G and put a
grip<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:41.220> thermal<00:03:41.640> scope<00:03:41.850> on<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.420> of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
grip and a thermal scope on it so of

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.060 
grip and a thermal scope on it so of
course<00:03:42.660> you're<00:03:42.840> going<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.989> need<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.320> two

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
it's insane there's absolutely no recoil

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.270 
it's insane there's absolutely no recoil
it's<00:03:53.130> really<00:03:53.700> cool<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:55.260> yeah<00:03:55.560> that's<00:03:55.829> just
