 already closed 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.400
 bad idea 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.460
 torture or 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.590
 it's a passage in 3d 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.020
 things so that they think 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.230
 1 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.780
 I am 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.649
 gold 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 I 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.330
 he 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.399
 3 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.870
 Yes 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.580
 the carpentry culture that is there on the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.880
 edges of your career and who came 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.880
 greet his new deal is a horse 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.739
 how 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.299
 two of four years and mathieu 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.780
 retaining polish brothers who the day where 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.780
 a hard time 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:22.290
 23 28 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:22.290
 the premiums of the matches in the video 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.450
 5 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.489
 2 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.489
 in the world 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.049
 m 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.300
 just that it's a little bit 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.460
 pedagogical so the first grid of 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.180
 scoring the first mare 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.739
 big section for the annoyance not good 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.150
 react to crises presents itself very well 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.850
 so on her head and knew her she had 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.960
 they considered so but it's still 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.090
 was very well directed him 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.220
 he gave us the rating of six out of ten to 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.630
 on the top line I was saying everything to 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.310
 the time is very important for a ig 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.650
 to have unique very very well heard that 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.730
 will determine the power among others of 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.190
 mare she scored 7 out of 10 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.690
 which is very very good corner 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.730
 members and profiles so that's 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.230
 a mare that will require she is 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.970
 massive enough that make him 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.560
 carrying members and enough members 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.070
 powerful to eventually power 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.500
 performed very much of the line activities 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:03.200
 she got another 7 out of 10 there 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.990
 another strong point in his paces 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.030
 so it's a mare who hires her very 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.430
 well one does not trot and who is at 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.470
 duel six out of ten and in print 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.160
 which is the fifth criterion 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.710
 which is judged current on horses 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.910
 is that the obvious times it takes 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.860
 as well as the following ones it is 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.300
 aesthetic and that please and so the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.760
 judges 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:30.260
 as much we would not want anything satire it's 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.600
 all these notes that we will remember from 33 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.990
 on 50 which is very good blow 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.970
 side 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.570
 and frankly with two like that I 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.340
 am very sorry especially very reassured 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.690
 to know that a mare from the region 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.690
 wants to defend our colors 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.360
 Bernard Achour 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.380
 when 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.100
 roubaud 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.990
 he did what we love
