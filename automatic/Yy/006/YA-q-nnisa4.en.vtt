00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.160
 we go again to mendoza now to 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.930
 talk about the champions trophy that are 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.420
 playing there the lionesses the lionesses that 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.219
 by beating him 4-1 england they have finished 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.289
 first in what your group in the group 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.209
 go today they will dispute their party by quarters 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.800
 of final against China and who was 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.449
 there speaking exclusively with one of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.950
 the front ones with delfin merino was the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.260
 aura couto 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.260
 the match we started in the ideal way 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.550
 that we would have wanted but that the 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.860
 team tried to reverse it in everything 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.410
 moment thanks to them in the last 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.030
 fourth we could make the difference that 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.720
 we needed to classify first 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.580
 so on that side happy with what 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.220
 that the team offered today and demonstrated 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.500
 until the last minute and with respect to 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.059
 the zones and the crossings that are given by 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.760
 there are not the expected ones but neither is 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.340
 something that pulls out the dream if we want 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.660
 meet the main objective that is 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.610
 win this championship trophy you have to 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.580
 win everyone and I'll do in any 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.560
 moment so for more than that out there 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.270
 It's not ideal that Holland has 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.400
 ranked first and more as you can 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.290
 say I think we are 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.869
 focused on ourselves while going 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.750
 step by step what now the main thing 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.420
 it is Chinese if it is not a physical rival it is a 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.580
 rival that runs is a rival that plays 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.340
 a lot with what the body is 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.090
 has a certain structure with what is the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.149
 ball that is also good 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.189
 but I think the main thing or do 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.149
 we as we face the game as 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.250
 this I do not know tomorrow to play and I think 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.539
 that you win and attitude are not going to be left over like this 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.619
 I hope everything goes as planned 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.049
 personally I do not like anything in the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.869
 four quarters is something that the truth 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.799
 we talk a lot between each other 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.840
 all the changes sometimes generate 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.479
 comments and sometimes at the beginning 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.850
 it costs to assimilate it but the truth is that 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.420
 I still personally do not feel 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.640
 That taste that I like 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.670
 but you have to see how it works 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.259
 to see if it is already stipulated and 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.259
 According to that, we will have to raise 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.619
 really what is the best formula for 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.619
 play them
