larger pool is written the base of the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
larger pool is written the base of the
tank<00:00:51.469> right<00:00:52.469> did<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> put<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
tank right did you put that down a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.660 
tank right did you put that down a
second<00:00:54.469> here<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:58.440> pot<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.370> speak

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
second here we have the pot so to speak

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.150 
second here we have the pot so to speak
as<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.260> got<00:01:01.379> no<00:01:01.680> holes<00:01:01.949> in

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
as you can see it's got no holes in

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
as you can see it's got no holes in
apart<00:01:02.730> from<00:01:02.879> these<00:01:02.969> two<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.390> uneven<00:01:03.750> pitches

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
apart from these two your uneven pitches

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.850 
apart from these two your uneven pitches
by<00:01:05.189> no<00:01:05.430> means<00:01:05.670> enough<00:01:06.470> he<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.650> want<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
by no means enough he just want to

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
prepare daily adult

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.550 
prepare daily adult
somewhat<00:01:11.000> earlier<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.840> takes<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.140> long<00:01:12.289> time<00:01:12.350> to

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
somewhat earlier it takes a long time to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.289 
somewhat earlier it takes a long time to
drill<00:01:12.890> these<00:01:13.039> holes<00:01:13.149> so<00:01:14.149> we<00:01:14.649> have<00:01:15.649> fun<00:01:19.180> for<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
drill these holes so we have fun for the

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.929 
drill these holes so we have fun for the
base<00:01:20.509> of<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:20.869> pot<00:01:21.140> we<00:01:21.619> will<00:01:21.829> require<00:01:22.220> one<00:01:22.820> of

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
base of this pot we will require one of

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.179 
base of this pot we will require one of
these<00:01:23.470> these<00:01:24.470> have<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:24.950> be<00:01:25.159> man-made<00:01:25.610> also<00:01:26.270> by

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
these these have to be man-made also by

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.020 
these these have to be man-made also by
four<00:01:28.189> millimeter<00:01:28.579> two<00:01:29.270> pieces<00:01:29.829> some<00:01:30.850> form<00:01:31.850> in

neighborhood which should fit exactly in
the<00:01:42.500> base<00:01:42.649> of<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.459> pot<00:01:44.049> also<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:46.039> will<00:01:46.159> need

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
the base of the pot also you will need

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.089 
the base of the pot also you will need
to<00:01:46.520> make<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.909> dripper<00:01:47.420> rigging<00:01:47.689> system<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:48.860> feed

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099 
to make a dripper rigging system to feed

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.999 
to make a dripper rigging system to feed
top<00:01:49.459> of<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.729> system<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:51.020> done<00:01:51.229> with<00:01:51.470> some

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
top of the system this is done with some

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.130 
top of the system this is done with some
six<00:01:52.369> mil<00:01:52.580> paper<00:01:52.849> and<00:01:53.179> some<00:01:53.990> five<00:01:54.890> mill<00:01:55.189> elbows

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
six mil paper and some five mill elbows

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.020 
six mil paper and some five mill elbows
these<00:01:57.140> need<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.439> be<00:01:57.590> preheated<00:01:58.189> with<00:01:58.640> some<00:01:58.819> hot

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
these need to be preheated with some hot

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.139 
these need to be preheated with some hot
water<00:01:59.209> to<00:01:59.599> actually<00:01:59.929> get<00:02:00.080> them<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.349> fit

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
water to actually get them to fit

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.089 
water to actually get them to fit
perfectly<00:02:02.149> once<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.259> have<00:02:03.349> done<00:02:03.470> these<00:02:03.679> you

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
perfectly once you have done these you

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.730 
perfectly once you have done these you
will<00:02:04.250> also<00:02:04.399> need<00:02:04.789> to<00:02:05.539> complete<00:02:05.929> a<00:02:06.110> larger

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
will also need to complete a larger

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.400 
will also need to complete a larger
vision<00:02:06.950> of<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:07.640> grid<00:02:07.909> for<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.810> base<00:02:08.959> of<00:02:09.170> here

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
vision of this grid for the base of here

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.250 
vision of this grid for the base of here
so<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.310> will<00:02:10.459> fill<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.910> whole<00:02:11.090> base<00:02:11.329> this<00:02:12.049> will

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
so it will fill the whole base this will

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.240 
so it will fill the whole base this will
need<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.590> be<00:02:12.620> attached<00:02:13.370> firmly<00:02:13.610> using<00:02:14.540> some

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
need to be attached firmly using some

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.760 
need to be attached firmly using some
easy<00:02:16.250> fix<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:17.569> is<00:02:17.750> security<00:02:18.200> stickers

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.650 

so<00:02:22.770> once<00:02:23.520> you've<00:02:23.670> completed<00:02:23.850> all<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.360> them

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
so once you've completed all of them

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.620 
so once you've completed all of them
which<00:02:25.080> will<00:02:25.260> be<00:02:25.410> sometime<00:02:25.650> later<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:27.510> will

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
which will be sometime later you will

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.160 
which will be sometime later you will
have<00:02:30.830> something<00:02:31.830> resembling<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.870> now<00:02:33.870> once

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
have something resembling this now once

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.310 
have something resembling this now once
that's<00:02:34.380> completed<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.700> will<00:02:35.730> need<00:02:36.060> an<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.960> pump

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
that's completed you will need an a pump

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.130
