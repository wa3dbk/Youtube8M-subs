00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.379
 today it is loud with us because it works 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.050
 around the lucasarts classic full throttle 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.119
 or in Germany full throttle tim shepherd 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.710
 We know all the current as the man 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.680
 behind double fine and as a fixed starter 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.140
 legend early 90s was with day of 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.939
 the tentacle scene gets around and out 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.830
 bonn gilbert's shadow emerged 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.110
 He paid homage to his next play 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.150
 a lifestyle demir like we did at the latest 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.989
 since legendary blood likes to care 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.989
 the metal 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.199
 after the classic 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.510
 adventure stories from indie and 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.699
 monkey island and completely wacky 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.790
 Date title he on the tentacle and sam &amp; 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.409
 max went lucasarts new trails full throttle 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.270
 understood less than classical 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.710
 adventure but as interactive 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.710
 cartoon road movie 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.810
 Here the story was clearly in the foreground 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.100
 and this was clearly more adult than 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.619
 in the games before 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.330
 despite numerous gags is full throttle too 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.950
 no slapstick fireworks with the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.960
 but it has one thing before 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.060
 together to cut the density 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.590
 the atmosphere 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.020
 the setting is a mixture of easy 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.299
 rider and mad max in one not all too 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.399
 distant future ruling corporations over 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.810
 the cities and outlaw motorcycle gangs 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.520
 over the wasteland in between 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.750
 at least that's how the game works 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.020
 Do not lose yourself in here 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.610
 Exposure and biker chief of the pole 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.560
 Cats gang gets into an intrigue 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.479
 entangled him will murder on 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.610
 Great industrial mail.com collie 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.590
 attached what should ultimately lead to it 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:07.130
 that the company of this biker legend in 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.390
 Future I thought that you 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.860
 maybe some help with the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.510
 negotiations need sir 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.060
 behind it is the greasy 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.650
 suit wear adrien rippberger not because 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.209
 only bands entire aisle behind lattice 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.370
 but also brings his bike 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.269
 sabotages when she threatens and makes herself 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.220
 to avenge himself 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.690
 cleanse his name and rip 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.970
 burgers plans to thwart 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.280
 while there will be some dead give 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.050
 Here you can see something with it 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.880
 child friendly anarcho charm of a sam &amp; 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.560
 max, this approach is not much to 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.600
 do because the fists ever 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.000
 Talk or nails in it 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.710
 or chain saws and thus it fits 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.450
 that lucasarts not only us here 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.060
 can be castles but also various 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.040
 action deposits will be among others 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.780
 We beat other rockers off the street 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.530
 or Imperial cars in destruction 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.840
 derby 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.030
 These deposits have many at that time 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.070
 adventure fans disturbed the reproach 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.900
 such mini games do not belong in one 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.160
 adventure and with that you only want the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.960
 stretch game time 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.180
 that was about five hours 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.670
 not exactly for the time 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.710
 epic too that if suddenly as 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.720
 first lópez has been in the back since then 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.150
 blessing time could bumped many 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.130
 but bitter was on bands die 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.960
 the game is not over it only pretended 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.600
 the scene in question again 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.490
 the game was also compared at least 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.890
 with monkey island 2 or day of the 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.960
 tentacle quite linear which of course 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.010
 tremendous fluid dramaturgy of the help 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.960
 to build a story 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.030
 many jigsaw puzzles , too 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.520
 too easy there just less locations and 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.900
 Items for election would stand today 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.370
 this manko the least 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.930
 stand out for the most current 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.030
 adventures go away 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.640
 Today one likes to be grateful for the fun 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.640
 be the full throttle already 1995 boot 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.370
 What you save on the cost 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.560
 the presentation went to the vga 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.930
 graphic merged in a great way and 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.060
 wise 2d animations with edges graphic 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.070
 which was often tried in the nineties 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.540
 It works perfectly well here 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.430
 out would be a bit more pixelated 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.110
 cartoon with state-of-the-art technology 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.420
 that is about to cost in the low 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.680
 have beaten allegedly 15 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.680
 million dollars 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.180
 this was joined by droning 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.340
 sound effects metal music of the band even 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.320
 jackals are too modest for the game 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.150
 fame helped and excellent speakers 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.959
 both in the English and under 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.959
 German wave 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.969
 in the original version should once 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.990
 more mark hamill occur and citizens 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.550
 lend his voice 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.319
 and otherwise the americans are likely 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.699
 various voices hear this 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.219
 example from the simpsons or 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.530
 ghostbusters edges in German became 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:50.229
 Tilo Schmitz talked about the band 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.560
 as a voice from frontman gerard butler 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.849
 in 306 dragon age 2 and that unfortunately 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:01.439
 2012 deceased Michael Clarke Duncan 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:05.529
 Sorry but these are shirts 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:07.210
 are the pure cotton is enough 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:10.889
 but not quite the even fuller and 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.889
 deeper original voice from the band 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.669
 All in all it was done so completely 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.479
 incomparable flair on the monitor 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.550
 to conjure 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.680
 already in the credits, we could hot 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.439
 provide reasonable asphalt was the 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.900
 difficult high of asphalt and that 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:28.539
 First thing I saw when I woke up 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.759
 her face is atmosphere left us until 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.460
 slowly to the dying tribel not worthy 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.110
 more going on though tim shepherd lucasarts 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.050
 after working on grim fandango 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.089
 left the studio in 2000 and left 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.509
 2002 continued on the legs 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.699
 put 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.680
 and although already trailer and gameplay 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.339
 existed both attempts were again 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.560
 pulped 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.240
 with the statement one wanted the fans no 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.710
 He does not present a product he does not 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.870
 was completely convinced 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.000
 without tim shepherd probably would have 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.339
 not good anyway and delivered 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.770
 yes later with blood in legend the metal 

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:02.560
 at any rate full throttle anyway 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.779
 polarized 1995 fans as well as press 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.939
 some liked the atmosphere and the 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:08.740
 idea of ​​an interactive roadmovie's 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.599
 others keep playing too easy 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.880
 and too short in any well-stocked one 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.200
 Collection of adventure classics 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.810
 failed the next time we see 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.810
 us then with particles of chris taylor
