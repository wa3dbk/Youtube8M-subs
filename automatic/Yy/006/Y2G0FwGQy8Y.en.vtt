it hello yes Taylor jr. and then you can
Windows<00:01:41.369> key<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> same<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:44.899> think<00:01:45.899> that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
Windows key is the same as I think that

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.630 
Windows key is the same as I think that
I<00:01:46.290> don't<00:01:46.350> know<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:46.770> commander<00:01:47.250> option

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
I don't know if that's commander option

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.249 
I don't know if that's commander option
on<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> Mac<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.450> anyway<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.930> same<00:01:49.110> as

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
on the Mac but anyway it's the same as

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.940 
on the Mac but anyway it's the same as
doing<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.649> safe<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.570> Windows<00:01:52.500> key<00:01:52.710> R

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
doing that safe and then Windows key R

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.359 
doing that safe and then Windows key R
will<00:01:53.310> run<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.710> then<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.159> over

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
will run it and then here it is over

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.590 
will run it and then here it is over
here<00:01:59.570> that's<00:02:00.570> too<00:02:00.869> big<00:02:01.729> let's<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:02.969> close<00:02:03.329> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
here that's too big let's see close it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.910 
here that's too big let's see close it
you<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.799> says<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.159> running<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:05.909> hey

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
if you closed the simulator it'll say

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.190 
if you closed the simulator it'll say

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
I'm recording a video it's it's

00:03:47.170 --> 00:04:27.840 
I'm recording a video it's it's
emulating<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:47.860> Mac<00:03:48.070> hardware<00:03:48.430> so

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.540 

anyways<00:04:28.850> if<00:04:29.600> I<00:04:29.870> really<00:04:30.410> really<00:04:30.440> want<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.220> good

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
anyways if I really really want a good

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.730 
anyways if I really really want a good
performance<00:04:32.090> then<00:04:32.690> I<00:04:32.840> could<00:04:33.050> find<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.590> way<00:04:33.620> to

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
performance then I could find a way to

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.279 
performance then I could find a way to
get<00:04:33.979> myself<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.400> Mac<00:04:34.630> but<00:04:35.630> anyway<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:36.110> is<00:04:36.169> a

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
get myself a Mac but anyway this is a

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.189 
get myself a Mac but anyway this is a
pretty<00:04:36.500> cool<00:04:36.710> way<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:37.750> play<00:04:38.750> around<00:04:38.960> with<00:04:39.139> a

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
pretty cool way to play around with a

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:39.969 
pretty cool way to play around with a
Mac<00:04:39.410> I<00:04:39.440> guess

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
Mac I guess

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.270 
Mac I guess
and<00:04:40.160> there's<00:04:40.669> my<00:04:40.850> SkyDrive<00:04:41.150> here<00:04:41.979> we<00:04:42.979> go<00:04:43.100> back

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
and there's my SkyDrive here we go back

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.490 
and there's my SkyDrive here we go back
out<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:43.580> exclusive<00:04:44.120> mode<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.840> then<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.320> was

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
out of exclusive mode and then that was

00:04:48.500 --> 00:05:06.670 
out of exclusive mode and then that was
my<00:05:02.410> SkyDrive<00:05:03.910> hello<00:05:04.910> world<00:05:05.289> and<00:05:06.289> there's<00:05:06.470> my

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
my SkyDrive hello world and there's my

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.520 
my SkyDrive hello world and there's my
hello<00:05:06.919> world<00:05:07.250> code<00:05:07.520> on<00:05:07.849> my<00:05:07.880> I<00:05:08.450> can<00:05:09.229> take<00:05:09.410> this

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
hello world code on my I can take this

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.290 
hello world code on my I can take this
and<00:05:09.680> put<00:05:09.830> this<00:05:09.860> on<00:05:10.039> a<00:05:10.070> USB<00:05:10.370> Drive<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:11.030> take<00:05:11.180> it

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
and put this on a USB Drive and take it

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.260 
and put this on a USB Drive and take it
to<00:05:11.360> class<00:05:11.830> or<00:05:12.830> just<00:05:13.160> do<00:05:13.310> it<00:05:13.430> from<00:05:13.550> here<00:05:13.849> go<00:05:14.090> back

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
to class or just do it from here go back

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.060 
to class or just do it from here go back
to<00:05:14.389> my<00:05:14.539> full<00:05:14.750> screen<00:05:15.050> you<00:05:15.080> know<00:05:17.800> it<00:05:18.800> takes<00:05:18.979> a

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
to my full screen you know it takes a

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.469 
to my full screen you know it takes a
minute<00:05:19.310> for<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.490> screen<00:05:19.789> to<00:05:19.880> buffer<00:05:20.150> then<00:05:20.270> it'll

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
minute for a screen to buffer then it'll

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.250 
minute for a screen to buffer then it'll
jump<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.870> bit<00:05:21.020> until<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.590> resizes<00:05:22.510> then<00:05:23.510> there's

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
jump a bit until it resizes then there's

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.460 
jump a bit until it resizes then there's
my<00:05:24.849> inside<00:05:25.849> of<00:05:25.970> Mac<00:05:26.180> there's<00:05:26.449> my<00:05:26.630> SkyDrive<00:05:26.930> and

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
my inside of Mac there's my SkyDrive and

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.180 
my inside of Mac there's my SkyDrive and
then<00:05:28.039> my<00:05:28.190> SkyDrive<00:05:28.430> app<00:05:28.849> will<00:05:29.030> sync<00:05:29.270> it<00:05:29.449> online

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
then my SkyDrive app will sync it online

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.000 
then my SkyDrive app will sync it online
and<00:05:31.190> then<00:05:31.520> I<00:05:31.669> can<00:05:31.820> write<00:05:32.030> my<00:05:32.210> code<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:33.080> be<00:05:33.979> a

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
and then I can write my code and be a

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.290 
and then I can write my code and be a
happy<00:05:34.780> programming<00:05:35.780> camper<00:05:36.229> I<00:05:37.060> guess<00:05:38.060> that's

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
happy programming camper I guess that's

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.629 
happy programming camper I guess that's
it<00:05:38.479> for<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.750> video

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.060 

or<00:05:43.639> I<00:05:43.669> can<00:05:44.060> let's<00:05:44.810> see<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:44.990> got<00:05:45.289> to<00:05:45.410> come<00:05:45.620> off<00:05:45.800> of

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
or I can let's see I got to come off of

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.879 
or I can let's see I got to come off of
the<00:05:46.160> soldier<00:05:46.520> game<00:05:46.669> you<00:05:47.229> take<00:05:48.229> focus<00:05:48.620> off<00:05:48.770> the

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
the soldier game you take focus off the

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.740 
the soldier game you take focus off the
window<00:05:49.160> so<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.430> input<00:05:49.699> can<00:05:49.940> be<00:05:49.970> received<00:05:50.479> and

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
window so the input can be received and

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.349 
window so the input can be received and
then<00:05:50.930> you'd<00:05:51.050> have<00:05:51.139> to
