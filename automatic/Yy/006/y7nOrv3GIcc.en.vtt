later because I'll put a link for his
channel<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> description<00:00:55.010> but<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
channel in the description but it's a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.930 
channel in the description but it's a
purse<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> let's<00:00:57.450> see<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> rest<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.170> me

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
purse on that let's see the rest to me

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.300 
purse on that let's see the rest to me
so<00:00:59.940> his<00:01:00.510> vessel<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.170> essence<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.980> pretty

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
so his vessel in essence it's pretty

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.030 
so his vessel in essence it's pretty
compact<00:01:02.670> he's<00:01:03.180> only<00:01:03.570> three<00:01:03.870> by<00:01:04.049> seven<00:01:04.110> by<00:01:04.619> five

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
compact he's only three by seven by five

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.700 
compact he's only three by seven by five
being<00:01:05.820> seven<00:01:06.360> white<00:01:06.570> three<00:01:06.900> deep<00:01:07.079> in<00:01:07.350> five

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
being seven white three deep in five

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.730 
being seven white three deep in five
high<00:01:08.009> and<00:01:08.659> yeah<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:10.020> pretty<00:01:10.200> nice<00:01:10.560> because

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
high and yeah it's pretty nice because

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.460 
high and yeah it's pretty nice because
it<00:01:11.070> has<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> nice<00:01:11.579> opening<00:01:12.000> sequence<00:01:12.479> let's<00:01:13.259> can

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
it has a nice opening sequence let's can

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.440 
it has a nice opening sequence let's can
see<00:01:13.620> like<00:01:13.800> that<00:01:15.710> yeah<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.280> dumb<00:01:17.610> part<00:01:17.880> about

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
see like that yeah the dumb part about

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
see like that yeah the dumb part about
this<00:01:18.750> design<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.830> has<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.310> use<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
this design is that it has to use a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.580 
this design is that it has to use a
wooden<00:01:20.970> button<00:01:21.479> because<00:01:21.870> it<00:01:21.900> doesn't<00:01:22.320> work

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
wooden button because it doesn't work

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.270 
wooden button because it doesn't work
weight<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:25.049> came<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.830> put

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
weight and so on but you came in put

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
weight and so on but you came in put
this<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:26.790> rests<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.510> so<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> don't

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
this which rests on this so you don't

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
this which rests on this so you don't
have<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.500> use<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:29.450> repeater<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.920> also

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
have to use a repeater now you can also

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.120 
have to use a repeater now you can also
put<00:01:32.610> these<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.180> three<00:01:33.600> any<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.260> six<00:01:34.530> for

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
put these on three any one six for

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.789 
put these on three any one six for
making<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.940> little<00:01:36.240> bit<00:01:36.390> faster<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
making it a little bit faster but it

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.550 
making it a little bit faster but it
won't<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.220> missing<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.080> it<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
won't be missing so I don't like it that

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.060 
won't be missing so I don't like it that
much

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
much

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.880 
much
now<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.390> nice<00:01:42.600> part<00:01:42.930> about<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.380> design<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
now a nice part about this design is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.300 
now a nice part about this design is
that<00:01:44.010> use<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.940> Scout<00:01:45.900> room<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.500> change<00:01:47.100> if

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that use this Scout room to change if

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.080 
that use this Scout room to change if
these<00:01:47.780> if<00:01:48.780> these<00:01:49.190> listen<00:01:50.190> will<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.520> powers<00:01:50.909> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
these if these listen will be powers of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.530 
these if these listen will be powers of
not<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.869> what<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:53.010> do<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.580> because<00:01:54.180> it's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
not in what this will do is because it's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.679 
not in what this will do is because it's
between<00:01:55.400> sorry<00:01:56.400> because<00:01:56.820> there<00:01:57.150> is<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.330> block

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
between sorry because there is a block

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.899 
between sorry because there is a block
between<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.170> code<00:01:58.710> room<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.369> comparator

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
between the code room and the comparator

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.140 
between the code room and the comparator
when<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.110> pushes<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.920> code<00:02:02.400> room<00:02:02.580> down<00:02:02.909> it's

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
when it pushes the code room down it's

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.929 
when it pushes the code room down it's
wrong<00:02:03.510> update<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> comparator<00:02:04.770> until<00:02:05.640> this

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
wrong update the comparator until this

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
wrong update the comparator until this
torch<00:02:06.270> turns<00:02:06.540> back<00:02:06.869> home<00:02:07.080> because<00:02:07.439> this

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
torch turns back home because this

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.390 
torch turns back home because this
button<00:02:08.549> will<00:02:08.879> turn<00:02:09.299> off<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.349> when<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.950> turns

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
button will turn off and when the turns

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.119 
button will turn off and when the turns
back<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.150> will<00:02:12.360> update<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:13.080> comparator<00:02:13.799> so

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
back on it will update the comparator so

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.390 
back on it will update the comparator so
it<00:02:14.489> will<00:02:14.790> power<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.510> piston<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.409> it<00:02:17.040> will<00:02:17.250> be

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
it will power the piston and it will be

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.000 
it will power the piston and it will be
in<00:02:17.459> sync<00:02:17.849> with<00:02:18.029> the<00:02:18.090> other<00:02:18.540> one

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.899 

trying<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.370> show<00:02:21.549> that<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:24.129> see<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
trying to show that you see that the

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.339 
trying to show that you see that the
comparator<00:02:25.390> takes<00:02:25.629> a<00:02:25.750> little<00:02:25.959> bit<00:02:26.079> suit

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
comparator takes a little bit suit

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.030 
comparator takes a little bit suit
enough<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.569> think<00:02:28.599> that's<00:02:29.110> best<00:02:29.379> fit<00:02:29.709> so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
enough but I think that's best fit so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.030 
enough but I think that's best fit so
you<00:02:30.099> know<00:02:30.519> let's<00:02:30.970> go<00:02:31.180> with<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.629> Torah<00:02:32.040> so

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
you know let's go with the Torah so

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.619 
you know let's go with the Torah so
we're<00:02:33.280> gonna<00:02:33.400> start<00:02:33.700> out<00:02:33.790> where<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.180> want<00:02:34.390> so

we're gonna start out where you want so

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.199 
we're gonna start out where you want so

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.539 
and Montek but it won't be in sync so I
don't<00:03:22.269> have<00:03:22.389> that<00:03:22.599> much<00:03:22.889> but<00:03:23.889> apart<00:03:24.340> from<00:03:24.430> that

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
don't have that much but apart from that

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.319

anus<00:04:16.780> conceit<00:04:17.170> was<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:17.739> fine

anus conceit was just fine

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.140 
anus conceit was just fine
so<00:04:20.880> that's<00:04:21.509> basically<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:22.460> I'm<00:04:23.460> wrong<00:04:24.000> with

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
so that's basically it I'm wrong with

so that's basically it I'm wrong with
this<00:04:24.330> design<00:04:24.690> is<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.169> can<00:04:25.590> see<00:04:26.310> the

this design is that you can see the

this design is that you can see the

but<00:04:29.310> for<00:04:30.090> being<00:04:30.599> a<00:04:30.750> very<00:04:31.020> compact<00:04:31.470> design<00:04:31.680> I

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
but for being a very compact design I

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.390
