the<00:00:34.260> stuff<00:00:34.500> yesterday<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.370> didn't<00:00:35.579> make<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the stuff yesterday I just didn't make a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.630 
the stuff yesterday I just didn't make a
video<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:37.040> haven't<00:00:38.040> been<00:00:38.219> working<00:00:38.370> at

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
video of it I haven't been working at

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.580 
video of it I haven't been working at
all<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> day<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.899> million

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
all the day because it's like a million

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.950 
all the day because it's like a million
degrees<00:00:40.739> out<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:47.329> this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> motor

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
degrees out so this is what the motor

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.850 
degrees out so this is what the motor
looks<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.410> now

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
looks like now

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.229 
looks like now
pulled<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> front<00:00:50.670> head<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
pulled the front head off and

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.069 
pulled the front head off and
surprisingly<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.390> wasn't<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.690> head<00:00:54.870> gasket

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
surprisingly it wasn't a head gasket

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
surprisingly it wasn't a head gasket
because<00:00:57.800> I'll<00:00:58.800> show<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> head<00:00:59.370> gasket

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
because I'll show you the head gasket

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.429 
because I'll show you the head gasket
here<00:01:04.850> here's<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.060> gasket<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.780> mean<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
here here's the gasket I mean if you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.149 
here here's the gasket I mean if you
look<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.930> can't<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.409> any<00:01:10.560> spots<00:01:10.860> where

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
look at it you can't see any spots where

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:21.550 
look at it you can't see any spots where
it's<00:01:11.310> noticeably<00:01:12.740> blow<00:01:13.740> under<00:01:14.100> anything

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.190 

so<00:01:22.960> we<00:01:23.960> took<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.140> look<00:01:24.320> at<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.560> head<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:26.200> we

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
so we took a look at the head and we

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.410 
so we took a look at the head and we
laid<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.470> square<00:01:27.890> across<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:32.270> was

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
laid a square across it and it was

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.469 
laid a square across it and it was
warped<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.610> we<00:01:34.700> took<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:34.909> up<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.210> machine

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
warped so we took it up to the machine

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.149 
warped so we took it up to the machine
shop<00:01:35.509> today<00:01:36.020> they're<00:01:36.590> going<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.799> take<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:36.950> look

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
shop today they're going to take a look

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.249 
shop today they're going to take a look
at<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.490> they're<00:01:37.610> going<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:38.649> mill<00:01:39.649> it<00:01:39.680> down

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
at it and they're going to mill it down

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.590 
at it and they're going to mill it down
but<00:01:42.259> when<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:42.500> took<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.770> head<00:01:42.920> off<00:01:43.390> these<00:01:44.390> two

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
but when we took the head off these two

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.609 
but when we took the head off these two
cylinders<00:01:44.869> are<00:01:45.259> full<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.530> water<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:50.290> yeah<00:01:51.290> I

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
cylinders are full of water and yeah I

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.070 
cylinders are full of water and yeah I
mean<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:52.310> was<00:01:52.520> pull<00:01:52.759> all<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.660> way<00:01:53.690> up<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:53.990> the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
mean this was pull all the way up to the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.660 
mean this was pull all the way up to the
edge<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:54.710> was<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.160> know<00:01:55.280> just<00:01:55.460> had<00:01:55.640> a

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
edge and this was you know just had a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.889 
edge and this was you know just had a
little<00:01:55.850> bit<00:01:55.970> sit<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.300> there<00:01:57.940> but<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.780> know

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
little bit sit in there but you know

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.540 
little bit sit in there but you know
whatever<00:02:02.830> what<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.860> really<00:02:04.130> want<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.340> do<00:02:04.460> is

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
whatever what I really want to do is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.190 
whatever what I really want to do is
take<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.880> intake<00:02:05.270> manifold<00:02:05.720> off<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.080> get

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
take the intake manifold off and get

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.719 
take the intake manifold off and get
that<00:02:06.229> ported<00:02:06.800> because<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:07.130> think<00:02:07.310> that'd<00:02:07.610> be

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
that ported because I think that'd be

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:08.169 
that ported because I think that'd be
cool

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
cool

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.790 
cool
it's<00:02:08.690> like<00:02:09.340> really<00:02:10.340> rough<00:02:10.580> inside<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.800> it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
it's like really rough inside of it it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.220 
it's like really rough inside of it it
looks<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.250> cast<00:02:14.209> aluminum<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.989> think

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
looks like it's cast aluminum I think

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.400 
looks like it's cast aluminum I think
I'm<00:02:15.800> not<00:02:16.040> sure<00:02:16.280> or<00:02:17.060> maybe<00:02:17.569> it's<00:02:17.720> cast<00:02:17.959> iron<00:02:18.110> I

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
I'm not sure or maybe it's cast iron I

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.800 
I'm not sure or maybe it's cast iron I
don't<00:02:18.560> know<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:20.060> anyway<00:02:20.180> they<00:02:20.510> made<00:02:20.630> no

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
don't know but anyway they made no

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.370 
don't know but anyway they made no
effort<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.319> smoothing<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.370> out<00:02:22.489> at<00:02:22.640> all<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:24.730> and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
effort of smoothing it out at all so and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.580 
effort of smoothing it out at all so and
I<00:02:27.790> had<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.940> take<00:02:29.120> off<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.600> exhaust<00:02:30.049> manifold

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
I had to take off the exhaust manifold

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.060 
I had to take off the exhaust manifold
of<00:02:30.680> course<00:02:30.980> get<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.790> head<00:02:32.030> off<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:33.739> was<00:02:33.829> really

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
of course get the head off it was really

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.650 
of course get the head off it was really
stupid<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.760> there's<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.090> bracket<00:02:35.540> that

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
stupid is that there's this bracket that

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.050 
stupid is that there's this bracket that
holds<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.140> power<00:02:36.320> steering<00:02:36.680> pump<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:37.340> the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
holds on the power steering pump and the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.630 
holds on the power steering pump and the
alternator<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.950> course<00:02:40.190> had<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.400> bolt

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
alternator and of course had to bolt

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.430 
alternator and of course had to bolt
that<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.120> head<00:02:41.329> so<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.049> take<00:02:42.200> off<00:02:42.410> a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
that to the head so I have to take off a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.979 
that to the head so I have to take off a
whole<00:02:42.709> bunch<00:02:42.829> of<00:02:43.040> stuff<00:02:43.400> down<00:02:43.610> here<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.120> think

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
whole bunch of stuff down here I think

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.420 
whole bunch of stuff down here I think
there's<00:02:45.170> two<00:02:45.380> or<00:02:45.500> three<00:02:45.530> bolts<00:02:46.010> wait<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.280> take

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
there's two or three bolts wait to take

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.289 
there's two or three bolts wait to take
off<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:52.280> take<00:02:52.549> those<00:02:52.700> off<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.180> get

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
off and it take those off just to get

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.580 
off and it take those off just to get
the<00:02:53.390> head<00:02:53.510> off<00:02:53.660> because<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.320> know<00:02:54.380> they're

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
the head off because you know they're

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.289 
the head off because you know they're
bolted<00:02:54.859> to<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.040> head<00:02:55.190> nothing<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.120> could<00:02:56.269> do

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
bolted to the head nothing I could do

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.490 
bolted to the head nothing I could do
and<00:02:59.299> I<00:03:01.780> think<00:03:02.780> you're<00:03:02.870> probably<00:03:03.109> going<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.380> put

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
and I think you're probably going to put

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.620 
and I think you're probably going to put
new<00:03:03.650> water<00:03:03.859> pump<00:03:04.070> in<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.370> just<00:03:05.269> because<00:03:05.510> all

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
new water pump in it just because all

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.140

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
this craps out already

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.080 
this craps out already
