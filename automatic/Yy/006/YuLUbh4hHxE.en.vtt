Hello everyone, my name is Saki Shibata.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.006
I'd like to show you how to do an easy braided hairstyle

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.800
Now let's do it!

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.100
I'm going to leave this much hair out

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.900
Take this much and...

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.380
Secure it with this small hair band.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.580
Once you've done that,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.380
Take the end of the ponytail and pull that through the loop you made from the ponytail.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.900
And it went through the loop!

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.620
Now, I'm going to make a plait.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.140
Once you've done this much...

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.740
I'm going to use another small hair tie.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.240
Take your entire hair and tie them up all together.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.780
I'm going to make a loop and pull the tail through it!

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.840
Part this section into two and pull this ponytail through it

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.840
I'm going to make a plait with the rest of the hair.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.600
Plait your hair a few times and secure it with a small hair band.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.880
And there's more to this

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.480
Take the end of the plait...

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.920
I'm going to do another loop thing!

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.540
And, it's done!

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.020
So that's all you have to do to make this braid hairstyle!

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.040
But I'm going to arrange it by adding some accessories.

00:03:18.287 --> 00:03:20.287
I'm sure a lot of girls have one. A gold hairpin!

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.200
Add them on the back of my head

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.160
You see? This ordinarily hairstyle looks a lot cuter with some hairpins!

00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:01.618
And what's more..

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.280
I'm going to put on this square straw hat! It's becoming a new trend!

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.980
And you look like you are ready for summer!

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.160
That's how you make this hairstyle! It looks hard to do but it's not! Try it out and let me know what you think of it!
