and<00:00:13.670> just<00:00:13.940> finally<00:00:14.180> I'll<00:00:14.420> show<00:00:14.630> you<00:00:14.690> how<00:00:14.990> to

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
and just finally I'll show you how to

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
and just finally I'll show you how to
once<00:00:16.730> you've<00:00:16.880> got<00:00:17.000> these<00:00:17.119> agents<00:00:17.510> in<00:00:17.660> the

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
once you've got these agents in the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.010 
once you've got these agents in the
scene<00:00:19.210> it<00:00:20.210> was<00:00:20.300> not<00:00:20.480> like<00:00:20.660> you<00:00:20.689> can<00:00:20.900> actually

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
scene it was not like you can actually

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.740 
scene it was not like you can actually
do<00:00:21.950> with<00:00:22.099> them<00:00:22.220> until<00:00:22.340> you<00:00:22.580> apply<00:00:23.300> some<00:00:23.570> sort

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
do with them until you apply some sort

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.640 
do with them until you apply some sort
of<00:00:23.779> rendering<00:00:24.080> effect<00:00:24.470> to<00:00:25.189> them<00:00:26.529> they<00:00:27.529> don't

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
of rendering effect to them they don't

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.350 
of rendering effect to them they don't
render<00:00:27.980> by<00:00:28.099> themselves<00:00:28.700> and<00:00:28.849> unless<00:00:29.180> you're

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
render by themselves and unless you're

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.240 
render by themselves and unless you're
moving<00:00:29.750> a<00:00:29.900> scene<00:00:30.500> item<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:30.919> don't<00:00:30.950> see

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
moving a scene item you don't see

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.970 
moving a scene item you don't see
anything<00:00:31.460> at<00:00:31.640> all<00:00:32.079> a<00:00:33.079> couple<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.680> ways<00:00:33.800> of

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
anything at all a couple of ways of

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.700 
anything at all a couple of ways of
doing<00:00:34.040> that<00:00:34.660> first<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:35.930> they<00:00:36.140> probably<00:00:36.649> the

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
doing that first and they probably the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.560 
doing that first and they probably the
most<00:00:36.860> common<00:00:37.220> way<00:00:37.399> that<00:00:38.090> you'll<00:00:38.239> interact

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
most common way that you'll interact

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.500 
most common way that you'll interact
with<00:00:38.780> them<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.020> use<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.500> instance<00:00:40.510> the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
with them is to use the instance the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.830 
with them is to use the instance the
flocking<00:00:42.020> system<00:00:42.380> creates<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:43.070> basic<00:00:43.840> light

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
flocking system creates a basic light

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.930 
flocking system creates a basic light
wave<00:00:45.019> particle<00:00:45.350> system<00:00:45.859> and<00:00:46.100> this<00:00:46.579> is<00:00:46.730> how<00:00:46.879> the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
wave particle system and this is how the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.680 
wave particle system and this is how the
instance<00:00:47.390> here<00:00:47.570> interacts<00:00:48.050> with<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:49.420> so<00:00:50.420> if<00:00:50.570> I

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
instance here interacts with it so if I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:59.079 
instance here interacts with it so if I
just<00:00:50.870> load<00:00:51.109> an<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:56.949> so<00:00:57.949> I've<00:00:58.039> loaded<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.429> a<00:00:58.550> fish

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
just load an a so I've loaded in a fish

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:09.470 
just load an a so I've loaded in a fish
object<00:01:00.079> here<00:01:02.769> just<00:01:03.769> shrink<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.129> down<00:01:04.190> a<00:01:04.339> bit

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:18.950 

if<00:01:10.480> we<00:01:10.600> add<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.950> fish<00:01:13.290> local<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.760> particles

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280 

and<00:01:19.960> see<00:01:20.140> there<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:21.330> fish<00:01:22.330> has<00:01:22.960> now<00:01:23.140> been

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
and see there that the fish has now been

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.430 
and see there that the fish has now been
applied<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.620> all<00:01:23.800> of<00:01:24.100> those<00:01:24.190> agents<00:01:28.140> yeah<00:01:29.170> the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
applied to all of those agents yeah the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.860 
applied to all of those agents yeah the
dark<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.830> can't<00:01:30.040> see<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:31.260> yeah<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:34.690> see

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
dark you can't see it yeah so you see

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.980 
dark you can't see it yeah so you see
now<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:36.360> fish<00:01:37.360> has<00:01:37.510> been<00:01:37.630> applied<00:01:37.960> to

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
now that the fish has been applied to

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.860 
now that the fish has been applied to
all<00:01:38.140> those<00:01:38.350> agents<00:01:39.300> we<00:01:40.300> now<00:01:40.420> have<00:01:40.630> something

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
all those agents we now have something

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.530 
all those agents we now have something
in<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.470> scene<00:01:41.710> we<00:01:42.280> can<00:01:42.310> use<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.790> visualize<00:01:42.940> all

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
in the scene we can use to visualize all

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.000 
in the scene we can use to visualize all
those<00:01:43.690> positions<00:01:43.990> with<00:01:46.620> and<00:01:47.620> then<00:01:47.830> we<00:01:47.890> have<00:01:47.979> a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
those positions with and then we have a

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.730 
those positions with and then we have a
fairly<00:01:48.280> nice<00:01:48.520> school<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.360> fish<00:01:49.740> swimming

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
fairly nice school of fish swimming

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.800 
fairly nice school of fish swimming
along<00:01:51.010> that<00:01:51.340> path<00:01:51.640> where<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.330> agents<00:01:52.690> were

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
along that path where the agents were

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.270 
along that path where the agents were
before<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.640> can<00:01:57.790> also<00:01:58.680> say<00:01:59.680> for<00:01:59.710> example

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
before and you can also say for example

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.730 
before and you can also say for example
I'll<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:00.490> turn<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:00.880> off<00:02:01.470> you<00:02:02.470> can<00:02:02.590> also

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
I'll just turn this off you can also

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.850 
I'll just turn this off you can also
apply<00:02:02.890> hyper<00:02:03.520> voxels<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.270> these<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.710> if<00:02:05.770> we

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
apply hyper voxels to these so if we

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.660 
apply hyper voxels to these so if we
just<00:02:06.010> load<00:02:06.160> up<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.369> hyper<00:02:06.520> box<00:02:06.790> or<00:02:06.940> panel<00:02:11.670> say

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
just load up the hyper box or panel say

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.030 
just load up the hyper box or panel say
for<00:02:12.790> example<00:02:13.209> surface<00:02:14.310> HBS

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.240 

and<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:20.939> see<00:02:21.150> there<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.560> super<00:02:22.560> super

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and you can see there the super super

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.360 
and you can see there the super super
surface<00:02:23.879> hyper<00:02:24.360> voxels<00:02:24.900> being<00:02:25.140> rendered<00:02:26.129> on

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
surface hyper voxels being rendered on

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:40.400 
surface hyper voxels being rendered on
top<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:32.400> top<00:02:32.579> of<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.909> agents

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.480 

and<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.650> can<00:02:41.770> produce<00:02:41.920> some<00:02:42.190> fairly

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
and you can produce some fairly

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.740 
and you can produce some fairly
interesting<00:02:43.350> fluid<00:02:44.350> effects<00:02:45.600> because<00:02:46.600> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
interesting fluid effects because the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.170 
interesting fluid effects because the
agents<00:02:47.140> tend<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.440> clump<00:02:47.650> together<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:49.000> as<00:02:49.090> you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
agents tend to clump together so as you

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.960 
agents tend to clump together so as you
can<00:02:49.270> see<00:02:49.330> there<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:51.340> know<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.520> blobs<00:02:51.760> not

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
can see there the you know the blobs not

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.520 
can see there the you know the blobs not
breaking<00:02:52.360> up<00:02:52.450> it's<00:02:52.810> moving<00:02:53.110> quite<00:02:53.260> nicely

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
breaking up it's moving quite nicely

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.750 
breaking up it's moving quite nicely
through<00:02:53.950> space<00:02:54.190> there<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.560> shade<00:02:57.490> it<00:02:57.640> up

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
through space there so you shade it up

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.430 
through space there so you shade it up
like<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.230> yeah

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
like a yeah

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.950 
like a yeah
liquid<00:02:59.770> metal<00:02:59.800> or<00:03:00.160> whatever<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.840> that's

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
liquid metal or whatever so that's

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.330 
liquid metal or whatever so that's
another<00:03:05.230> way<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:05.800> interact<00:03:06.070> with

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
another way that you can interact with

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.670 
another way that you can interact with
them<00:03:06.850> with<00:03:07.420> flocking<00:03:07.840> system<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.290> by<00:03:08.440> using

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
them with flocking system is by using

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.820 
them with flocking system is by using
hyper<00:03:09.220> voxels<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:12.270> hope<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:14.290> quick

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
hyper voxels I hope the this quick

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.390 
hyper voxels I hope the this quick
introduction<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:16.330> flocking<00:03:16.720> system<00:03:17.110> is

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
introduction to the flocking system is
