ten o'clock in the morning which means

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.760 
ten o'clock in the morning which means
all<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.240> clocks<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.750> world<00:01:37.869> would<00:01:38.649> have

to be reset God has done things like

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.449 
to be reset God has done things like
this<00:01:42.220> before<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:43.509> 2<00:01:43.840> Kings<00:01:44.140> 20<00:01:44.619> verse<00:01:44.860> 8<00:01:45.130> God

this before in 2 Kings 20 verse 8 God
made<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.270> Sun<00:01:46.450> go<00:01:46.660> backwards<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.380> then

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
made the Sun go backwards and then

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.339 
made the Sun go backwards and then
forward<00:01:48.340> again<00:01:48.660> which<00:01:49.660> would<00:01:49.869> mean<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.200> the

forward again which would mean that the
Earth's<00:01:50.560> rotation<00:01:51.459> would<00:01:51.910> have<00:01:52.179> rolled<00:01:52.420> back

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
Earth's rotation would have rolled back

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.710 
Earth's rotation would have rolled back
and<00:01:53.050> then<00:01:53.440> forward<00:01:53.770> again<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.569> during<00:01:55.569> the

days of Joshua in Joshua 10 verse 12 God

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.589 
days of Joshua in Joshua 10 verse 12 God
made<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.410> Sun<00:01:59.619> and<00:01:59.920> Moon<00:02:00.190> stand<00:02:00.970> still<00:02:01.300> for<00:02:01.569> a

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
while which means that both the earth

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.749 
while which means that both the earth
and<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:05.050> moon's<00:02:05.349> revolution<00:02:06.130> stopped

judgment God is speaking about a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.009 
judgment God is speaking about a

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
change in the Earth's axis which causes

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.039 
change in the Earth's axis which causes
one<00:02:15.260> third<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.799> day<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.069> be<00:02:16.489> lost<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.180> will

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
one third of the day to be lost and will
