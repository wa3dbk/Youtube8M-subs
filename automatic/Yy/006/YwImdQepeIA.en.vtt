I kind of wanted to see what it would be

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.220 
I kind of wanted to see what it would be
like<00:00:15.000> because<00:00:15.450> I've<00:00:15.690> been<00:00:15.719> hearing<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> lot<00:00:16.109> of

like because I've been hearing a lot of
things<00:00:16.410> about<00:00:16.590> how<00:00:16.800> much<00:00:16.949> quicker<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
things about how much quicker it is and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.429 
things about how much quicker it is and
they<00:00:19.859> were<00:00:19.920> right<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.810> beyond

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
they were right this is like beyond

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.040 
they were right this is like beyond
quick<00:00:22.769> um<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> task<00:00:23.910> if<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.180> think<00:00:24.330> 190

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
quick um this was a task if I think 190

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.230 
quick um this was a task if I think 190
something<00:00:25.410> Dagon<00:00:25.800> off<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.189> figured<00:00:26.970> I'd<00:00:27.029> switch

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
something Dagon off I figured I'd switch

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.759 
something Dagon off I figured I'd switch
it<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.480> considering<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> lighthouse<00:00:28.529> we

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
it up considering the lighthouse we

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.450 
it up considering the lighthouse we
probably<00:00:29.070> pretty<00:00:29.429> busy<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.140> I<00:00:31.140> figured<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.130> try

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
probably pretty busy and I figured a try

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.670 
probably pretty busy and I figured a try
the<00:00:32.520> water<00:00:32.940> birth<00:00:33.149> island<00:00:33.600> because<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.380> as

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the water birth island because I know as

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.350 
the water birth island because I know as
soon<00:00:34.800> as<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.980> walk<00:00:35.520> into<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> entrance<00:00:36.149> here

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
soon as you walk into the entrance here

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.330 
soon as you walk into the entrance here
there's<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.469> ton<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.680> Dagon<00:00:38.010> off<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
there's like a ton of Dagon off and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.740 
there's like a ton of Dagon off and
they're<00:00:38.460> normally<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> higher<00:00:39.000> levels<00:00:39.390> which

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
they're normally the higher levels which

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.150 
they're normally the higher levels which
they<00:00:39.930> were<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.079> think<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.440> were<00:00:40.500> level<00:00:40.770> 1-12

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
they were I think they were level 1-12

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.360 
they were I think they were level 1-12
each<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:42.620> it's<00:00:43.620> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> ape<00:00:44.219> atoll

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
each and it's kind of like the ape atoll

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100 
each and it's kind of like the ape atoll
skeleton<00:00:44.969> monkeys<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.750> kill<00:00:45.960> them

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
skeleton monkeys like as you kill them

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600 
skeleton monkeys like as you kill them
more<00:00:46.350> kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.739> appeared<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.309> he<00:00:47.399> gets<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
more kind of just appeared so he gets to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.680 
more kind of just appeared so he gets to
the<00:00:47.760> point<00:00:47.910> where<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.149> there's<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> ton<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the point where like there's a ton of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
the point where like there's a ton of
them<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.190> use<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> cannon

name of it because this is a new one but

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
name of it because this is a new one but
if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> use<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.469> ancients<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.489> cannon

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
if you use that on ancients and a cannon

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.219 
if you use that on ancients and a cannon
you<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.300> tear<00:01:03.629> right<00:01:03.780> through<00:01:03.840> them<00:01:04.140> i<00:01:04.199> think

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
i went through this task in like 11

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
i went through this task in like 11
minutes<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:07.229> even<00:01:07.740> 12<00:01:08.130> minutes<00:01:08.460> something

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
minutes or even 12 minutes something

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.039 
minutes or even 12 minutes something
like<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.180> i<00:01:09.240> wasn't<00:01:09.479> paying<00:01:09.600> completely

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
like that but i wasn't paying completely

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.260 
like that but i wasn't paying completely
fully<00:01:10.260> attention<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.830> whole<00:01:10.920> time<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
fully attention the whole time and the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.789 
fully attention the whole time and the
cannon<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.659> needed<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> top<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.650> there

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
cannon I needed to top up here and there

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.590 
cannon I needed to top up here and there
and<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.490> wasn't<00:01:14.729> paying<00:01:14.820> attention<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.450> but

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
and I wasn't paying attention to it but

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.140 
and I wasn't paying attention to it but
anyways<00:01:15.869> uh<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.500> was<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.220> using<00:01:17.490> soulsplit<00:01:17.909> in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
anyways uh I was just using soulsplit in

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.170 
anyways uh I was just using soulsplit in
this<00:01:18.270> video<00:01:18.650> my<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.310> whatever<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.060> want

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
this video my or or or whatever you want

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.760 
this video my or or or whatever you want
to<00:01:21.240> call<00:01:21.330> them<00:01:21.390> were<00:01:21.689> depleted<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> time

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to call them were depleted at the time

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
to call them were depleted at the time
so<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.729> strictly<00:01:24.060> soulsplit<00:01:24.600> with

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
so this is just strictly soulsplit with

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
so this is just strictly soulsplit with
a<00:01:24.900> prayer<00:01:25.170> renewal<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.710> prayer<00:01:26.070> pots<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.640> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
a prayer renewal and prayer pots and I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
a prayer renewal and prayer pots and I
think<00:01:27.450> only<00:01:27.600> went<00:01:27.810> through<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.110> prayer<00:01:28.590> flask

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
think only went through one prayer flask

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
think only went through one prayer flask
and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.640> two<00:01:29.970> doses<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> prayer<00:01:30.869> renewal

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and I think two doses a prayer renewal

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.249 
and I think two doses a prayer renewal
and<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.180> tore<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.720> see<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> XP

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and this just tore you can see the XP

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
and this just tore you can see the XP
drops<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.710> over<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> place<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.460> keep<00:01:35.880> in

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
drops all over the place and keep in

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.499 
drops all over the place and keep in
mind<00:01:36.240> i<00:01:36.860> got<00:01:37.860> 200<00:01:38.070> mil<00:01:38.369> range<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:39.030> couple<00:01:39.299> weeks

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
mind i got 200 mil range a couple weeks

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.569 
mind i got 200 mil range a couple weeks
ago<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.140> i'm<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.530> getting<00:01:40.740> range<00:01:40.920> XP<00:01:41.280> anymore

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
ago so i'm not getting range XP anymore

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.940 
ago so i'm not getting range XP anymore
so<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.390> range<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.110> XP<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.560> general<00:01:43.860> will

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
so the range or the XP in general will

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.929 
so the range or the XP in general will
be<00:01:43.979> much<00:01:44.280> higher<00:01:44.460> than<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.850> actually

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
be much higher than what is actually

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.230 
be much higher than what is actually
showing<00:01:45.299> here<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:47.009> magic<00:01:47.340> drops<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
showing here and the magic drops like I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600 
showing here and the magic drops like I
saw<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> couple<00:01:48.659> drops<00:01:48.930> i<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.380> 1.8<00:01:49.920> k<00:01:50.130> XP<00:01:50.579> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
saw a couple drops i think 1.8 k XP a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.850 
saw a couple drops i think 1.8 k XP a
couple<00:01:51.030> times<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:52.229> average<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.619> getting

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
couple times and on average you getting

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.249 
couple times and on average you getting
700<00:01:53.369> XP<00:01:53.640> drops<00:01:53.880> every<00:01:54.329> couple<00:01:54.540> seconds<00:01:54.990> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
700 XP drops every couple seconds so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.060 
700 XP drops every couple seconds so
it's<00:01:56.040> extremely<00:01:56.250> fast<00:01:56.729> um<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:58.110> think<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.979> is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
it's extremely fast um I think this is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's extremely fast um I think this is
probably<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> best<00:01:59.549> area<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> kill<00:02:00.149> diagnosis

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
probably the best area to kill diagnosis

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.389 
probably the best area to kill diagnosis
unless<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.350> try<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> chaos

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
unless you want to go try the chaos

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.670 
unless you want to go try the chaos
tunnels<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:02.939> those<00:02:03.090> ones<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:04.530> don't

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
tunnels with those ones but you don't

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.130 
tunnels with those ones but you don't
really<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:07.110> won't

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
really have a can in there so you won't

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.930 
really have a can in there so you won't
be<00:02:07.409> able<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.710> kill<00:02:08.099> them<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.310> quickly<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
be able to kill them as quickly you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.669 
be able to kill them as quickly you
could<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.270> steel<00:02:09.509> Titans<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.170> didn't<00:02:10.560> really

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
could do steel Titans I didn't really

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.350 
could do steel Titans I didn't really
bring<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.009> steel<00:02:11.190> time<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.580> me<00:02:11.849> on<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.120> task

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
bring a steel time with me on this task

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.160 
bring a steel time with me on this task
just<00:02:12.720> because

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
just because

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.559 
just because
I<00:02:13.459> wanted<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.520> kind<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.760> see<00:02:14.940> how<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.240> would

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
I wanted to kind of see how this would

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.150 
I wanted to kind of see how this would
kind<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.959> plan<00:02:16.170> out<00:02:16.319> first<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.770> how<00:02:16.890> well<00:02:17.069> it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
kind of plan out first and how well it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.250 
kind of plan out first and how well it
would<00:02:17.220> work<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:18.209> did<00:02:18.480> pretty<00:02:18.660> well<00:02:18.750> when<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
would work and it did pretty well when I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.750 
would work and it did pretty well when I
do<00:02:19.349> get<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.800> next<00:02:20.010> task<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.430> will<00:02:20.489> bring<00:02:20.670> a

do get in the next task I will bring a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.880 
do get in the next task I will bring a
steel<00:02:20.940> Titan<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.390> I'm<00:02:22.380> sure<00:02:22.560> I'll<00:02:22.680> get<00:02:22.800> it
