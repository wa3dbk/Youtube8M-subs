you are those other gathering
professions<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:44.600> for<00:00:45.600> example<00:00:46.700> i'm<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
professions so for example i'm going to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.080 
professions so for example i'm going to
take<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.510> girl<00:00:49.110> crater<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.820> where<00:00:50.969> i've

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
take on girl crater which is where i've

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
take on girl crater which is where i've
been<00:00:51.120> spending<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.809> my<00:00:52.020> time<00:00:52.050> lately<00:00:57.890> if

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
been spending a lot of my time lately if

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.189 
been spending a lot of my time lately if
you<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.699> goro<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> giant<00:01:00.989> circle

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you look on goro is a giant circle

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.479 
you look on goro is a giant circle
that's<00:01:01.469> what<00:01:01.649> makes<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.949> such<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.129> great

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that's what makes it such a great

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.649 
that's what makes it such a great
example<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.239> how<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:04.019> about<00:01:05.210> gold<00:01:06.210> farming

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
example of how you go about gold farming

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
example of how you go about gold farming
in<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.930> area<00:01:07.580> essentially<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.820> want

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
in this area essentially what you want

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.830 
in this area essentially what you want
to<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.540> set<00:01:09.750> together<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.530> lap<00:01:11.340> system<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to do is set together a lap system you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.450 
to do is set together a lap system you
literally<00:01:13.140> make<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> track<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.220> normally

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
literally make a track that you normally

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
literally make a track that you normally
make<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.479> where<00:01:15.780> your<00:01:15.960> resources

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
make that you know where your resources

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.580 
make that you know where your resources
actually<00:01:17.130> spawn<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> fuel<00:01:19.320> for

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
actually spawn and you get a fuel for

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.120 
actually spawn and you get a fuel for
the<00:01:19.680> area<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.490> use<00:01:20.700> modifications<00:01:21.299> like

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
the area you can use modifications like

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.609 
the area you can use modifications like
gatherer<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.939> show<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:25.229> where<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
gatherer to show you actually where the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
gatherer to show you actually where the
veins<00:01:25.890> are<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> case<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.909> mining<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.570> where

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
veins are in the case of mining or where

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.149 
veins are in the case of mining or where
the<00:01:27.990> herbs<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> case<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> herbalism

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
the herbs are in the case of herbalism

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
the herbs are in the case of herbalism
but<00:01:32.159> basically<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.329> get<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> few<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:33.960> feel

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
but basically you can get a few for feel

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
but basically you can get a few for feel
for<00:01:34.590> even<00:01:34.860> without<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.150> lap<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.479> i

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
for even without that on the lap that i

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.359 
for even without that on the lap that i
tend<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> do<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.560> comes<00:01:37.799> down<00:01:38.009> around

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
tend to do actually comes down around

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.700 
tend to do actually comes down around
here<00:01:38.820> drops<00:01:39.659> down<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> vein

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
here drops down because there is a vein

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.700 
here drops down because there is a vein
that<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.950> comes<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.640> comes<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
that it comes right here comes down to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.460 
that it comes right here comes down to
right<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.159> cuts<00:01:44.939> down<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> bunch<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
right about here cuts down to a bunch of

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.370 
right about here cuts down to a bunch of
veins<00:01:47.189> right<00:01:47.579> down<00:01:47.820> here<00:01:48.119> avoid<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.110> area

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
veins right down here avoid this area

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.800 
veins right down here avoid this area
because<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.770> Raptors<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.280> very<00:01:51.240> plentiful

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
because the Raptors are very plentiful

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
because the Raptors are very plentiful
and<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.200> too<00:01:52.259> high<00:01:52.500> level<00:01:52.829> especially<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and way too high level especially in the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.190 
and way too high level especially in the
slithering<00:01:54.090> scar<00:01:54.390> where<00:01:54.630> that's<00:01:54.780> actually

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
slithering scar where that's actually

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.069 
slithering scar where that's actually
the<00:01:56.420> psyllid<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:57.600> whatever<00:01:57.840> they're<00:01:58.049> called

the freaking insects that are annoying

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.910 
the freaking insects that are annoying
that's<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.899> horrible<00:02:01.110> area<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.740> area

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
that's a horrible area but this area

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
that's a horrible area but this area
right<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.250> actually<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.820> lot<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.210> rich

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.410 
right here actually is a lot of rich
thorium<00:02:03.810> veins<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.380> come<00:02:04.979> down<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.610> come<00:02:05.939> back<00:02:06.149> up

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
thorium veins I come down I come back up

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.680 
thorium veins I come down I come back up
and<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.469> lap<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.239> keep<00:02:09.390> doing

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
and I make that lap I just keep doing

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.720 
and I make that lap I just keep doing
that<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.259> was<00:02:10.440> leveling<00:02:10.890> I'd<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.520> class

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that if I was leveling I'd get to class

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.320 
that if I was leveling I'd get to class
under<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> classes<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.870> wanted

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
under the classes I wanted

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.640 
under the classes I wanted
through<00:02:13.480> their<00:02:13.630> extra<00:02:13.900> are<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.080> lot<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.260> quests

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
through their extra are a lot of quests

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.500 
through their extra are a lot of quests
area<00:02:14.980> for<00:02:15.130> just<00:02:15.250> killing<00:02:15.580> random<00:02:15.940> mobs<00:02:16.150> which

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
area for just killing random mobs which

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.270 
area for just killing random mobs which
is<00:02:16.660> good<00:02:16.840> because<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.200> make<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> circle<00:02:18.070> through

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
is good because I make a circle through

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.670 
is good because I make a circle through
the<00:02:18.400> entire<00:02:18.700> area<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.900> actually<00:02:20.200> would<00:02:20.500> get

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
the entire area so I actually would get

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.380 
the entire area so I actually would get
a<00:02:20.710> lot<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:20.890> experience<00:02:21.700> for<00:02:21.970> distilling<00:02:22.240> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
a lot of experience for distilling the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.190 
a lot of experience for distilling the
mobs<00:02:22.570> as<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.900> went<00:02:24.360> also<00:02:25.360> this<00:02:25.690> area<00:02:25.990> has<00:02:26.170> a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
mobs as I went also this area has a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.200 
mobs as I went also this area has a
repeatable<00:02:26.830> quest<00:02:27.160> for<00:02:27.460> power<00:02:27.580> crystals<00:02:28.150> that

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
repeatable quest for power crystals that

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.900 
repeatable quest for power crystals that
you<00:02:28.450> can<00:02:28.600> actually<00:02:28.780> get<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:30.280> gives<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.580> cool

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
you can actually get it gives you cool

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
little items like crystal force which

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.540 
little items like crystal force which
increases<00:02:34.240> your<00:02:34.330> spirit<00:02:34.780> by<00:02:35.230> 30<00:02:35.800> for<00:02:36.370> 30

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
few different ones like that but those

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.080 
few different ones like that but those
are<00:02:59.890> just<00:02:59.980> three<00:03:00.160> examples<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.940> that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
are just three examples of that

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.199 
are just three examples of that
repeatable<00:03:01.540> quest<00:03:02.490> so<00:03:03.490> you<00:03:03.550> can<00:03:03.790> gather<00:03:03.940> the

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
repeatable quest so you can gather the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.820 
repeatable quest so you can gather the
power<00:03:04.390> crystals<00:03:04.810> as<00:03:04.900> well<00:03:05.080> as<00:03:05.230> gathering<00:03:05.410> the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
power crystals as well as gathering the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.770 
power crystals as well as gathering the
veins<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.430> whatnot<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.570> really

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
veins and whatnot and that really

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.360 
veins and whatnot and that really
develops<00:03:08.790> what<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.940> can<00:03:10.150> do<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:12.130> gives<00:03:12.280> you

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
develops what you can do it gives you

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.920 
develops what you can do it gives you
kind<00:03:12.490> of<00:03:12.580> an<00:03:12.700> idea<00:03:12.760> they're<00:03:13.120> also<00:03:13.270> as<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.570> few

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
kind of an idea they're also as a few

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.960 
kind of an idea they're also as a few
different<00:03:14.230> areas<00:03:14.530> this<00:03:14.770> is<00:03:14.950> good<00:03:15.160> i<00:03:15.490> would<00:03:15.700> say

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
different areas this is good i would say

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.640 
different areas this is good i would say
for<00:03:16.510> high<00:03:16.750> 40s<00:03:17.380> /<00:03:17.800> mid<00:03:18.220> 50s<00:03:18.959> if<00:03:19.959> we<00:03:20.230> want<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.530> go

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
for high 40s / mid 50s if we want to go

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.740 
for high 40s / mid 50s if we want to go
a<00:03:20.680> little<00:03:20.920> lower<00:03:21.190> if<00:03:21.519> you're<00:03:22.300> looking<00:03:22.540> for

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
a little lower if you're looking for

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.900 
a little lower if you're looking for
something<00:03:23.080> even<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.440> little<00:03:23.560> easier<00:03:24.100> we<00:03:24.640> head

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
something even a little easier we head

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.120 
something even a little easier we head
over<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.540> Eastern<00:03:25.900> Kingdoms<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:28.769> write<00:03:29.769> at

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
to do that but I usually avoid it

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.100 
to do that but I usually avoid it
because<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.500> there's<00:03:59.920> enough<00:04:00.600> mining<00:04:01.600> veins<00:04:01.870> on

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
another rare elite in this area in the

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.850 
another rare elite in this area in the
caves<00:05:24.460> with<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.790> ogres<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:25.300> he<00:05:25.750> drops<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.260> mace

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
caves with the ogres and he drops a mace

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.440 
caves with the ogres and he drops a mace
called<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.250> pacifier<00:05:27.730> which<00:05:27.970> can<00:05:28.210> sell<00:05:28.420> for

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
called the pacifier which can sell for

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.600 
called the pacifier which can sell for
30<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:28.960> 40<00:05:29.350> gold<00:05:29.560> if<00:05:29.710> you<00:05:29.800> need<00:05:29.950> it<00:05:30.070> to<00:05:30.160> drop<00:05:30.400> but

30 to 40 gold if you need it to drop but

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.180 
30 to 40 gold if you need it to drop but

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.190 
I think he only spawns probably weekly
and<00:05:33.400> he's<00:05:33.910> farmed<00:05:34.330> pretty<00:05:34.630> average<00:05:34.870> Lee

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
because pretty normally because of him

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.480 
because pretty normally because of him
having<00:05:37.480> that<00:05:37.840> maze<00:05:38.110> but<00:05:38.830> just<00:05:39.070> making<00:05:39.250> that

as well so there's an idea for you this

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.600 
as well so there's an idea for you this
is<00:05:54.400> good<00:05:54.610> for<00:05:55.030> probably<00:05:57.120> mid<00:05:58.120> 30s<00:05:58.540> to<00:05:58.780> mid<00:05:58.810> 40s

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
is good for probably mid 30s to mid 40s

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.490 
is good for probably mid 30s to mid 40s
going<00:06:00.610> even<00:06:00.850> lower<00:06:01.120> this<00:06:01.600> is<00:06:01.750> where<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:01.990> started

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
going even lower this is where I started

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.320 
going even lower this is where I started
out<00:06:02.650> making<00:06:02.890> laps<00:06:03.400> is<00:06:03.700> where<00:06:03.940> I<00:06:04.000> got<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.300> idea

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
out making laps is where I got the idea

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.750 
out making laps is where I got the idea
of<00:06:04.780> just<00:06:04.810> that's<00:06:05.590> what<00:06:05.830> I<00:06:05.860> did<00:06:06.160> usually<00:06:06.640> i'm

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
of just that's what I did usually i'm

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.520 
of just that's what I did usually i'm
waiting<00:06:07.060> for<00:06:07.090> pvp<00:06:07.720> to<00:06:07.840> pop<00:06:08.020> which<00:06:08.230> i<00:06:08.350> have

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
waiting for pvp to pop which i have

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.490 
waiting for pvp to pop which i have
probably<00:06:08.950> an<00:06:09.070> hour<00:06:09.250> before<00:06:09.700> it<00:06:09.790> will<00:06:09.970> so<00:06:10.750> this

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
probably an hour before it will so this

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.710 
probably an hour before it will so this
is<00:06:11.530> good<00:06:11.830> for<00:06:12.160> that<00:06:12.310> you<00:06:12.580> know<00:06:12.940> get<00:06:13.450> into<00:06:13.600> the

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
is good for that you know get into the

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.000 
is good for that you know get into the
queue<00:06:13.930> and<00:06:14.080> then<00:06:14.200> you<00:06:14.290> go<00:06:14.410> to<00:06:14.470> the<00:06:14.620> place<00:06:14.800> where

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
queue and then you go to the place where

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.440 
queue and then you go to the place where
you<00:06:15.190> want<00:06:15.400> to<00:06:15.490> do<00:06:15.550> the<00:06:15.670> laps<00:06:15.880> and<00:06:16.150> just<00:06:16.300> keep

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
so that makes a good idea that makes a

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.970 
so that makes a good idea that makes a
good<00:06:27.490> plan<00:06:27.880> for<00:06:28.270> for<00:06:28.630> farming<00:06:28.990> gold<00:06:29.170> the<00:06:29.860> other

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
good plan for for farming gold the other

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.230 
good plan for for farming gold the other
