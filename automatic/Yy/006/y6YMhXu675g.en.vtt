00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 but 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.040
 how heavy ships float on all 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.779
 items in the water 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.259
 except gravity act 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.230
 buoyancy force which was named 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.710
 archimedean powers in honor of ancient greek 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.670
 scientist archimedes once bathe you this 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.470
 the scientist made a discovery on every body 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.930
 immersed in liquid 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.580
 ejecting force 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.090
 upward and equal to weight 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.940
 the fluid it displaces if 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.870
 buoyancy less gravity 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.140
 then the body sinks if gravity and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.390
 buoyancy force equal body floats 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 to understand how this law works 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.510
 let's do a little experiment 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.830
 take a clear plastic cup 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.010
 a piece of plasticine and a marker at the beginning 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.400
 mark the marker on the outside 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.530
 cup initial water level 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.530
 then we make a ball of plasticine 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.370
 and put it in the water we see that the ball 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.100
 immediately drowned and unsurprisingly 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:39.310
 clay density is greater than density 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:43.710
 water mark a new water level now 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.710
 get the same piece of clay 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.800
 and blind him from the boat 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.740
 we put it in the water carefully 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.820
 cheers our boat is swimming 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.630
 note the new water level we see that 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.630
 new water level above previous 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.790
 it means the boat has displaced more water than 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.020
 the ball is molded from the same piece 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:16.180
 plasticine plasticine weight has not changed in 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.520
 first and second case on clay 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.130
 the same gravity acts 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.819
 why in the second case plasticine 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.980
 swims 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.969
 giving the clay a boat shape 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.510
 we changed its overall density now 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:36.450
 the volume of the submerged water is occupied 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.819
 almost the same air and we know 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.310
 that the air density is much less 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.650
 water density in this way 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.459
 total density of plasticine boat 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.260
 turns out to be less water density 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.799
 the boat displaced much more water 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.780
 than the ball and the more fluid 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.680
 being forced out the more pushing 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.109
 power case with a boat 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.530
 buoyancy force was equal to force 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.530
 gravity acting on the boat therefore 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.290
 the boat is swimming 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.800
 nowadays ships are made of steel 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.200
 which is 8 times denser than water but they are not 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.930
 sink because their overall density 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.910
 less water density also like 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.520
 rubber duckling fill inside 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.940
 air ship also has cavities 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.640
 filled with air so its weight 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.860
 distributed over a large space 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.700
 which leads to a small common 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.560
 density 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.790
 the ship has an important characteristic 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.700
 displacement 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.660
 It displaces more water than the ship 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.570
 more its displacement 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.260
 and the more heavy load he is able 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.260
 carry
