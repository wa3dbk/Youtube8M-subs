really<00:02:06.180> bullsh<00:02:06.360> about<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> think

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
really bullsh about this and I think

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.830 
really bullsh about this and I think
it's<00:02:07.170> actually<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
it's actually a

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.800 
it's actually a
is<00:02:09.170> they<00:02:09.679> will<00:02:09.830> spawn<00:02:10.099> runts<00:02:10.690> which<00:02:11.690> are

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
is they will spawn runts which are

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.600 
is they will spawn runts which are
pretty<00:02:11.930> much<00:02:12.019> tiny<00:02:12.349> ones<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.800> but<00:02:13.550> I

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
pretty much tiny ones of that but I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.300 
pretty much tiny ones of that but I
think<00:02:13.640> he<00:02:13.970> he<00:02:14.750> fucked<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.530> skin<00:02:15.800> because
