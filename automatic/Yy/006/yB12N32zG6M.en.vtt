00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
schoolhouse road we don't need to know

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.170 
schoolhouse road we don't need to know
the<00:00:28.529> town<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.250> yeah<00:00:29.490> typical<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.179> tire

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
the town to the yeah typical a tire

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
with story Oh Zach doesn't cut me out so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.250

I<00:01:05.970> don't<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> guys<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.780> noticed<00:01:07.140> for

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
I don't know if you guys all noticed for

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.890 
I don't know if you guys all noticed for
exactly<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> intentional<00:01:08.340> squeak<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.689> if

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
exactly the intentional squeak so if

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.380 
exactly the intentional squeak so if
that<00:01:10.110> was<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.619> falsetto<00:01:11.250> screams<00:01:11.820> weren't

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that was a like falsetto screams weren't

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
that was a like falsetto screams weren't
a<00:01:12.479> technical<00:01:13.080> -<00:01:13.409> two<00:01:13.650> days<00:01:13.799> ago<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:15.330> in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
a technical - two days ago I was in

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.260 
a technical - two days ago I was in
physics<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.080> our<00:01:16.890> subs<00:01:17.130> dude<00:01:17.310> no<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.820> wants

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
physics and our subs dude no one wants

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.340 
physics and our subs dude no one wants
to<00:01:18.299> hear<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.439> story

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
somewhere between 25 and probably 30

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.289 
somewhere between 25 and probably 30
years<00:01:32.479> old<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:32.930> he's<00:01:33.770> gone<00:01:34.070> his<00:01:34.909> name<00:01:35.119> you

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
years old and he's gone his name you

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
that's so he's giving us directions and

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.279 
that's so he's giving us directions and
for<00:01:50.090> physics<00:01:50.450> which<00:01:50.659> he<00:01:50.929> doesn't<00:01:51.140> know<00:01:51.200> how<00:01:51.259> to

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
for physics which he doesn't know how to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.700 
for physics which he doesn't know how to
do<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:52.130> don't<00:01:52.220> want<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.549> do<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.710> he
