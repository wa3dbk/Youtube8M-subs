00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello today i'm with julien 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.599
 coach photos of all my coaches point 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.509
 com then is he all the time 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.460
 necessary to use a flash julien is going 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.750
 show you when to use it 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:23.039
 let's bring up a point the flash on your 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.769
 compact bridge or SLR entry of 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.710
 range you have a built-in flash 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.900
 let's take an example you are in the evening 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.809
 in a room it is quite dark 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.290
 legends years wanted to photograph this 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 scene you are forced to use a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.670
 flash otherwise the photo will be crazy on 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 problem you integrated flash equivalents 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.059
 you restore an image that will not be 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.230
 necessarily very idyllic he will send 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:01.530
 his flash on the first topic of your 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 photo this topic will be overexposed it will be 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.799
 all white the background will be very 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.840
 dark 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.390
 the built-in flash has trouble managing the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 different depths of field he's going 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.840
 make you very white certain areas 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.610
 and others it will not be good enough 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.740
 illuminated the ideal of course is to use 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.790
 a deported flash what you can 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.450
 see here using a deported flash 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.750
 he will eliminate problems two eyes 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.640
 red 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.049
 let's take another example you are at the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.470
 beach you want to photograph a 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.079
 portrait there will be a lot of light 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.049
 the portrait of one side will be well lit 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.619
 by the sun and on the other will be very 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.460
 are good rails names which very marked and 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.009
 that's pretty unsightly on results 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.899
 to remove this effect there use 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.250
 so a flash for the image to become 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.070
 a little more homogeneous 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.380
 she will still keep the areas 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.680
 dark and clear areas and is going 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.179
 eliminate this very big contrast we 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.150
 are going to evoke a little point a little 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.690
 more expert is the use of 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.780
 multiple streams 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:21.210
 h on my gimmi flash box that I 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.980
 am going to call m who will give some 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.950
 news 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.310
 a flash that will be called slaves who 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.310
 is right next 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.280
 being able to use different 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.740
 flash I had allow to manage like 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.840
 in photo studio for example for the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.480
 shooting a different object 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.370
 points of light to create shadows 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.630
 to create a point of light some 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.860
 share to value energize your 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:56.670
 shooting for that you need 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.890
 still semi material 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.050
 professional or professional who you 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.350
 will use this function 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.390
 of slaves and m little used so 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:12.030
 multiple flashes and adjust each flash 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.750
 one after the other to be restored 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.660
 a lot of light is little light 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.130
 depending on where the head of the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.520
 flash is oriented to either the object 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.860
 directional or is a directional 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.770
 on supports reflecting the 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.150
 ceiling or on a plate 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.330
 reflective that you buy in 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.200
 store or that you tinker yourself 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.430
 with aluminum foil 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.310
 you will see that to manage the light will be 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.410
 product in bottle a portrait in a 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.930
 piece will reveal a picture with a big 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.160
 hide in conclusion here is a small 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.160
 example a housing a flash 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.580
 m next to a slave flash 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.190
 I'm going to take the photo the flashes are going 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.030
 enlighten the subject for a good result 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.030
 here
