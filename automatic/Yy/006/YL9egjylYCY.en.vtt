another<00:00:18.730> video<00:00:19.030> I<00:00:19.330> did<00:00:19.570> something<00:00:19.960> on<00:00:20.110> how<00:00:20.320> you

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
another video I did something on how you

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.410 
another video I did something on how you
can<00:00:20.650> kind<00:00:20.860> of<00:00:20.980> clone<00:00:21.250> an<00:00:21.520> object<00:00:22.000> and<00:00:22.150> make<00:00:22.270> it

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
can kind of clone an object and make it

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.030 
can kind of clone an object and make it
so<00:00:22.540> that<00:00:22.570> you<00:00:22.810> don't<00:00:23.050> have<00:00:23.230> to<00:00:23.410> pull<00:00:23.680> it<00:00:23.860> out

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
so that you don't have to pull it out

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.710 
so that you don't have to pull it out
well<00:00:24.550> you<00:00:24.730> can<00:00:24.880> just<00:00:25.029> pull<00:00:25.210> it<00:00:25.300> out<00:00:25.420> of<00:00:25.599> the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
well you can just pull it out of the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.390 
well you can just pull it out of the
copied<00:00:26.140> object<00:00:26.260> and<00:00:26.680> not<00:00:26.740> really<00:00:27.040> have<00:00:27.189> to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
copied object and not really have to

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.210 
copied object and not really have to
rework<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.210> whole<00:00:28.329> model<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:29.020> this<00:00:30.009> is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
rework the whole model and this is

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.620 
rework the whole model and this is
something<00:00:30.730> else<00:00:31.000> for<00:00:31.150> more<00:00:31.300> complicated

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
something else for more complicated

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.930 
something else for more complicated
model<00:00:32.200> obviously<00:00:32.349> here<00:00:32.980> is<00:00:33.220> sort<00:00:33.730> of<00:00:33.790> an

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
model obviously here is sort of an

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.729 
model obviously here is sort of an
Android<00:00:34.360> robot<00:00:34.750> thing<00:00:34.930> I've<00:00:35.079> been<00:00:35.110> working

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
Android robot thing I've been working

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.940 
Android robot thing I've been working
issue<00:00:36.220> on<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.230> best<00:00:38.410> model<00:00:38.770> in<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.890> world

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
issue on not the best model in the world

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.680 
issue on not the best model in the world
this<00:00:39.250> is<00:00:39.340> a<00:00:39.460> really<00:00:39.700> rougher<00:00:40.090> version<00:00:40.450> of<00:00:40.570> it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
this is a really rougher version of it

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.110 
this is a really rougher version of it
it's<00:00:40.810> it's<00:00:41.110> gone<00:00:41.770> a<00:00:41.800> lot<00:00:42.100> farther<00:00:42.399> since<00:00:42.880> then

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
it's it's gone a lot farther since then

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.590 
it's it's gone a lot farther since then
but<00:00:43.949> just<00:00:44.949> for<00:00:45.309> now<00:00:45.340> I<00:00:45.460> thought<00:00:45.760> I<00:00:46.030> would<00:00:46.329> go

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
but just for now I thought I would go

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.709 
but just for now I thought I would go
through<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:47.199> show<00:00:47.230> you<00:00:47.680> really<00:00:47.949> quick<00:00:48.280> how<00:00:48.309> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
through and show you really quick how to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.900 
through and show you really quick how to
use<00:00:49.719> the<00:00:49.960> clone<00:00:50.140> tool<00:00:50.199> and<00:00:50.890> still<00:00:51.219> not<00:00:51.399> have<00:00:51.460> to

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
use the clone tool and still not have to

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.020 
use the clone tool and still not have to
do<00:00:52.059> it<00:00:52.210> like<00:00:52.420> one<00:00:52.750> item<00:00:53.289> at<00:00:53.379> a<00:00:53.410> time<00:00:53.469> or<00:00:54.010> say<00:00:54.250> you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
do it like one item at a time or say you

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.750 
do it like one item at a time or say you
know<00:00:55.149> if<00:00:55.300> I<00:00:55.449> clone<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:56.320> breast<00:00:56.859> area<00:00:57.250> here

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
know if I clone this breast area here

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.000 
know if I clone this breast area here
it's<00:00:58.000> not<00:00:58.179> gonna<00:00:58.359> you<00:00:58.870> know<00:00:59.289> probably<00:00:59.649> go<00:00:59.980> over

dots along the edge here all the
vertices<00:01:36.910> I'm<00:01:37.720> gonna<00:01:37.960> go<00:01:38.110> up<00:01:38.320> here<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.890> where

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
vertices I'm gonna go up here to where

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.570 
vertices I'm gonna go up here to where
it<00:01:39.220> says<00:01:39.340> X<00:01:39.760> put<00:01:40.510> it<00:01:40.660> at<00:01:40.780> zero<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.920> now<00:01:42.310> I've

it says X put it at zero and now I've

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.500 
it says X put it at zero and now I've
got<00:01:42.820> a<00:01:42.850> nice<00:01:43.300> neat<00:01:43.600> line<00:01:43.870> so<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.380> I<00:01:44.680> can<00:01:45.510> copy

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
got a nice neat line so that I can copy

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.810 
got a nice neat line so that I can copy
and<00:01:46.870> duplicate<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.560> then<00:01:47.590> cut<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.310> over<00:01:48.610> and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
and duplicate and then cut it over and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.310 
and duplicate and then cut it over and
then<00:01:48.940> slide<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:49.480> over<00:01:49.600> there<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:49.960> it'll<00:01:50.050> fit

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
then slide it over there and it'll fit

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.080 
then slide it over there and it'll fit
very<00:01:50.680> nicely<00:01:50.860> um<00:01:52.050> then<00:01:53.050> what<00:01:53.560> I'm<00:01:53.650> gonna<00:01:53.890> do<00:01:54.160> is
