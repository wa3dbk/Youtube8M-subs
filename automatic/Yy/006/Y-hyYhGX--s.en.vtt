the<00:00:39.090> best<00:00:39.239> tennis<00:00:39.510> players<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> world<00:00:40.110> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.760 

I<00:00:46.790> don't<00:00:47.420> think<00:00:47.510> good<00:00:47.810> things<00:00:47.990> happen<00:00:48.380> by

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770

accident<00:00:48.800> there<00:00:49.760> certainly<00:00:49.910> was<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.240> lot<00:00:50.420> of

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
accident there certainly was a lot of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.000 
accident there certainly was a lot of
work<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:50.810> definitely<00:00:51.140> treated<00:00:51.590> more<00:00:51.740> like<00:00:51.950> a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
work I definitely treated more like a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.680 
work I definitely treated more like a
like<00:00:52.430> a<00:00:52.460> profession<00:00:53.030> now<00:00:53.120> as<00:00:53.270> far<00:00:53.420> as<00:00:53.480> being

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
like a profession now as far as being

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.180 
like a profession now as far as being
prepared<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.290> doing<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.620> right<00:00:54.740> things<00:00:54.980> and

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
prepared and doing the right things and

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.270 
prepared and doing the right things and
even<00:00:55.780> nutrition<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:56.870> all<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:57.320> back

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
even nutrition and all that and back

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.500 
even nutrition and all that and back
then<00:00:58.490> I<00:00:58.520> wasn't<00:00:58.790> that<00:00:59.060> wasn't<00:00:59.240> really<00:00:59.420> the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
then I wasn't that wasn't really the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.180 
then I wasn't that wasn't really the
case<00:00:59.750> I<00:01:00.020> almost<00:01:00.230> missed<00:01:00.560> that<00:01:00.740> simplistic

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.310 
make adjustments and adjust to the way
the<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.470> game<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.620> going<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:14.600> way<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:14.750> serve<00:03:15.110> is

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
the the game is going the way I serve is

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.630 
the the game is going the way I serve is
not<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.650> way<00:03:15.770> you<00:03:15.830> would<00:03:16.070> teach<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.430> kid<00:03:16.580> to

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
not the way you would teach a kid to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.510 
not the way you would teach a kid to
surf<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.060> it's<00:03:17.930> it's<00:03:18.590> almost<00:03:18.830> technically<00:03:19.370> all

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
surf so it's it's almost technically all

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.310 
surf so it's it's almost technically all
wrong<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:19.820> then<00:03:20.180> all<00:03:20.720> of<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.900> sudden<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.230> goes

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
wrong and then all of a sudden it goes

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.630 
wrong and then all of a sudden it goes
right<00:03:21.500> at<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.770> end<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:22.100> think<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.459> one<00:03:22.580> thing

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
right at the end I think the one thing

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.800 
right at the end I think the one thing
that<00:03:22.820> people<00:03:23.120> don't<00:03:23.209> realize<00:03:23.570> about<00:03:23.600> a

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
that people don't realize about a

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.750 
that people don't realize about a
service<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.230> it's<00:03:24.470> not<00:03:24.620> all<00:03:24.860> are<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.430> lot<00:03:25.730> of

service that it's not all are a lot of
it<00:03:25.940> comes<00:03:26.060> from<00:03:26.209> lower<00:03:26.510> body<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.900> from<00:03:27.290> legs<00:03:27.530> I

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
it comes from lower body and from legs I

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.199 
it comes from lower body and from legs I
feel<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.040> most<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.489> big<00:03:28.670> service<00:03:29.060> from

was a bit of a mentor for me I asked him

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.270 
was a bit of a mentor for me I asked him
what<00:04:11.390> as<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.720> biggest<00:04:12.200> regret<00:04:12.590> was<00:04:12.620> it's<00:04:13.190> a

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
what as the biggest regret was it's a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.620 
what as the biggest regret was it's a
pretty<00:04:13.430> heavy<00:04:13.610> question<00:04:14.030> for<00:04:14.209> Andre<00:04:14.450> I<00:04:14.480> mean

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
pretty heavy question for Andre I mean

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.420 
pretty heavy question for Andre I mean
we've<00:04:14.780> all<00:04:14.900> kind<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.709> been<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:15.860> part<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.220> his<00:04:16.400> uh

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
we've all kind of been a part of his uh

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.050 
we've all kind of been a part of his uh
his<00:04:16.970> triumphs<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:17.959> his<00:04:18.080> pitfalls<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:18.850> he<00:04:19.850> said

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
his triumphs and his pitfalls so he said

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.340 
his triumphs and his pitfalls so he said
i<00:04:20.090> didn't<00:04:20.390> i<00:04:20.510> didn't<00:04:20.750> start<00:04:20.870> my<00:04:21.049> charitable

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
i didn't i didn't start my charitable

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.470 
i didn't i didn't start my charitable
foundation<00:04:21.890> early<00:04:22.130> enough

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
foundation early enough

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.850 
foundation early enough
and<00:04:22.600> that's<00:04:23.080> coming<00:04:23.230> from<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.530> guy<00:04:23.650> he's

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
and that's coming from a guy he's

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.460 
and that's coming from a guy he's
probably<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.190> leader<00:04:24.370> as<00:04:24.610> far<00:04:25.060> as<00:04:25.210> a

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
probably the leader as far as a

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.560 
probably the leader as far as a
philanthropy<00:04:26.470> in<00:04:26.670> tennis<00:04:27.670> and<00:04:27.820> maybe<00:04:28.420> even

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
philanthropy in tennis and maybe even

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.500 
philanthropy in tennis and maybe even
sports<00:04:28.960> so<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.920> hit<00:04:30.070> home<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.970> figured

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
sports so that hit home and I figured

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.030 
sports so that hit home and I figured
there<00:04:31.630> was<00:04:31.720> no<00:04:31.840> reason<00:04:31.990> even<00:04:32.530> if<00:04:32.710> he<00:04:32.800> couldn't

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
there was no reason even if he couldn't

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.710 
there was no reason even if he couldn't
raise<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.370> much<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.850> start<00:04:34.360> at<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.510> next

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
raise that much to start at the next

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.050 
raise that much to start at the next
year<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.900> think<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:35.140> was<00:04:35.290> 18<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.400> we<00:04:36.490> raised<00:04:36.730> you

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
year I think I was 18 and we raised you

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.310 
year I think I was 18 and we raised you
know<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.300> think<00:04:37.480> it<00:04:37.660> was<00:04:37.750> thirty<00:04:37.960> or<00:04:38.110> forty

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
know I think it was thirty or forty

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.840 
know I think it was thirty or forty
thousand<00:04:38.650> dollars<00:04:38.860> in<00:04:38.980> a<00:04:39.040> parking<00:04:39.340> lot<00:04:39.400> you

thousand dollars in a parking lot you

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.250
