00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hey guys what is up the neo Cuba steer

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.190 
hey guys what is up the neo Cuba steer
I've<00:00:02.820> got<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> tutorial<00:00:03.449> for<00:00:03.750> you<00:00:03.810> guys<00:00:03.870> today

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
I've got a tutorial for you guys today

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.320 
I've got a tutorial for you guys today
this<00:00:04.500> time<00:00:04.740> it<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.160> how<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.430> mine<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.150> best

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
this time it is on how to mine the best

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.600 
this time it is on how to mine the best
and<00:00:06.629> easiest<00:00:06.779> ways<00:00:07.230> let's<00:00:07.950> get<00:00:08.130> started<00:00:08.400> so

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
and easiest ways let's get started so

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.540 
and easiest ways let's get started so
there<00:00:09.210> are<00:00:09.300> two<00:00:09.480> basic<00:00:10.080> types<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.620> mining<00:00:11.370> and

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
there are two basic types of mining and

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.930 
there are two basic types of mining and
minecraft<00:00:12.410> minecraft'<00:00:13.410> mining<00:00:14.250> see<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
minecraft minecraft' mining see the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.470 
minecraft minecraft' mining see the
connection

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
connection

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.680 
connection
so<00:00:16.020> there's<00:00:16.650> caving<00:00:17.160> looking<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.029> caves<00:00:18.330> for

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
so there's caving looking in caves for

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
so there's caving looking in caves for
ores<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.260> there<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.920> branch<00:00:20.189> mining<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:20.820> let's

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
ores and there is branch mining so let's

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.640 
ores and there is branch mining so let's
get<00:00:21.600> into<00:00:21.779> caving<00:00:22.109> first<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.470> will<00:00:22.590> explain

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
get into caving first I will explain

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.490 
get into caving first I will explain
branch<00:00:23.160> mining<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.390> little<00:00:24.600> bit<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:25.080> strip

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
branch mining and a little bit or strip

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.320 
branch mining and a little bit or strip
mining<00:00:25.800> whatever<00:00:26.010> you'd<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.369> call<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.580> so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
of your ores
but<00:01:40.770> strip<00:01:41.100> mining<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.549> more<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:41.970> diamonds

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
but strip mining is more for diamonds

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.490 
but strip mining is more for diamonds
gold<00:01:42.750> redstone<00:01:43.259> lapis<00:01:43.710> lazuli<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.399> yeah<00:01:45.500> keep

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
gold redstone lapis lazuli so yeah keep

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
gold redstone lapis lazuli so yeah keep
in<00:01:46.619> mind<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:47.280> all<00:01:47.310> caves<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.909> huge<00:01:48.270> such<00:01:48.600> as

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
in mind not all caves are huge such as

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
in mind not all caves are huge such as
this<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.710> well<00:01:50.579> I'd<00:01:50.850> say<00:01:51.090> this

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
this one this one is well I'd say this

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.880 
this one this one is well I'd say this
one<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.450> pretty<00:01:52.110> big<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.829> not

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
one is pretty big but it's not

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
one is pretty big but it's not
necessarily<00:01:53.399> huge<00:01:53.759> because<00:01:54.090> some<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.509> go

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
necessarily huge because some will go

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.139 
necessarily huge because some will go
down<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.619> bedrock<00:01:55.920> well<00:01:56.490> not<00:01:56.670> necessarily<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
down to bedrock well not necessarily to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.330 
down to bedrock well not necessarily to
bedrock<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.689> close<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.049> those<00:01:58.320> layers<00:01:58.590> which

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
bedrock but close to those layers which

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.649 
bedrock but close to those layers which
I<00:01:59.460> guess<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.909> is<00:01:59.939> pretty<00:02:00.240> big<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.570> they

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
I guess this one is pretty big but they

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.270 
I guess this one is pretty big but they
will<00:02:00.810> branch<00:02:01.079> off<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.530> lot<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.009> different

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
will branch off in a lot of different

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.899 
will branch off in a lot of different
directions<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.719> yeah<00:02:04.280> keep<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.460> mind<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
directions so yeah keep in mind you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.310 
directions so yeah keep in mind you
probably<00:02:06.149> want<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.540> mind<00:02:06.750> every<00:02:07.020> order<00:02:07.290> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
probably want to mind every order you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.869 
probably want to mind every order you
encounter<00:02:07.890> I'm<00:02:08.069> not<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.610> I'm<00:02:08.789> just

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879

showing you guys how to do these things

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.690 
showing you guys how to do these things
how<00:02:11.370> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
how to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.809 
how to
like<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:13.200> placing<00:02:13.530> torches<00:02:13.950> along

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
like this and just placing torches along

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.000 
like this and just placing torches along
the<00:02:15.270> right<00:02:15.480> side<00:02:15.870> or<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.319> left<00:02:16.440> side<00:02:16.620> will

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the right side or the left side will

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.080 
the right side or the left side will
help<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.220> find<00:02:17.370> your<00:02:17.520> way<00:02:17.550> because<00:02:17.940> when

little<00:02:22.020> tip<00:02:22.200> learned<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.980> from<00:02:23.130> direwolf<00:02:23.520> 20

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
little tip learned that from direwolf 20

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.780 
little tip learned that from direwolf 20
you<00:02:25.020> always<00:02:25.440> place<00:02:25.650> them<00:02:25.739> on<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> right<00:02:26.099> it's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
you always place them on the right it's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.760 
you always place them on the right it's
a<00:02:26.819> good<00:02:27.090> way<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.360> find<00:02:27.599> things<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.140> now<00:02:28.410> this

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
a good way to find things and now this

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.430 
a good way to find things and now this
will<00:02:29.190> work<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.790> Xbox<00:02:30.300> Pocket<00:02:30.900> Edition<00:02:30.989> I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
will work on the Xbox Pocket Edition I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.870 
will work on the Xbox Pocket Edition I
know<00:02:31.530> there's<00:02:31.770> no<00:02:31.890> caves<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.400> won't<00:02:32.610> work<00:02:32.760> on

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
know there's no caves that won't work on

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.370 
know there's no caves that won't work on
the<00:02:32.970> poor<00:02:33.150> condition<00:02:33.510> but<00:02:33.540> branch<00:02:33.989> mining

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
the poor condition but branch mining

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.960 
the poor condition but branch mining
definitely<00:02:34.860> will<00:02:35.010> stick<00:02:35.640> around<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.940> watch

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
definitely will stick around to watch

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.479 
definitely will stick around to watch
that<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.200> think<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.069> guys<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.370> seen

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
that so I think you guys have seen

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.970 
that so I think you guys have seen
enough<00:02:38.700> caving<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.420> really<00:02:40.290> good<00:02:40.410> method<00:02:40.620> I'm

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
enough caving a really good method I'm

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.740 
enough caving a really good method I'm
gonna<00:02:41.190> try<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.430> find<00:02:41.640> some<00:02:41.790> good<00:02:42.000> ores<00:02:42.239> well

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
gonna try to find some good ores well

don't want to start that so as you can
see<00:02:49.950> down<00:02:50.280> here<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.580> some<00:02:50.760> lava<00:02:51.500> lavas<00:02:52.500> found

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
see down here is some lava lavas found

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.100 
see down here is some lava lavas found
deep<00:02:52.980> underground<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.640> yeah<00:02:53.850> oh<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.569> right

deep underground so yeah oh and right
here<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.500> diamonds<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.130> yeah<00:02:56.370> caving<00:02:56.970> is

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
here is diamonds so yeah caving is

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.630 
here is diamonds so yeah caving is
definitely<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.569> really<00:02:57.989> good<00:02:58.200> way<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.709> finds<00:02:59.370> or

this is method number two branch mining
so<00:03:18.090> start<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.019> staircase<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.829> shown<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.549> dig

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
so start a staircase like shown and dig

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.210 
so start a staircase like shown and dig
down<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.540> really<00:03:22.079> low<00:03:22.290> layer<00:03:22.530> such<00:03:22.890> as<00:03:23.040> layer

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
down to a really low layer such as layer

be at layer 12 and if you guys don't
have<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:43.950> function<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.549> will<00:03:44.609> go<00:03:44.880> ahead<00:03:45.000> and

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
have this function I will go ahead and

have this function I will go ahead and
show<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.299> how<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.510> find<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:45.989> I'm<00:03:46.049> just

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
show you how to find it so I'm just

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.449 
show you how to find it so I'm just
gonna<00:03:46.260> make<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.560> staircase<00:03:46.980> down<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.430> a

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
gonna make the staircase down to a

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.160 
gonna make the staircase down to a
really<00:03:47.670> deep<00:03:47.820> layer<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.329> I'll<00:03:48.480> cut<00:03:48.870> there

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
really deep layer and I'll cut there

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.090 
really deep layer and I'll cut there
because<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.500> guys<00:03:49.650> don't<00:03:49.799> want<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:49.980> watch

you get any orders you can smelt them
while<00:04:25.000> you're<00:04:25.120> mining<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:25.780> let<00:04:26.530> me<00:04:26.710> go<00:04:27.160> ahead

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
while you're mining so let me go ahead

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.310 
while you're mining so let me go ahead
and<00:04:27.460> set<00:04:27.850> up<00:04:27.940> some<00:04:28.150> things<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.660> we<00:04:28.900> will<00:04:29.110> get

started actually didn't have to set up
anything<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:31.930> decide<00:04:32.140> to<00:04:32.170> turn<00:04:32.410> myself<00:04:32.500> off

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
anything I decide to turn myself off

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.290 
anything I decide to turn myself off
creative<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:33.370> it's<00:04:33.580> recommended<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:34.120> also

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
creative so it's recommended you also

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.850 
creative so it's recommended you also
make<00:04:34.540> a<00:04:34.570> crafting<00:04:35.050> bench<00:04:35.110> they're<00:04:35.470> very

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
make a crafting bench they're very

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.710 
make a crafting bench they're very
helpful<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.370> have<00:04:36.460> I'm<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.450> going<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.600> keep

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
helpful to have I'm just going to keep

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.390 
helpful to have I'm just going to keep
it<00:04:37.840> on<00:04:37.870> my<00:04:38.020> player<00:04:38.230> because<00:04:38.470> I<00:04:38.500> need<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.860> place

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
it on my player because I need to place

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.060 
it on my player because I need to place
it<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:39.730> branch<00:04:40.510> mining<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.200> basically<00:04:41.740> just

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
it so branch mining is basically just

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.950 
it so branch mining is basically just
digging<00:04:42.400> around<00:04:42.670> underground<00:04:43.300> on<00:04:43.750> this

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
digging around underground on this

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.750 
digging around underground on this
specific<00:04:44.410> layer<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:44.860> if<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.070> do<00:04:45.340> not<00:04:45.460> know<00:04:45.640> it

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
specific layer so if you do not know it

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.670 
specific layer so if you do not know it
later<00:04:45.910> on<00:04:45.970> we<00:04:46.240> are<00:04:46.330> on<00:04:46.390> layer<00:04:46.630> 12<00:04:46.930> right<00:04:47.200> now<00:04:47.230> I

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
later on we are on layer 12 right now I

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.040 
later on we are on layer 12 right now I
will<00:04:48.490> show<00:04:48.760> you<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:49.150> method<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:49.630> finding<00:04:49.930> that

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
will show you the method to finding that

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.170 
will show you the method to finding that
so<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.830> want<00:04:51.010> to<00:04:51.100> just<00:04:51.250> keep<00:04:51.520> digging<00:04:51.850> your

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
so you want to just keep digging your

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.730 
so you want to just keep digging your
staircase<00:04:52.540> down<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:53.170> since<00:04:53.380> I'm<00:04:53.500> just<00:04:53.530> going

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
staircase down and since I'm just going

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.080 
staircase down and since I'm just going
to<00:04:53.770> dig<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.130> straight<00:04:54.400> hole<00:04:54.520> down<00:04:54.700> until<00:04:54.970> you

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
to dig a straight hole down until you

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.750 
to dig a straight hole down until you
reach<00:04:55.120> bedrock<00:04:56.070> so<00:04:57.070> let's<00:04:57.280> just<00:04:57.430> dig<00:04:57.580> down

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
reach bedrock so let's just dig down

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.760 
reach bedrock so let's just dig down
here<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.390> you<00:04:58.900> see<00:04:58.930> this<00:04:59.170> is<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.380> first<00:04:59.530> layer

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
here and you see this is the first layer

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.890 
here and you see this is the first layer
of<00:04:59.800> bedrock<00:05:00.010> right<00:05:00.400> here<00:05:00.580> so<00:05:00.790> this<00:05:01.000> is<00:05:01.060> layer<00:05:01.480> 1

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
of bedrock right here so this is layer 1

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.680 
of bedrock right here so this is layer 1
2<00:05:02.890> 3<00:05:03.550> 4<00:05:04.000> 5<00:05:04.510> 6<00:05:05.020> 7<00:05:05.470> 8<00:05:06.010> so<00:05:06.580> now<00:05:06.790> you<00:05:06.850> add<00:05:07.090> 4<00:05:07.420> to<00:05:07.600> that

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so now you add 4 to that

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.510 
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so now you add 4 to that
number<00:05:07.900> since<00:05:08.200> there's<00:05:08.320> 4<00:05:08.500> layer<00:05:08.680> layers<00:05:09.310> of

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
number since there's 4 layer layers of

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.010 
number since there's 4 layer layers of
bedrock<00:05:09.790> and<00:05:09.940> now<00:05:10.090> you're<00:05:10.270> at<00:05:10.360> layer<00:05:10.540> 12<00:05:10.840> so

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
bedrock and now you're at layer 12 so

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.290 
bedrock and now you're at layer 12 so
basically<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:12.130> first<00:05:12.370> layer<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.640> bedrock<00:05:12.760> or

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
basically the first layer of bedrock or

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.560 
basically the first layer of bedrock or
one<00:05:13.930> is<00:05:14.460> four<00:05:15.460> blocks<00:05:15.850> higher<00:05:16.150> than<00:05:16.450> the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
one is four blocks higher than the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.910 
one is four blocks higher than the
actual<00:05:16.780> number<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.260> you<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.590> guess<00:05:17.770> your

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
actual number so you I guess your

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
actual number so you I guess your
starting<00:05:18.190> at<00:05:18.280> 5<00:05:18.570> technically<00:05:19.570> well<00:05:20.350> no<00:05:20.740> but<00:05:21.100> uh

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
starting at 5 technically well no but uh

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.750 
starting at 5 technically well no but uh
yeah<00:05:22.540> you<00:05:22.990> can<00:05:23.140> rewatch<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.740> NC<00:05:24.160> I<00:05:24.190> did<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.550> so

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
yeah you can rewatch that NC I did it so

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.910 
yeah you can rewatch that NC I did it so
yeah<00:05:25.330> branch<00:05:25.660> mining<00:05:26.140> is<00:05:26.260> basically<00:05:26.800> just

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
yeah branch mining is basically just

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.960 
yeah branch mining is basically just
mining<00:05:27.910> like<00:05:28.060> this<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.510> every<00:05:29.230> two<00:05:29.530> blocks

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
mining like this and every two blocks

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.850 
mining like this and every two blocks
mining<00:05:30.970> out<00:05:31.090> like<00:05:31.300> this<00:05:31.510> this<00:05:32.230> is<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.560> most

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
mining out like this this is the most

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.560 
mining out like this this is the most
efficient<00:05:33.520> way<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.700> branch<00:05:34.120> mine<00:05:34.330> there<00:05:34.480> is

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
efficient way to branch mine there is

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.990 
efficient way to branch mine there is
not<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:34.930> more<00:05:35.290> efficient<00:05:35.710> way<00:05:35.770> there<00:05:36.190> is<00:05:36.280> no

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
not a more efficient way there is no

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.820 
not a more efficient way there is no
proven<00:05:37.450> method<00:05:37.990> if<00:05:38.110> you<00:05:38.140> guys<00:05:38.290> have<00:05:38.530> proof

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
proven method if you guys have proof

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.950 
proven method if you guys have proof
post<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.610> comment<00:05:39.820> or<00:05:40.030> something<00:05:40.330> there's<00:05:40.510> no

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
post a comment or something there's no

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.020 
post a comment or something there's no
way<00:05:41.500> it<00:05:42.190> can<00:05:42.340> be<00:05:42.460> more<00:05:42.550> efficient<00:05:42.970> because

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
way it can be more efficient because

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.430 
way it can be more efficient because
you're<00:05:43.240> uncovering<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.840> most<00:05:44.050> blocks

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
you're uncovering the most blocks

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.850 
you're uncovering the most blocks
possible<00:05:45.250> so<00:05:46.260> I'd<00:05:47.260> like<00:05:47.410> to<00:05:47.470> see<00:05:47.710> some

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
possible so I'd like to see some

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.560 
possible so I'd like to see some
comments<00:05:48.220> on<00:05:48.280> what<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:48.610> guys<00:05:48.760> are<00:05:48.970> finding<00:05:49.270> by

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
comments on what you guys are finding by

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.140 
comments on what you guys are finding by
using<00:05:49.720> these<00:05:49.930> methods<00:05:50.380> it<00:05:50.530> would<00:05:50.620> really

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
using these methods it would really

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.550 
using these methods it would really
lighten<00:05:52.150> my<00:05:52.270> day<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.810> if<00:05:53.110> you<00:05:53.200> could<00:05:53.350> leave<00:05:53.500> a

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
lighten my day and if you could leave a

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.560 
lighten my day and if you could leave a
like<00:05:53.860> that<00:05:54.100> would<00:05:54.220> help<00:05:54.340> too<00:05:54.640> I<00:05:54.670> love<00:05:55.090> seeing

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
like that would help too I love seeing

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.350 
like that would help too I love seeing
you<00:05:55.630> guys<00:05:55.780> as<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.260> feedback<00:05:56.950> on<00:05:57.340> what<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.640> just

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
you guys as the feedback on what I just

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.090 
you guys as the feedback on what I just
about<00:05:58.540> said<00:05:58.810> but<00:05:59.500> yeah<00:05:59.620> this<00:05:59.770> is<00:05:59.830> basically

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
about said but yeah this is basically

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.950 
about said but yeah this is basically
strip<00:06:00.790> mining<00:06:01.090> so<00:06:01.240> I'm<00:06:01.360> going<00:06:01.480> to<00:06:01.540> strip<00:06:01.780> mine

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
strip mining so I'm going to strip mine

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.680 
strip mining so I'm going to strip mine
a<00:06:01.990> bit<00:06:02.230> until<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:02.830> can<00:06:03.070> find<00:06:03.370> some<00:06:03.580> ores<00:06:03.790> and<00:06:04.060> I

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
a bit until I can find some ores and I

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.850 
a bit until I can find some ores and I
will<00:06:04.840> show<00:06:04.960> you<00:06:05.020> guys<00:06:05.080> but<00:06:05.350> this<00:06:05.440> is<00:06:05.500> basically

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
will show you guys but this is basically

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.020 
will show you guys but this is basically
what<00:06:06.040> you<00:06:06.070> do<00:06:06.220> it'll<00:06:06.370> look<00:06:06.520> like<00:06:06.670> this<00:06:06.820> it

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
what you do it'll look like this it

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.460 
what you do it'll look like this it
looks<00:06:07.150> really<00:06:07.540> neat<00:06:07.720> underground<00:06:08.230> you<00:06:08.350> can

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
looks really neat underground you can

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.750 
looks really neat underground you can
make<00:06:08.560> it<00:06:08.650> look<00:06:08.740> fancy<00:06:09.010> you<00:06:09.340> could<00:06:09.430> even<00:06:09.610> turn

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
make it look fancy you could even turn

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.260 
make it look fancy you could even turn
it<00:06:09.910> into<00:06:10.060> a<00:06:10.240> home<00:06:10.540> or<00:06:10.870> gather<00:06:11.650> cobblestone

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
it into a home or gather cobblestone

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.550 
it into a home or gather cobblestone
this<00:06:13.270> is<00:06:13.390> a<00:06:13.420> good<00:06:13.660> way<00:06:13.750> to<00:06:13.780> gather<00:06:13.990> cobblestone

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
this is a good way to gather cobblestone

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.660 
this is a good way to gather cobblestone
too<00:06:14.710> if<00:06:14.800> you<00:06:14.860> just<00:06:15.010> want<00:06:15.160> to<00:06:15.190> gather<00:06:15.340> call<00:06:15.580> the

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
too if you just want to gather call the

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.980 
too if you just want to gather call the
stone<00:06:15.820> to<00:06:15.910> build<00:06:16.030> a<00:06:16.120> house<00:06:16.300> or<00:06:16.660> whatnot<00:06:16.840> but

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
stone to build a house or whatnot but

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.610 
stone to build a house or whatnot but
yep<00:06:17.530> so<00:06:18.370> let's<00:06:18.790> go<00:06:19.030> ahead<00:06:19.150> and<00:06:19.330> get<00:06:19.810> on<00:06:20.050> to

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
yep so let's go ahead and get on to

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.280 
yep so let's go ahead and get on to
finding<00:06:21.370> some<00:06:21.700> ore<00:06:21.910> so<00:06:22.240> be<00:06:22.540> right<00:06:22.720> back

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
finding some ore so be right back

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.350 
finding some ore so be right back
okay<00:06:24.010> so<00:06:24.070> I<00:06:24.190> have<00:06:24.400> branch<00:06:24.700> mind<00:06:24.970> a<00:06:25.090> bit<00:06:25.210> here

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
okay so I have branch mind a bit here
