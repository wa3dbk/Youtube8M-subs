some people just walk that way naturally
but<00:01:57.170> it's<00:01:58.170> really<00:01:58.500> good<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.920> able<00:01:58.979> to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
but it's really good to be able to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
but it's really good to be able to
practice<00:01:59.280> pointing<00:01:59.820> your<00:01:59.880> toes<00:02:00.090> forward<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
keeping that central line going it's

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.560 
keeping that central line going it's
very<00:02:04.079> healthy<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.710> walk<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.040> way<00:02:05.250> too
