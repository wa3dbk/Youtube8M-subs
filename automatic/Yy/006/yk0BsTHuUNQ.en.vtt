00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.059
 we're on the way again today 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.119
 today with him again today with David 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.550
 alaba biggest me hello nuri and david 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.660
 They are busy working on their teams and doing it 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.360
 a lot has happened since the last time 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.160
 Let's see what you are doing 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.500
 have set the ceiling is very first time 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.660
 much better than your first starter 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.250
 set but I believe that has to be a bit 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.820
 is still made yes that is 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.530
 anarchy 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.210
 so took are there lukaku storage 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.549
 makiadi these are all great people though 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.010
 not perfect this time, however, open 

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:47.570
 Let's have a look at mexes or 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.540
 defender muhamed pp and were 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 even in domestic defense could 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.110
 probably good with martin harnik 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.030
 work together both from the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:02.600
 bundesliga so that could be good from the bench 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.680
 will come so we have a 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.180
 a little something already made chemistry 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.310
 in the martin harnik ever the 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:15.290
 do you know what is from the bundesliga 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:17.390
 with nicklas bendtner and max is the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.040
 active team is getting slow 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.190
 if you compare what we at the beginning 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.270
 had and what is now on the lawn 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.580
 has made a good team of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.720
 the name but if the situation still 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.770
 Playing well together is good too 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.610
 important transfermarkt maybe i can 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.159
 our team a bit more 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:49.640
 Reinforce and the chemistry easy 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:51.080
 can improve how to properly with 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.940
 Lukaku 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.500
 fits to beat down people though 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:03.630
 the market on time so you only have 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.770
 ten seconds around the 1600s georg wanted 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.960
 has bought or 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.240
 Roman Abramovich simply says that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.020
 ddr of his team school their fun 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.010
 but you can also party a bit 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.460
 let's have a team 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.270
 to tighten copenhagen despite tight 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.100
 the deficit getting better out of there too 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.190
 even the chemistry will be better 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.250
 formation right looks very good 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.980
 what do you say to your team big and 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.120
 quite satisfied with the new one 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.010
 players again now 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.459
 came 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.970
 dior caroline or that many fans now 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.970
 especially in chemistry 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.879
 So the team looks on paper all 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.359
 good looking out huge david alaba 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.280
 style will beat in a real match 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.319
 against a randomly chosen one 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.790
 player and also in the next episode 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.790
 series which strikes only nose
