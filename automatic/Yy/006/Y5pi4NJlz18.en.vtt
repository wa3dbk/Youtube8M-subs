00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 Hello friends Today 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.740
 it's about sauces 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.650
 and the sauces 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.099
 I want to go to the point of aurora sauce 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.869
 which is a very remembered and longed for sauce 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.869
 for the Cubans 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.910
 the aurora sauce 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.680
 they are derived from a white sauce 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:44.110
 the sauces 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.830
 white are the bechamel and the ball 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.830
 the bechamel 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.170
 Milky 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.410
 the same proportion of flour as salt 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.230
 that of butter 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.010
 also for the candle a tea that then 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.650
 will be with broth that is to say bechamel with 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.440
 milk and b batch with chicken beef broth 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.460
 of vegetables is to say what the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.560
 difference nothing more 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.900
 those two cups of broth or milk then 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.490
 today I am going to be with the bechamel 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.380
 it's made with milk 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.000
 so 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.000
 here I have prepared 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.820
 the milk 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.970
 the oats 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.080
 and the salt 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.050
 the butter 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.340
 that takes four tablespoons of 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.070
 butter too 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.460
 I already have it here also is to say a 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.469
 teaspoon of salt four tablespoons of 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.700
 flour and two cups of water make up one 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.850
 White sauce 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.350
 what is the bechamel but also the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.350
 of chanel you can savor 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:11.320
 it is savored za generally like walnut 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.420
 moscada that here I have it nut 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.280
 moscada a teaspoon and wine 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.890
 you can select any wine 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.890
 to flavor your bechamel sauce 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.550
 let's proceed to make the sauce 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.550
 bechamel 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.030
 I'm going to pour a cup 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.159
 that I had her ready 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.159
 I'm going to prepare the other one 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.780
 will come to see you 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.890
 Y 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.900
 I will add 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.530
 the salt 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.379
 the flour 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.940
 the flour 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.030
 nutmeg 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.350
 and 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.350
 and the wine 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:28.200
 the expected butter 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:31.740
 in fire well let's make the mixture 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.740
 of the ingredients 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.170
 and it seems to me that it was already well mixed 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.319
 you 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.940
 ok let's light the fire to join 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.790
 this mixture 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.510
 to the band in it then when it 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.480
 will perform 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.810
 what is the bechamel sauce 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.510
 then because they told him that I wanted 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.780
 get to the aurora sauce because 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.480
 precisely the aurora sauce is a 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.770
 variation of taste that is made to 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.770
 final to the bechamel sauce 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.310
 so that's why I left it for the 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.460
 final and I left him the first free 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.669
 the butter and I'm going to sell it and 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.669
 mixture 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.980
 and immediately I'm going to start 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.980
 give back 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.220
 That is what this sauce must 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:10.230
 stir revolver 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.230
 until she starts to set 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.310
 and there it is beginning to thicken 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:23.980
 then I will zoom in 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.980
 the ingredients of the aurora 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.009
 I'm going to bring the ingredients of the 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.210
 aurora that are added at the end 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.220
 because the recipe of the aurora 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.090
 it implies 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.090
 It includes 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:47.360
 in its ingredients 2 cup of cream 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.720
 Bechamel already understands is the basis if not 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.350
 has the bechamel cream béchamel not 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.770
 can do the aurora 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.940
 already started to boil to curdle and then 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.940
 I'm going to add 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.150
 the ingredients to turn it into a 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.390
 cream work 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.740
 a teaspoon of paprika in half 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.740
 elsur mug 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.370
 a teaspoon of salt 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.409
 and the teaspoon of pepper that does not 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.409
 I wanted to throw him before the one in america 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.319
 Now stir and mix that is already 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.319
 curdling 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:46.600
 with the heat that comes from the burner 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:51.750
 it's more than enough I have to separate it 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.750
 that is, what 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.630
 We have 2 in 1 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.729
 there they have a cream aurora cream 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.729
 dawn 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.000
 all right 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.110
 let's serve it 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.620
 and good friends what do you think is cute 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:20.700
 I tasted it delicious delicious as 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:24.050
 whenever the béchamel is made with the 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:27.990
 pepper with wine with nutmeg 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:31.500
 with the salt that those details never 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.610
 they lose by then when we go to 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.639
 do 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:40.120
 our precious aurora 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:46.539
 and the bechamel come also contributing 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:48.240
 not only the base but flavor hoisting flavor 

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:51.550
 hoisting much more 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.939
 complementing that delicious sauce that 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:57.969
 is the aurora well has been a pleasure to 

00:07:54.939 --> 00:08:02.370
