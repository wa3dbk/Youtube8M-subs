 street today I have five tips for 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:15.900
 what you film at christmas time 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:18.150
 should the holiday season break or 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.740
 has already begun and many of you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.630
 maybe already have a camera or 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.070
 get one for christmas and what 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.080
 Can you do better than you do 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.760
 directly try it straight in 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.890
 this season, many offer themselves 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.779
 different things to film and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.980
 can also take pictures so the tips 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.059
 you can also take pictures 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.010
 adapt 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.350
 That's why we start with directly 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.149
 tip 1 tip number one you can do that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.980
 There is Christmas at Christmas 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.559
 heaps of Christmas markets pretty much 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.420
 every city and berlin is booming 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.530
 and is crowded with christmas markets 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.390
 we are here right now 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.280
 there are even three alexanderplatz here 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.980
 christmas markets almost in one spot 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.020
 and these offer themselves very well 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.989
 for beautiful shots too 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.059
 there are lights there is eat it 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.680
 People are running around doing it 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.719
 there are big wheels there are others 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.150
 Attractions Everything you can 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.189
 filming there pay attention to that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.290
 here is a bright lens I have 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.540
 for example, here is 50 millimeters 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.590
 1.4 on my know 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.689
 that offers me the possibility of a lot 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.880
 light on the sensor to pack so that 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 it stops when it is dark that one 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.720
 still recognizes something and especially if 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.439
 it is dark you should get this 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.390
 Also visit Christmas markets because 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.280
 During the day the lights may be off 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.409
 People are not that many anymore 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.590
 there and in the evening he get the people there 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.939
 the lights are on it sparkles everything 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.009
 beautiful as you are in there 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.250
 So background looks rather in the evening 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.380
 go shutter shut so on 51 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.500
 10 you can also quietly go down to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.479
 a 33 that does not matter to the picture 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.610
 Do not hold on to this too hard 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.740
 rule and at the iso take care that you 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.270
 not too high but high enough 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.549
 you still see something in the picture 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.399
 you see her on the lcd display what 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.680
 That's why every film is adapted by alisa 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.270
 that you see something number two 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.040
 usually it belongs to the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.200
 Christmas time or winter time 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.209
 it's the snow here in berlin 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.890
 is missing at the moment I know in others 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.140
 in opponents 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.330
 germany, however, already exists 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.040
 everything is still a bit gray 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.990
 That's why I can not do you any 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.970
 however, examples of recordings show snow 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.530
 also filmed wonderfully too 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.959
 and I just mean 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.720
 keep it on a white 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.880
 surface or something but maybe with 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.800
 a person go out like that through the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.570
 snow is running in the near or 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 maybe make an amount of snow 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.209
 a snowball fight or something like that or 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.680
 making snowmen or something like that 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.590
 Maybe it offers snow 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.720
 which lies on food or so as everything in 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.540
 close-ups with a beautiful open aperture 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.010
 filmed so maybe nice sharpening 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.050
 Course from one doctor to another 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.489
 Just creative that was easy 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.959
 just be an example and yours 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.950
 creativity really is not there 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.900
 borders 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.310
 rage you out and yes I can unfortunately 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.620
 Do not do it because in Berlin 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.959
 Peter snow we come to type number 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.120
 three after christmas markets and 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.620
 There are also suitable in everywhere 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.780
 the city lights no matter it on 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.730
 Christmas markets is or in others 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.440
 shopping streets everything is full with 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.820
 flashing lights straight to 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.829
 Everything is beautiful at Christmas time 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.140
 I am also decorated in the form of 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.180
 santa clauses or rudolf dem 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.040
 reindeer or something and offers something 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.680
 Eerie too good 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.660
 just to feel 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.489
 out of focus so bright lens 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.190
 for that use as I already full 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.760
 I mentioned 50 millimeter 1.4 here 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.769
 the 50 meter 1.8 also does the same 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.450
 good job and then just complete 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.769
 up and focus and film that 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.280
 and then how the lights are flashing or 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.049
 maybe still reflect 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.820
 any car headlights or 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.570
 Traffic lights in the background the color 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.310
 change 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.530
 so what looks beautiful and straight 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.320
 for transitions or something provides so 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.450
 Such recordings are also available 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.160
 wonderful without sharpness preliminary so 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.650
 even if such a string of lights there 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.420
 or something like that for example from the beginning 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.739
 from the first bulb to the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.600
 rear light bulb just like that 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.410
 sharper course at completely open 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.880
 make a blind 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.880
 that looks really nice , too 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.590
 camera settings as well as where before too 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.190
 easy at the christmas markets 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.739
 leave 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.900
 Tip number four unpack the gifts 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.280
 or gifts in general I can 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.479
 unfortunately not yet film because 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.800
 We do not have Christmas Eve yet 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.199
 but especially on Christmas Eve when 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.270
 entire family sits together and all 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.069
 unpacking her presents films that 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.960
 So if you are so 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.360
 Gifts opens up the wrapping paper 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.370
 tears up the emotions of small children 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.139
 The laugh of little children when they are 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.729
 unpack into gifts and a toy 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.099
 that's what she's on 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.840
 have been happy for weeks are something 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.300
 beautiful shots and there you can 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.220
 really join in and finalize 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.319
 pay attention to the camera settings 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.990
 so I like open aperture I like 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.599
 such a film shutter time fits it 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.259
 really the brightness on the side 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.849
 bogged down too tightly to this 150 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.710
 but also goes down and ii 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.750
 as well as already said earlier it fits 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.250
 Just look at what you see on the display 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.629
 sees and then you can actually 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.629
 do not do much wrong 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:11.639
 Tip number 5 are Christmas trees so 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.780
 clear at christmas time what can there 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.159
 not missing a beautiful 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.990
 christmas tree does not matter if you are in 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.879
 living room or maybe just up 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.680
 its christmas market as we just 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.060
 are or somewhere else in the city 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.280
 everything is full of christmas trees 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.449
 beautifully decorated nicely decorated too 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.219
 little lights here christmas balls and 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.710
 maybe little elves or something about it 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.150
 is completely no matter these Christmas trees 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.550
 are beautifully decorated and there 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.409
 do not try such a Christmas tree 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.539
 only to be taken as a full shot 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.819
 but sometimes with the camera 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.580
 and to get closer to the objective couple 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.229
 detailed recordings to make just his 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.479
 sharpness maybe even of 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.310
 a ball to the next ball or 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.020
 something or a doctor became 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.599
 jewelry is attached to the next doctor 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.460
 jewelery hangs so what makes the art 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.840
 Not just the Christmas tree 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.590
 completely but also a bit 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.629
 get closer 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.599
 different perspectives later simply 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:06.629
 Take the camera around and be easy 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:08.310
 Creative that was 5 tips from me 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:09.569
 what to do during the winter season 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.430
 can film everything 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.740
 maybe you have more tips 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.520
 for me like to post in the 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.690
 Comments 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.969
 I also have a little one 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.639
 additional boost for you and candles 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.819
 I think there's no season in there 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.979
 whose more candles are lit than 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:27.360
 for christmas so candles there as well 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.310
 with the lights with sharpness 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.270
 play blur and then you can 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.380
 beautiful recordings participate 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.210
 Now I hope you have the video 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.070
 fallen and also helped if so 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.690
 is gives thumbs up 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.500
 inexpensive channel where no more video 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.960
 to miss 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.430
 check out these videos here for me 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.840
 here still packed in the unpacked 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.670
 and we'll meet again on saturday 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.230
 with a new video review 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.010
 until then and I go there a first 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.010
 drink mulled wine
