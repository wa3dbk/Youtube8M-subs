this kind of travel dongle and and these

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.620 
this kind of travel dongle and and these
sort<00:00:35.890> of<00:00:35.920> dongles<00:00:36.370> we<00:00:36.910> have<00:00:37.030> already<00:00:37.240> in<00:00:37.510> the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
sort of dongles we have already in the

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.990 
sort of dongles we have already in the
market<00:00:37.990> there<00:00:38.200> basically<00:00:38.920> it<00:00:39.160> is<00:00:39.280> creating<00:00:39.820> a

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
market there basically it is creating a

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.600 
market there basically it is creating a
wireless<00:00:40.450> LAN<00:00:40.630> around<00:00:41.350> itself<00:00:41.770> and<00:00:42.040> it's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
wireless LAN around itself and it's

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.130 
wireless LAN around itself and it's
connecting<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.240> wireless<00:00:43.570> LAN<00:00:43.720> to<00:00:44.050> the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
connecting the wireless LAN to the

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.319 
connecting the wireless LAN to the
Internet<00:00:44.590> via<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.220> mobile<00:00:45.640> network

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
Internet via the mobile network

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.440 
Internet via the mobile network
here<00:00:46.570> I<00:00:46.630> have<00:00:46.900> a<00:00:46.930> good<00:00:47.230> speed<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.890> product

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
here I have a good speed the product

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.360 
here I have a good speed the product
there's<00:00:49.450> a<00:00:49.540> button<00:00:49.750> which<00:00:50.290> gives<00:00:50.320> me<00:00:51.160> more

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
there's a button which gives me more

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.460 
there's a button which gives me more
information<00:00:51.970> on<00:00:52.090> how<00:00:52.300> they<00:00:52.480> how<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.079> device

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
information on how they how the device

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.200 
information on how they how the device
is<00:00:53.620> working<00:00:53.650> and<00:00:54.190> what<00:00:54.400> I<00:00:54.430> can<00:00:54.700> see<00:00:54.850> over<00:00:55.180> here

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
is working and what I can see over here

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.389 
is working and what I can see over here
is<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:55.570> it's<00:00:56.020> connected<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.250> local

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
is that it's connected to the local

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:58.920 
is that it's connected to the local
network<00:00:57.550> DNA<00:00:58.300> over<00:00:58.570> here

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
network DNA over here

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.760 
network DNA over here
this<00:00:59.470> is<00:00:59.560> a<00:00:59.590> battery<00:00:59.890> indicator<00:01:01.170> 3.5<00:01:02.170> G<00:01:02.470> so

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
this is a battery indicator 3.5 G so

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.550 
this is a battery indicator 3.5 G so
it's<00:01:02.920> faster<00:01:03.579> 3G<00:01:04.000> network<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.689> now<00:01:05.229> it<00:01:05.379> says

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
it's faster 3G network and now it says

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.499 
it's faster 3G network and now it says
that<00:01:05.799> there<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.009> one<00:01:06.310> device<00:01:06.729> connected<00:01:07.329> which

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
that there is one device connected which

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.260 
that there is one device connected which
is<00:01:07.659> my<00:01:07.990> laptop<00:01:08.380> over<00:01:08.649> here<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.939> this<00:01:10.090> is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
is my laptop over here so this is

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.849 
is my laptop over here so this is
basically<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:11.109> display<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.829> if<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:13.829> press<00:01:14.829> the

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859 
basically the display and if I press the

basically the display and if I press the
button<00:01:15.219> again<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:16.149> shows<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:17.020> service

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
button again it shows that the service

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.559 
button again it shows that the service
is<00:01:17.409> okay<00:01:17.799> today<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:18.759> have<00:01:19.210> used<00:01:20.399> 123<00:01:21.569> megabytes

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
country and SIM cards inside the device

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.929 
country and SIM cards inside the device
and<00:01:52.779> what<00:01:53.349> is<00:01:53.499> very<00:01:53.920> special<00:01:54.399> with<00:01:54.789> this
