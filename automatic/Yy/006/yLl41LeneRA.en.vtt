talk about a different game but Oklahoma

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
talk about a different game but Oklahoma
did<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.799> good<00:01:31.979> job<00:01:32.040> even<00:01:32.460> after<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> second

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390

and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.689> guess<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.259> didn't<00:01:37.500> score

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and then they I guess they didn't score

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.899 
and then they I guess they didn't score
up<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.950> they<00:01:38.040> got<00:01:38.189> another<00:01:38.340> stop<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.729> defense

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

up and they got another stop on defense
the<00:01:39.750> defense<00:01:40.170> started<00:01:40.380> playing<00:01:41.009> better<00:01:41.540> in

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the defense started playing better in

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.840 
the defense started playing better in
the<00:01:42.689> second<00:01:43.079> half<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:44.130> hands<00:01:44.490> down<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the second half but hands down the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.760 
the second half but hands down the
Oklahoma<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.810> being<00:01:46.560> able<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.920> still<00:01:48.770> combine

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
Oklahoma for being able to still combine

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.609

four<00:01:50.159> points<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> defense<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.450> Oklahoma<00:01:52.110> is

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
four points that defense for Oklahoma is

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.440 
four points that defense for Oklahoma is
pretty<00:01:52.979> underrated<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.119> didn't<00:01:54.329> talk
