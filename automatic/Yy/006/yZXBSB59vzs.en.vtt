00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.420 
game and the t1000 I can only do other
different<00:03:19.200> tracks<00:03:19.470> or<00:03:19.709> something<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.310> don't

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
different tracks or something I don't

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.620 
different tracks or something I don't
even<00:03:20.610> know<00:03:20.790> how<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.910> explain<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.269> all<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.540> know

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
even know how to explain it all I know

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.130 
even know how to explain it all I know
is<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.890> one<00:03:23.459> track<00:03:24.120> every<00:03:24.810> time<00:03:25.019> you

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
is that it's one track every time you

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.440 
is that it's one track every time you
play<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.890> different<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.820> could<00:03:27.269> have<00:03:27.360> done

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
play it it's different I could have done

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.550 
play it it's different I could have done
a<00:03:27.510> whole<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.870> could<00:03:27.989> have<00:03:28.080> done<00:03:28.140> an<00:03:28.260> entire

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
a whole I could have done an entire

a whole I could have done an entire
Ted's<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.220> just<00:03:29.910> this<00:03:30.330> track<00:03:30.780> because<00:03:31.190> every

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
Ted's on just this track because every

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.039 
Ted's on just this track because every
time<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.489> played<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:32.880> different<00:03:33.209> now<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> be

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
time you played it's different now to be

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.020 
time you played it's different now to be
fair<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.980> not<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.280> every<00:03:35.610> time<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.850> play

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
fair it's not like every time you play

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.550 
fair it's not like every time you play
it's<00:03:36.180> completely<00:03:36.870> different<00:03:37.170> like<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.380> whole

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
it's completely different like a whole

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.470 
it's completely different like a whole
different<00:03:37.829> map<00:03:38.190> but<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.850> way<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.299> set

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
different map but the way that it's set

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.850 
different map but the way that it's set
up<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.900> way<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.200> play<00:03:40.350> trials<00:03:40.650> you

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
up and the way that you play trials you

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.990 
up and the way that you play trials you
get<00:03:40.980> into<00:03:41.100> rhythm<00:03:41.370> when<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.760> start<00:03:41.910> going

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
get into rhythm when you start going

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.550 
get into rhythm when you start going
through<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.299> map<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.900> certain<00:03:43.140> kind<00:03:43.530> of

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
through the map in certain kind of

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.840 
through the map in certain kind of
knowing<00:03:43.739> what<00:03:43.950> your<00:03:44.040> next<00:03:44.220> steps<00:03:44.459> gonna<00:03:44.610> be

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
knowing what your next steps gonna be

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.970 
knowing what your next steps gonna be
that<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:45.570> can't<00:03:45.900> do<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.230> here<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.829> to

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
that you can't do that here you have to

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.699 
that you can't do that here you have to
actually<00:03:47.430> adapt<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:48.239> every<00:03:48.690> other<00:03:48.900> like<00:03:49.470> every

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
actually adapt to every other like every

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.229 
actually adapt to every other like every
40<00:03:50.100> feet<00:03:50.310> there's<00:03:50.549> something<00:03:50.790> different<00:03:50.970> is

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
40 feet there's something different is

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.000 
40 feet there's something different is
gonna<00:03:51.390> be<00:03:51.570> there<00:03:51.750> occasionally<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.860> might

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
gonna be there occasionally you might

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.590 
gonna be there occasionally you might
get<00:03:53.160> lucky<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.519> get<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:53.910> maybe<00:03:54.060> two<00:03:54.420> or

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
get lucky and get like maybe two or

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.330 
get lucky and get like maybe two or
three<00:03:54.660> different<00:03:55.079> obstacles<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.680> row<00:03:55.860> that

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
three different obstacles in a row that

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.430 
three different obstacles in a row that
are<00:03:56.400> one<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.209> you've<00:03:57.329> just<00:03:57.540> done<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:58.079> maybe

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
are one that you've just done like maybe

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.380 
are one that you've just done like maybe
the<00:03:58.829> last<00:03:59.010> map<00:03:59.310> for<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.730> one<00:03:59.850> prior<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.120> that

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
the last map for the one prior to that

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.210 
the last map for the one prior to that
but<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.810> doesn't<00:04:01.079> matter<00:04:01.350> because<00:04:01.650> you're

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
but that doesn't matter because you're

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.710 
but that doesn't matter because you're
always<00:04:02.459> gonna<00:04:02.700> have<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.120> be<00:04:03.239> different<00:04:03.360> here

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
always gonna have to be different here

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.240 
always gonna have to be different here
now<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.989> course<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.290> other<00:04:04.500> issue<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.010> comes

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
now of course the other issue that comes

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.860 
now of course the other issue that comes
up<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.970> fact<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.329> leaderboard<00:04:06.810> is

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
up is the fact that the leaderboard is

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.270 
up is the fact that the leaderboard is
gonna<00:04:06.989> be<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.110> little<00:04:07.230> bit<00:04:07.380> skewed<00:04:07.709> somebody's

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
gonna be a little bit skewed somebody's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.190 
gonna be a little bit skewed somebody's
gonna<00:04:08.400> be<00:04:08.549> running<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:08.820> 45<00:04:09.269> seconds<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.900> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
gonna be running for 45 seconds and the

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.449 
gonna be running for 45 seconds and the
reality<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.590> maybe<00:04:10.829> they<00:04:10.920> had<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.310> whole<00:04:11.430> bunch

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
reality is maybe they had a whole bunch

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.970 
reality is maybe they had a whole bunch
of<00:04:11.700> really<00:04:12.269> easy<00:04:12.510> obstacles<00:04:13.320> all<00:04:13.650> that

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
of really easy obstacles all that

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.029 
of really easy obstacles all that
matters<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:14.940> played<00:04:15.660> this<00:04:15.930> map<00:04:16.200> for<00:04:16.769> no

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
matters is that I played this map for no

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.610 
matters is that I played this map for no
shit<00:04:17.400> three<00:04:18.000> hours<00:04:18.599> two<00:04:19.169> hours<00:04:19.229> of<00:04:19.560> the

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
shit three hours two hours of the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.190 
shit three hours two hours of the
morning<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.099> then<00:04:20.280> for<00:04:20.459> another

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
morning and then for another

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.620 
morning and then for another
or<00:04:21.260> in<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.560> evening<00:04:22.010> afterwards<00:04:22.460> because<00:04:23.180> it

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
or in the evening afterwards because it

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.500 
or in the evening afterwards because it
just<00:04:23.900> has<00:04:24.140> so<00:04:24.650> much<00:04:24.980> replay<00:04:25.520> value<00:04:25.700> look<00:04:26.390> at

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
just has so much replay value look at
