00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
changes and if you seen the notes
yourself<00:00:21.600> you're<00:00:21.869> probably<00:00:21.900> aware<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.980> they

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
yourself you're probably aware that they

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.089 
yourself you're probably aware that they
are<00:00:23.220> basically<00:00:23.670> Neffs<00:00:24.570> all<00:00:24.930> around<00:00:25.230> alright
