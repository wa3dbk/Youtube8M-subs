so<00:00:44.760> yesterday<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> did<00:00:45.360> some<00:00:45.510> chicken<00:00:45.829> do<00:00:46.829> some

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so yesterday I did some chicken do some

so yesterday I did some chicken do some
egg<00:00:47.190> beaters<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> morning<00:00:48.350> today<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.739> just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
egg beaters in the morning today I just

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.520 
egg beaters in the morning today I just
had<00:00:50.309> some<00:00:50.460> leftover<00:00:50.850> ground<00:00:51.059> turkey<00:00:51.530> from

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
had some leftover ground turkey from

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.869 
had some leftover ground turkey from
last<00:00:52.770> night's<00:00:53.010> dinner<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.579> rest<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> my

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
last night's dinner that the rest of my

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.709 
last night's dinner that the rest of my
family<00:00:54.210> last<00:00:54.960> night<00:00:56.059> with<00:00:57.059> some<00:00:57.090> broth<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
family last night with some broth and I

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
family last night with some broth and I
guess<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> broth<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.469> used<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.160> keep<00:00:59.370> your

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
guess the broth is used to keep your

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.130 
guess the broth is used to keep your
kidneys<00:01:00.300> functioning<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> give<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
kidneys functioning to give you the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
kidneys functioning to give you the
sodium<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.590> need<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.550> three<00:01:02.730> ounces<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
sodium we need but three ounces of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
sodium we need but three ounces of
protein<00:01:03.210> three<00:01:03.510> times<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.840> day<00:01:03.960> isn't<00:01:04.290> an

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
protein three times a day isn't an

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
protein three times a day isn't an
incredible<00:01:04.979> large<00:01:05.670> amount<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.030> food<00:01:06.210> little

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
incredible large amount of food little

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.760

wanted them to not feel bad about
knowing<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:51.520> I<00:04:51.580> figured<00:04:51.820> if<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:51.970> get<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.240> out<00:04:52.330> in

maybe then I'll cut her off at the pass
