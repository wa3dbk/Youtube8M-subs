00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.370
 being villagrÃ¡n because I spoke 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.450
 participated like yesterday 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.570
 8th jorge rucks mourinho juan carlos ni cold division francisco 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.569
 winner average 163 kilometers 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.099
 792 meters ana 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.949
 of the lap record was for emilio sagi in the emergency 6 minutes 25 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.949
 seconds 99 feel 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.710
 as always while we enjoy the images 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.159
 the word 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.359
 criticisms or fellini car has worked very well let's hear 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.850
 ap 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.850
 for example it allows you to do 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.750
 Echenique a Parisian and with good factor 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.080
 I think they are happy because 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.090
 good to improve we improve 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.770
 maybe it's not wise to miss a little bit but 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.400
 it was closer to 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.360
 on the contrary 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.850
 we have a physical relationship and then it was done today that if I work 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.540
 the motor 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.150
 the engine next to everything that changed but all that changed nothing 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.330
 this is 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.500
 and I think that without a doubt 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.620
 in the fire of eta working well what I will get that I will work with respect 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.610
 to the car because 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.470
 min separate them and related to the ocean 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.480
 does not render think what 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.030
 we will not allow the final 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.770
 I know that I had some problem with this heroine, something that we 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.620
 they cheat 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.360
 in this circuit fundamentally it is a tragedy and about so long and good there 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.210
 not everything for example escape me 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.390
 but you get divorced 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.270
 we are going to do and work and I think that she 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.590
 we are on the way to South Africa with a new stage 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.729
 Nora anonymity to all the Alps 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.870
 what happens that flies and follow the reform not 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.610
 this is what they are going to say that we are going for the apartments el mar alicante 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.040
 the race 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.600
 who will win 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.460
 you like who you want me to win 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.460
 so 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.080
 school as school 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:11.969
