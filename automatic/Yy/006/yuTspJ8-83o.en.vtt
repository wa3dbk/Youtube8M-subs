00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.790
 hi it's the best discovery 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.070
 today I propose to discover 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.570
 the chocolate lease from lot and then 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.680
 this is a young German brand 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.320
 is very good it is a pledge of quality 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.460
 and so the box is just once 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.770
 that we bought all the hard drives in 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.270
 a forest a little house all these 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.099
 colors are very bright it's great 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.180
 pretty so on the other side of the box one 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.800
 can see that there is a little crazy one 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.300
 micron so I guess it can be 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.710
 warm up if you wish 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.910
 we could not because we were 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.770
 in the term rio in Japan so we did not 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.590
 could not heat so we eat it 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.090
 and then cold opening super easy 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.730
 on the side you just have to 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.440
 journeys and after it opens and then 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.640
 there it's just too good you can 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.890
 see that inside the box and 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.079
 decorate the small of small sachets in 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.609
 he too there are types of music a 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.249
 squirrel the institute really too cute 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.629
 is actually apparently the Japanese 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.620
 must use decoration on 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.109
 cakes that can even be added 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.699
 the name of the child if we want that's it for 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.700
 when we open we can discover at 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.870
 inside pretty little puffs 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.490
 and his little puffs are so 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.780
 stuffed with chocolate so it's a 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.630
 kind of chocolate squares that's 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.400
 quite tender and actually on top 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.079
 on the fly through there is a kind of 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.890
 we made a little bit of sugar 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.630
 caramelized 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.100
 so that's really I think it's 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.420
 better of course when to heat them 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.740
 because chocolate has to be melted 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.250
 but it was still a beautiful 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.170
 discovery 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.299
 then these little puffs are little 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.619
 sweet frankly it's really very 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.899
 do not hesitate to buy some if you 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.159
 are passing through japan was going it was 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.369
 the minute discovered by shocked she has 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.369
