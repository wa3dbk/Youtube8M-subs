00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 then they are difficult to understand 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.970
 when we are talking about a period 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.190
 simple where in the middle does not pass 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.589
 absolutely nothing we are talking about 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.460
 what is called an interest rate 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.410
 nominal I put 10 receipt 11 in the middle 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.670
 there is nothing 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.740
 that's nominal interest rate and now 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.720
 let's try to understand what is the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.970
 difference between this nominal rate and the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.310
 effective rate because because you are already 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.920
 either to take a subtraction or to make a 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.470
 term deposit in your bank are always going to 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.780
 meet the nominal rate and the 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.210
 effective rate and we will learn to take 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.670
 decisions with each of them very 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.750
 well what happens if the bank and now 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.320
 tell me we're going to alter this 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.690
 fixed term or this term deposit and we're going 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.260
 to do the following the first six 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.079
 months we will have an annual rate of 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.030
 10 percent but half of it 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.940
 of the year 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.930
 then I put 10,000 and here the bank 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.930
 will receive me 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.149
 because I do not know why half of the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.819
 year then the rate in half that's 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.039
 pretty simple inside suppose that in 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.679
 that moment I return to make a 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.290
 deposit term I now have ten 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.120
 fifteen hundred 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.240
 so I'll invest it again in the 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:35.310
 bank very well the bank promises me the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.630
 same nominal rate of 10% now well I 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.980
 already here I have a capital of greater origin 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.710
 I will not receive 500 pesos of interest 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.700
 yes because if you do 10,500 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.520
 which is the initial capital of 0.10 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.940
 divided 2 are already going to get more than 500 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.740
 interest weights in this period are going to 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.840
 get 500 25 can if you observe everything 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.360
 the year you here have 11 thousand 25 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.260
 pesos euros dollars 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.970
 then note that if the bank 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.830
 offers 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.890
 this situation of doing two periods the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.790
 fixed term or two periods in deposit to 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.790
 term 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.850
 I'm making more money and the rate 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.450
 payroll of the same note nominal rate 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.690
 of 3 100 percent but there to keenan 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.470
 11,025 jatib to conceive 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.590
 what is the difference that in the middle 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.510
 you have a capitalization 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.440
 you here charge your interest and the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.200
 they reinvest then if the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.700
 bank that offers this is giving me a 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.670
 nominal rate of 10% but effectively 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.890
 I end up charging more and therefore I have 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.050
 that learn to calculate this house 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.140
 effective because it is what makes me take 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.130
 better or worse decisions if they tell me 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.550
 this or this and I and in both cases I 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.470
 gives 10% yo how do I know which one is better because 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.230
 let's see what the rates for this are 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.180
 different 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.890
 including the nominal ones 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.460
 in the real world banks are going to 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.250
 make offers 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.430
 now we are going to concentrate and 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.010
 let's start using these 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.040
 interest rate financial concepts 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.130
 we're going to learn to use to 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.560
 investment decision making 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.750
 now we saw as a term deposit of 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.420
 10,000 is transformed into 11,000 if 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.830
 we have a higher effective rate we charge 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.170
 plus 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.880
 pÃ©rez is we saw how the bank can 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.500
 cancel these loans like what are 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.080
 the sales of each one but now we're going 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.860
 to begin to understand the interest and 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.069
 the passage of time in a different way 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.079
 using the same 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.510
 and we are going to concentrate on what is 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.359
 call in the present value the value 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.310
 present is going to be a key concept and 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.609
 only for you to be able to take 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.280
 investment decisions that is this 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.889
 project or this trade or this company 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.020
 it's good it 's bad it serves me it does not serve me 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.259
 can be a profitable may not be 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.340
 profitable most of these questions 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:33.160
 let's solve with the present value 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.680
 of an investment let's see a little bit in 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.660
 what does this consist of the present value is 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.360
 agree on the term deposit 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.570
 we said that we put 10,000 and 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.200
 we received 11,000 the house of interest is 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.430
 a house 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.370
 with Ivan the bank tells me to see if 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.740
 you put 10 I give them back 11 if 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.810
 you want more you have no option no 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.020
 can choose that option that option is 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.020
 one and another therefore in how they see to 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.350
 this side is determined by a third party 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.360
 in this case the bank and then notice 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.210
 the account we had made agreed 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.220
 in the account unifies initial capital by 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.940
 one plus the interest rate equals 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:20.580
 final capital 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:22.919
 this account of 10 thousand for 10 10 11 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.569
 what happens if we change the intern a little 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.270
 of this equation and look 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:31.419
 what did I do, clear the capital 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.619
 initial pass this term multiplying 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.619
 here he spent it from housing 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:41.239
 so now I have a question 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:43.189
 different which is initial capital but 

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:44.870
 The bank tells me I'm going to 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:49.210
 give 11 thousand 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.210
 and here I am going to alter the process 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.760
 and this interest rate is what I 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.770
 I call the requisite rate that I look for 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.740
 for an investment let's make a 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.520
 simple calculation let's assume that the 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.710
 bank offers 10% and I to invest it 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.620
 I require 10% therefore the number is the same 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.910
 then as calculation the initial capital 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.710
 or the present value if the present value 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.860
 of the investment that the bank offers us 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.560
 look 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:26.940
 when he offers me the van with him 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:30.010
 / 1 plus the interest rate I will 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.650
 I request the investment in this case 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:36.600
 like the same one that she offers us 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:38.700
 bank then reached the same value 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.820
 and now let's see different examples 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.009
 because because if the bank offers me 11 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.639
 thousand 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:50.320
 and I to be willing to make a 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:53.920
 investment term deposit van 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.520
 it requires a higher rate for example 12% 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.699
 already this value is not going to give good 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.759
 a lower value and let's see how that 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:07.360
 we use it to make decisions of 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:12.849
 investment then with this formula that 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:15.180
 is the future fund flow divided the 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:18.460
 interest rate requested the 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.849
 investments I have the present value 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.889
 of an investment and the present value is 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:26.800
 a concept that will not be used 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:29.340
 very much from now on in the 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.340
 course
