00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
around do all four as a stacking slow
debuff<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.250> they<00:01:59.369> don't<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
debuff so that they don't get to the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.319 
debuff so that they don't get to the
raid<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.640> ahead<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.909> shackle<00:02:03.210> them

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
raid so and go ahead and shackle them

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.770 
raid so and go ahead and shackle them
whenever<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:04.790> if<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.360> get<00:02:06.630> into

whenever that's up if they do get into
the<00:02:06.990> raid<00:02:07.459> maybe<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.879> few<00:02:09.479> won't<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> huge

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the raid maybe a few won't be a huge

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.470 
the raid maybe a few won't be a huge
problem<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:11.069> you're<00:02:11.250> some<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.150> somewhat

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
problem if you're some to somewhat

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.839 
problem if you're some to somewhat
towards<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> end

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
towards the end

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.800 
towards the end
you'll<00:02:14.849> be<00:02:14.970> able<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.239> heal<00:02:15.420> through<00:02:15.690> it

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
you'll be able to heal through it

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.600 
you'll be able to heal through it
however<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.440> there<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.739> few<00:02:17.040> into<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> raid

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
however if there are few into the raid

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.369 
however if there are few into the raid
you're<00:02:18.239> probably<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.659> to<00:02:18.720> wipe<00:02:18.900> because

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
you're probably going to wipe because

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.170 
you're probably going to wipe because
the<00:02:19.980> only<00:02:20.190> things<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.849> kill<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the only things that can kill the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.059 
the only things that can kill the
shadowy<00:02:21.450> constructs<00:02:21.989> are<00:02:22.200> people<00:02:22.950> who<00:02:23.040> have

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
shadowy constructs are people who have

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.550 
shadowy constructs are people who have
died<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.489> turned<00:02:23.700> into<00:02:23.819> spirits<00:02:24.349> if<00:02:25.349> you've

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
died and turned into spirits if you've

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.720 
died and turned into spirits if you've
already<00:02:25.799> killed<00:02:25.980> your<00:02:26.220> spirits<00:02:26.549> it's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
already killed your spirits it's

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.880 
already killed your spirits it's
probably<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.090> wise<00:02:27.360> idea<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.810> go<00:02:28.019> back<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.590> help

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
probably a wise idea to go back and help

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.440 
probably a wise idea to go back and help
other<00:02:29.220> people<00:02:29.549> with<00:02:29.640> their<00:02:29.790> spirits<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.329> make

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
other people with their spirits to make

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.930 
other people with their spirits to make
this<00:02:30.569> possible<00:02:30.810> bit<00:02:31.110> easier<00:02:31.760> it's<00:02:32.760> it

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
this possible bit easier it's it

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.030 
this possible bit easier it's it
basically<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.540> DPS<00:02:34.019> race<00:02:34.260> there's<00:02:34.829> a<00:02:34.890> lot<00:02:35.010> of

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
basically a DPS race there's a lot of

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.240 
basically a DPS race there's a lot of
heat<00:02:35.280> rate<00:02:35.730> healing<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:37.250> there's

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
heat rate healing going on there's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.330 
heat rate healing going on there's
incinerate<00:02:39.120> which<00:02:39.480> hits<00:02:40.110> for<00:02:40.379> about<00:02:40.560> 3.6<00:02:41.099> k

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
incinerate which hits for about 3.6 k

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.259 
incinerate which hits for about 3.6 k
and<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.849> ticks<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:43.310> 3.6<00:02:44.310> k<00:02:44.610> afterwards

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
and then it ticks for 3.6 k afterwards

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.880 
and then it ticks for 3.6 k afterwards
every<00:02:45.540> second<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.170> needs<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.769> be

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
every second so that needs to be

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.520 
every second so that needs to be
cleansed<00:02:47.190> immediately<00:02:48.049> it's<00:02:49.049> very<00:02:49.170> easy<00:02:49.379> for

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
cleansed immediately it's very easy for

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.559 
cleansed immediately it's very easy for
somebody<00:02:49.829> with<00:02:50.099> shadow<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.970> death<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.450> die

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
somebody with shadow of death to die

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.940 
somebody with shadow of death to die
from<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:52.099> so<00:02:54.410> well<00:02:55.410> there's<00:02:55.650> also<00:02:55.799> a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
from this so well there's also a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.360 
from this so well there's also a
stacking<00:02:56.609> shadow<00:02:56.940> debuff<00:02:57.390> need<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.810> make<00:02:57.959> sure

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
stacking shadow debuff need to make sure

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.130 
stacking shadow debuff need to make sure
that<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.519> keep<00:02:59.700> everybody<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> raid<00:03:00.720> as

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
that you keep everybody in the raid as

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.190 
that you keep everybody in the raid as
high<00:03:01.440> health<00:03:01.739> as<00:03:01.950> possible<00:03:03.170> we<00:03:04.170> killed<00:03:04.440> him

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
high health as possible we killed him

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.000 
high health as possible we killed him

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
like I did right there immediately

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.830 
like I did right there immediately
afterwards<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:32.129> tab<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:33.180> Lance<00:03:33.510> them

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
afterwards you tab and you Lance them

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.300 
afterwards you tab and you Lance them
with<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.230> three<00:03:34.440> button<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.040> can<00:03:35.160> see

Lance<00:03:39.120> actually<00:03:39.629> has<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:41.090> slowing<00:03:42.090> debuff<00:03:42.780> that

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
Lance actually has a slowing debuff that

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.500 
Lance actually has a slowing debuff that
is<00:03:43.319> stackable<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.160> what<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.400> do<00:03:44.639> is<00:03:44.669> you<00:03:45.150> press

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
is stackable so what you do is you press

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.470 
is stackable so what you do is you press
for<00:03:45.840> four<00:03:46.169> shackle<00:03:46.609> then<00:03:47.609> immediately

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
for four shackle then immediately

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.420 
for four shackle then immediately
afterwards<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.530> would<00:03:49.739> switch<00:03:50.160> to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
afterwards you would switch to

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.309 
afterwards you would switch to
individual<00:03:50.819> visual<00:03:51.150> targets<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.750> just<00:03:52.199> go
