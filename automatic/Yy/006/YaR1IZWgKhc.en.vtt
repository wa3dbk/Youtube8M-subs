my specialty is crash testing in the lab
eight<00:00:10.429> years<00:00:10.700> ago<00:00:10.849> me<00:00:11.119> my<00:00:11.329> father<00:00:11.539> was<00:00:11.780> in<00:00:11.929> a

road so it was around 70 kph so but and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.189 
road so it was around 70 kph so but and
that's<00:00:22.550> why<00:00:22.820> I<00:00:22.849> wanted<00:00:23.269> to<00:00:23.330> do<00:00:23.509> this<00:00:23.720> because<00:00:23.929> I

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
want to help people we will have two

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.109 
want to help people we will have two
cars<00:00:26.660> on<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.169> wire<00:00:27.380> that<00:00:28.009> pulls<00:00:28.880> them

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
cars on the wire that pulls them

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.270 
cars on the wire that pulls them
together<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:29.919> 60<00:00:30.919> kph<00:00:31.240> so<00:00:32.240> when<00:00:32.480> we<00:00:33.070> in<00:00:34.070> the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
together and 60 kph so when we in the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.540 
together and 60 kph so when we in the
impact<00:00:34.670> we<00:00:34.850> have<00:00:35.260> 120<00:00:36.260> kph<00:00:37.150> together<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:39.550> yeah

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
impact we have 120 kph together and yeah

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.130 
impact we have 120 kph together and yeah
we<00:00:40.820> have<00:00:40.850> all<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.210> dummies<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:41.750> everything

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
we have all the dummies and everything

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.730 
we have all the dummies and everything
so<00:00:42.320> we<00:00:42.410> get<00:00:42.590> a<00:00:42.620> lot<00:00:42.950> of<00:00:42.980> data<00:00:43.250> out<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:44.300> I<00:00:44.390> look

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
so we get a lot of data out of it I look

00:00:44.740 --> 00:01:04.460 
so we get a lot of data out of it I look
so<00:00:45.740> there<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.520> car<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:46.910> behaving<00:00:47.630> correct

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.420 

you

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.330 

well<00:01:14.390> Lisa<00:01:14.570> we've<00:01:14.810> seen<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.170> crash<00:01:15.410> you're

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
well Lisa we've seen the crash you're

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.890 
well Lisa we've seen the crash you're
not<00:01:16.520> doing<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:16.820> analysis<00:01:17.270> what<00:01:17.780> are<00:01:17.840> you

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
not doing the analysis what are you

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.940 
not doing the analysis what are you
looking<00:01:18.170> for

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
looking for

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.480 
looking for
at<00:01:19.280> first<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.910> see<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.540> speed<00:01:21.110> how<00:01:21.590> how<00:01:22.040> fast

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
at first I see the speed how how fast

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.550 
at first I see the speed how how fast
the<00:01:22.670> car<00:01:22.910> went<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.540> then<00:01:23.840> I'm<00:01:24.140> looking

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
the car went and then I'm looking

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.320 
the car went and then I'm looking
through<00:01:24.890> my<00:01:24.980> checklist<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.850> have<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.060> checklist

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
through my checklist I have a checklist

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.530 
through my checklist I have a checklist
on<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.960> lot<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.500> pages<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.670> then<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:28.880> go<00:01:29.270> through

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
on a lot of pages and then I go through

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.930 
on a lot of pages and then I go through
the<00:01:29.720> car<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.200> see<00:01:30.410> how<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.100> dummy<00:01:31.430> impact

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
the car and see how the dummy impact

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.050 
the car and see how the dummy impact
with<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.300> airbags<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.230> I<00:01:33.320> see<00:01:33.530> how<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.820> car

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
with the airbags and I see how the car

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.330 
with the airbags and I see how the car
is<00:01:35.090> deformed<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.260> just<00:01:36.560> take<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.770> quick<00:01:37.100> look

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
is deformed and just take a quick look

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.420 
is deformed and just take a quick look
over<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.000> it's<00:01:38.180> everything<00:01:38.600> it's<00:01:38.870> okay<00:01:39.530> and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
over so it's everything it's okay and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.730 
over so it's everything it's okay and
then<00:01:40.940> after<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:41.360> we<00:01:41.630> are<00:01:41.660> getting<00:01:42.470> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
then after that we are getting the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.620 
then after that we are getting the
movies<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.400> films<00:01:43.760> so<00:01:44.030> we<00:01:44.150> can<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.510> high

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
movies the films so we can the high

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.500 
movies the films so we can the high
speed<00:01:44.870> films<00:01:45.230> and<00:01:45.590> see<00:01:46.370> what<00:01:46.790> really<00:01:47.000> happened

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
speed films and see what really happened

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.790 
speed films and see what really happened
during<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.870> crash<00:01:48.080> because<00:01:48.320> it's<00:01:48.620> going

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
during the crash because it's going

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.360 
during the crash because it's going
pretty<00:01:49.070> fast<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.210> then<00:01:50.990> we<00:01:51.770> look<00:01:51.950> at<00:01:52.100> the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
pretty fast and then we look at the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.930 
pretty fast and then we look at the
dummy<00:01:53.270> in<00:01:53.630> your<00:01:53.840> values<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:55.160> we<00:01:55.280> get<00:01:55.430> out<00:01:55.670> of

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
dummy in your values that we get out of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.600 
dummy in your values that we get out of
the<00:01:56.060> data<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.690> then<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:58.010> I<00:01:58.040> will<00:01:58.250> do<00:01:58.370> later

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
the data and then that I will do later

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.300 
the data and then that I will do later
today<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.150> tomorrow<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.840> analyze<00:02:00.350> them<00:02:00.590> just

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
today and tomorrow and analyze them just

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.950 
today and tomorrow and analyze them just
looking<00:02:01.610> at<00:02:01.730> it<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.030> car<00:02:02.240> seems<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.720> have<00:02:02.840> come

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
looking at it the car seems to have come

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.840 
looking at it the car seems to have come
out<00:02:03.140> of<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.380> impact<00:02:03.860> extraordinarily<00:02:04.430> well

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
out of the impact extraordinarily well

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.030 
out of the impact extraordinarily well
you<00:02:05.000> can<00:02:05.150> open<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:05.660> close<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:06.140> doors<00:02:06.380> so

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
you can open and close the doors so

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.980 
you can open and close the doors so
presumably<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:08.149> passengers<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.960> driver

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
presumably the passengers and the driver

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.870 
presumably the passengers and the driver
would<00:02:09.740> have<00:02:09.770> been<00:02:10.010> pretty<00:02:10.369> alright<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:10.790> a

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
would have been pretty alright in a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.790 
would have been pretty alright in a
crash<00:02:11.060> like<00:02:11.270> this<00:02:11.420> despite<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.140> speed<00:02:12.350> yeah

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
crash like this despite the speed yeah

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.980 
crash like this despite the speed yeah
yeah<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.250> will<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.670> that's<00:02:14.150> what<00:02:14.300> we<00:02:14.600> see<00:02:14.780> we

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
yeah it will and that's what we see we

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.490 
yeah it will and that's what we see we
see<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.350> safety<00:02:16.190> cage<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.210> where<00:02:17.930> the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
see the safety cage that is where the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.100 
see the safety cage that is where the
dummy<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.670> compartment<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.540> everything

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
dummy is the compartment and everything
