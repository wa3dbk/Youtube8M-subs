from Roger sears a rodgers here ten

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.569 
from Roger sears a rodgers here ten
years<00:00:43.059> after<00:00:43.860> Roger<00:00:44.860> began<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.399> program

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
years after Roger began the program

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.479 
years after Roger began the program
during<00:00:46.510> Ben's<00:00:46.899> era<00:00:47.320> I<00:00:47.649> think<00:00:47.950> he<00:00:48.130> brought<00:00:48.340> it

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
during Ben's era I think he brought it

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.729 
during Ben's era I think he brought it
back<00:00:48.640> down<00:00:48.880> to<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.090> working<00:00:49.540> level<00:00:49.719> and<00:00:50.020> had

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
back down to the working level and had

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.100 
back down to the working level and had
it<00:00:50.890> developed<00:00:51.579> like<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.180> slander<00:00:52.690> you<00:00:53.020> know

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
it developed like the slander you know

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.940 
it developed like the slander you know
standard<00:00:53.800> presentations<00:00:55.739> working<00:00:56.739> with<00:00:56.890> the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
standard presentations working with the

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.010 
standard presentations working with the
safety<00:00:57.190> councils<00:00:57.760> making<00:00:58.090> sure<00:00:58.239> got<00:00:58.660> into<00:00:58.930> the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
safety councils making sure got into the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.529 
safety councils making sure got into the
provinces<00:00:59.620> so<00:01:00.129> I<00:01:00.160> think<00:01:00.250> Ben<00:01:00.550> Ben<00:01:00.969> zero<00:01:01.239> was

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
provinces so I think Ben Ben zero was

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.350 
provinces so I think Ben Ben zero was
really<00:01:01.870> basically<00:01:02.670> getting<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:03.879> out<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.269> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
really basically getting it out to the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.639 
really basically getting it out to the
public<00:01:04.570> out<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.110> people<00:01:05.469> and

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
public out to the people and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.940 
public out to the people and
diversifying<00:01:06.549> it<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.000> I'd<00:01:07.570> say<00:01:07.600> when<00:01:08.409> with

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
diversifying it and I'd say when with

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.700 
diversifying it and I'd say when with
Dan's<00:01:09.310> era<00:01:09.790> which<00:01:10.150> is<00:01:10.360> still<00:01:10.960> ongoing<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.500> think

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
Dan's era which is still ongoing I think

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.740 
Dan's era which is still ongoing I think
he<00:01:11.770> brought<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.130> new<00:01:12.280> technologies<00:01:13.030> into<00:01:13.420> and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
he brought the new technologies into and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.899 
he brought the new technologies into and
to<00:01:13.930> focus<00:01:14.110> into<00:01:14.619> place<00:01:14.860> I<00:01:15.159> brought<00:01:15.670> some<00:01:15.880> new

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
to focus into place I brought some new

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.300 
to focus into place I brought some new
ideas<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.720> program<00:01:17.140> with<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.530> guidance

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
ideas to the program with the guidance

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.780 
ideas to the program with the guidance
of<00:01:18.490> Ben<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.909> I<00:01:19.180> think<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:20.520> together<00:01:21.520> with

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
of Ben and I think that together with

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.270 
of Ben and I think that together with
his<00:01:22.000> with<00:01:22.570> his<00:01:22.750> support<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.799> support<00:01:23.950> of

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
his with his support and the support of

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.620
