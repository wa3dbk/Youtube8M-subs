00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.780
 so a very important point on 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.890
 exterior door frames 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.210
 so the windows then the windows there 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.059
 there are many things to see so 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.980
 there is an insulation part a part in 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.859
 thermal and a sealing part at 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.410
 the air then in terms of insulation 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.500
 so we will find for a good 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 window well sorry we will find already 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.340
 firstly triple glazing so good 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.349
 I have a hard time seeing video but we have 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.350
 a certain thickness of glazing we have 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.120
 three triple glazing 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.719
 secondly the window frame which 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.790
 must be well isolated so here it is a 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.610
 wooden frame with insulation 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.899
 inside and finally it's a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.780
 wood window him but we see that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.520
 aluminum that is not well insulated 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.309
 is not an insulation this is found 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.850
 than outside so aluminum him there 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.370
 only serves for aesthetics 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.760
 so that's the part really 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 insulation so built and is triple 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.020
 glazing so we find the wood 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.729
 with 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.700
 the minimum but only 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.380
 the outside then the other point there 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.560
 is thermal bridges so this 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.829
 what we see is that the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.000
 the recess in the side wall 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.530
 interior will be covered side 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.049
 outside by insulation by 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:35.049
 the outside so here there is a 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.729
 a thickness see the on 5 and 6 cm 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.920
 so behind the credit there is a 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.989
 thickness of wood wool that comes 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.729
 covering the frame of the window which 

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:45.060
 avoids the need to avoid the bridge 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:50.409
 thermal duo window frame 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.450
 finally third point we will find the 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.640
 airtightness problems so 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.959
 so here so it's a little bit of the same 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.969
 color than wood but in fact we have a 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:06.099
 seal which is especially the turn of the mount of 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:10.269
 the rubber window we find a 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:15.870
 other here June on the same outside 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:20.430
 for all around the window and finally 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.310
 so all or all around and finally 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.859
 so we also see that window one 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.319
 shape that prevents easy and prevents 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.519
 seem to flow easily 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.920
 so that's it it's for 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.980
 airtightness so a last 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.690
 point that may be important for for 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.799
 insulation 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.190
 so we see these shutter boxes 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.109
 so the shutter boxes are 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.170
 often very bad for cons 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:49.290
 thermal so here 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.599
 we opted for shutters with blades 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.440
 orientable in fact there is a discomfort 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.760
 to fit in so what makes you have 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.680
 anyway eh 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:06.140
 - 2 - 2 thermal bridges duo fly so 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.140
 this is the case for the outer door frames
