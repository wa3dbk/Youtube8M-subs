does have built-in speakers you do have

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.959 
does have built-in speakers you do have
a<00:01:38.329> line<00:01:38.599> in<00:01:38.840> right<00:01:39.469> there<00:01:40.279> right<00:01:40.670> next<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:40.939> it

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
a line in right there right next to it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.879 
a line in right there right next to it
over<00:01:41.179> here<00:01:41.329> you'd<00:01:41.450> have<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.599> DVI<00:01:42.020> port<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:42.619> then

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:42.889 
over here you'd have a DVI port and then

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.889 
over here you'd have a DVI port and then
finally<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.520> most<00:01:44.029> popular<00:01:44.509> probably<00:01:44.779> going
