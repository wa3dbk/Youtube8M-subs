 five packs at 50 miles 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.750
 I just wanted to do before opening 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.800
 the pages of friends a little intro for 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.790
 talk to you a little bit about this finale 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.660
 league champions what I thought 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.100
 my impressions 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.270
 my feeling after this final you 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.040
 know i'm a supporter of juventus 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.079
 is unfortunately the juventus lost 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.780
 first small parenthesis the video by 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.280
 yesterday's opening thank you enormously 8500 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.840
 I have master if tomorrow we may have 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.910
 ten thousand I do not know you're 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 Thanks for the family, you manage yourself 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.750
 will I honestly ask for 7500 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 I like in the video I laugh a little 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.079
 little and I had more you are you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.940
 are really the best friends 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.500
 so that's it now we have 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.400
 talked about that I thank you I got you 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.420
 about this league final 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.610
 champions what did I think 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 friends but to taste it is a very very 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.270
 good match a very nice final 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.130
 honestly I was a little disappointed logically 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.659
 I wanted the juventus 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.470
 they win and inevitably I find 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.110
 that there was room to win 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.180
 honestly we would not have had to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 take this goal to anchor if we had known 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.049
 keep the score early sion had 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.420
 not taken an entrance goal there would have 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.070
 certainly had another scenario 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.390
 after with if we redo the world 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.369
 by the way with them if we redo the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 world that fits well after the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.390
 what I'm going to say because we quote 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.040
 equalized and age sing that here is 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.659
 was starting to be good we were starting to 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.030
 have actions started in the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.860
 match and so on and there was a penalty 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.450
 not whistled on fox down for me in the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.700
 surface pogba there is penalty 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.619
 with if we redo the world but if 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.149
 a penalty logically they saw 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.799
 that we mark it at 2 1 it's not the same 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.200
 thing because an attack against more 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.729
 later the barça put the second goal 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.890
 then obviously we tried to 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.230
 push and we take a goal against 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.760
 attack like they had put in bayern 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.700
 in last-minute attack 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.290
 the barça he omits 1,3 at the end brief not 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.060
 for rage and that I told you friends 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.670
 honestly I think there was the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.470
 place now the barca must confess 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.600
 that it's the best team in 2015 it 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 deserves to be a champion and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.290
 I was happy finally I was and that I 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.570
 watched them celebrate their title 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.950
 honestly ben I could cape hobbies 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.570
 the wages could only congratulate I 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.890
 nothing to say he's super good they have 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.870
 makes a very good match again 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.130
 today there is nothing to say there 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.220
 I think they were still a 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.780
 little bit lower than the barça now 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.090
 on a match everything could play there 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.470
 had the place she I told you 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.970
 but here it is with if we redo the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.770
 world we will not redo the final of 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.960
 friends the barca won it and that's 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.730
 well deserved there and nothing to say 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.170
 on it be it on the match because 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.060
 that on the match they do not want it 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.800
 final is clearly he does not swallow or 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.420
 on the whole season the barca 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.370
 I congratulate them I'm disgusted 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.340
 obviously for the cheek but the addition the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.530
 yuv and to the fact a beautiful season 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.180
 league 1 lydia the dias and that's for the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.180
 barca that is the triple blow they 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.410
 will still have full title to play 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.480
 london during summer at the end of summer 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.280
 there will be the european supercup 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.570
 supercoup of spain and so on 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.520
 in December and the world championship 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.510
 clubs short I honestly hope me 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.430
 I like the barça so I hope 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.350
 that they will all win like that it's 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.150
 a historic season for the club but 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.770
 in any case the juve who made a 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.090
 terrific season series ya cup 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.800
 of Italy champions league final 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.880
 the gains it was unexpected a time we 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.320
 look at both teams barcelona 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.300
 juventus obviously we were there 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.280
 outsiders and we made a nice final 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.200
 I'm proud of my team and I 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.370
 congratulate barça friends here we have 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.600

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.120

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.100

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.810
 the clothes we will go to the opening 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.730
 packs to 50000 so the theme m 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.620
 it's rakitic unfortunately they have 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.120
 not yet updated the game it's a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.560
 hour and three minutes that are not 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.510
 still updated the trick it 's not 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.980
 still displayed here from the bottom right 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.570
 while on twitter they come from 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.340
 put the message like what a kitsch 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.260
 was well in the footsteps that he was 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.490
 available from 1am the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.840
 stroke 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.340
 they just put something 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.670
 like what is available from 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.920
 now 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.810
 So I would not want it to cost 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.950
 1000 the only way to find out if rakitic 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.630
 it's really in the parks that's the 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.550
 chopper because because I do not see 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.959

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.930

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.190

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.660
 really not famous friends short 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.160
 it was mostly to talk to you about the 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.940
 juventus for the coy too who was 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.800
 also not a long time 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.320
 good too bad it was an opportunity to 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.520
 talk about juventus that's it 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.290

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.610

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.330

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.710

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.610
