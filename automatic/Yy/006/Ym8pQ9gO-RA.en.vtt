00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.310
 but as you speak videos this does not 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:31.289
 is that I do not respect you'm the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.480
 people are going to record a video today because 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.020
 People are going to talk about that thing 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.059
 people kind of doubt the place you 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.790
 The way you move and the way you look 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.579
 You say this happens to a lot of people. 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.010
 with many other people also type 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 jet turned kind of me for example me 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 I was in the place or I live in 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.180
 itaera 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:58.820
 The episode that the guy's been fucking 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.710
 You picture with a place I live 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:08.689
 that has to do with the clothes I'm in 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.689
 The place that I live here was you have to 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.799
 follow the pattern people to a place that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.759
 you have to follow the pattern of that 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.700
 place 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.310
 so those that are not so well has 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.170
 a niche that we own is gone 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.040
 depending on the person now the other 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.040
 I find it strange 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.450
 you are 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.970
 follow-up pattern woman with siblings 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.829
 a classic example of that I think 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.710
 hawaiian type 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.479
 if you use 19 years in a city center 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.100
 type are you with jeans and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.470
 Mayana you are stylish that ever 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.149
 now if you are with an avaianos in the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.189
 and you are on the periphery or if you 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.380
 usa pretend big here in my neighborhood 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.329
 is a spoon drag program with 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.640
 money and you do not take a bath now is 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.439
 In our center you are superstitious and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.030
 blame the old middle so our right 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.830
 one thing that I think happens straight 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.750
 me too and I think that's what some 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.350
 people for example everywhere I say 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.660
 I'm a Corinthian person who doubts I 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.390
 I'm forming as I just did to self 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.100
 I'm dinosaur I was agile, you all. 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.710
 so that way you can get the focus 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:50.650
 we notice that I am a Corinthian who 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:53.200
 It needs to be revealed in the kingdom ahead. 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.920
 A lot of people also live on the farm. 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.510
 only that he does not say that he lives here and 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.510
 that point has left 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:14.980
 without wanting to know the end disk where 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:20.170
 people lived I said this and when you 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:27.310
 will personally be nine more days of 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.540
 death though below because you count 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.470
 Where do you live 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:37.480
 shame where you were born in the assembly 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.370
 It has nothing to do with sunshine in some 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.120
 services is not that you would see them 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.700
 form the western zone at risk 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.070
 I do not deliver until I've played 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.079
 I called to order a deal you 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:55.660
 not this neighborhood I give because the 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.340
 problem that has more than one 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.030
 buy although you do not know anyone to 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.600
 sing honey had access that will have a 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.880
 single bullet lost in a style that 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.680
 You kind of agreed, I can not talk. 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.220
 once a place because in front of 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.220
 all 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:25.320
 But if you stop to think, mine has to 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.550
 get out of here working downtown in 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.550
 thing 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.770
 self - criticism of the person as if there 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:38.639
 You take care of yourself , do you live here? 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:40.030
 If you live there then in practice it's cool. 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.370
 much better 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.360
 I think that was the message that people 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.610
 is alone 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:58.150
 It's for you who are proud to live 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:05:02.699
 Where do you live in an ae? 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.699
 It's only for me to get taller today.
