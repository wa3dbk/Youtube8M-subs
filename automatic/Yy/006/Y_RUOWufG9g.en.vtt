00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
right hand is an octave up how easy is

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.540 
right hand is an octave up how easy is
that<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:17.440> don't<00:01:17.710> have<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.890> let<00:01:18.009> your<00:01:18.220> pages

of song it to learn one page and then

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.650 
of song it to learn one page and then
you<00:01:20.830> just<00:01:21.009> move<00:01:21.160> up<00:01:21.310> an<00:01:21.670> octave<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.300> second

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
you just move up an octave to the second

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.609 
you just move up an octave to the second
page<00:01:23.940> secrets<00:01:24.960> videos<00:01:25.960> are<00:01:26.140> awesome<00:01:26.320> like

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
page secrets videos are awesome like

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.109 
page secrets videos are awesome like
that<00:01:26.679> I<00:01:27.220> love<00:01:27.729> it

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
that I love it

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.900 
that I love it
so<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.320> first<00:01:29.530> line<00:01:29.740> is<00:01:29.950> just<00:01:30.220> invitation

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
so the first line is just invitation

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.940 
so the first line is just invitation
you'll<00:01:31.119> get<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:32.110> second<00:01:32.470> line<00:01:32.619> gives

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
you'll get that the second line gives

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.030 
you'll get that the second line gives
you<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.100> little<00:01:33.310> left<00:01:33.520> hand

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.250 

so<00:01:39.520> again<00:01:39.760> it's<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.210> little<00:01:40.330> X<00:01:40.630> between<00:01:40.960> the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
so again it's a little X between the

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.840 
so again it's a little X between the
skips<00:01:41.560> if<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:41.830> need<00:01:41.980> to<00:01:42.160> if<00:01:42.340> it's<00:01:42.520> not<00:01:42.700> working

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
skips if you need to if it's not working

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.930 
skips if you need to if it's not working

out but you should end up on D at the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.040 
out but you should end up on D at the
end<00:01:46.090> of<00:01:46.150> that<00:01:48.090> skip<00:01:49.090> down

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.980 

that<00:01:53.050> little<00:01:53.910> that<00:01:54.910> little<00:01:54.970> phrase<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.720> ends

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
that little that little phrase it ends

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:04.280
