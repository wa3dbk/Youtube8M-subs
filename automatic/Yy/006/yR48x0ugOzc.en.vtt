tell us a bit me about the Eclipse
itself<00:03:25.900> why<00:03:26.290> is<00:03:26.349> there<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:26.800> much<00:03:26.950> fuss<00:03:27.220> about

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370

2003 there was an eclipse in Antarctica
which<00:03:53.860> of<00:03:54.010> course<00:03:54.040> is<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.370> most<00:03:54.610> difficult

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
which of course is the most difficult

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.490 
which of course is the most difficult

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
place on earth to get to so it's very

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.289 
place on earth to get to so it's very

in this big city this big transport hub
and<00:04:01.299> of<00:04:01.660> course<00:04:01.870> it's<00:04:01.989> worth<00:04:02.110> mentioning<00:04:02.290> that

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and of course it's worth mentioning that

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.710 
and of course it's worth mentioning that
in<00:04:02.620> eclipse<00:04:03.010> also<00:04:03.280> has<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.670> metaphysical<00:04:04.630> a
