completely black so you're going to go
up<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.330> your<00:02:18.450> tools<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.080> select<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> paint

you've done that you need to take that

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.650 
you've done that you need to take that
layer<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:28.860> slide<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.550> down<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.360> back

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
layer and slide it down so it's a back

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
go back to your tools pick the eraser go

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.790 
go back to your tools pick the eraser go
to<00:02:41.580> radius<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.720> put<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.170> at<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.380> white<00:02:43.620> as

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
to radius and put it at the white as

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.240 
to radius and put it at the white as
ready<00:02:44.070> as<00:02:44.160> possible<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.690> now<00:02:45.900> erase

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
ready as possible so you can now erase

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.310 
ready as possible so you can now erase
the<00:02:47.250> bulk<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.640> your<00:02:47.700> background<00:02:48.030> quickly<00:02:48.990> so

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
the bulk of your background quickly so

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.660 
the bulk of your background quickly so
now<00:02:49.470> you're<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.830> start<00:02:50.100> erasing<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
now you're going to start erasing the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.860 
now you're going to start erasing the
bulk<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.970> your<00:02:51.030> background<00:02:53.300> without<00:02:54.300> going

bulk of your background without going

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.050 
bulk of your background without going
too<00:02:55.050> near<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.530> lines<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:56.100> what<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.459> drew<00:02:56.790> and

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
too near the lines of what you drew and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.510 
too near the lines of what you drew and
of<00:02:57.540> course<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.470> more<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.739> filled<00:02:59.130> your<00:02:59.280> page

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
of course the more you filled your page

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.949 
of course the more you filled your page
the<00:02:59.790> less<00:03:00.000> you're<00:03:00.180> going<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.720> erase

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
the less you're going to have to erase

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.240 
the less you're going to have to erase
the<00:03:01.170> less<00:03:01.320> work<00:03:01.530> you're<00:03:01.739> gonna<00:03:01.800> have<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.130> do

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
the less work you're gonna have to do

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.880 
the less work you're gonna have to do
now<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.540> just<00:03:03.690> start<00:03:03.930> erasing<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.500> larger

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
now so you just start erasing the larger

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.640 
now so you just start erasing the larger
areas<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.760> once<00:03:06.030> that's<00:03:06.360> done<00:03:06.780> you're<00:03:07.470> going

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
areas and once that's done you're going

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.340 
areas and once that's done you're going
to<00:03:07.770> slide<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.489> radius<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.450> make<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.870> smaller

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
to slide the radius to make it smaller

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.300 
to slide the radius to make it smaller
on<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.570> on<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.810> eraser<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.440> then<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:14.010> can<00:03:14.160> go

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
on the on the eraser and then you can go

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.150 
on the on the eraser and then you can go
in<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.700> erase<00:03:15.060> more<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.720> details<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
in and erase more of the details the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.460 
in and erase more of the details the
closer<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.610> get<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.060> lines<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.540> drew<00:03:18.870> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
closer you get to the lines you drew the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.960 
closer you get to the lines you drew the
narrower<00:03:19.950> you're<00:03:20.250> going<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.790> make

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
narrower you're going to have to make

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.460 
narrower you're going to have to make
the<00:03:21.120> radius<00:03:21.540> you're<00:03:21.750> probably<00:03:22.019> gonna<00:03:22.260> have<00:03:22.380> to

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the radius you're probably gonna have to

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.130 
the radius you're probably gonna have to
adjust<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.459> radius<00:03:23.790> one<00:03:24.030> more<00:03:24.239> time<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.959> its

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
adjust the radius one more time to its

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.289 
adjust the radius one more time to its
thinnest<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.519> get<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.090> and

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
thinnest so you can get in there and

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.199 
thinnest so you can get in there and
erase<00:03:27.780> all<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.170> details<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.030> way

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
erase all the details and that way

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.620 
erase all the details and that way
you'll<00:03:30.420> maximize<00:03:32.030> you'll<00:03:33.030> do<00:03:33.269> this<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.570> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
you'll maximize you'll do this in the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.820 
you'll maximize you'll do this in the
least<00:03:33.840> amount<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.290> time

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
least amount of time

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.880 
least amount of time
once<00:03:35.700> you've<00:03:35.910> erased<00:03:36.330> all<00:03:36.600> your<00:03:36.630> details<00:03:37.140> at

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
once you've erased all your details at

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.490 
once you've erased all your details at
this<00:03:38.670> point<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.420> can<00:03:39.630> start<00:03:39.780> playing<00:03:40.290> around

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
this point you can start playing around

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.150 
this point you can start playing around
with<00:03:41.030> adding<00:03:42.030> some<00:03:42.330> details<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.470> you're<00:03:43.950> gonna

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
with adding some details so you're gonna

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.500 
with adding some details so you're gonna
want<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.519> switch<00:03:44.930> tools<00:03:46.910> you<00:03:47.910> may<00:03:48.060> want<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.330> add

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
want to switch tools you may want to add

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.630 
want to switch tools you may want to add
another<00:03:48.840> layer<00:03:49.200> when<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:49.890> switch<00:03:50.130> deep<00:03:50.370> when

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
another layer when you switch deep when

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.360 
another layer when you switch deep when
you<00:03:50.730> add<00:03:50.910> details<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.170> I'm<00:03:52.320> picking<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.190> new

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
you add details in so I'm picking a new

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.220 
you add details in so I'm picking a new
layer<00:03:53.610> I'm<00:03:53.850> going<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.150> my<00:03:54.269> pencil<00:03:54.780> tool<00:03:54.989> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
layer I'm going to my pencil tool and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.870 
layer I'm going to my pencil tool and
I'm<00:03:55.650> making<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.250> have<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.489> skinniest

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
I'm making it to have the skinniest

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.030 
I'm making it to have the skinniest
radius<00:03:57.360> possible<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.049> match<00:03:58.200> my<00:03:58.440> pencil<00:03:58.830> lines

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
radius possible to match my pencil lines

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.920 
radius possible to match my pencil lines
and<00:03:59.340> now<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> can<00:04:00.030> go<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.450> start<00:04:00.690> adding

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
and now I can go in and start adding

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.490 
and now I can go in and start adding
faces<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.950> can<00:04:02.790> start<00:04:03.150> adding<00:04:03.450> color<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.110> I'm

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
faces I can start adding color and I'm

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.350 
faces I can start adding color and I'm
actually<00:04:04.680> doing<00:04:05.070> this<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.610> different<00:04:05.880> layer

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
actually doing this in a different layer

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.350 
actually doing this in a different layer
than<00:04:07.080> my<00:04:07.350> original<00:04:07.500> drawing<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.489> if<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.000> mess<00:04:09.209> up

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
than my original drawing so if I mess up

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.759 
than my original drawing so if I mess up
I<00:04:09.480> can<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.810> delete<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.230> layer<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.709> I

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
I can just delete the layer and I

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.000 
I can just delete the layer and I
haven't<00:04:11.190> messed<00:04:11.310> up<00:04:11.489> my<00:04:11.610> original<00:04:12.030> drawing<00:04:13.010> so

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
haven't messed up my original drawing so

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.920 
haven't messed up my original drawing so
here<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.250> am<00:04:14.370> adding<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:15.030> face<00:04:16.910> drawing<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.269> circle

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
here I am adding a face drawing a circle

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.580 
here I am adding a face drawing a circle
and<00:04:19.140> then<00:04:19.260> I'm<00:04:19.380> using<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.900> paint<00:04:22.109> bucket<00:04:22.260> fill

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
and then I'm using the paint bucket fill

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.969 
and then I'm using the paint bucket fill
to<00:04:22.770> add<00:04:22.919> color<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.570> faces<00:04:25.050> just<00:04:25.860> by

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
to add color to the to the faces just by

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.620 
to add color to the to the faces just by
tracing<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.490> shape<00:04:26.729> of<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:26.970> face<00:04:27.210> and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
tracing the shape of the face and

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.590 
tracing the shape of the face and
Paint<00:04:27.780> Bucket<00:04:27.900> filling<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.530> circle<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:30.450> can

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
Paint Bucket filling the circle you can

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.000 
Paint Bucket filling the circle you can
just<00:04:30.840> keep<00:04:30.960> on<00:04:31.200> adding<00:04:31.260> different<00:04:31.830> layers<00:04:32.280> and

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
just keep on adding different layers and

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.440 
just keep on adding different layers and
adding<00:04:35.010> more<00:04:35.160> detail<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:36.030> then<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.300> can

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
adding more detail and then you can

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.230 
adding more detail and then you can
merge<00:04:36.690> those<00:04:36.960> layers<00:04:37.140> later<00:04:37.970> I'm<00:04:38.970> actually

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
merge those layers later I'm actually

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.570 
merge those layers later I'm actually
going<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.690> go<00:04:39.810> into<00:04:40.020> my<00:04:40.230> camera<00:04:40.680> roll<00:04:40.980> now<00:04:41.280> and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
going to go into my camera roll now and

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.990 
going to go into my camera roll now and
in<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.660> new<00:04:42.930> layer<00:04:43.230> I'm<00:04:43.620> going<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:44.250> get<00:04:44.970> a

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
in a new layer I'm going to get a

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.730 
in a new layer I'm going to get a
picture<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:47.390> Finn<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.510> human<00:04:48.690> from<00:04:49.290> adventure

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
words PNG afterwards you'll get these

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.110 
words PNG afterwards you'll get these
portable<00:05:31.890> Network<00:05:32.280> graphics<00:05:32.730> and<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:32.940> nice

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
portable Network graphics and the nice

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.000 
portable Network graphics and the nice
thing<00:05:33.150> about<00:05:33.420> them<00:05:33.870> is<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.260> they<00:05:34.470> don't<00:05:34.800> have

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
thing about them is that they don't have

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.580 
thing about them is that they don't have
backgrounds<00:05:35.700> so<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:36.390> can<00:05:36.900> put<00:05:37.170> them<00:05:37.320> into

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
backgrounds so you can put them into

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.370 
backgrounds so you can put them into
your<00:05:38.240> sketchbook<00:05:39.240> Pro<00:05:39.750> pictures<00:05:40.170> and<00:05:40.320> you

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
your sketchbook Pro pictures and you

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.870 
your sketchbook Pro pictures and you
don't<00:05:40.530> have<00:05:40.590> to<00:05:40.740> worry<00:05:40.980> about<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.340> race<00:05:41.580> in<00:05:41.790> the

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
don't have to worry about a race in the

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.310 
don't have to worry about a race in the
background<00:05:42.390> you're<00:05:42.840> going<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.080> just

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
background you're going to just

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.810 
background you're going to just
transform<00:05:43.890> them<00:05:44.100> adjust<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.550> size<00:05:44.790> and

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
transform them adjust the size and

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.410 
transform them adjust the size and
they'll<00:05:45.180> fit<00:05:45.390> right<00:05:45.420> in

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
they'll fit right in

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.020 
they'll fit right in
the<00:05:48.420> other<00:05:48.570> thing<00:05:48.960> is<00:05:49.260> you<00:05:50.130> can<00:05:50.370> take<00:05:50.610> the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
the other thing is you can take the

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.250 
the other thing is you can take the
layers<00:05:51.300> that<00:05:51.450> you've<00:05:51.720> already<00:05:51.870> done<00:05:52.200> like

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
layers that you've already done like

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.230 
layers that you've already done like
your<00:05:52.650> picture<00:05:53.040> of<00:05:53.100> your<00:05:53.220> crowd<00:05:53.430> of<00:05:53.580> people<00:05:53.760> and

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
your picture of your crowd of people and

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.500 
your picture of your crowd of people and
by<00:05:55.020> hitting<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.560> double<00:05:56.010> plus<00:05:56.310> sign<00:05:56.700> you<00:05:57.060> can

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
by hitting the double plus sign you can

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.930 
by hitting the double plus sign you can
duplicate<00:05:58.470> that<00:05:58.590> layer<00:05:58.770> and<00:05:59.040> then<00:05:59.460> by<00:05:59.670> hitting

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
duplicate that layer and then by hitting

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.640 
duplicate that layer and then by hitting
the<00:06:00.830> transform<00:06:02.300> option<00:06:03.300> at<00:06:03.450> the<00:06:03.570> top<00:06:03.780> you<00:06:04.620> can

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
the transform option at the top you can

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.880 
the transform option at the top you can
take<00:06:05.040> that<00:06:05.250> layer<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.580> you<00:06:06.030> can<00:06:06.960> flip<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.650> so

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
take that layer and you can flip it so

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.440 
take that layer and you can flip it so
it's<00:06:08.040> a<00:06:08.130> mirror<00:06:08.460> image<00:06:08.610> of<00:06:08.880> the<00:06:08.940> original

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
it's a mirror image of the original

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.830 
it's a mirror image of the original
layer<00:06:10.280> then<00:06:11.280> now<00:06:11.910> here's<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.330> transform

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
layer then now here's the transform

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.340 
layer then now here's the transform
button<00:06:13.080> it's<00:06:13.320> just<00:06:13.560> the<00:06:14.270> arrows<00:06:15.270> and<00:06:15.510> once

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
button it's just the arrows and once

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.100 
button it's just the arrows and once
you've<00:06:16.560> flipped<00:06:16.950> it<00:06:17.220> you<00:06:17.460> now<00:06:17.670> have<00:06:18.110> more

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
you've flipped it you now have more

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.550 
you've flipped it you now have more
people<00:06:19.170> in<00:06:19.590> your<00:06:19.740> crowd<00:06:19.950> of<00:06:20.130> people<00:06:20.250> so<00:06:21.560> you've

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
people in your crowd of people so you've

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.910 
people in your crowd of people so you've
now<00:06:22.770> got<00:06:23.070> you've<00:06:23.250> doubled<00:06:23.640> your<00:06:23.700> picture<00:06:24.210> and

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
now got you've doubled your picture and

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.200 
now got you've doubled your picture and
you<00:06:25.920> can<00:06:25.950> add<00:06:26.250> all<00:06:26.430> sorts<00:06:26.460> of<00:06:26.790> cartoon

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
you can add all sorts of cartoon

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.870 
you can add all sorts of cartoon
characters<00:06:27.750> you<00:06:27.990> can<00:06:28.170> add<00:06:28.460> backgrounds<00:06:29.460> you

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
characters you can add backgrounds you

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.610 
characters you can add backgrounds you
can<00:06:29.910> adjust<00:06:30.540> what<00:06:30.750> goes<00:06:30.960> in<00:06:31.140> front<00:06:31.380> of<00:06:31.470> what

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
can adjust what goes in front of what

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.800 
can adjust what goes in front of what
goes<00:06:31.800> in<00:06:31.950> back<00:06:32.100> by<00:06:32.340> sliding<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:32.970> layers<00:06:33.210> so

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
goes in back by sliding the layers so

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.780 
goes in back by sliding the layers so
it's<00:06:33.930> a<00:06:33.990> good<00:06:34.140> idea<00:06:34.410> to<00:06:34.500> go<00:06:34.680> to<00:06:34.710> Google<00:06:35.310> and<00:06:35.490> put

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
it's a good idea to go to Google and put

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.580 
it's a good idea to go to Google and put
into<00:06:35.940> your<00:06:36.240> camera<00:06:36.960> roll<00:06:37.169> all<00:06:37.500> sorts<00:06:38.490> of<00:06:38.729> these

picture<00:07:06.430> that<00:07:06.730> I<00:07:06.760> did<00:07:07.150> using<00:07:07.600> this<00:07:07.720> crowd<00:07:08.020> of

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
picture that I did using this crowd of

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.980 
picture that I did using this crowd of
people<00:07:08.610> flipping<00:07:09.610> it<00:07:09.940> duplicating<00:07:10.840> it

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
people flipping it duplicating it

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.860 
people flipping it duplicating it
transforming<00:07:11.890> it<00:07:12.070> making<00:07:12.850> it<00:07:12.970> smaller<00:07:13.390> making

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
transforming it making it smaller making

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.810 
transforming it making it smaller making
the<00:07:14.140> layers<00:07:14.380> that<00:07:14.650> are<00:07:14.710> smaller<00:07:15.130> and<00:07:15.370> back<00:07:15.550> of

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.820 
the layers that are smaller and back of

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.570 
the layers that are smaller and back of
the<00:07:16.450> the<00:07:17.020> layers<00:07:17.230> that<00:07:17.530> are<00:07:17.590> larger<00:07:18.130> so<00:07:18.160> they

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
the the layers that are larger so they

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.950 
the the layers that are larger so they
look<00:07:18.760> like<00:07:18.790> they're<00:07:19.000> overlapping<00:07:19.540> so<00:07:19.900> it

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
look like they're overlapping so it

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.840 
look like they're overlapping so it
looks<00:07:20.080> like<00:07:20.110> a<00:07:20.230> very<00:07:20.380> deep<00:07:20.650> crowd<00:07:21.040> of<00:07:21.220> people<00:07:21.370> I

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:21.850 
looks like a very deep crowd of people I

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.170 
looks like a very deep crowd of people I
put<00:07:22.480> in<00:07:22.600> a<00:07:22.720> sky<00:07:23.110> for<00:07:23.500> a<00:07:23.530> background<00:07:24.190> I<00:07:24.580> use<00:07:25.000> the

put in a sky for a background I use the

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.710 
put in a sky for a background I use the
