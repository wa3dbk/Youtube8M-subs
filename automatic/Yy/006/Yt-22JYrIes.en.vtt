switch works on the handlebars now and
got<00:00:52.320> rid<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.890> was<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> motor

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.810 

the<00:00:56.610> back<00:00:56.789> wheel<00:00:57.440> extended<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.160> tabs<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the back wheel extended the tabs on the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.580 
the back wheel extended the tabs on the
back<00:01:00.090> where<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.390> could<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.780> they've<00:01:01.140> stopped

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
back where you could see they've stopped

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.680 
back where you could see they've stopped
probably<00:01:01.980> about<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.579> right<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
probably about right here right here and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.980 
probably about right here right here and
I<00:01:04.559> welded<00:01:05.189> these<00:01:05.460> tabs<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.600> made<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
I welded these tabs on and I made up a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.330 
I welded these tabs on and I made up a
couple<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> those<00:01:07.409> jack<00:01:07.770> screws<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
couple of those jack screws like a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
couple of those jack screws like a
motorcycle<00:01:08.909> has<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.630> holding<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> rim<00:01:10.110> in

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
motorcycle has for holding the rim in

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
motorcycle has for holding the rim in
place<00:01:10.470> instead<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> relying<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.640> bowl

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
place instead of relying on the bowl

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.870 
place instead of relying on the bowl
itself<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:13.310> at<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.490> point<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> just

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
itself because at one point it just

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.990 
itself because at one point it just
sucked<00:01:15.540> itself<00:01:15.840> forward<00:01:16.580> very<00:01:17.580> violently

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
sucked itself forward very violently

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.609 
sucked itself forward very violently
decided<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.799> yank<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> chain<00:01:20.130> off<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.619> took

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
decided to yank the chain off so took

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.050 
decided to yank the chain off so took
care<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.860> those<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:24.890> course<00:01:25.909> anything<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
care of those of course anything on the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
care of those of course anything on the
other<00:01:27.210> side<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:28.680> tranny<00:01:29.750> was<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:31.200> on

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
other side the tranny was a little on

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.899 
other side the tranny was a little on
the<00:01:31.380> weak<00:01:31.530> side<00:01:32.150> put<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> light<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:34.790> think<00:01:35.790> was

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the weak side put a light on I think was

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
the weak side put a light on I think was
kind<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.150> tweaking<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.630> me<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.189> I

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
kind of tweaking on me a little bit so I

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.950 
kind of tweaking on me a little bit so I
actually<00:01:38.520> ended<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:39.020> adding<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.799> gusset<00:01:41.960> see

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
actually ended up adding that gusset see

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.300 
actually ended up adding that gusset see
right<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:44.659> under<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.810> pulley<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
right in there under this pulley in the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.330 
right in there under this pulley in the
back<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.350> drilled<00:01:49.350> through<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.590> block<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
back I drilled through the block here I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.530 
back I drilled through the block here I
see<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:53.520> added<00:01:53.759> another<00:01:53.970> bolt<00:01:54.360> they're

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the holes are pretty good the chena

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.000 
the holes are pretty good the chena
popped<00:02:24.780> off<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.110> me<00:02:25.230> once<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.739> kind<00:02:25.980> of

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
popped off on me once so I kind of

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.080 
popped off on me once so I kind of
wanted<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.280> make<00:02:26.430> sure<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.940> wasn't

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
wanted to make sure that that wasn't

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.850 
wanted to make sure that that wasn't
going<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.300> happen<00:02:27.390> again<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.989> think<00:02:28.500> what<00:02:28.769> was

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
going to happen again I think what was

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.880 
going to happen again I think what was
happening<00:02:29.220> was<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> energy<00:02:29.790> from<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.890> belt

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
happening was the energy from the belt

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.110 
happening was the energy from the belt
pulling<00:02:32.190> one<00:02:32.310> direction<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.910> chain

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
pulling one direction and the chain

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.280 
pulling one direction and the chain
pulling<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.420> other<00:02:33.569> way<00:02:33.690> was<00:02:33.930> actually<00:02:34.080> a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
pulling the other way was actually a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.070 
pulling the other way was actually a
tweaking<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.160> training<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.549> little<00:02:35.640> bit<00:02:36.080> and

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
tweaking that training a little bit and

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.039 
tweaking that training a little bit and
one<00:02:37.230> other<00:02:37.410> thing<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.739> did<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.870> was<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:39.989> to

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
one other thing I did a I was going to

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.180 
one other thing I did a I was going to
do<00:02:40.110> at<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.230> beginning<00:02:40.319> -<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:40.830> forgot<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
do at the beginning - I just forgot to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.500 
do at the beginning - I just forgot to
do<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:42.110> let's<00:02:43.110> put<00:02:43.319> a<00:02:43.380> piece<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.650> angle

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
do it let's put a piece of angle

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.150 
do it let's put a piece of angle
underneath<00:02:45.510> right<00:02:45.720> across<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.110> bottom<00:02:46.380> just

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
underneath right across the bottom just

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.710 
underneath right across the bottom just
to<00:02:47.280> kind<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.610> stiffen<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:47.970> bottom<00:02:48.360> plate<00:02:48.599> up

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
to kind of stiffen that bottom plate up

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.539 
to kind of stiffen that bottom plate up
from<00:02:49.349> bowing<00:02:49.709> when<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.980> motor<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.250> trying<00:02:50.459> to

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
from bowing when the motor is trying to

hour when it's all the way up you're

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.020 
hour when it's all the way up you're
right<00:03:49.410> around<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.980> little<00:03:50.160> over<00:03:50.370> 40<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.760> took<00:03:50.940> it

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
right around a little over 40 I took it

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.849 
right around a little over 40 I took it
down<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.180> road<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.750> was<00:03:52.170> cruising<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.709> same

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
down the road I was cruising the same

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.710 
down the road I was cruising the same
speed<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.220> cars<00:03:53.430> were<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:53.880> it's<00:03:54.569> kind<00:03:54.690> of

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
speed the cars were and it's kind of

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.690 
speed the cars were and it's kind of
funny<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:54.989> was<00:03:55.019> getting<00:03:55.260> some<00:03:55.380> thumbs<00:03:55.560> up<00:03:55.769> the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
funny I was getting some thumbs up the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.460 
funny I was getting some thumbs up the
motors<00:03:57.030> got<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.329> lot<00:03:57.450> more<00:03:57.480> power<00:03:57.780> yet<00:03:58.109> so<00:03:58.440> I

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
motors got a lot more power yet so I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.170 
motors got a lot more power yet so I
might<00:03:58.829> even<00:03:58.950> try<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.310> go<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> little<00:03:59.670> bit<00:03:59.880> larger

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
might even try to go a little bit larger

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.220 
might even try to go a little bit larger
on<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:01.019> front<00:04:01.200> sprocket<00:04:02.060> it'll<00:04:03.060> probably<00:04:03.269> go

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
on the front sprocket it'll probably go

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.250 
on the front sprocket it'll probably go
right<00:04:04.440> around<00:04:04.530> 50<00:04:05.040> which<00:04:05.639> is<00:04:05.670> me<00:04:06.239> scary<00:04:07.110> on<00:04:07.230> a

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
right around 50 which is me scary on a

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.420 
right around 50 which is me scary on a
bicycle<00:04:07.470> but

especially<00:04:10.430> with<00:04:10.879> what<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.180> has<00:04:11.299> for<00:04:11.329> brakes

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
especially with what it has for brakes

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.679 
especially with what it has for brakes
but<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:12.650> be<00:04:12.829> it
