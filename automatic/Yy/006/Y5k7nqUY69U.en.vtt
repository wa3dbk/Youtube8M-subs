what<00:00:02.250> I<00:00:02.280> have<00:00:02.639> here<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.920> rubber<00:00:04.920> mold<00:00:05.220> I've

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
what I have here is a rubber mold I've

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.100 
what I have here is a rubber mold I've
taken<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.480> an<00:00:06.629> intake<00:00:07.049> port<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> head<00:00:09.110> stock

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
taken of an intake port on a head stock

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.379 
taken of an intake port on a head stock
944<00:00:10.860> 8<00:00:11.040> valve<00:00:11.340> head<00:00:14.089> there's<00:00:15.089> kind<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.269> an

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
944 8 valve head there's kind of an

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.900 
944 8 valve head there's kind of an
interesting<00:00:15.540> process<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.880> know

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
interesting process so I you know

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.130 
interesting process so I you know
cleaned<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.420> really<00:00:18.630> well

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
cleaned it up really well

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.580 
cleaned it up really well
I<00:00:19.220> put<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> valve<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:23.210> you<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.590> tilted

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
I put the valve in and you know tilted

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.380 
I put the valve in and you know tilted
the<00:00:25.769> heads<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:26.880> sitting<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.269> this

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the heads that I was sitting in this

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.700 
the heads that I was sitting in this
orientation<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> top<00:00:28.410> would<00:00:28.590> be

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
orientation so the top would be

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.609 
orientation so the top would be
perfectly<00:00:29.130> flat<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.390> mixed<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.080> two-part

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
perfectly flat and I mixed up a two-part

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.100 
perfectly flat and I mixed up a two-part
silicon<00:00:32.369> rubber<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.180> then<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.450> poured<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.930> in

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
silicon rubber and then I poured it in

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.280 
silicon rubber and then I poured it in
and<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.930> after<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.020> was<00:00:37.110> cured<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:39.290> actually

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and then after it was cured I actually

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.150 
and then after it was cured I actually
used<00:00:41.070> hydraulic<00:00:41.879> press<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.890> pushed<00:00:43.890> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
used hydraulic press and pushed that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.850 
used hydraulic press and pushed that
pushed<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.760> out<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> valve<00:00:46.200> side<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
pushed it out down in the valve side I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.819 
pushed it out down in the valve side I
did<00:00:47.340> tear<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.820> bit<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.570> I'd<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.680> be

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
did tear it a bit so I'd have to be

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.720 
did tear it a bit so I'd have to be
gentle<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:52.340> what<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> looks<00:00:53.550> like

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
gentle with it but what it looks like

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.459 
gentle with it but what it looks like
I'll<00:00:54.059> take<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> valve<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> minute

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
I'll take the valve out for a minute

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:06.450 
I'll take the valve out for a minute
here<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.239> hand

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.330 

yeah<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.790> don't<00:01:08.510> know<00:01:08.780> how<00:01:09.619> much<00:01:09.800> of<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:10.100> will

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
yeah I don't know how much of this will

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.090 
yeah I don't know how much of this will
show<00:01:10.550> up<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.909> video<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:11.840> um<00:01:12.050> you<00:01:12.979> know<00:01:13.010> I

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
show up on the video but um you know I

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.469 
show up on the video but um you know I
can<00:01:13.250> certainly<00:01:13.460> see<00:01:13.909> where<00:01:14.119> there's<00:01:14.270> some

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
can certainly see where there's some

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.290 
can certainly see where there's some
room<00:01:14.690> for<00:01:14.930> improvement<00:01:15.430> from<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.580> good<00:01:16.909> porting

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
room for improvement from a good porting

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.420 
room for improvement from a good porting
and<00:01:17.450> polishing<00:01:17.930> job<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.220> know<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.340> few

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
and polishing job so you know a few

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.950 
and polishing job so you know a few
things<00:01:19.759> I<00:01:19.850> want<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.090> point<00:01:20.270> out<00:01:20.450> first<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.840> all

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
things I want to point out first of all

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.640 
things I want to point out first of all
you<00:01:21.080> see<00:01:21.259> this<00:01:21.729> casting<00:01:22.729> line<00:01:23.320> on<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.530> know

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
you see this casting line on you know

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.940 
you see this casting line on you know
both<00:01:24.860> sides<00:01:24.909> so<00:01:25.909> that's<00:01:26.150> where<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:27.560> casting

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
both sides so that's where the casting

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.370 
both sides so that's where the casting
is<00:01:28.040> kind<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.280> rough<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.909> protruding<00:01:29.570> how<00:01:29.780> into

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
is kind of rough and protruding how into

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.790 
is kind of rough and protruding how into
the<00:01:30.470> wall<00:01:30.710> of<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.509> of<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.659> passageway<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:33.740> you

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
the wall of the of the passageway so you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.170 
the wall of the of the passageway so you
know<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:34.070> made<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.490> negative<00:01:34.910> the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
know it made that negative the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.820 
know it made that negative the
indentation<00:01:35.450> here<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.380> certainly<00:01:36.530> that

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
indentation here and certainly that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.430 
indentation here and certainly that
could<00:01:37.039> be<00:01:37.190> smoothed<00:01:37.670> down<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.270> helped<00:01:38.479> but<00:01:39.350> if

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
could be smoothed down and helped but if

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.469 
could be smoothed down and helped but if
you<00:01:39.530> look<00:01:39.770> down<00:01:41.259> towards<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.440> seat<00:01:42.770> area<00:01:43.479> it's

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
you look down towards the seat area it's

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.359 
you look down towards the seat area it's
um<00:01:44.979> it's<00:01:45.979> pretty<00:01:46.250> smooth<00:01:46.899> around<00:01:47.899> here<00:01:48.619> but

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
um it's pretty smooth around here but

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.300 
um it's pretty smooth around here but
not<00:01:49.550> quite<00:01:50.509> all<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.440> way<00:01:51.470> around<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.950> know<00:01:51.979> so

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
not quite all the way around you know so

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.200 
not quite all the way around you know so
so<00:01:52.580> what<00:01:52.789> how<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:53.570> was<00:01:54.670> created<00:01:55.670> or<00:01:55.789> machined

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
so what how this was created or machined

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.529 
so what how this was created or machined
you<00:01:57.080> know<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.710> hole<00:01:58.670> or<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.000> opening

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
you know that the hole or the opening

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.779 
you know that the hole or the opening
the<00:01:59.659> passageway<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.320> cast<00:02:00.649> into<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.280> head<00:02:01.490> and

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
the passageway is cast into the head and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.820 
the passageway is cast into the head and
then<00:02:02.390> they<00:02:02.539> come<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:03.050> with<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.380> machining

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
then they come in with the machining

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.699 
then they come in with the machining
tool<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.820> they<00:02:04.970> machine<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.360> bore<00:02:05.690> down<00:02:06.319> just

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
tool and they machine a bore down just

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.339 
tool and they machine a bore down just
as<00:02:06.830> far<00:02:07.069> as<00:02:07.220> they<00:02:07.399> need<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:08.000> then<00:02:08.569> put<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.080> seed

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
as far as they need to then put the seed

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.729 
as far as they need to then put the seed
in<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:10.130> if<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.429> can<00:02:10.610> see<00:02:10.849> that<00:02:11.030> transition

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
in so if you can see that transition

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.500 
in so if you can see that transition
from<00:02:12.739> this<00:02:12.980> kind<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.340> smooth<00:02:13.610> part<00:02:13.970> here<00:02:14.330> to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
from this kind of smooth part here to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.690 
from this kind of smooth part here to
the<00:02:14.660> very<00:02:14.900> smooth<00:02:15.319> part<00:02:15.620> right<00:02:15.770> there<00:02:15.830> you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
the very smooth part right there you

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.339 
the very smooth part right there you
know<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.239> steel<00:02:17.510> seat<00:02:17.930> that's

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
know this is the steel seat that's

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.589 
know this is the steel seat that's
pressed<00:02:18.739> into<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.130> aluminum<00:02:19.550> head<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.330> this

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
pressed into the aluminum head and this

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.510 
pressed into the aluminum head and this
is<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> machining<00:02:21.470> area<00:02:21.860> on<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.130> aluminum

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
is the machining area on the aluminum

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.320 
is the machining area on the aluminum
head<00:02:22.760> -<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:25.040> have<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.250> match<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.819> seat

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
head - you have to match the the seat

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.170 
head - you have to match the the seat
diameter<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.800> know<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.340> only<00:02:28.550> comes<00:02:28.880> in

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
diameter but you know it only comes in

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.510 
diameter but you know it only comes in
so<00:02:30.140> far<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:30.739> there's<00:02:30.950> kind<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.160> bottoms

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
so far and then there's kind of bottoms

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.630 
so far and then there's kind of bottoms
out<00:02:31.640> into<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.030> casting<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.800> blending<00:02:34.370> this

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
out into the casting so blending this

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.760 
out into the casting so blending this
blending<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.360> casting<00:02:35.989> into<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.560> would

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
blending the casting into this would

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.309 
blending the casting into this would
probably<00:02:37.250> help<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:38.300> then<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.870> know<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.170> is

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
probably help and then you know this is

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.080 
probably help and then you know this is
where<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.280> part<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.580> hits<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.910> valve

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
where the the part that hits the valve

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.900 
where the the part that hits the valve
obviously<00:02:41.930> if<00:02:42.739> we<00:02:42.890> look<00:02:43.040> at<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.220> top<00:02:43.489> we<00:02:43.760> can

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
obviously if we look at the top we can

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.540 
obviously if we look at the top we can
also<00:02:44.090> see<00:02:44.739> inside<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.920> hole<00:02:46.099> that's<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
also see inside the hole that's the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.990 
also see inside the hole that's the
depression<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.420> valve<00:02:47.629> guide<00:02:48.020> makes

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
depression that the valve guide makes

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.760 
depression that the valve guide makes
you<00:02:50.000> know<00:02:50.150> if<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.750> cut<00:02:50.989> down<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.319> valve<00:02:51.500> guide

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
you know if you cut down the valve guide

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.119 
you know if you cut down the valve guide
or<00:02:52.129> you<00:02:52.760> know<00:02:53.050> machine<00:02:54.050> away<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.650> valve<00:02:54.830> guide

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
or you know machine away the valve guide

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.869 
or you know machine away the valve guide
some<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:56.720> do<00:02:56.870> create<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.170> little<00:02:57.319> bit<00:02:57.440> more

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
some you do create a little bit more

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.640 
some you do create a little bit more
area<00:02:58.879> for<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.629> air<00:02:59.750> passageway<00:03:00.319> to<00:03:00.349> go<00:03:00.590> to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
area for the air passageway to go to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.650 
area for the air passageway to go to
because<00:03:01.190> then<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.430> would<00:03:01.550> be<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.000> valve<00:03:02.180> stem

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
because then it would be the valve stem

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.800 
because then it would be the valve stem
all<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.739> way<00:03:03.890> up<00:03:04.129> but<00:03:05.030> I'm<00:03:05.120> not<00:03:05.239> entirely<00:03:05.629> sure

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
all the way up but I'm not entirely sure

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.190 
all the way up but I'm not entirely sure
that's<00:03:05.989> gonna<00:03:06.379> buy<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:07.370> whole<00:03:07.819> lot<00:03:08.150> if<00:03:09.110> you

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
that's gonna buy you a whole lot if you

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.480 
that's gonna buy you a whole lot if you
do

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
do

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.960 
do
poor<00:03:10.150> teamwork<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:11.740> think<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.520> biggest<00:03:12.730> thing

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
poor teamwork I think the biggest thing

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.910 
poor teamwork I think the biggest thing
people<00:03:13.420> say<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.800> this<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:16.590> tight<00:03:17.590> radius

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
people say is is this this tight radius

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.670 
people say is is this this tight radius
you<00:03:18.370> know<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.610> bottom<00:03:19.000> wall<00:03:19.300> radius<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
you know the bottom wall radius so the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.850 
you know the bottom wall radius so the
air<00:03:20.830> has<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.340> come<00:03:21.640> down<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.060> way<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.810> as<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
air has to come down this way and as the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.640 
air has to come down this way and as the
air<00:03:23.980> goes<00:03:24.310> over<00:03:24.970> this<00:03:25.240> curve<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.350> airs<00:03:26.500> going

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
air goes over this curve the airs going

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.680 
air goes over this curve the airs going
to<00:03:26.740> try<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.920> separate<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.300> gonna<00:03:28.420> create

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
to try to separate so it's gonna create

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.020 
to try to separate so it's gonna create
like<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.870> little<00:03:29.140> vacuum<00:03:29.350> pocket<00:03:30.100> or<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.940> know

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
like a little vacuum pocket or you know

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.180 
like a little vacuum pocket or you know
the<00:03:31.150> ATAR<00:03:31.330> is<00:03:31.390> not<00:03:31.570> gonna<00:03:31.750> flow<00:03:32.110> right<00:03:32.560> next<00:03:33.130> to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
the ATAR is not gonna flow right next to

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.560 
the ATAR is not gonna flow right next to
this<00:03:33.340> curve<00:03:33.580> on<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.880> bottom<00:03:33.910> part<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.450> this

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
this curve on the bottom part of this

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.490 
this curve on the bottom part of this
valve<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.920> you're<00:03:36.610> trying<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.300> improve<00:03:38.260> this

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
valve so you're trying to improve this

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.520 
valve so you're trying to improve this
transition<00:03:39.220> making<00:03:39.460> it<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.760> larger<00:03:40.120> radius

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
transition making it a larger radius

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.450 
transition making it a larger radius
things<00:03:41.530> like<00:03:41.830> that<00:03:43.710> that<00:03:44.710> probably<00:03:45.190> is<00:03:45.280> gonna

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
things like that that probably is gonna

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.820 
things like that that probably is gonna
give<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.670> good<00:03:45.850> gains<00:03:46.210> I'm<00:03:47.050> also<00:03:47.290> looking<00:03:47.560> at

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
give you good gains I'm also looking at

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.530 
give you good gains I'm also looking at
this<00:03:48.010> on<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.430> bottom<00:03:48.580> side<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:48.910> actually<00:03:49.210> flat

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
this on the bottom side is actually flat

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.750 
this on the bottom side is actually flat
on<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.170> bottom<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.710> think<00:03:51.040> maybe<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.400> can<00:03:51.520> see

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
on the bottom I think maybe you can see

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.150 
on the bottom I think maybe you can see
it<00:03:51.790> right<00:03:52.000> about<00:03:52.210> there<00:03:52.270> or<00:03:52.810> maybe<00:03:53.710> if<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:53.950> hold

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
it right about there or maybe if I hold

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.340 
it right about there or maybe if I hold
it<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:54.520> way<00:03:54.580> you<00:03:55.240> know<00:03:55.360> it's<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.630> it's

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
it this way you know it's a it's

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.700 
it this way you know it's a it's
actually<00:03:56.710> a<00:03:56.860> little<00:03:57.370> flat<00:03:57.670> there<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:58.710> you

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
actually a little flat there and you

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.920 
actually a little flat there and you
know<00:03:59.830> rounding<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.340> might<00:04:00.700> might<00:04:01.420> help<00:04:01.630> that

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
know rounding that might might help that

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.740 
know rounding that might might help that
that<00:04:02.500> transition<00:04:04.410> um<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:07.150> biggest<00:04:07.390> or<00:04:07.720> the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
that transition um the biggest or the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.010 
that transition um the biggest or the
most<00:04:08.200> interesting<00:04:08.350> thing<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.250> me<00:04:09.280> is<00:04:09.820> really<00:04:10.720> I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
most interesting thing to me is really I

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.110 
most interesting thing to me is really I
had<00:04:11.470> never<00:04:11.710> really<00:04:11.980> thought<00:04:12.010> about<00:04:12.520> how<00:04:13.060> the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
had never really thought about how the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.470 
had never really thought about how the
valve<00:04:13.770> interacts<00:04:15.630> with<00:04:17.820> with<00:04:18.820> this<00:04:19.000> chamber

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
valve interacts with with this chamber

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.810 
valve interacts with with this chamber
so<00:04:19.720> I'm<00:04:19.810> gonna<00:04:19.930> put<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:20.410> in<00:04:20.560> like<00:04:21.460> the<00:04:21.610> valve

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
so I'm gonna put it in like the valve

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.740 
so I'm gonna put it in like the valve
was<00:04:22.260> was<00:04:23.260> closed<00:04:23.620> so<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.270> valves<00:04:25.540> all<00:04:25.660> the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
was was closed so and the valves all the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.960 
was was closed so and the valves all the
way<00:04:25.840> closed<00:04:26.140> it's<00:04:26.380> obviously<00:04:26.740> well<00:04:27.610> seated

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
way closed it's obviously well seated

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.270 
way closed it's obviously well seated
like<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.890> but<00:04:29.890> let's<00:04:30.880> say<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.120> valves<00:04:31.390> open

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
like that but let's say the valves open

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.790 
like that but let's say the valves open
50<00:04:33.280> thousandths<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:33.910> an<00:04:34.030> inch<00:04:34.440> that's<00:04:35.440> about

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
50 thousandths of an inch that's about

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.210 
50 thousandths of an inch that's about
that<00:04:36.490> much<00:04:37.440> which<00:04:40.710> well<00:04:41.710> that's<00:04:41.980> probably

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
that much which well that's probably

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.240 
that much which well that's probably
about<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.670> tenth<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.360> an<00:04:43.480> inch<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:44.560> that's<00:04:44.770> you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
about a tenth of an inch so that's you

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.380 
about a tenth of an inch so that's you
know<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.370> hundred<00:04:45.520> thousandths<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.180> an<00:04:46.330> inch

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
know a hundred thousandths of an inch

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.360 
know a hundred thousandths of an inch
that's<00:04:47.110> probably<00:04:47.530> about<00:04:47.650> 50<00:04:48.130> there<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:51.160> big

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
that's probably about 50 there the big

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.250 
that's probably about 50 there the big
thing<00:04:51.700> that<00:04:51.730> I<00:04:51.880> realize<00:04:52.390> is<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.840> that's<00:04:53.050> such

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
thing that I realize is that that's such

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.650 
thing that I realize is that that's such
a<00:04:53.290> small<00:04:53.530> opening<00:04:54.040> on<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:54.400> this<00:04:54.910> side<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.420> the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
a small opening on this this side of the

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.390 
a small opening on this this side of the
the<00:04:56.350> short<00:04:56.700> radius<00:04:57.700> side<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:59.590> no<00:04:59.950> air<00:05:00.220> is

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
the short radius side that no air is

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.850 
the short radius side that no air is
gonna<00:05:00.550> flow<00:05:00.880> through<00:05:01.300> this<00:05:01.690> side<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.650> the

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
gonna flow through this side of the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.350 
gonna flow through this side of the
valve<00:05:03.070> all<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.460> air<00:05:03.610> is<00:05:03.730> gonna<00:05:03.910> go<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.150> this

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
valve all the air is gonna go to this

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.210 
valve all the air is gonna go to this
side<00:05:04.630> of<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.870> valve<00:05:05.080> so<00:05:05.530> anything<00:05:05.830> we<00:05:05.920> can<00:05:06.070> do

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
side of the valve so anything we can do

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.880 
side of the valve so anything we can do
so<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.700> don't<00:05:07.330> know<00:05:07.570> rough<00:05:07.870> guess<00:05:08.200> maybe<00:05:08.500> one

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
so I don't know rough guess maybe one

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.340 
so I don't know rough guess maybe one
third<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.330> valve<00:05:10.510> here<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.170> know

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
third of the valve here so you know

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.800 
third of the valve here so you know
looking<00:05:11.680> from<00:05:12.100> here<00:05:12.130> to<00:05:12.580> here<00:05:12.790> isn't<00:05:13.600> gonna

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
looking from here to here isn't gonna

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.390 
looking from here to here isn't gonna
have<00:05:13.960> any<00:05:14.110> air<00:05:14.320> flowing<00:05:14.710> through<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:15.520> it

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
have any air flowing through so it

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.250 
have any air flowing through so it
50<00:05:16.880> thousands<00:05:17.270> left<00:05:17.540> you're<00:05:17.780> only<00:05:17.870> getting

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
50 thousands left you're only getting

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.560 
50 thousands left you're only getting
air<00:05:18.560> flowing<00:05:18.919> through<00:05:19.280> this<00:05:20.060> little<00:05:20.330> back

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
air flowing through this little back

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.780 
air flowing through this little back
edge<00:05:20.840> right<00:05:21.080> here<00:05:21.139> I<00:05:21.650> maybe<00:05:22.220> two-thirds<00:05:22.639> of

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
edge right here I maybe two-thirds of

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.740 
edge right here I maybe two-thirds of
the<00:05:22.880> dowel<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.979> at<00:05:24.979> full<00:05:25.370> lift<00:05:25.729> which<00:05:26.510> I<00:05:26.630> have

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
the dowel and at full lift which I have

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.920 
the dowel and at full lift which I have
a<00:05:26.780> caliper<00:05:27.199> here<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:27.680> measure<00:05:28.419> this<00:05:29.419> is<00:05:29.630> set<00:05:29.810> to

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
a caliper here to measure this is set to

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.129 
a caliper here to measure this is set to
about<00:05:30.110> 460<00:05:30.830> which<00:05:31.370> is<00:05:31.639> about<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.330> full<00:05:32.840> lift

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
about 460 which is about the full lift

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.810 
about 460 which is about the full lift
of<00:05:34.130> the<00:05:34.310> 944<00:05:34.820> so<00:05:35.449> it's<00:05:35.720> about<00:05:36.490> C<00:05:37.490> that's<00:05:37.610> you

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
of the 944 so it's about C that's you

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.090 
of the 944 so it's about C that's you
know<00:05:37.910> approximately<00:05:38.570> full<00:05:39.440> lift<00:05:39.740> on<00:05:39.979> the

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
know approximately full lift on the

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.860 
know approximately full lift on the
valve<00:05:41.110> even<00:05:42.110> here<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:42.740> don't<00:05:43.460> think<00:05:44.120> that<00:05:44.630> much

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
valve even here I don't think that much

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.070 
valve even here I don't think that much
air<00:05:45.260> is<00:05:45.530> going<00:05:45.979> to<00:05:46.190> make<00:05:46.400> this<00:05:46.610> u-turn<00:05:47.360> you

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
air is going to make this u-turn you

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.860 
air is going to make this u-turn you
know<00:05:48.199> around<00:05:48.560> from<00:05:49.070> this<00:05:49.970> side<00:05:50.240> of<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.419> radius

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
know around from this side of the radius

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.830 
know around from this side of the radius
and<00:05:51.199> then<00:05:51.680> come<00:05:51.919> out<00:05:52.039> this<00:05:52.340> way<00:05:52.580> you<00:05:53.539> know<00:05:53.600> most

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
and then come out this way you know most

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.379 
and then come out this way you know most
of<00:05:53.930> that<00:05:54.110> air<00:05:54.260> is<00:05:54.380> gonna<00:05:54.500> want<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:54.830> go<00:05:55.010> in<00:05:55.880> this

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
of that air is gonna want to go in this

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.120 
of that air is gonna want to go in this
direction<00:05:57.039> and<00:05:58.539> if<00:05:59.539> you<00:05:59.780> even<00:06:00.050> decrease<00:06:00.770> this

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
direction and if you even decrease this

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.580 
direction and if you even decrease this
radius<00:06:01.669> here<00:06:01.699> if<00:06:02.630> you<00:06:02.810> you<00:06:02.930> know<00:06:03.080> you<00:06:03.350> were

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
radius here if you you know you were

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.629 
radius here if you you know you were
able<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:04.070> add<00:06:04.430> material<00:06:05.210> into<00:06:05.419> the<00:06:05.539> port<00:06:05.870> to<00:06:06.800> is

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
able to add material into the port to is

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.520 
able to add material into the port to is
right<00:06:07.850> now<00:06:08.000> this<00:06:08.180> air<00:06:08.449> is<00:06:08.630> go<00:06:08.840> this<00:06:09.020> way<00:06:09.260> and

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
right now this air is go this way and

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.990 
right now this air is go this way and
then<00:06:09.770> that<00:06:09.800> way<00:06:10.100> that's<00:06:10.400> kind<00:06:10.669> of<00:06:10.699> a<00:06:10.820> big

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
then that way that's kind of a big

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.570 
then that way that's kind of a big
s-curve<00:06:11.479> if<00:06:12.260> you<00:06:12.410> could<00:06:12.590> reduce<00:06:12.740> that<00:06:12.949> s-curve

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
s-curve if you could reduce that s-curve

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.510 
s-curve if you could reduce that s-curve
you<00:06:13.729> could<00:06:13.880> probably<00:06:14.260> get<00:06:15.260> some<00:06:15.949> improved

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
you could probably get some improved

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.600 
you could probably get some improved
efficiency<00:06:16.760> there<00:06:17.600> as<00:06:17.840> well<00:06:18.190> but<00:06:19.190> it's<00:06:19.370> um

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
efficiency there as well but it's um

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.540 
efficiency there as well but it's um
kind<00:06:20.360> of<00:06:20.479> interesting<00:06:20.900> looking<00:06:21.349> and<00:06:21.650> at<00:06:22.280> this

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
kind of interesting looking and at this

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.040 
kind of interesting looking and at this
and<00:06:22.760> visualizing<00:06:23.300> you<00:06:23.570> know<00:06:23.630> what<00:06:23.750> the<00:06:23.900> air

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
and visualizing you know what the air

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.670 
and visualizing you know what the air
passageway<00:06:24.770> into<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:25.820> engine<00:06:26.300> is<00:06:26.479> and<00:06:26.960> I<00:06:27.500> can

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
passageway into the engine is and I can

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.320 
passageway into the engine is and I can
definitely<00:06:27.860> see<00:06:29.349> how<00:06:30.430> there's<00:06:31.430> room<00:06:31.940> to<00:06:32.150> be

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
definitely see how there's room to be

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.390
