have<00:05:30.320> sold<00:05:30.830> them<00:05:31.010> I<00:05:31.160> should<00:05:31.250> say<00:05:31.580> so<00:05:32.330> this<00:05:32.570> is

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
have sold them I should say so this is

my first time really selling toys now if

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.050 
my first time really selling toys now if
this<00:05:35.240> does<00:05:35.570> go<00:05:35.720> well<00:05:36.080> I<00:05:36.350> would<00:05:36.530> consider

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
this does go well I would consider

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.120 
this does go well I would consider
actually<00:05:38.060> doing<00:05:38.570> this<00:05:38.720> more<00:05:39.290> often<00:05:39.530> I<00:05:39.919> would

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
actually doing this more often I would

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.280 
actually doing this more often I would
go<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:40.430> more<00:05:40.640> of<00:05:40.760> these<00:05:40.880> things<00:05:41.180> see<00:05:42.110> what<00:05:42.260> I

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
go to more of these things see what I

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.710 
go to more of these things see what I
could<00:05:42.470> find<00:05:42.650> kind<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.640> fix<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.060> stuff<00:05:44.270> up<00:05:44.479> and

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
could find kind of fix the stuff up and

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.810 
could find kind of fix the stuff up and
then<00:05:44.810> resell<00:05:45.650> them<00:05:45.800> and<00:05:45.979> if<00:05:46.130> this<00:05:46.310> is<00:05:46.490> like<00:05:46.640> a

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
then resell them and if this is like a

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.909 
then resell them and if this is like a
failure<00:05:47.270> then<00:05:47.660> this<00:05:48.169> will<00:05:48.320> be<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.530> last<00:05:48.680> time

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
failure then this will be the last time

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.700 
failure then this will be the last time
I<00:05:48.979> guess<00:05:49.280> because<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.990> spent<00:05:50.990> a<00:05:51.110> lot<00:05:51.350> of<00:05:51.380> money

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
I guess because I spent a lot of money

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.680 
I guess because I spent a lot of money
that<00:05:52.070> I<00:05:52.130> shouldn't<00:05:52.460> have<00:05:52.550> spent<00:05:52.850> I<00:05:53.210> mean<00:05:53.660> I

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
that I shouldn't have spent I mean I

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.230 
that I shouldn't have spent I mean I
realize<00:05:54.290> it's<00:05:54.530> a<00:05:54.620> big<00:05:54.800> risk<00:05:55.040> on<00:05:55.340> my<00:05:55.760> part<00:05:56.000> I

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
realize it's a big risk on my part I

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.940 
realize it's a big risk on my part I
understand<00:05:57.020> that<00:05:57.200> not<00:05:57.380> your<00:05:57.500> fault<00:05:57.770> my<00:05:57.890> fault

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
understand that not your fault my fault

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.280 
understand that not your fault my fault
but<00:05:58.550> maybe<00:05:59.300> it<00:05:59.479> could<00:05:59.600> be<00:05:59.690> a<00:05:59.720> good<00:05:59.900> thing<00:06:00.110> I

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
but maybe it could be a good thing I

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.960 
but maybe it could be a good thing I
hope<00:06:00.440> now<00:06:00.979> that<00:06:01.160> I<00:06:01.220> just<00:06:01.250> finished<00:06:01.729> telling
