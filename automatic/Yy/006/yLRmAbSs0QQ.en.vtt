00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.450
 active hi music of friends are 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.950
 matteo bidoia of guitar tutorials in the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.850
 video you just saw I ran 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.900
 lonesome road blues by joe bonamassa 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.620
 important feature of this 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.470
 song is the rhythm that giufÃ  performs 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.090
 under the singing a rhythm that can 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.770
 be performed in the video performed with 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.250
 the pick and middle and ring finger can be 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:27.410
 also done with the thumb is always 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.410
 therefore the best annular way 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.680
 let's take a closer look at how to do ad 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.689
 perform this rhythm first with the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.689
 pick and fingers and then only with fingers 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.180
 you can hide the pick in your hand 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.550
 using are the fingers 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.610
 you will have a minor attack then the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.130
 possibility to manage more 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.890
 percussive and more rhythmic the part here 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.050
 below in the description you will find the 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.290
 link to the tabla ture and backing trek 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:20.540
 to be able to perform the piece in the best possible way 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.540
 see you at the next autoplay
