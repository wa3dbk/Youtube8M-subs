00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:10.530
 [Music] 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.820
 Hello everyone 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.650
 today we're in a video 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.980
 rather how she died in the jt 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.900
 with so for a stadium which I was 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.920
 with title that really need a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.019
 patch here so 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.740
 so if marc simard commented on 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.740
 riots in lhasa 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 so you wrote has amassed six 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.610
 points iv and will introduce so I was 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.090
 invested to switch off its mysteries 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.090
 of this type 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.360
 dice imitated their pages concerned I 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:57.020
 already made part of our trip 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.420
 but there 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.410
 no it's also after you download 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.630
 a salary so it's a trick 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.860
 undertaken as a magic london in 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.930
 Samoens and installs modes 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.300
 automatically me I ten pages 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.420
 of a word of a talent I think it's 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.020
 shit I much prefer the 6 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.990
 December at this unfolds to something we 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.350
 must maybe that will work so 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.369
 you extracted I was in my interior 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:35.210
 based on 22 originally night so 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:37.970
 set up krafchick boat was only doing 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.600
 not need because I showed them 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.740
 debates as a solution so here we are 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.740
 that it is to open 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.140
 the escape 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.090
 to feed me 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.090
 he comes 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.060
 so normally broadband asks you 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.009
 to update but not 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.170
 because otherwise you will put a 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.080
 mistake in fact here you are there for 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.129
 the moment or lower his voice 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.269
 download a voice from elsewhere 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.549
 I already said I'm getting wet audi 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.430
 by the way, we're going to take a 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:23.140
 scooter by the way not what goes after 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.140
 it will be very simply a trick 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:41.709
 all of us and what like who has 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:41.709
 place tonight in laval and there are four days 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:48.739
 that's how he got 10,820 and the guy 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:51.500
 who noted it I think it's noted and 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.159
 the bad one buries in all 17 out 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.810
 20 is very well attention 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.329
 foci of modes like installing them and 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.090
 when you do the game goes floor of 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.919
 seed the riot that is not working I already 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.769
 fell on the modes like that one 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.840
 downloads you chose the second it's 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.069
 actually watch that she was instructed to 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.540
 7 kb a second a little already I 'll do a 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.049
 word by second select our 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.049
 market 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:33.450
 so here it is so he is where he is there so 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.450
 the wise advice of sounds 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.980
 kid and so are 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.500
 it's something else because that's good 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.830
 well I'll have you too many dogs to 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.880
 take you acted at the point of the games 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.820
 for a delay the name of the vehicle and 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.820
 rhythmic gold and half what is it 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.440
 in fact you have to take it and half there 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.570
 is important why since in fact there 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.209
 blue denim 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:10.230
 I actually do it on the back 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.840
 in fact he took that that means the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.840
 vehicle speed land sellers so 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.000
 for you put it in the file you 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.560
 have in the resale of firm vehicles 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.470
 and now we fall back on the sky in 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.110
 feast continues and installs Occitan of 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.550
 automated vehicles 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.660
 in short you have to restore back end that 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.230
 it is to remove vehicles 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.430
 that's for my sake you'll show next you 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.670
 select the second that's for 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.570
 trained zip archives and who knows but 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:49.180
 his next foam examine your i 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.360
 wrinkles in the Middle Ages in prime time of 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:58.900
 rate there you select your mode 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:01.030
 highly euros the record or exonerates 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.100
 so every time you have to delete 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.050
 two months of a game you settle 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.060
 nomads I am like that and you are at 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.120
 a small number have a reporter 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.920
 the interaction and next did not seek 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.650
 so there you select the vehicle 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.529
 that you want to change skis and see 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.109
 if mode is that you can 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:21.719
 natal a fashionable couple patientons scooter 

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:24.479
 and replace him for example by a man 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:26.339
 by his 500th fell net it seems to me it's 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.569
 funny and noval endorsed by the annoying 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:29.179
 because I 'm going to show you some time 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:37.159
 when we start people completely 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:37.159
 idiot i praise and next 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.699
 she is a little slow 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.660
 I am 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.430
 so what's good is that you 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.629
 can put a doubt no it means 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.810
 we would ride in the vehicle 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:06:02.349
 it will not put it on his knees 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:10.139
 number doubled so at you put me I 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:12.970
 I'm wrong made next century french la 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.110
 next with there I tell you he admitted 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.930
 the one taken away points 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:22.919
 clg next and girls leave us the world 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.919
 is 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.640
 hiccup guy photo 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.850
 and you make excite 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.820
 so here are our modes and install and 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:48.730
 to crazy I just have to do that 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:53.570
 what is it directly from there 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:55.700
 we continue later to the backup section 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.830
 the eifel so positive gt3 so that's the 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.520
 same thing for this interview 3 if you 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:05.090
 install next so 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.569
 it's automatically and there you have 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.840
 the vehicles me I have the audi a8 is 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:14.539
 installed here so we threw ourselves 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.840
 with vesti to show you my 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.840
 expectations 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.580
 so salute the shame 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.940
 so the scooter is there he has 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.620
 been installed 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.180
 so here's the hands so that's so 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.560
 long line of attention I had already 

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:50.960
 listening on we will cut the radio 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:55.010
 you see that when you start that 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:59.450
 does a wheeling to the powerful high and he 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.680
 is going extremely fast look hop there 

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:05.290
 by the way at the beginning of the game I am 

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:10.550
 crushed in an area that will express 

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:13.750
 that's it and biogas so I hope since 

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.750
 you a goal and has more
