00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.789 

for<00:00:05.240> this<00:00:05.359> course<00:00:05.660> I've<00:00:05.960> only<00:00:06.170> been<00:00:06.350> using<00:00:06.590> a

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
for this course I've only been using a

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.220 
for this course I've only been using a
single<00:00:07.189> photo<00:00:07.460> library<00:00:07.729> which<00:00:08.450> resides<00:00:08.900> in<00:00:09.080> my

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
single photo library which resides in my

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.589 
single photo library which resides in my
pictures<00:00:09.620> folder<00:00:09.650> and<00:00:10.160> is<00:00:10.759> called<00:00:11.000> iPhoto

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
pictures folder and is called iPhoto

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.890 
pictures folder and is called iPhoto
library<00:00:12.249> because<00:00:13.249> I<00:00:13.519> upgraded<00:00:14.030> from<00:00:14.329> iPhoto

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
library because I upgraded from iPhoto

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.080 
library because I upgraded from iPhoto
to<00:00:15.139> aperture<00:00:15.499> and<00:00:15.829> kept<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.520> same<00:00:16.730> original

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
to aperture and kept the same original

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.890 
to aperture and kept the same original
library<00:00:18.790> but<00:00:19.790> you<00:00:19.970> can<00:00:20.180> use<00:00:20.360> multiple

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
library but you can use multiple

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.780 
library but you can use multiple
libraries<00:00:21.110> with<00:00:21.590> aperture<00:00:22.070> and<00:00:22.280> switch

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
libraries with aperture and switch

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.090 
libraries with aperture and switch
between<00:00:23.000> them<00:00:23.360> easily

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.000 

so<00:00:27.100> I'm<00:00:27.160> going<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.369> quit<00:00:27.580> aperture<00:00:28.060> and<00:00:28.270> then

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
so I'm going to quit aperture and then

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.260 
so I'm going to quit aperture and then
relaunch<00:00:30.010> it<00:00:30.310> while<00:00:30.520> holding<00:00:30.789> down<00:00:30.970> the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
relaunch it while holding down the

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.770 
relaunch it while holding down the
option<00:00:31.300> key<00:00:32.790> from<00:00:33.790> here<00:00:34.059> I<00:00:34.090> can<00:00:34.180> select<00:00:34.480> a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
option key from here I can select a

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.040 
option key from here I can select a
library<00:00:35.200> to<00:00:35.350> open<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:37.180> only<00:00:37.329> choices<00:00:37.690> right

library to open my only choices right

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.410 
library to open my only choices right
now<00:00:38.260> are<00:00:38.559> my<00:00:39.190> iPhoto<00:00:39.699> library<00:00:39.790> in<00:00:40.329> the

Drive<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:48.550> I<00:00:48.730> have<00:00:48.879> a<00:00:48.910> library<00:00:49.449> in<00:00:49.480> another

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
Drive if I have a library in another

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.020 
Drive if I have a library in another
location<00:00:50.050> that<00:00:50.800> aperture<00:00:51.100> isn't<00:00:51.489> seeing<00:00:51.730> I

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
location that aperture isn't seeing I

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.329 
location that aperture isn't seeing I
could<00:00:52.480> navigate<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:53.080> to<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.470> by<00:00:54.100> clicking

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
could navigate it to it by clicking

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.020 
could navigate it to it by clicking
other<00:00:54.730> library<00:00:55.390> or<00:00:56.320> I<00:00:56.350> can<00:00:57.220> just<00:00:57.250> create<00:00:57.699> a<00:00:57.760> new

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
other library or I can just create a new

other library or I can just create a new
empty<00:00:58.269> library<00:00:59.519> I'll<00:01:00.519> do<00:01:00.820> that<00:01:01.019> name<00:01:02.019> at<00:01:02.229> work

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
empty library I'll do that name at work

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.560 
empty library I'll do that name at work
library<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.280> save<00:01:03.760> it<00:01:03.940> in<00:01:04.059> my<00:01:04.089> pictures

library and save it in my pictures
folder

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.120 

you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.620 

I'm<00:01:12.130> going<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.370> add<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.490> few<00:01:12.700> photos<00:01:13.120> to<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.480> and

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
I'm going to add a few photos to it and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.100 
I'm going to add a few photos to it and
then<00:01:14.560> quit<00:01:14.980> aperture<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.750> relaunch<00:01:16.750> again

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
then quit aperture and relaunch again

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.570 
then quit aperture and relaunch again
holding<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.650> option<00:01:17.800> key

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.680 

you

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.560 

now<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.740> can<00:01:31.160> open<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.550> work<00:01:31.730> library<00:01:32.270> or<00:01:32.510> the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
now I can open the work library or the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.300 
now I can open the work library or the
original<00:01:33.050> iPhoto<00:01:33.950> library<00:01:34.070> as<00:01:35.800> I<00:01:36.800> select<00:01:37.160> each

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
original iPhoto library as I select each

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.610 
original iPhoto library as I select each
one<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:37.970> tells<00:01:38.240> me<00:01:38.420> how<00:01:38.660> many<00:01:38.720> originals<00:01:39.380> and

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
one this tells me how many originals and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.530 
one this tells me how many originals and
versions<00:01:39.980> are<00:01:40.100> eaten<00:01:40.340> in<00:01:40.430> each<00:01:40.730> library<00:01:41.030> to

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
versions are eaten in each library to

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.150 
versions are eaten in each library to
give<00:01:41.690> me<00:01:41.840> an<00:01:41.930> idea<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.560> size<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.950> I'll<00:01:46.040> go

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
give me an idea of the size so I'll go

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.970 
give me an idea of the size so I'll go
back<00:01:46.340> into<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.670> work<00:01:46.910> library

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.120 

and<00:01:50.150> from<00:01:51.150> here<00:01:51.420> go<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.660> file<00:01:52.050> switch<00:01:52.620> library

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and from here go to file switch library

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.390 
and from here go to file switch library
I<00:01:53.810> can<00:01:54.810> switch<00:01:55.050> back<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.560> original<00:01:55.680> iPhoto

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
I can switch back to my original iPhoto

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.510 
I can switch back to my original iPhoto
library<00:01:56.720> which<00:01:57.720> happens<00:01:58.140> nice<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> quick<00:02:01.520> now

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
