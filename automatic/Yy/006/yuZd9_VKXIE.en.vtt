that<00:01:47.049> I<00:01:47.080> did<00:01:47.200> indeed<00:01:47.830> do<00:01:48.009> a<00:01:48.040> super<00:01:48.340> spirit<00:01:48.610> bomb

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
that I did indeed do a super spirit bomb

on<00:01:48.909> him<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:50.110> get<00:01:50.229> this<00:01:50.409> little<00:01:50.619> thing<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
on him you get this little thing the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.240 
on him you get this little thing the
after<00:01:52.240> game<00:01:52.420> or<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.990> guess<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.289> yes<00:01:53.979> just

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
after game or the I guess the yes just

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.399 
after game or the I guess the yes just
throw<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.490> energy<00:01:55.180> at<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.479> end<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.720> Z<00:01:55.930> I<00:01:56.170> think

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
throw the energy at the end of Z I think

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.020 
throw the energy at the end of Z I think
I<00:01:56.649> don't<00:01:56.950> think<00:01:57.100> there's<00:01:57.250> any<00:01:57.369> GT<00:01:57.700> but<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:57.880> guess

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
I don't think there's any GT but I guess

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.340 
I don't think there's any GT but I guess

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
I guess right there we go oh I guess I

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.530 
I guess right there we go oh I guess I
kind<00:05:23.730> of<00:05:23.760> thought<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:23.940> wasn't<00:05:24.150> gonna<00:05:24.300> be<00:05:24.450> in

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
kind of thought it wasn't gonna be in

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.940 
kind of thought it wasn't gonna be in
there<00:05:24.720> but<00:05:24.840> I'm<00:05:24.900> surprised<00:05:25.260> we<00:05:25.380> lasted<00:05:25.770> so

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
there but I'm surprised we lasted so

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.460 
there but I'm surprised we lasted so
long<00:05:25.980> without<00:05:26.340> getting<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:27.050> ring<00:05:28.050> out<00:05:28.200> there

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
long without getting a ring out there

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.020 
long without getting a ring out there
but<00:05:28.710> we<00:05:28.800> got<00:05:28.920> a<00:05:28.950> lot<00:05:29.160> of<00:05:29.190> xp<00:05:29.550> for<00:05:29.580> that<00:05:29.820> that's

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
but we got a lot of xp for that that's

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.730 
but we got a lot of xp for that that's
pretty<00:05:30.180> nice<00:05:30.390> didn't<00:05:30.990> quite<00:05:31.170> get<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.320> level

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
pretty nice didn't quite get the level

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:40.050 
pretty nice didn't quite get the level
of<00:05:31.890> those<00:05:32.070> so<00:05:32.870> dad<00:05:33.870> kind<00:05:34.140> of<00:05:34.200> shucks

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.200 

but<00:05:40.690> still<00:05:41.500> be<00:05:41.770> a<00:05:41.800> whole<00:05:42.100> lot<00:05:42.130> stronger

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210

it that's the end of it Oh finery
selfish<00:06:06.550> one<00:06:06.760> selfish<00:06:07.150> one<00:06:07.450> driven<00:06:08.230> by<00:06:08.410> a

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
selfish one selfish one driven by a

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.750 
selfish one selfish one driven by a
desire<00:06:08.740> to<00:06:09.010> fight<00:06:09.580> stronger<00:06:10.330> opponents<00:06:11.760> okay

that<00:06:13.020> yes<00:06:14.020> that<00:06:14.320> is<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:14.800> end<00:06:14.979> that<00:06:15.660> that<00:06:16.660> is

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
that yes that is the end that that is

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.469 
that yes that is the end that that is
the<00:06:16.990> real<00:06:17.200> real<00:06:17.590> end<00:06:17.860> there<00:06:18.160> I<00:06:18.460> think<00:06:18.580> so

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
the real real end there I think so

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.750 
the real real end there I think so
well<00:06:20.320> there's<00:06:20.530> a<00:06:20.590> nice<00:06:20.740> little<00:06:20.919> thing<00:06:21.160> I<00:06:21.490> guess

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
well there's a nice little thing I guess

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.700 
well there's a nice little thing I guess
is<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.690> quick<00:06:22.870> battle<00:06:23.139> with<00:06:23.260> herb<00:06:23.440> when<00:06:23.620> we

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
is the quick battle with herb when we

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.260 
is the quick battle with herb when we
unlocked<00:06:24.040> him<00:06:24.220> now<00:06:24.370> so<00:06:24.610> that's<00:06:24.790> pretty<00:06:25.090> cool

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
unlocked him now so that's pretty cool

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.490 
unlocked him now so that's pretty cool
and<00:06:26.250> yes<00:06:27.250> so<00:06:27.490> that's<00:06:28.210> it<00:06:28.479> for<00:06:28.690> this<00:06:28.900> one<00:06:29.200> I

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
and yes so that's it for this one I

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.430 
and yes so that's it for this one I
don't<00:06:30.160> think<00:06:30.370> and<00:06:30.940> I<00:06:31.300> there's<00:06:31.660> some<00:06:31.780> GT<00:06:32.139> stuff

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
don't think and I there's some GT stuff

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.900 
don't think and I there's some GT stuff
you<00:06:32.530> can<00:06:32.680> do<00:06:32.860> but<00:06:33.070> they're<00:06:33.280> kind<00:06:33.550> of<00:06:33.610> awkward

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
you can do but they're kind of awkward

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.820 
you can do but they're kind of awkward
