for<00:01:34.950> my<00:01:35.130> they're<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> lot<00:01:36.000> better

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
for my they're going to be a lot better

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.399 
for my they're going to be a lot better
i<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> offense<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> lot

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
i think the offense is going to be a lot

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.840 
i think the offense is going to be a lot
more<00:01:37.439> effective<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> defense<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.610> certainly

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
more effective the defense is certainly

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.640 
more effective the defense is certainly
