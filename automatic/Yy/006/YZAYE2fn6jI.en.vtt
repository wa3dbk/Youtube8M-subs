00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hello so we meet today 

00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.730
 for I believe the video that I was 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.660
 the most requested recently is about 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.740
 so the bun that I wear 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.260
 currently what is very funny it is 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.000
 that this bun I do it since May we 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.889
 follows a decade or so I even 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.240
 talked to my boyfriend just now and he 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.410
 remembers me already with her hair 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.970
 and we've known each other since we were 16 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.300
 so that's been a long time since the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.980
 door 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.359
 it is a deposit that has absolutely no 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.710
 nothing incredible but I do not know 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.000
 why recently you've been 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.890
 dozens to ask me every day 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.119
 but do us a tutorial on this path 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.289
 we laughed badly to let mails 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.510
 comments on youtube of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.369
 questions about serious condition and that makes me 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.360
 to die of laughter because that's it 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.469
 really completely you will see 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.370
 the explanation that will make you laugh 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.290
 because he really does not do anything 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.940
 incredible dance fignon the little 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.180
 history of this hairstyle is that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.829
 so I have very long hair since 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.059
 very long time I would not even be 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.210
 really the last time I had the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.140
 hair above the shoulders and in addition 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.420
 to have long hair I have 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 a lot and they are very thick so 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.809
 I really like to wear my hair 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 dropped but everyday there is a moment 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.809
 where I'm sick and tired of it 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.579
 to tie them one because it bothers me 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.199
 and it falls into my eyes 2 because 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.789
 in summer for example it's quite 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.439
 unbearable to have this tuft that 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.770
 keeps you warm in the back of the neck 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.119
 and 3 with my current job so if you 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.049
 do not know I'm a nurse I do not 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.750
 can not afford to allow me to 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.030
 to wear detached hair at work 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.020
 so many reasons that make his 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.970
 Serbian buns or become my mark of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 makes the door anyway to 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.210
 daily and here I am going to you 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.170
 explain today how I do it 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.770
 but I guarantee you that there is really 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.420
 nothing wizard 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.670
 it made me laugh so much 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.310
 I would like to share some kind of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.900
 hashtag I have not found out yet that she 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.640
 bought I'm going to find I'm going 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.020
 to be able to invent but I put it to you 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.360
 on the screen and so if you do this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 bun at home share it on 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.570
 share the picture so duchesneau on 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.650
 twitter on a star g you send me a 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.390
 snap chatou what because it's ok 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.320
 to really make people laugh so if 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.299
 you place you do 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.100
 show me because I see I find 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.470
 it's hilarious so I'm wearing it 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.270
 currently is the only 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.100
 the only thing you need for 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 to make this bun is an elastic 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.910
 and that's all I think it's a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.620
 sign that can work on a lot 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.780
 of hair types the only condition 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.430
 is to have still a certain 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.530
 capillary mass so that implies 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.640
 to have some length 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.720
 here is this bun on a square by 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.860
 extension will not be absolutely 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.009
 possible in any case on hair 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.000
 very long and very bulky and very 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.700
 many like well it's a 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.810
 hairstyle that quite ideal several 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.670
 ways to do it if you want it 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.720
 be very tight rather loose so I 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.670
 will show you the basic way not 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.600
 ready I show you a little bit the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.640
 various versions 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.470
 so we start by putting the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.120
 maggots parade jumps on his wrist 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.390
 either to the sheep savin me I loved it as 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.209
 it 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.550
 you gather absolutely all your 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.780
 hair and I personally like it 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.900
 to do a little on the top of the head 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.890
 but you get good you want 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.690
 I will try to be the clearest 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.430
 possible because it's really it's 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.340
 a whole story this thing so once 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.330
 that you got there it's time to 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.650
 choose if you want something from 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.030
 very tight which you maintain which one 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.959
 the one very tight or if you release it 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.230
 a little bit for something a little 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.650
 plus a style a little more beautiful hate 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.459
 etc. 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.400
 so we go through like that once 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.060
 this then for a moment 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.470
 I hope you see it well at 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.940
 the elastic is then passed 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.700
 you make a turn you spend it a 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.989
 second time and you do not pass 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.420
 completely the ponytail in fact 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.790
 a kind of loop like these is 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.570
 then we continue we still pass it 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.190
 once like that so it's the same 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.720
 do not pass it entirely and a 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.570
 last time I caught a 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.130
 piece and I plate and moderate the little 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.260
 little piece of cabbage that is 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.930
 there I actually place it just below 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.390
 and that's it's all there is nothing to do 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.920
 there is no is no bread it has 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.910
 added there are no accessories 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.989
 see of course the poems were small 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.370
 flowers that allow if you want 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.830
 but there is absolutely nothing else to 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.400
 do and so back a little look 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.799
 a little bit twisted let's go on 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.819
 which is 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.250
 infinitely declinable if I want to 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.799
 say you can do it for example 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.069
 very low where for example do you do 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.359
 a rule you do it here and we 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.469
 repeat the same process I go back to you 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.790
 again like that it allows you 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:06.480
 to see him once twice 100 to 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:12.209
 pass entirely three times and four 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.889
 time and here and again a pledge of 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.810
 little things and that's it and it makes you a 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.280
 bun down so that's really the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.949
 the simplest hairstyle that I do 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.000
 for years I do not count the 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.199
 number of times I've even been asked 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.759
 daily habitat hairstyle is 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.199
 beautiful and I'm ashamed because that's it 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.419
 what is it really the most 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.039
 simple of the earth and it can have a 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.400
 super elaborate look it works on 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.539
 dry hair like I'm currently doing this 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.070
 also works on hair 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.300
 wet and that's for example a very 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.680
 good idea if you want to have some 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.599
 natural ripples without having to 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.139
 use a curling iron to iron 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.120
 smooth etc. 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.070
 you wash your hair at night you 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.120
 leave in very quickly and so 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.380
 those who are still a little bit 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.580
 wet you do this bun and you 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.470
 sleep with and when you wake up 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.849
 morning by removing the elastic you 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.190
 so find with the ripples that 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.659
 you see knowing that on hair 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.889
 steep really stops it does not 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.030
 probably will not work but on 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.960
 soft hair like mine 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.280
 works very well you watch 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.930
 also the version a little bit more 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.030
 loose that will give a look a little bit 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.479
 more sees a little cooler 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.830
 so we do the same thing except me 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.990
 so I put the hair even more 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.810
 up and sometimes I pull myself on my 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.810
 hair and so here we are again 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.980
 and suddenly you will see that you 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.450
 falls a little bit more and it's a look 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.310
 a little bit cooler you can a 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.030
 little pulled on the bun for it to be 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.980
 a little more loose 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.900
 and yes it's a little more relaxed to 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.940
 the back and that's the look 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.180
 that I would have for example the weekend 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.200
 and that's about the elastics because 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.570
 maybe it's worth it 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.250
 discuss I buy my own part that a 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.350
 rate at h &amp; m 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.580
 these are my favorites it's what costs 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.750
 the cheapest they do not have a duration of 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.889
 limited life since when you see the 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.020
 mass of hair that I was going to me 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.980
 pass about 1 all one does not pass 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.060
 not that much but I think I 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.430
 breaks at least one every three 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.800
 weeks or months 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.580
 personally I always choose them 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.990
 only with steel that without 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.060
 no betali part since I find 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.889
 that it damages the hair enormously so 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.060
 here I always opt for this if you 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.040
 obviously have larger ones that 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.050
 are more elastic so beefier and 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.020
 I opt for the classics and who 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.430
 buy by lot 2 I'm no longer ten 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.530
 or twelve but that's it I always use 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.139
 these one another elastic ty that 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.340
 works well what are the I had to me 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.610
 remember how it's called twists 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.870
 tape i think twister swiss bank my 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.130
 sail I'm not going to put that on 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.500
 the video we find in particular on the

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.240
 are just less elastic that 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.919
 marks a little less hair and 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.940
 who skillfully hair and that exists 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.900
 in many different colors and 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.430
 it's a little bit wider 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.940
 pretty cute that can allow to 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.740

 I hope the video helps you and so 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.130

 pictures on social networks if you 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.100
 make them so that I can go 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.630
 see that and then make you a little 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.010
 hello because it really made me 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.020
 laugh a lot since I have a 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.060
 little shame to show you the tutorial there 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.410
 is in fact nothing 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.940
 it's really not a hairstyle 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.810
 incredible to achieve for as little as 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.940
 now you have understood the 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.230
 obviously more beautiful technique 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.820
 hair are no longer and joly since 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.590
 you can do maximum laps and 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.790
 maybe that's why we 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.230
 had asked me the question quite recently 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.160
 since right now I have hair 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.720
 really very very very very long and 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.860
 suddenly you have more hair and more 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.150
 Chilean is big and it's true that it 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.790
 maybe one side a little bit more 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.720
 impressive is even prettier yes 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.800
 besides I had not thought but it's 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.520
 probably for that I had been asked 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.870
 the question recently 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.700
 so here I hope the video has you 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.600

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.440
