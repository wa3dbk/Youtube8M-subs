00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.389 

it<00:00:00.900> has<00:00:01.020> been<00:00:01.199> setting<00:00:01.530> up<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.800> alternator

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
it has been setting up this alternator

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.170 
it has been setting up this alternator
for<00:00:02.730> my<00:00:02.899> Corolla<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:04.140> think<00:00:04.319> it's<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.500> 2011<00:00:05.180> is

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
for my Corolla I think it's a 2011 is

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.350 
for my Corolla I think it's a 2011 is
they've<00:00:06.420> run<00:00:06.660> as<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> generator<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:08.360> there's

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
they've run as a generator and there's

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.000 
they've run as a generator and there's
only<00:00:09.480> three<00:00:09.870> wires<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.469> need<00:00:10.679> other<00:00:10.889> than

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
only three wires that I need other than

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:19.360 
only three wires that I need other than
the<00:00:11.219> ground<00:00:11.460> we're<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:11.969> down<00:00:12.090> here

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.130 

doesn't<00:00:19.970> want<00:00:20.090> to<00:00:20.150> focus<00:00:20.270> on<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.540> mess<00:00:20.840> it's<00:00:20.990> in

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
doesn't want to focus on a mess it's in

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.350 
doesn't want to focus on a mess it's in
here<00:00:21.320> so<00:00:22.280> you<00:00:22.370> got<00:00:22.550> this<00:00:22.820> one<00:00:23.030> right<00:00:23.150> here

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
here so you got this one right here

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.150 
here so you got this one right here
which<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:23.870> usually<00:00:24.530> the<00:00:24.620> connection<00:00:24.980> to<00:00:25.070> the

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
which is usually the connection to the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.920 
which is usually the connection to the
battery<00:00:26.500> one<00:00:27.500> of<00:00:27.620> these<00:00:27.770> is<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.760> computer<00:00:29.300> not

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
battery one of these is the computer not

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.290 
battery one of these is the computer not
really<00:00:30.080> understand<00:00:30.970> understanding<00:00:31.970> what<00:00:32.180> it

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
really understand understanding what it

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.500 
really understand understanding what it
does<00:00:32.480> but<00:00:32.840> I<00:00:33.290> think<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:34.130> read<00:00:34.280> was<00:00:34.430> that<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:35.330> gets

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
does but I think I read was that it gets

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.299 
does but I think I read was that it gets
pulled<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.900> ground<00:00:36.020> sometimes<00:00:36.559> I<00:00:36.860> believe

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
pulled to ground sometimes I believe

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.430 
pulled to ground sometimes I believe
that<00:00:37.489> might<00:00:37.640> shut<00:00:37.910> off<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.210> alternator<00:00:38.410> so<00:00:39.410> I

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
that might shut off the alternator so I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.990 
that might shut off the alternator so I
just<00:00:39.590> have<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.800> wired<00:00:39.950> 12<00:00:40.340> volts<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:40.730> keep<00:00:40.880> it

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
just have it wired 12 volts to keep it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.260 
just have it wired 12 volts to keep it
on<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:42.530> other<00:00:42.680> one<00:00:42.980> is<00:00:43.700> a<00:00:44.559> believe<00:00:46.270> the

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
on and the other one is a believe the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.570 
on and the other one is a believe the
ignition<00:00:47.720> so<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.320> other<00:00:48.410> one<00:00:48.590> gets<00:00:49.100> connected

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
ignition so the other one gets connected

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.010 
ignition so the other one gets connected
to<00:00:49.790> 12<00:00:50.059> volt<00:00:50.239> when<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:50.450> turn<00:00:50.570> on<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.720> key<00:00:50.930> I

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
to 12 volt when you turn on the key I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.380 
to 12 volt when you turn on the key I
just<00:00:51.200> have<00:00:51.290> it<00:00:51.410> connected<00:00:51.739> all<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:51.949> time<00:00:52.390> that

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
just have it connected all the time that

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.410 
just have it connected all the time that
runs<00:00:53.570> down<00:00:53.720> there<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.140> Junction<00:00:54.650> there

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
runs down there to that Junction there

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.910 
runs down there to that Junction there
and<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.480> have<00:00:56.629> a<00:00:56.660> little<00:00:56.900> time<00:00:57.199> 12<00:00:57.620> volt<00:00:57.769> power

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
and I have a little time 12 volt power

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.860 
and I have a little time 12 volt power
supply<00:00:58.159> that<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:58.940> barely<00:00:59.300> enough<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.720> get

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
supply that this is barely enough to get

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.780 
supply that this is barely enough to get
it<00:00:59.989> running<00:01:00.080> I<00:01:00.379> don't<00:01:01.250> have<00:01:01.370> any<00:01:01.489> computer

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
it running I don't have any computer

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.450 
it running I don't have any computer
power<00:01:01.970> supplies<00:01:02.269> out<00:01:02.480> handy<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.250> so<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.280> have

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
power supplies out handy so so I have

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.610 
power supplies out handy so so I have
that<00:01:04.610> connected<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.059> their<00:01:05.269> this<00:01:06.080> gets<00:01:06.350> turned

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
that connected to their this gets turned

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.790 
that connected to their this gets turned
on<00:01:06.800> with<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:07.730> button<00:01:08.120> right<00:01:08.150> here<00:01:08.620> which<00:01:09.620> it

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
on with this button right here which it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.980 
on with this button right here which it
goes<00:01:10.070> into<00:01:10.370> that<00:01:10.460> case<00:01:11.270> over<00:01:11.570> there<00:01:11.690> which<00:01:11.840> is

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
goes into that case over there which is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.899 
goes into that case over there which is
how<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.170> contactor<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.979> rely<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.340> turn<00:01:13.760> on

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
how the contactor and a rely to turn on

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.110 
how the contactor and a rely to turn on
things<00:01:14.180> remotely<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:16.159> button<00:01:17.030> is

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
things remotely and the button is

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.240 
things remotely and the button is
isolated<00:01:17.720> from<00:01:17.840> I'm<00:01:18.140> in<00:01:18.290> 20<00:01:18.530> volts<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:18.920> was<00:01:19.190> a

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
isolated from I'm in 20 volts it was a

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.830 
isolated from I'm in 20 volts it was a
transformer<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:19.970> could<00:01:20.090> steps<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.570> down<00:01:20.690> to

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
transformer that could steps it down to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.819 
transformer that could steps it down to
about<00:01:20.990> 15<00:01:21.850> anyway<00:01:22.850> yeah<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.350> just<00:01:24.350> have<00:01:24.649> this

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
about 15 anyway yeah so just have this

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.950 
about 15 anyway yeah so just have this
screwdriver<00:01:25.700> handle<00:01:26.119> tape<00:01:26.360> down<00:01:26.600> here<00:01:26.840> it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
screwdriver handle tape down here it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.200 
screwdriver handle tape down here it
looks<00:01:27.200> pretty<00:01:27.950> ugly<00:01:28.070> but<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.490> works<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.060> then

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
looks pretty ugly but it works and then

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.760 
looks pretty ugly but it works and then
you're<00:01:29.570> spinning<00:01:29.780> with<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.079> drill<00:01:30.320> on<00:01:30.530> high

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
you're spinning with the drill on high

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.330 
you're spinning with the drill on high
and<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.990> should<00:01:33.200> be<00:01:33.290> spinning<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.710> lot<00:01:33.890> faster

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
and it should be spinning a lot faster

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.399 
and it should be spinning a lot faster
it's<00:01:35.000> just<00:01:35.149> barely<00:01:35.420> spinning<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.049> get<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.289> up

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
it's just barely spinning to get it up

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.020 
it's just barely spinning to get it up
like<00:01:36.619> when<00:01:36.860> that<00:01:37.009> battery<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.520> full<00:01:37.759> on<00:01:37.789> the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
like when that battery is full on the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.179 
like when that battery is full on the
drill<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:39.049> is<00:01:39.200> barely<00:01:39.469> enough<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:39.920> get<00:01:40.070> it

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
drill this is barely enough to get it

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.800 
drill this is barely enough to get it
running<00:01:40.340> at<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.640> high<00:01:41.060> enough<00:01:41.240> speed<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.659> order

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
running at a high enough speed in order

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.370 
running at a high enough speed in order
to<00:01:41.930> generate<00:01:42.439> over<00:01:42.680> twelve<00:01:43.460> volts<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:45.200> have

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
to generate over twelve volts and I have

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:54.340 
to generate over twelve volts and I have
a<00:01:45.409> little<00:01:45.710> snapshot<00:01:45.920> of<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.340> waveform<00:01:46.789> here

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.429 

boo

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.590 

because<00:01:57.950> I'll<00:01:58.100> just<00:01:58.280> like<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:58.909> before<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.420> was

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
because I'll just like it before I was

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.319 
because I'll just like it before I was
toasting<00:02:00.079> in<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.859> comments<00:02:02.289> so<00:02:03.289> um<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:04.329> might

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
toasting in the comments so um I might
