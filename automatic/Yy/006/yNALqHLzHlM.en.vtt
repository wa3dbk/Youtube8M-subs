this at the bottom and actually cover

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.650 
this at the bottom and actually cover
the<00:00:47.070> setting<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.640> i'm<00:00:47.789> trying<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.090> mimic<00:00:48.360> this

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the setting off i'm trying to mimic this

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.830 
the setting off i'm trying to mimic this
right<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.250> somewhat<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.120> but

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
right there like somewhat like that but

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.160 
right there like somewhat like that but
what<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> found<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:53.510> actually<00:00:54.510> loses<00:00:55.020> your

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
what I found that is actually loses your

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.200 
what I found that is actually loses your
signal<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.620> everybody's<00:00:55.980> used<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:57.000> if

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
signal but everybody's used to but if

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.170 
signal but everybody's used to but if
you<00:00:57.329> hold<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:58.309> wait<00:00:59.309> where<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> sim<00:00:59.910> tray

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you hold it some wait where the sim tray

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.689 
you hold it some wait where the sim tray
is<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.530> sim<00:01:01.800> tray<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> hold

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
is right there your sim tray if you hold

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.680 
is right there your sim tray if you hold
it<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.239> along<00:01:03.539> your

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it right there and then along your

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.530 
it right there and then along your
fingers<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.250> opposite<00:01:05.250> angle<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.299> will

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
fingers on the opposite angle you will

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
fingers on the opposite angle you will
get<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.049> nice<00:01:07.350> signal<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> what's<00:01:08.400> good<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
get a nice signal and what's good is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.940 
get a nice signal and what's good is
that<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.939> tenders<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:10.350> bad<00:01:10.619> i'm

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that your tenders are not that bad i'm

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.070 
that your tenders are not that bad i'm
your<00:01:11.549> fingers<00:01:11.880> might<00:01:12.119> slip<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.930> but

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
your fingers might slip a little bit but

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.510 
your fingers might slip a little bit but
that<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.409> takes<00:01:13.680> some<00:01:13.710> getting<00:01:14.040> used<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.400> as

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that this takes some getting used to as

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.039 
that this takes some getting used to as
you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:14.880> my<00:01:15.090> antenna<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> left<00:01:15.900> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you can see my antenna on the left is

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.710 
you can see my antenna on the left is
cleared<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> right

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
cleared and so is the one on the right

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.060 
cleared and so is the one on the right
so<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.020> probably<00:01:19.170> preferred<00:01:19.770> why<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
so this is probably preferred why I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.219 
so this is probably preferred why I
recommended<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> hold<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> phone<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.840> Wi-Fi

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
recommended to hold the phone your Wi-Fi

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.590 
recommended to hold the phone your Wi-Fi
on<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.310> damn<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.820> might<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.330> touched

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
on one like it damn it might get touched

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.800 
on one like it damn it might get touched
by<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.200> holding<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.009> somewhat<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.360> but

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
by you holding it somewhat like that but

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.969 
by you holding it somewhat like that but
that's<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.380> big<00:01:28.500> deal<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.799> got

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that's not really a big deal if you got

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.429 
that's not really a big deal if you got
for<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> 3g<00:01:29.939> arm<00:01:32.360> but<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> only<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.900> second

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
for you 3g arm but the only the second

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.140 
for you 3g arm but the only the second
downside<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> proximity<00:01:35.640> sensor<00:01:35.790> in

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
downside is that the proximity sensor in

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.120 
downside is that the proximity sensor in
the<00:01:36.180> phone<00:01:36.390> um<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.500> immediately<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.950> great

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the phone um this immediately that great

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.890 
the phone um this immediately that great
yet<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.850> Apple<00:01:39.210> set<00:01:39.390> has<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> update<00:01:39.720> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
yet the Apple set has to update that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.550 
yet the Apple set has to update that
driver<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.360> wait<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.630> next<00:01:42.869> iOS<00:01:43.259> upgrade

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
driver so wait for the next iOS upgrade

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.630 
driver so wait for the next iOS upgrade
and<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:44.670> fix<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.180> patch<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.659> you
