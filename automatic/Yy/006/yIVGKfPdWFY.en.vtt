00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.650 
might i get minus ammo on that but uh
all<00:02:16.070> right<00:02:16.130> i<00:02:16.370> think<00:02:16.459> we<00:02:16.910> already<00:02:17.150> have<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
all right i think we already have the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.360 
all right i think we already have the
loophole<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.200> let's<00:02:18.350> actually<00:02:18.530> go<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.130> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
loophole so let's actually go in and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.650 
loophole so let's actually go in and
delete<00:02:20.120> these<00:02:20.480> stupid<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.050> we<00:02:21.170> just<00:02:21.350> got<00:02:22.660> so

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
delete these stupid so we just got so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.410 
delete these stupid so we just got so
get<00:02:24.020> really<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.290> KP<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> believer<00:02:25.420> gloves

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
get really is KP a believer gloves

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.300 
get really is KP a believer gloves
that's<00:02:27.020> gonna<00:02:27.200> bring<00:02:27.410> us<00:02:27.560> up<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.709> level<00:02:27.920> three

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
that's gonna bring us up to level three

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.090 
that's gonna bring us up to level three
and<00:02:28.930> we<00:02:29.930> gotta<00:02:30.140> get<00:02:30.230> rid<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.620> loophole

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
and we gotta get rid of the loophole

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.650 
and we gotta get rid of the loophole
let's<00:02:31.610> see<00:02:31.790> where<00:02:32.030> would<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.150> be<00:02:34.510> there<00:02:35.510> it

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
let's see where would that be there it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.370 
let's see where would that be there it
is<00:02:36.430> yeah<00:02:37.430> we<00:02:37.549> got<00:02:37.700> two<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.060> them<00:02:38.150> are<00:02:38.330> t<00:02:38.480> i<00:02:38.630> have

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
is yeah we got two of them are t i have

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.250 
is yeah we got two of them are t i have
the<00:02:39.530> other<00:02:39.650> pie<00:02:39.920> tech<00:02:40.269> elite<00:02:41.269> very<00:02:41.540> into<00:02:41.900> this

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
the other pie tech elite very into this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.580 
the other pie tech elite very into this
is<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.470> exploit<00:02:43.450> plus<00:02:44.450> three<00:02:44.900> range<00:02:45.230> mice

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
is the exploit plus three range mice

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.160 
is the exploit plus three range mice
language<00:02:46.010> might<00:02:46.220> as<00:02:46.280> well<00:02:46.370> fire<00:02:46.580> right<00:02:46.730> I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
language might as well fire right I

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.150 
language might as well fire right I
probably<00:02:48.170> use<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.410> loophole<00:02:48.769> if<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.010> had<00:02:49.100> a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
probably use the loophole if I had a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.050 
probably use the loophole if I had a
choice<00:02:49.370> there<00:02:50.470> alright<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:51.769> of<00:02:52.220> course<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
choice there alright so of course the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.729 
choice there alright so of course the
last<00:02:53.269> thing<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.870> sometimes<00:02:54.080> forget<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.530> do

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
last thing that I sometimes forget to do

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.850 
last thing that I sometimes forget to do
we're<00:02:55.489> gonna<00:02:55.760> go<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.299> check<00:02:56.690> out<00:02:56.930> my<00:02:57.320> combat

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
we're gonna go and check out my combat

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.550 
we're gonna go and check out my combat
record<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:59.180> KD<00:02:59.510> dropped<00:02:59.810> a<00:02:59.959> little<00:03:00.170> bit<00:03:00.290> again

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
record so KD dropped a little bit again

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.130 
record so KD dropped a little bit again
a<00:03:01.370> wooden<00:03:01.910> loss<00:03:02.030> ratio<00:03:02.450> dropped<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.810> little<00:03:02.989> bit

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
a wooden loss ratio dropped a little bit

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.430 
a wooden loss ratio dropped a little bit
en<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.910> score<00:03:04.910> per<00:03:05.000> minutes<00:03:05.269> about<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:06.200> same

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
en and score per minutes about the same

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.270 
en and score per minutes about the same
i<00:03:06.470> guess<00:03:06.850> we<00:03:07.850> haven't<00:03:08.030> quite<00:03:08.390> reached<00:03:09.280> 40,000

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
i guess we haven't quite reached 40,000

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.979 
i guess we haven't quite reached 40,000
kills<00:03:10.430> when<00:03:10.579> you<00:03:10.640> 25<00:03:11.120> more<00:03:11.269> kills<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.660> do<00:03:11.810> that

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
kills when you 25 more kills to do that

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.360 
kills when you 25 more kills to do that
but<00:03:12.530> i<00:03:12.560> think<00:03:12.590> that's<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:13.010> pretty<00:03:13.160> cool

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
but i think that's a pretty cool

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.940 
but i think that's a pretty cool
