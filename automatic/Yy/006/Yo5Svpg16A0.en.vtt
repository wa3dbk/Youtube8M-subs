I tried applying it with my fingers and
then<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.360> finally<00:01:57.719> tried<00:01:58.079> applying<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.710> with

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
then I finally tried applying it with

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.109 
then I finally tried applying it with
the<00:01:59.130> Sigma<00:01:59.610> angled<00:02:00.149> top<00:02:00.390> kabuki<00:02:00.740> f-84

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
the Sigma angled top kabuki f-84

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.270 
the Sigma angled top kabuki f-84
strangely<00:02:03.119> enough<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:04.020> gives<00:02:04.469> me<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.040> best

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
strangely enough this gives me the best

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.889 
strangely enough this gives me the best
results<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.090> wet<00:02:06.270> right<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.750> I

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
results and it's wet right now because I

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.830 
results and it's wet right now because I
just<00:02:07.079> cleaned<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.550> but<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.000> reason<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.599> is

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
just cleaned it but the reason is is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.900 
just cleaned it but the reason is is
this<00:02:10.170> foundation<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.670> very

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
this foundation you have to do in very

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.160 
this foundation you have to do in very
small<00:02:12.239> portions

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
small portions

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.880 
small portions
cuz<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.740> dries<00:02:14.069> very<00:02:14.370> very<00:02:15.150> fast<00:02:15.620> it's<00:02:16.620> good

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
cuz it dries very very fast it's good

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.040 
cuz it dries very very fast it's good
they<00:02:17.130> say<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.580> all<00:02:17.700> skin<00:02:18.090> types<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.660> think<00:02:18.690> this

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
they say for all skin types I think this

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.900 
they say for all skin types I think this
is<00:02:19.200> better<00:02:19.410> for<00:02:19.709> like<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.980> combination<00:02:20.340> oily

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
is better for like a combination oily

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.130 
is better for like a combination oily
you<00:02:21.360> could<00:02:21.480> probably<00:02:21.660> wear<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:21.959> if<00:02:22.050> you're

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
you could probably wear it if you're

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.900 
you could probably wear it if you're
normal<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.860> you're<00:02:22.980> dry<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.310> have<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.580> feeling

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
normal if you're dry I have a feeling

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.490 
normal if you're dry I have a feeling
it's<00:02:24.030> going<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> really<00:02:24.569> adhere<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.230> some<00:02:25.410> of

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
it's going to really adhere to some of

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.559 
it's going to really adhere to some of
those<00:02:25.590> spots<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.160> put<00:02:26.700> about<00:02:26.790> two<00:02:27.090> pumps<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.540> a

wearing it people really like it I have

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.830

used it with setting powder and without
setting<00:05:13.320> powder<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.970> think<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.300> key<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.570> this

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
setting powder I think the key to this

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.409 
setting powder I think the key to this
is<00:05:16.199> I<00:05:16.440> have<00:05:16.949> needed<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.520> set<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:17.940> on<00:05:18.120> my

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
fine without setting it but I definitely

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.650
