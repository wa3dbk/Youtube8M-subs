00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.500
 hey people this is the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.980
 and that's what we all in this 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.350
 Packaging is 100 recyclable 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.900
 and even the manual as well as ink 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.730
 based on soy we finally have 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.730
 again a printed manual on it 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.039
 short instructions one and book and a few 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.660
 information back guarantee 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.190
 Of course we have a modular one 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.520
 power supply means we have this here 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.130
 data cable ends up on micro usb together 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.659
 So with this power supply socket 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.460
 otherwise we simply use it 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.499
 to load it on the pc or data 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.600
 exchange 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:40.850
 we also have a headset that is 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.339
 a headset with these attachments to 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.530
 possibility laid alternately we have 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.260
 a remote control and the cable in the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.129
 compared to the galaxy s3 or note 2 has 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.289
 will be changed again 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.999
 it has become thinner and wider 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.159
 that should make sure that it is not so 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.949
 I think you know that 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.920
 and now it's smartphone time 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.899
 the same size as the galaxy s3 has 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.119
 a metal frame of the 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.579
 but unfortunately not made of metal yes 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.590
 but a politician today looks like this 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.689
 it is good in the hand it has one 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.640
 really great size the back 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.469
 we have seen the white version 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.659
 with his little pattern stocked times 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.509
 see if we recognize that now 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.810
 we that the white version looks similar 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.549
 out 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.920
 Let's go into detail and 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.899
 start to see there on the left side 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.609
 we of course in the middle of the frame and with 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.259
 a good pressure point, the loudness 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.229
 Throw this into really very good ones 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.990
 pressure point and sits up on this 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.520
 small wobble clearly firm yes completely 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.259
 there is nothing left until we reach the bottom 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.659
 go there we have a secondary 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.700
 microphone or no we are below as 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.009
 we use the main microphone to call 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.899
 and a micro usb connection with nhl 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.579
 possibility means with an adapter 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.979
 can spend like hdmi 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.780
 the frame gets longer and we land 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.909
 the one out of power button the one 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.710
 has decent pressure point that is here 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.380
 By the way, a slide on it is here 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.939
 The case does not look weird at the top 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.369
 we have an infrared sensor around it 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.030
 device as a phone 1 remote control use 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.130
 to be able to 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.759
 a secondary microphone to active 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.610
 Noise reduction and 1 3 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.769
 5 mm jack if we do not have the back 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.659
 that's about this one 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.569
 we have small rags down here in 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.459
 speakers then see the polycarbonate 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.530
 backside housing in the collections 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.810
 Foundation a single led and up here 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.849
 the camera with 3 10 megapixel 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.790
 dissolves and of course videos in full hd 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.470
 makes her stand out about 1 mm 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.989
 now you could see that very well 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.099
 open the back and see what 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.349
 we find there 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.970
 I have already inserted the battery 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.000
 is of course included and delivered 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.310
 2,600 mah the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.290
 Top is the speaker is clear 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.190
 bigger than you expect it to be 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.629
 two sleds 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.819
 here we have the one for the 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.359
 micro sim card and here we can 64 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.010
 expand gigabytes via micro sd card 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.810
 Overall, the smartphone has more important 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.950
 but the internet continues to be like that 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.370
 you probably have in the last 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.700
 only just under 8 5 gigabytes notice 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.299
 for free disposal 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.040
 Of course we have one too 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.849
 front and here of course dominates 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.340
 the 5 inch full hd display is it 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.590
 a really really chic part 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.410
 what kind of panel do we have 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.629
 of course a super amoled panel wws 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.739
 actually from samsung know this time 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.410
 of course with full hd so 1920 x 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.299
 1080 pixels is the connection to the pc 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.859
 we do not have it anymore but we want it 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.660
 the display is no longer accurate 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.549
 but we want to detail 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.709
 what are they going to go above 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.669
 or what we do not see the 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.799
 on the left we have a small one 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.419
 Notification led the blue lights 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.000
 if there is any news 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.650
 or red if you miss it 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.569
 the first sensor and that is one 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.430
 Light sensor that fits naturally 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.500
 automatically the display brightness 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.810
 when writing back to samsung 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.909
 earpiece a gesture sensor and a 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.829
 distance sensor and a 2 megapixel 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.459
 front camera the videos also in full hd 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.650
 can record 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.199
 we see that the frame around the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.540
 Display not so wide is wonderful 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.519
 Below we see a physical one 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.190
 home-button undertake a back and forth 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.229
 a home taste yes, besides, we see 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.300
 the series clearly rounded corners 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.160
 and we see a lot 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.350
 in the frame of the me to the display glass 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.690
 Only after this comes Metallic 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.770
 acting framework is the total 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.130
 samsung galaxy s 4 137 mm high 70 mm 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.800
 wide and 7 9 millimeters thick or thin 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.410
 that's pretty much the size 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.310
 galaxy s3 not exactly but 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.260
 pretty much 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.110
 it weighs when you pick it up 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.660
 with the battery 130 grams and that fits 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.820
 very good to the size of the battery I have 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.160
 already said is 2600 milliamp hours 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.930
 strong for it there are fat from them 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.270
 Thumbs up not out of my thumb 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.630
 Fed I would be a great fat 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.130
 thumb because it is great 16 gb we have 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.560
 intern memory I have already said 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.020
 but not quite as free 85 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.620
 about and the sar-worth on the head 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:07.730
 is 0 2 85 watts per kilogram 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.160
 on the body it is almost 040 39 900 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.140
 kilogram more precisely white and 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.180
 black are the available colors that 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.240
 I know you already see one time 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.280
 something around the 600 euro and Amazon 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.110
 or money is short, for example 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.419
 already delivery was mean when now 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.550
 then want to quickly drag it to it 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.680
 is an android 4.2 jelly bean 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.960
 smartphone and of course samsung 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.740
 the own surface touchwiz nature 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:38.360
 joecks in the version 2.0 over it must be yes 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.380
 this is how it is known here software 4 2 2 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.080
 1 1 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.020
 9 gigahertz dualcore my quad-core 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.720
 Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor drives 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.400
 the whole come to two gigabyte ram 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.220
 even more 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.190
 data connections are maximum hspa plus 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.919
 and if we can do it thanks to ours 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.419
 we have 42 2 mbit pro 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.330
 second available 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:05.990
 otherwise lte to a maximum of 100 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.390
 megabit / second and nfc south wlan 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:13.310
 powered by neat and with 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:15.020

 bluetooth 4.0 that's all it was 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.040
 my unboxing i hope it has you 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.560
 i am pleased about this 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.680
 device will definitely be a decent one 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.669
