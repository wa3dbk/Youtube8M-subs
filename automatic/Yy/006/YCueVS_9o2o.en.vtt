00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.209
 What we are going to tell you, can save lives, we invite you to watch the video 

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:07.939
 full. 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.619
 What should we and what can cyclists do to facilitate the 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.459
 overtaking of vehicles that want to overtake us? 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.169
 First and we will not tire of saying it 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.169
 respect to the rest of the occupants of the road 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.319
 and although it is obvious we can not stop saying that we should go 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.119
 circulating on the shoulder 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.729
 or else there is, as far to the right as possible of the road. 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.440
 Always referring to Spanish standards 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.300
 the cyclists can circulate in parallel of two in two as long as 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.360
 do not obstruct the normal running of other vehicles, 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.440
 find complicated traffic or conditions of reduced visibility 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.110
 in these cases they should circulate online 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.300
 also say that cyclists when overtaking 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.750
 they must maintain the distance of one and a half meters with respect to the vehicle 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.520
 that are advancing the same as the other way around 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.120
 and those produced between cyclists of the same one are not considered overtaking 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.030
 group. 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.600
 We all have to be aware that one of the reasons that more accidents 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.770
 provoke is the overtaking maneuver to a cyclist or group of cyclists. 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.150
 Any vehicle that is going to perform the overtaking maneuver must, 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.980
 First, make sure you can do it without endangering or 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.080
 cyclist neither to himself and of course indicate with the intermittent the maneuver 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.830
 never warn the cyclist with the horn as it could scare him. 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.590
 To advance safely we must know two things both 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.400
 very important: 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.900
 The first is that the safety distance is fundamental 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.539
 thus avoiding trample, 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.189
 frighten or provoke a blow of air 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.350
 that could make the cyclist fall, 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.340
 the minimum lateral distance, we insist minimum 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.900
 that we must leave between the right side of our vehicle and the cyclist or 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.950
 group of cyclists 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.780
 it's one and a half meters 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.549
 and this at least if it can be more 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.510
 better 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.800
 minimum one and a half meters, 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.030
 in Spain does not meet this rule 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.659
 is considered a serious offense and sanctioned with a fine of 200 euros and 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.819
 four card points, 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.519
 The second thing we need to know is that if we have to overtake one or more 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.530
 cyclists and the road section has a continuous line 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.239
 or express signal of not overtaking 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.139
 is allowed 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.989
 and we could say until forced to pass the continuous line to 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.930
 overtake the cyclist or group 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.869
 and will be able to occupy partial 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.399
 or totally the opposite lane 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:31.670
 as long as 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.519
 do not come a vehicle in front 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.150
 and do not get in danger or get upset 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.979
 the progress of cyclists traveling in the opposite direction 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.749
 in this case overtaking will be prohibited and we will have to reduce the 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:44.429
 speed 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.889
 even stop 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.309
 if necessary. 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:51.839
 Many people still do not know the rule of 1'5 but many more 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.979
 they do not know the rule that they can pass the solid line for 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.139
 overtake a cyclist properly 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.379
 and it is very important that you help us to get this information to the greatest 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.639
 number of possible people 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.299
 because we know what happens when a driver goes after the cyclist 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.510
 and does not find the possibility of overtaking without stepping on the continuous line 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.069
 in the end it ends up impatient and when the patience is over 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.870
 exceeds the cyclist in any way 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.959
 without stepping on the solid line 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.020
 because he does not know what he can 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.900
 pass it 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.459
 and this greatly increases the chances of an accident. 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.350
 Forever 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.320
 We ask you to share the videos on the networks or in any way to 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.200
 that the information reaches the greatest number of people in this case 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.039
 we beg 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:40.119
 because we know that this video can save lives, it can save your life. 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.879
 We only remember as we said in the previous video that in Mammoth we have 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.449
 this sticker to put the back of your vehicles and help 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.319
 to the dissemination of 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.019
 the norm of the meter and a half for overtaking 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.889
 you can get it for free at any of our stores 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.769
 or you can make an order in our online store mammoth.es 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.560
 as well 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.519
 we will include it for free. 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.939
 Nothing more, thank you very much for listening to us 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.979
 If you have been interesting, we thank you very much for the "I like" and the more 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.079
 have this video, 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.139
 better for everyone.
