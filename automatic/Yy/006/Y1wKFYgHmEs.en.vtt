 okay it's to childhood memories and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.150
 its timeless agreement we go 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.859
 start by making the marshmallow agree 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.930
 you're dipping with tea leaves 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.310
 gelatin leaves in cold water 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.779

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 ok here's two here I 'm going soaked 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.660
 sheets per household otherwise they risk 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.460
 to cause one between the screen and its 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.930
 hamlets hydrate of first agreement 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 phase you dive well well in 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.329
 cold water 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.770
 if if you are in summer you put 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.510
 some violations to announce a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.149
 super important phase of the road 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:49.680
 okay we'll start a little sugar 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:51.270
 cooked I put a third of what in water at 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.610
 background of a russia for a third of the weight 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.320
 sugar is here all that I put I put 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.079
 sugar at the bottom you see like that tape 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.270
 it falls alone and I'm going to wear 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.189
 to boil in sugar and I'm going to leather to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.240
 110 degrees nathan is clear i want to be 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.909
 at 110 degrees I will start to climb 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.650
 but white has nothing 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.200
 - you stir then what is important 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.630
 in clean sugar from the clean water of the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 nickel sugar and that touches nothing a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.930

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.580
 will see talk and little words there 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.470

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.379
 tribute and Latin is a moment of 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.840
 bloom and loose always bedridden 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.520
 see it's cooked and here now I 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.110
 receive say 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.180
 thoroughly he is dead 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.269
 three cabinets 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.600
 you see not favorable and firm she 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.180
 is well chilled and here I am going to add 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.750
 Maj and the tribune 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.750
 the number of rooms 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.730
 and there I will accelerate 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.030
 cool again for two 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.030
 three minutes 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:40.340

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:49.640
 italian ok super farm for 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:51.500
 Quebec soup whose vaults and there she 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.810
 is cooked is good then we touch them 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:00.310
 the more we go as soon as a garnish our little ones 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.310
 molds and what's important is to 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.220
 to support you go so that it goes 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.230
 deep down that repeat the operation that 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.840
 is no air bubbles you see it needs to 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.940
 really there you see not hesitate we're going 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.100
 repeat the operation for each small 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.820
 us us intact ac who after we go 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.770
 to leave well like that here first 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.090
 range is here and we will attack attack 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.810
 a little bit to avoid it 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.540
 dry little teddy bear and is at once 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.550
 it's going fast and it costs more 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.270
 late only slightly 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.380
 here and now you will put 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.700
 in a cool place cooking during 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.320
 an hour to two hours finally that it is 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.300
 know and that gelatin does not work 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.460
 at any time nowadays will be 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.990
 frozen we unrolled them very 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.130
 delicately we put a little spades 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.840
 it's because it's for power 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.660
 catch it in the chocolate we made 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.470
 melt chocolate then in a bain-marie 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.360
 or in the microwave accord pure chocolate there 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.320
 we're going to make them dark chocolate what is 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.730
 very good in the air are it's also 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.790
 milk chocolate yes okay even 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.040
 chocolate but our chocolates 5 bar 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.760
 of talc and so we remove a small 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.240
 little the surplus one soaked them in the 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.240
 chocolate but 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.159
 you leave well drained to remove 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:18.749
 the chocolate over and you have 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:20.430
 planted news from the support and well you 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:23.009
 let your little bears freeze 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.560
 and you will taste without any 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.669
 moderation then redon so now 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.669
