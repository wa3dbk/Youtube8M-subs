00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
consume more blueberries and probably

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.670 
consume more blueberries and probably
anything<00:02:17.920> else<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:19.260> they've<00:02:20.260> got<00:02:20.410> some<00:02:20.560> great

talk about coconut flakes and when it
comes<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.490> sugar<00:02:33.700> paleo<00:02:34.540> coconut<00:02:34.990> flakes<00:02:35.230> only

so yeah three ingredients low and carb
low<00:02:49.420> in<00:02:49.540> calorie<00:02:49.990> they<00:02:50.230> got<00:02:50.380> fiber<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:50.980> there

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
low in calorie they got fiber in there

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.350 
low in calorie they got fiber in there
and<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:52.360> couple<00:02:52.600> grams<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:53.020> protein<00:02:53.410> as<00:02:53.590> well<00:02:54.360> so

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
and a couple grams of protein as well so

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.199 
and a couple grams of protein as well so
we<00:02:56.350> picked<00:02:57.130> these<00:02:57.220> up<00:02:57.400> there<00:02:57.550> Julianne<00:02:57.910> bakery

stuff and they got the K now for keto
it's<00:03:19.930> getting<00:03:20.170> more<00:03:20.620> more<00:03:21.030> popular<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.750> if

you're<00:03:23.380> not<00:03:23.500> familiar<00:03:23.620> with<00:03:23.890> ketosis<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.540> a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
you're not familiar with ketosis it is a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.400 
you're not familiar with ketosis it is a
great<00:03:25.930> way<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.110> lose<00:03:26.440> weight<00:03:26.500> get<00:03:27.489> healthy<00:03:27.519> and

don't<00:03:29.410> confuse<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:30.040> with<00:03:30.300> ketoacidosis

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
don't confuse this with ketoacidosis

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.229 
don't confuse this with ketoacidosis
which<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.989> something<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.890> type<00:03:33.370> 1<00:03:33.580> diabetics

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
which is something that type 1 diabetics

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.670 
which is something that type 1 diabetics
can<00:03:35.970> obtain<00:03:36.970> when<00:03:37.330> getting<00:03:37.720> into<00:03:38.019> ketosis

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
can obtain when getting into ketosis

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.870 
can obtain when getting into ketosis
it's<00:03:39.640> like<00:03:39.820> an<00:03:39.940> extreme<00:03:40.390> version<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:41.080> ketosis

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
it's like an extreme version of ketosis

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.840 
it's like an extreme version of ketosis
so<00:03:42.880> I<00:03:43.560> just<00:03:44.560> experimented<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.430> little<00:03:45.549> more

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
so I just experimented a little more

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.460 
so I just experimented a little more
getting<00:03:46.209> deeper<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.660> deeper<00:03:46.780> into<00:03:47.170> ketosis

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
getting deeper and deeper into ketosis

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.400 
getting deeper and deeper into ketosis
and<00:03:48.209> instantly<00:03:49.209> dropped<00:03:49.600> about<00:03:49.870> four<00:03:50.110> pounds

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
and instantly dropped about four pounds

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.640 
and instantly dropped about four pounds
slimmed<00:03:51.370> down<00:03:51.489> probably<00:03:52.269> an<00:03:52.750> inch<00:03:53.290> off<00:03:53.470> my

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
slimmed down probably an inch off my

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.610 
slimmed down probably an inch off my
waist<00:03:53.890> yet<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.519> was<00:03:54.640> still<00:03:54.790> eating<00:03:55.230> very<00:03:56.230> very

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
waist yet I was still eating very very

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.640 
waist yet I was still eating very very
very<00:03:56.980> strict<00:03:57.430> paleo<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.180> just<00:03:58.630> dropped<00:03:58.989> carbs

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
very strict paleo I just dropped carbs

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.330 
very strict paleo I just dropped carbs
even<00:04:00.100> lower<00:04:00.310> felt<00:04:01.269> great<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:02.340> personally

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
even lower felt great and personally

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.120 
even lower felt great and personally
after<00:04:03.580> a<00:04:04.060> couple<00:04:04.269> weeks<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.840> that<00:04:04.989> I'll<00:04:05.290> hurry

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
after a couple weeks of that I'll hurry

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.670 
after a couple weeks of that I'll hurry
up<00:04:06.280> with<00:04:06.519> some<00:04:06.700> sweet<00:04:06.850> potato<00:04:07.440> once<00:04:08.440> in<00:04:08.590> a

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
while but for the most part I'm in

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.120 
while but for the most part I'm in
ketosis<00:04:10.930> for<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.620> solid<00:04:12.280> week<00:04:12.519> on<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.330> off<00:04:13.450> and

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
ketosis for a solid week on and off and

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.699 
ketosis for a solid week on and off and
feel<00:04:15.130> great<00:04:15.390> there's<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.630> less<00:04:17.019> need<00:04:17.680> for

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
feel great there's a less need for

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.640 
feel great there's a less need for
