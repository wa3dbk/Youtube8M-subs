or you put it on this side the sealing
ring<00:01:24.729> is<00:01:24.969> identical<00:01:25.570> on<00:01:25.750> both<00:01:26.229> sides<00:01:26.770> so

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
ring is identical on both sides so

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.300 
ring is identical on both sides so
simply<00:01:28.119> what<00:01:28.329> you<00:01:28.360> do<00:01:28.689> is<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.409> put<00:01:29.649> it<00:01:29.740> inside

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
sealing ring rack right here fits inside

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.649 
sealing ring rack right here fits inside
the<00:01:39.880> track<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:42.369> sealing<00:01:42.789> ring<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.149> so<00:01:43.600> you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
the track of the sealing ring and so you

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.410 
the track of the sealing ring and so you
just<00:01:43.930> keep<00:01:44.170> on<00:01:44.469> pressing<00:01:45.130> with<00:01:45.880> your<00:01:46.060> finger
