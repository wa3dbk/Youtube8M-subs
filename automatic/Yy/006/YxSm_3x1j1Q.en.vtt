factor<00:04:54.349> that's<00:04:54.530> been<00:04:54.710> stressed<00:04:55.099> in<00:04:55.250> this

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
factor that's been stressed in this

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.879 
factor that's been stressed in this
program<00:04:55.820> for<00:04:56.150> years<00:04:56.389> is<00:04:56.659> just<00:04:57.259> to<00:04:57.440> underscore

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
program for years is just to underscore

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.370 
program for years is just to underscore
it<00:04:58.099> again<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:58.460> again<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.940> really

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
it again and again it really

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.560 
it again and again it really
adds<00:04:59.980> to<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.310> fun<00:05:00.520> factor<00:05:00.790> because<00:05:01.270> silly

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
adds to the fun factor because silly

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.330 
adds to the fun factor because silly
doesn't<00:05:01.870> have<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.200> worry<00:05:02.800> that<00:05:02.920> they're<00:05:03.220> going
