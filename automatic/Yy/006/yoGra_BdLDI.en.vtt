year we've added to the brilliant finish
to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> whole<00:00:45.120> series<00:00:45.570> now<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.829> does<00:00:47.129> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
to the whole series now what that does I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.889 
to the whole series now what that does I
mean<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.969> get<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.149> difference<00:00:48.809> in

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
mean you get the difference in

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.560 
mean you get the difference in
appearance<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.980> shiny<00:00:50.309> luster<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.390> also

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
appearance so the shiny luster but also

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290 
appearance so the shiny luster but also
by<00:00:51.899> applying<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:53.100> buff<00:00:53.340> surface<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
by applying that that buff surface it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.819 
by applying that that buff surface it
actually<00:00:54.449> heats<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.989> symbol<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> gives

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
actually heats that symbol up and gives

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.040 
actually heats that symbol up and gives
it<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.160> second<00:00:56.699> tempering<00:00:57.090> which<00:00:57.480> adds<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
it a second tempering which adds to the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.860 
it a second tempering which adds to the
sustaining<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.890> gives<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.370> you<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.149> more

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
sustaining and gives it a you know more

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
sustaining and gives it a you know more
sustained<00:01:01.289> employment<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.550> that's<00:01:02.699> what

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
sustained employment and that's what

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.399 
sustained employment and that's what
drummers<00:01:03.120> are<00:01:03.210> looking<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.719> how<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
drummers are looking for how would you

describe the sound of in terms of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.859 
describe the sound of in terms of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
depends on which model this is a medium
