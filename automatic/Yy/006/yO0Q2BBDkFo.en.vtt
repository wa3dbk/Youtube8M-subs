conflicted about the review that I did

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.030 
conflicted about the review that I did
because<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.540> palette<00:01:30.930> isn't<00:01:31.200> bad<00:01:31.619> it's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
because the the palette isn't bad it's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
because the the palette isn't bad it's
just<00:01:32.880> not

just not

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.740 
just not
I<00:01:34.280> feel<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.610> palette<00:01:36.000> could<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.479> been

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
I feel like this palette could have been

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.649 
I feel like this palette could have been
done<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.710> size<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> Naked<00:01:38.820> basics<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
done the size of the Naked basics you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.940 
done the size of the Naked basics you
know<00:01:39.750> what<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.900> mean<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.259> could<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.500> been<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
know what I mean it could have been a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.600 
know what I mean it could have been a
really<00:01:41.340> small<00:01:41.930> neutral<00:01:42.930> Rose<00:01:43.740> taupe

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
really small neutral Rose taupe

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.120 
really small neutral Rose taupe
undertone<00:01:45.570> palette<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.229> didn't<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
undertone palette it didn't have to be a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.810 
undertone palette it didn't have to be a
full-on<00:01:48.020> Naked<00:01:49.020> palette<00:01:49.130> with<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.430> ton<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
full-on Naked palette with a ton of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.330 
full-on Naked palette with a ton of
shades<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.570> all<00:01:51.810> look<00:01:52.079> very<00:01:52.110> similar<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
shades that all look very similar and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.190 
shades that all look very similar and
then<00:01:53.729> half<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.210> them<00:01:54.420> are<00:01:54.689> really<00:01:54.990> poor

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
then half of them are really poor

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.249 
then half of them are really poor
quality<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:57.180> was<00:01:57.360> my<00:01:57.509> feeling<00:01:57.930> towards

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
quality so that was my feeling towards

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.800 
quality so that was my feeling towards
it<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.430> palette<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.880> sucks<00:02:00.479> it's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it so it's not a palette that sucks it's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.109 
it so it's not a palette that sucks it's
not<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.990> palette<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:01.500> bad<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
not a palette that's bad it's just a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.289 
not a palette that's bad it's just a
palette<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.689> didn't<00:02:04.079> need<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.159> big

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
palette that didn't need to be this big

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.730 
palette that didn't need to be this big
so<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> little

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
so it is a little

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.320 
so it is a little
I<00:02:08.770> didn't<00:02:09.040> want<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.250> confuse<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.760> guys<00:02:10.030> I

I didn't want to confuse you guys I

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.790 
I didn't want to confuse you guys I
definitely<00:02:11.050> don't<00:02:11.200> think<00:02:11.320> it's<00:02:11.590> worth<00:02:11.740> the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
definitely don't think it's worth the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.790 
definitely don't think it's worth the
$52<00:02:12.700> but<00:02:13.240> regardless<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.840> isn't<00:02:14.200> my<00:02:14.350> review

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
$52 but regardless this isn't my review

$52 but regardless this isn't my review
this<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.730> tutorial<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:16.960> look<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.410> did

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
this is the tutorial on this look I did

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.150 
this is the tutorial on this look I did
this<00:02:17.800> look<00:02:18.040> trying<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.550> use<00:02:18.790> my<00:02:19.030> palette<00:02:19.510> and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
this look trying to use my palette and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.320 
this look trying to use my palette and
trying<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.250> understand<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:21.970> little<00:02:22.180> bit

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
trying to understand it a little bit

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.060 
trying to understand it a little bit
better<00:02:22.480> kind<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.440> looks<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:23.860> could

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
better kind of looks that I could

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.560 
better kind of looks that I could
achieve<00:02:24.160> with<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.820> did<00:02:25.060> mention<00:02:25.240> in<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
achieve with it I did mention in the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.000 
achieve with it I did mention in the
review<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:25.960> this<00:02:26.290> was<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.530> palette<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:28.330> I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
review that this was a palette that I

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.230 
review that this was a palette that I
wouldn't<00:02:30.010> see<00:02:30.160> myself<00:02:30.460> reaching<00:02:30.670> for<00:02:30.850> very

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
wouldn't see myself reaching for very

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.300 
wouldn't see myself reaching for very
often<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.930> when<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.200> did<00:02:32.530> reach<00:02:32.710> for<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.130> it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
often and when I did reach for it it

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.180 
often and when I did reach for it it
would<00:02:33.460> probably<00:02:34.030> be<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.930> use<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.680> transition

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
would probably be to use a transition

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.550 
would probably be to use a transition
color<00:02:36.490> out<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.060> or<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> highlight<00:02:37.750> color<00:02:37.930> but

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
color out of it or a highlight color but

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.380 
color out of it or a highlight color but
not<00:02:38.710> necessarily<00:02:39.190> create<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.760> whole<00:02:40.000> look<00:02:40.180> out

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
not necessarily create a whole look out

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.040 
not necessarily create a whole look out
of<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:43.980> someone's<00:02:44.980> texted<00:02:45.370> me<00:02:45.460> so<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.510> know

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050

don't<00:05:54.940> need<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.120> see<00:05:55.300> a<00:05:55.330> tutorial<00:05:55.540> just

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
don't need to see a tutorial just

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.560 
don't need to see a tutorial just
because<00:05:56.410> I<00:05:56.680> use<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.280> same<00:05:57.310> steps<00:05:58.300> every

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
because I use the same steps every

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.990 
because I use the same steps every
single<00:05:58.990> time<00:05:59.200> so<00:05:59.830> this<00:06:00.010> is<00:06:00.160> the<00:06:00.400> eye<00:06:00.850> shadow

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
single time so this is the eye shadow

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.480 
single time so this is the eye shadow
look<00:06:01.540> that<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:02.140> created<00:06:02.560> it's<00:06:02.920> super<00:06:03.280> simple

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
look that I created it's super simple

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.420 
look that I created it's super simple
again<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.150> used<00:06:04.420> like<00:06:04.660> them<00:06:05.160> darkest<00:06:06.160> color<00:06:06.340> in

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
again I used like them darkest color in

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.010 
again I used like them darkest color in
the<00:06:06.580> palette<00:06:06.670> and<00:06:07.120> then<00:06:07.330> I<00:06:07.390> used<00:06:07.660> one<00:06:07.840> of<00:06:07.930> the

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
the palette and then I used one of the

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.390 
the palette and then I used one of the
lighter<00:06:08.260> shades<00:06:08.590> kind<00:06:08.890> of<00:06:08.980> familiarize

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
lighter shades kind of familiarize

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.370 
lighter shades kind of familiarize
myself<00:06:09.520> with<00:06:10.030> the<00:06:10.330> lighter<00:06:10.780> colors<00:06:11.110> in<00:06:11.260> this

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
myself with the lighter colors in this

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.130 
myself with the lighter colors in this
palette<00:06:11.590> because<00:06:11.800> they're<00:06:12.100> the<00:06:12.220> ones<00:06:12.370> that<00:06:12.550> I

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
palette because they're the ones that I

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.860 
palette because they're the ones that I
wasn't<00:06:14.140> particularly<00:06:14.770> fond<00:06:15.310> of<00:06:15.580> um<00:06:15.880> and<00:06:16.810> again

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
wasn't particularly fond of um and again

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.240 
wasn't particularly fond of um and again
my<00:06:17.170> thoughts<00:06:17.410> are<00:06:17.560> still<00:06:17.740> the<00:06:17.860> same<00:06:17.980> about

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
my thoughts are still the same about

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
look for so for me I like variety and

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.750 
look for so for me I like variety and
this<00:07:23.500> palette<00:07:23.950> doesn't<00:07:24.220> offer<00:07:24.340> that<00:07:24.490> much

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:24.760 
this palette doesn't offer that much

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.910 
this palette doesn't offer that much
variety<00:07:25.420> for<00:07:25.660> me<00:07:25.840> so<00:07:26.200> that's<00:07:26.500> one<00:07:26.770> of<00:07:26.860> the

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:26.920 
variety for me so that's one of the

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.500 
variety for me so that's one of the
reasons<00:07:27.190> why<00:07:27.340> it's<00:07:27.520> not<00:07:27.700> one<00:07:27.880> of<00:07:27.910> my<00:07:28.090> favorites

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.510 
reasons why it's not one of my favorites

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.910 
reasons why it's not one of my favorites
I<00:07:28.690> look<00:07:29.410> for<00:07:29.680> quality<00:07:30.630> versus<00:07:31.630> quantity<00:07:31.660> so<00:07:32.620> if

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:32.920 
I look for quality versus quantity so if

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.030 
I look for quality versus quantity so if
this<00:07:33.280> palette<00:07:33.850> were<00:07:34.210> a<00:07:34.480> through-and-through

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.040 
this palette were a through-and-through

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.040 
this palette were a through-and-through
great<00:07:36.040> palette<00:07:36.580> like<00:07:36.850> I'm<00:07:37.090> saying<00:07:37.420> all<00:07:37.630> twelve
