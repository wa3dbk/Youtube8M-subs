00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.500
 beautiful and craziest gas welcome today on 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.240
 my first channel 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.400
 today I'm here with this video but first 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.410
 of all I want to tell you if maybe there is 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.720
 liked this let's say small spits 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.780
 nava we say I wanted a moment different 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.280
 native slow tina of the video I can you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 be liked and maybe add 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.030
 also circumscribed and proactive 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.100
 many pleasures exceeded in history 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.260
 of the 100 like said this is pretty 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.660
 here with the gameplay we say about recycling 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.430
 because gameplay I had already used 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.920
 obviously I cut some pieces where 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.830
 only the most beautiful ones where there are 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.850
 a lot of who as you see now type 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.920
 88 who the 115 kill and nothing today 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.020
 today's topic let's say it's a lot 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.700
 well it is not my video site that lasts 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.260
 on the 89 minutes 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.890
 today he went to talking about the new one 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.390
 dlc guys called uprising said 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.370
 this guys think that by now everyone 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.580
 will have seen that since the gameplay 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.470
 perhaps it has been released for about four days 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 but we say that I also want to give the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.400
 mine on this dlc that if not to can 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.619
 break a lot of asses even if at the end 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.799
 they are more or less all the same in my opinion 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.170
 very modest opinion tents there is 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.600
 was a good difference from even 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.590
 this last dlc which came out about two 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320
 months ago 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.229
 ie maps maps are maps 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.899
 there is particularly a map that does not exist 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.159
 is never seen called magma maps are 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.780
 four boys plus the zombie map and 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.460
 let's say a new mode called 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.350
 mob of the day 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.509
 the map magma girls with a blade like that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.939
 beautiful we say that it is in the mountains of 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.770
 a volcano therefore as in aida to water 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.720
 and as in the other map where it passes 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.160
 on the train there will be say gods 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.210
 obstacles a little more allows in 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.310
 difficulty 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.750
 the player this thing we say me 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.430
 I like it alot 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.600
 there by name is not for a while more than 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.560
 upload the high map to the kill file 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.280
 boys is studio precisely from the same 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.630
 name to a form of study where in the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.390
 part cintare we have the castle e 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.160
 he is an author who precisely comes 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.900
 eg controlled by snipers e 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.050
 the high map is in the center map 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.190
 guys are aspects that I do not expect a 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.470
 friend still and it is really a real stage or 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.570
 as a rock star he is a little guy 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.130
 little theater where the map is not 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.990
 very big indeed it is all we say 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.270
 made in the center ie all the battles 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.310
 will take place in the center of the map 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.760
 so it will be very hard especially 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.090
 maybe I think everybody knows everyone 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.690
 an excellent map to use and also 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.030
 why not for file and feed isners 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.530
 and the last multiplayer map will be called 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.900
 vertigo where we say semo above gods 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.210
 skyscrapers like maybe and grace for those 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.330
 But it reminds made very modern 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.370
 perhaps they are buildings that do not exist 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.280
 not even now in new york so a little 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.840
 really beautiful futuristic pro you can 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.670
 also jumps from windows to series 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.350
 on the stairs go up to the roof 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.270
 the mind made this second map well 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.420
 my opinion but the best of the multiples 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.420
 I think it's huge magma and the map 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.490
 just the zombie guys are there 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.340
 mode called mob of the day 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.900
 unfortunately I haven't understood much since 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.130
 from the English that developed point 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.980
 these maps because they really talk 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.150
 very quickly so even if I do 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.750
 linguistics is very difficult for me 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.400
 understand type hi guys on this side is 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.709
 very difficult therefore and think that for 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.170
 unit for an Englishman guided this 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.780
 guys you defined I hope visuals can 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.850
 they liked wanting to tread a video 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.480
 and a lot of nerves a place to have done it 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.520
 if you guys leave me beautiful like it 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.140
 a nice don't like a nice vote for a 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.140
