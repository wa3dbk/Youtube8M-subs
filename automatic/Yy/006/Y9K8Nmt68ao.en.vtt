00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
bit easier because I could have rich be

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.440 
bit easier because I could have rich be
down<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.100> provide<00:00:41.460> crossfire<00:00:42.059> while<00:00:42.420> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
down there and provide crossfire while I

into this room and once there's two

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830 
into this room and once there's two
remaining<00:01:43.979> Intel<00:01:44.460> there's<00:01:45.060> gonna<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.360> some

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
remaining Intel there's gonna be some

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.719 
remaining Intel there's gonna be some
guys<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.200> come<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.740> escalator<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
guys that come up that escalator so you

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.880 
guys that come up that escalator so you
just<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.180> wary<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.530> be

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
just want to be wary of that and be

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.499 
just want to be wary of that and be
prepared<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.729> take<00:01:50.909> out<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.270> think

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
prepared and you can take out I think

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.550 
prepared and you can take out I think
it's<00:01:51.600> probably<00:01:51.750> about<00:01:51.899> eight<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.200> them<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it's probably about eight of them and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.010 
it's probably about eight of them and
one<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.860> two<00:01:52.890> shots<00:01:53.329> definitely<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.720> did<00:01:54.869> is

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
one or two shots definitely so we did is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.319 
one or two shots definitely so we did is
I<00:01:55.229> pushed<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> picked<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.430> Intel

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
I pushed up and picked up the Intel

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.510 
I pushed up and picked up the Intel

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
while he stayed back looking down at the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.179 
while he stayed back looking down at the
escalator<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.240> way<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.979> when<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> was

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
escalator that way we do when it was

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.209 
escalator that way we do when it was
gonna<00:02:02.310> happen<00:02:02.520> again<00:02:03.060> don't<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.659> shy

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
you're playing spec ops veteran yeah

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.780 
you're playing spec ops veteran yeah
since<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.630> guys<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.020> eight<00:02:16.440> bullets<00:02:16.980> it's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
since the guys just eight bullets it's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.700 
since the guys just eight bullets it's
much<00:02:18.000> much<00:02:18.240> easier<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.930> shoot<00:02:19.200> somewhere

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
much much easier to just shoot somewhere

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.710 
much much easier to just shoot somewhere
around<00:02:19.830> them<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.400> most<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.450> time<00:02:21.600> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
around them and most of the time you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.140 
around them and most of the time you
pick<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.020> double<00:02:22.440> triple<00:02:22.680> quad<00:02:23.220> kills<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.820> a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
pick up double triple quad kills it's a

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150 
pick up double triple quad kills it's a
lot<00:02:24.540> easier<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.020> do<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.320> way<00:02:25.620> when<00:02:25.860> Tony's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
lot easier to do it that way when Tony's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.640 
lot easier to do it that way when Tony's
jacking<00:02:26.550> Appeals<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.990> as<00:02:28.230> soon<00:02:28.350> as<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.500> think

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
jacking Appeals so as soon as I think

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.600 
jacking Appeals so as soon as I think
that<00:02:28.740> one<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:28.980> that's<00:02:29.220> when<00:02:29.370> they're<00:02:29.490> just

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.940 
but some of the shots they pull off
especially<00:03:15.660> with<00:03:15.720> RPGs<00:03:16.260> it's<00:03:16.800> just

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
especially with RPGs it's just

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.600 
especially with RPGs it's just
ridiculous<00:03:17.810> possible<00:03:18.810> oh<00:03:18.930> yeah<00:03:19.470> it's<00:03:20.340> just

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
ridiculous possible oh yeah it's just

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.930 
ridiculous possible oh yeah it's just
unbelievable<00:03:20.970> um<00:03:21.810> they're<00:03:22.200> Cyprus<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:23.430> near

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
unbelievable um they're Cyprus up near

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.100 
unbelievable um they're Cyprus up near
the<00:03:23.970> satellite<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.540> that's<00:03:24.810> definitely

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
the satellite and that's definitely

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.630 
the satellite and that's definitely
something<00:03:25.200> one<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.830> needs<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.130> pick<00:03:26.459> up

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640

something one of you needs to pick up
yeah<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.360> definitely<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:27.780> somebody<00:03:28.110> should

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
yeah I definitely think somebody should

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.600

definitely one person wants to have the
xm25<00:03:32.820> for<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.720> part<00:03:33.900> you'll<00:03:34.050> see<00:03:34.640> eventually

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
xm25 for the part you'll see eventually

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.610 
xm25 for the part you'll see eventually
a<00:03:36.000> copter<00:03:36.630> will<00:03:36.780> try<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.020> drop<00:03:37.200> some<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.440> cool

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
off but also be careful this is where

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.730 
off but also be careful this is where
that<00:03:42.180> poisonous<00:03:42.840> gas<00:03:43.050> is<00:03:43.290> going<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.500> be<00:03:43.560> shut

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
that poisonous gas is going to be shut

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.160 
that poisonous gas is going to be shut
off<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.100> it's<00:03:44.250> they<00:03:44.820> chew<00:03:45.300> in<00:03:45.480> strategic

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
off and it's they chew in strategic

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.690 
off and it's they chew in strategic
spots<00:03:46.200> where<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.800> would<00:03:46.920> normally<00:03:46.950> be<00:03:47.310> hiding

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
spots where you would normally be hiding

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.330 
spots where you would normally be hiding
so<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.900> just<00:03:49.140> makes<00:03:49.320> sure<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.770> wash<00:03:49.920> wil<00:03:50.190> weet

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
so it just makes sure to wash wil weet

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.550 
so it just makes sure to wash wil weet
end<00:03:50.580> up<00:03:50.730> hiding<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.330> we<00:03:51.810> cut<00:03:51.990> it<00:03:52.080> close<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.440> it

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
end up hiding is we cut it close in it
