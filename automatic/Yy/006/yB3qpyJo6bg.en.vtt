00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.480
 I will introduce you now the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.850
 galaxy guillaume that is really the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.500
 galaxy companion note 3 which is 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.540
 first and foremost a relay of his smartphone 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 and which provides access to 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.040
 main application of its 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.259
 phone directly for saga the sig has 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.149
 so I'm trying to unroll it 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.520
 a little bit different sites m 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.380
 so we see we have at the voice 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.770
 is a voice command that allows 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.610
 to send a message to others I 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.739
 spoke already present in the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.630
 smartphones the voice memo to throw 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 a memo and care choice 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.699
 the photo gallery since in fact the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.249
 big island is that we have a device 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.379
 photo that are located here on the side of 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.030
 arm so it's really integrated into the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.920
 watch and that actually allows me to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.659
 take a picture directly from the magal 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 expires so I just do not apply 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.010
 Therefore our policy is there for all 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.429
 do we also have video mode 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.299
 continuation on the nikon photos videos 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:12.180
 to arrow of India 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:14.130
 how can we finish so just I slide 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.990
 my wood up I arrive on a 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.990
 dial that allows us to actually pass 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.210
 a call there I propose we call and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.600
 there we see that it's jerry on the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600
 phone 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.840
 it's good for the good his role is to 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 count the fon France and the election 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.590
 quite acceptable 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.590
 and interests 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.960
 we are really on a very product 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.579
 complete and that allows to have all the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.369
 hands free and able to stay 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.350
 actually connected to his galaxy for 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.340
 manage his galette sig and we can do it 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.280
 from his phone 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.709
 so we go into the application said to 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.599
 manager who will allow us to actually 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.390
 manage the different applications and 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.819
 the different dials of the watch so 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.880
 typically in the clocks we can see 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.849
 that if I select here in type of 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.789
 dial automatically it'll change it 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.819
 on the galaxy s centennial unite the two 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.180
 faux-pas galex in 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.760
 all 4.0 and the finalist and doctors 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.450
 schwazer the game can predict his tenth 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.430
 to do before 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.599
 if I come back to my apps there I 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.440
 can handle the one I want to see 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.900
 appear 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.930
 it's not appearing in the water because I 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.599
 just to click cochet unchecked I have 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.050
 sure the series seemed to favorite every 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.660
 applications they are 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.100
 present it in the galaxy say and I 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.330
 will be able of course the parents effect 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.220
 pretty fascinating 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.690
 I will be able to download 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.640
 apps on samsung apps because 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.580
 that they are downloadable on this 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.020
 platform at the launch of 70.5 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.840
 go as they say they were at 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.160
 green it's a little bit increased and 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.840
 finally the dahra has features that 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.270
 should you have researched me 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.580
 and the galaxy gear so I'm going to be able 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.880
 a phone document looks for one to 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.540
 legear ie the part rang for 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.790
 the professionals and upside down and on 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.860
 the galaxy well i'm going to have access to 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.570
 a feature that allows you to 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.780
 find my device in assembly this 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.890
 price there I'll be able my staff 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.710
 phone do it the jury 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.540
 the points he has praised so that 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.400
 find at any time 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.530
 so we're really on a product that 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.390
 is positioned as the companion 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.400
 of the ex king to allow 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.140
 the user to continue his activities 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.300
 keeping your hands free but 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.940
 staying connected but a lot it's 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.990
 perfect 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.990
 these buses all 4.0 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.379
 here are two 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.519
 then autonomy in one year 24 hours 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.920
 of autonomy after that is always 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.390
 difficult to ask you 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.340
 very specific because it depends 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.609
 uses that you always go that summer 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.719
 I always said 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.909
 a little urinated came off two 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.350
 stars quite actually you have 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.060
 both the applications 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.900
 in the settings of the food or if 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.340
 you have the opportunity to manage 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.200
 different are they too the display 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.000
 ie the brightness the time of 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.920
 standby and the color of the background 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.930
 so after that it's really personalized to 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.910
 my offices but also reduce between 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.050
 quotation marks 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.050
 the consumption 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.880
 the colors the colors so my 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.400
 instit surrounds so we have the golden beige 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.990
 the one I wear today we in 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.540

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.930
 black and white 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.669
 There you go 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:45.250
