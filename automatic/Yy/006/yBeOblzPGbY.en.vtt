except<00:02:16.019> with<00:02:16.140> grandpa<00:02:16.410> thought<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.709> for

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
except with grandpa thought it was for

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.339 
except with grandpa thought it was for
at<00:02:17.310> number<00:02:17.610> three<00:02:17.819> though<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.120> have<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.390> a380

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
at number three though we have the a380

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.199 
at number three though we have the a380
or<00:02:19.650> an<00:02:19.980> ac-130<00:02:20.550> I'm<00:02:20.640> kind<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:20.849> tied<00:02:21.030> between

these two I think the a380 would be

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.280 
these two I think the a380 would be
awesome<00:02:23.580> it's<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> huge<00:02:24.090> giant<00:02:24.569> double-decker

jumbo jet for passengers I think that'd

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.059

not<00:02:50.099> sure<00:02:50.190> how<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.489> would<00:02:50.549> be<00:02:50.610> balanced

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
not sure how that would be balanced

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.880 
not sure how that would be balanced
because<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.900> would<00:02:52.019> be<00:02:52.049> able<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.349> shoot<00:02:52.530> you

may<00:02:53.040> need<00:02:53.099> two<00:02:53.400> people<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.700> fly<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.269> it

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
may need two people to fly in it it

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.479 
may need two people to fly in it it
would<00:02:54.870> look<00:02:55.049> pretty<00:02:55.440> similar<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.099> type<00:02:56.280> we

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
would look pretty similar to the type we

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.009 
would look pretty similar to the type we
have<00:02:56.640> right<00:02:56.849> now<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.299> instead<00:02:57.599> it<00:02:57.780> would<00:02:57.840> have

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
have right now but instead it would have

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.630 
have right now but instead it would have
guns<00:02:58.319> coming<00:02:58.560> up<00:02:58.709> beside<00:02:59.010> some<00:02:59.340> sort<00:02:59.610> of

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
guns coming up beside some sort of

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.920 
guns coming up beside some sort of
control<00:02:59.849> interface<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.780> could<00:03:00.900> actually

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
control interface and you could actually

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.770 
control interface and you could actually
shoot<00:03:01.530> three<00:03:01.920> different<00:03:02.340> sizes<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.910> cannons

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
shoot three different sizes of cannons

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.479 
shoot three different sizes of cannons
at<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.079> enemy<00:03:04.709> i'm<00:03:04.860> not<00:03:05.010> sure<00:03:05.160> how<00:03:05.220> much<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
at the enemy i'm not sure how much the

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.069 
at the enemy i'm not sure how much the
delay<00:03:05.730> abhi<00:03:05.940> once<00:03:06.150> again<00:03:06.390> that's<00:03:06.900> on

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
delay abhi once again that's on

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.630 
delay abhi once again that's on
rockstars<00:03:07.560> part<00:03:07.799> for<00:03:07.980> balancing<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.459> but<00:03:08.610> I

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
rockstars part for balancing that but I

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.640 
rockstars part for balancing that but I
think<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.030> would<00:03:09.120> be<00:03:09.180> pretty<00:03:09.360> fun<00:03:09.720> coming<00:03:10.530> at

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
where you had to get there before the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.090 
where you had to get there before the
criminals<00:04:30.600> got<00:04:30.750> away<00:04:30.990> so<00:04:31.470> once<00:04:31.650> again<00:04:31.770> two

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
criminals got away so once again two

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.680 
criminals got away so once again two
little<00:04:32.430> updates<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.000> things<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.389> could<00:04:33.570> be

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
little updates and things that could be

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.210 
little updates and things that could be
great<00:04:33.960> for<00:04:34.169> single-player<00:04:34.530> not<00:04:34.830> even<00:04:35.070> for

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
great for single-player not even for

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.920 
great for single-player not even for
multiplayer<00:04:35.610> just<00:04:35.850> for<00:04:35.970> single<00:04:36.090> player<00:04:36.300> that

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
multiplayer just for single player that

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.600 
multiplayer just for single player that
I<00:04:36.990> think<00:04:37.199> would<00:04:37.260> be<00:04:37.380> awesome<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.070> definitely

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
I think would be awesome and definitely

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.860 
I think would be awesome and definitely
there's<00:04:38.790> some<00:04:38.910> diversity<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.720> isn't

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
there's some diversity to it and isn't

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.600 
there's some diversity to it and isn't
the<00:04:40.020> same<00:04:40.229> you<00:04:40.500> know<00:04:40.620> AI<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.040> same<00:04:41.340> places

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
the same you know AI the same places

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.370 
the same you know AI the same places
over<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.030> over<00:04:42.120> again<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:43.050> would<00:04:43.199> be

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
over and over again that would be

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.680 
over and over again that would be
awesome<00:04:43.590> now<00:04:44.430> last<00:04:44.850> but<00:04:44.940> not<00:04:45.090> least<00:04:45.150> we<00:04:45.660> have

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
awesome now last but not least we have

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.110 
awesome now last but not least we have
