00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.370
 maybe better than expected and also 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.839
 important that the one that has been maintained 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.450
 until now if he does not have a rival 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.730
 complicated that also very much therefore not 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.940
 descend how you feel up to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.049
 this group moment together 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.539
 obviously with course of the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.849
 matches and wins the draw that 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.009
 we have obtained there is more confidence in the 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.439
 group to try this this party 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.649
 that we know that the rival is very difficult 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.699
 what is being played and obviously 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.499
 we are doing a very 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.239
 complicated then that either a 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.789
 very neat party as it came 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.339
 doing I think that that has been the basis of 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.800
 twitter the operation that we have 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:44.239
 worked very ordered so much for 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.239
 defend as to defend 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.030
 the difference 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:00.629
 again we have many things that 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.629
 do inside the island 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.439
 I think that the commitment of the group is 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.530
 seeing reflected in every game and in the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.250
 effort of the whole group then I think 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.430
 that this has been the basis and obviously 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.590
 is always trying to win but both 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.630
 arriving for the team concert 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.369
 as to attack which transports 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.649
 spoke on the computer to start this 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.270
 season after what happened the 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:33.760
 previous tournament we only made remains 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.370
 here a very individual analysis 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.630
 that we stopped doing and obviously has 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.170
 been reflected 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.020
 in the last objectives we know that it is 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.490
 a new tournament that ends three dates 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.000
 but we have to start from the best 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.960
 way 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.670
 and good because the triumphs before two 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.610
 months to continue working so 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.640
 we had been doing 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.010
 the plants as you think he has done 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.450
 the defense of this tournament from the 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:08.610
 past and we know that the defense has been 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 behaved in the best way starting 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.530
 from you every I think we have all 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.209
 run to keep the zero 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:25.360
 We have the debt to contribute towards 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:27.670
 offensive that has been running 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.950
 and well I think that has been the basis 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.170
 but surely the defense has given us 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.970
 a lot of confidence to tell other lives 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.030
 also that sense that the offensive 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.090
 it is falling to duty a little bad not you 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.800
 I say the work is even for both 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.510
 defend as to defend and obviously 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.880
 the density that is from the front 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.880
 which is broken because it is called 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.610
 so that we keep the absence a little 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.340
 of rock after the first 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.010
 match played very well obviously 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.100
 then a player of great quality who 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.000
 is 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:12.440
 is proven worldwide and again we 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.020
 it helped quite well and good 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.640
 who was I'll do the same 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.950
 always contributing to the team 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.050
 and you have felt like a steering wheel 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.850
 right instead of as a means of 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.240
 containment 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.350
 do it 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:32.860
 practicing the change are very different 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.930
 you learn other types of rhythms inside 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.810
 of the game but it is a function that nothing 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.460
 I know at the beginning of my career 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.560
 times when by lanes they left 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.770
 accommodating contention and right now that I 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.870
 are giving the opportunity of this one 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.750
 that's where I think there are three feet 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.300
 inductive to the teacher and well I think that 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.400
 the function is not part rather than the 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.030
 team and obviously also brings the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.560
 Positive at the end with several players 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.840
 magnificent that your vote of confidence from 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.440
 the chilean directive upside down 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.920
 I am for to present yes sure I am 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.950
 grateful with the board the trust 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.359
 I've always really tried to 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:23.199
 give me a hundred and obviously 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.199
 contribute more right now in my case in the 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:35.509
 position quite well and I arrived a 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:37.819
 year we went quite well as 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:41.840
 superleaders and we've been working 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:44.780
 then always the best for the team 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.789
 and I say where you use all of that with either 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.800
 steering wheel tension by right while 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.460
 be for the benefit of the team it will 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.860
 in the best way today you are in that 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.529
 in that titular position that are giving the 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.629
 opportunity is to give a better saliva is 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:02.539
 so can this tournament because 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:07.569
 he founded the room also mentioned in 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.569
 many games the chama 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:15.330
 they circulated their sight 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.250
 well I think any team one 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.420
 always have to give and give 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.800
 favorable answers then that's a 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.140
 I work for us and obviously 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.200
 we have to do it in the best way and 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.390
 is bringing the opportunity and the best 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.000
 effort for the team to get 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.280
 objectives when the two grants you 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.729
 like 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.139
 Attention 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.810
 I'm this one had enough as steering wheel 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.210
 we have a little more of 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.620
 incorporation to reach the area but 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.460
 I tell you they are can be very different and 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.550
 the others like 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.259
 of different rhythms different shapes 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.259
 of the nap when white theme 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.620
 obviously an important player is a 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.070
 great career 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.770
 has a specific weight in the team 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:12.919
 but we face it to a single player and 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:19.690
 obviously we go with a lot of respect with 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:19.690
 much the party and the people 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:28.100
 it's a dangerous team because they need 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.530
 they need points are at home 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.479
 obviously if you are not going to want to win the 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.600
 liberty us if they put in cloth of 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:38.479
 trial if you lose with your neck we're 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.400
 working to keep our pace and 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:43.240
 with the parties match I say all 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.240
 thinking 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.890
 the extra question 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.720
 for this weekend who will 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:55.300
 bets on football 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.960
 then it is difficult that it is not 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.960
 bone scan 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.150
 Y 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.150
 all right
