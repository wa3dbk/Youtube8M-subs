00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
whatever metal they use for it it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.459 
whatever metal they use for it it

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
all for the iphone it's pretty much

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.059 
all for the iphone it's pretty much
useless<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.869> probably<00:01:47.500> won't<00:01:47.799> want<00:01:47.890> to

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
whoops what that doesn't work unless

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.170 
whoops what that doesn't work unless
it's<00:02:53.069> upside<00:02:53.549> down<00:02:53.849> or<00:02:54.650> unless<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:56.180> reversed

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
and then flipped upside down you know I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.580 
and then flipped upside down you know I
was<00:02:59.519> trying<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.849> anyways<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.599> is<00:03:01.290> actually

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
was trying to do anyways it is actually

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.619 
was trying to do anyways it is actually
pretty<00:03:02.040> accurate<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.790> if<00:03:03.239> you're<00:03:03.360> using<00:03:03.480> a

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
pretty accurate and if you're using a

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.839 
pretty accurate and if you're using a
calculator<00:03:03.840> I'd<00:03:04.830> actually<00:03:05.160> definitely

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
calculator I'd actually definitely

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.369 
calculator I'd actually definitely
recommend<00:03:06.390> getting<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.080> just<00:03:07.170> for

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
recommend getting this but just for

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.080 
recommend getting this but just for
simply<00:03:07.890> browsing<00:03:09.019> for<00:03:10.019> example<00:03:10.349> here<00:03:10.709> um<00:03:11.459> you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
simply browsing for example here um you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.960 
simply browsing for example here um you
actually<00:03:12.569> have<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:13.110> as<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> bad<00:03:13.890> boys<00:03:14.099> crack<00:03:14.370> you

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
actually have to as a bad boys crack you

actually<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:16.250> kind<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.400> press<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
actually have to kind of press on the

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.930 
actually have to kind of press on the
screen<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.569> bit<00:03:18.920> like<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.430> very<00:03:20.640> lightly

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
screen a bit like this is very lightly

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.449 
screen a bit like this is very lightly
on<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:22.079> screen<00:03:23.750> not<00:03:24.750> working<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:25.709> i<00:03:25.829> press<00:03:26.160> it

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
on the screen not working if i press it

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.300 
on the screen not working if i press it
works<00:03:27.120> perfect<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.410> pretty<00:03:28.769> much<00:03:28.920> have<00:03:29.280> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
works perfect so you pretty much have to

as<00:04:02.910> smooth<00:04:03.269> as<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.569> would<00:04:03.720> hope<00:04:04.049> for<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.769> be

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
as smooth as I would hope for it to be

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.449 
as smooth as I would hope for it to be
in<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.099> original<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.500> first<00:04:07.680> place<00:04:07.799> but

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
in the original in the first place but

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.580 
in the original in the first place but
again<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.940> pogo<00:04:09.299> stylus<00:04:09.510> may<00:04:10.260> have<00:04:10.440> better

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
again the pogo stylus may have better

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.159 
again the pogo stylus may have better
quality<00:04:10.829> than<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.790> really<00:04:12.120> have<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.480> see

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
quality than this you really have to see

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.750 
quality than this you really have to see
it<00:04:13.260> for<00:04:13.410> yourself<00:04:13.799> because<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.489> can't<00:04:14.700> really

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
it for yourself because you can't really

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.170 
it for yourself because you can't really
tell<00:04:15.209> build<00:04:16.109> quality<00:04:16.519> just<00:04:17.519> by<00:04:17.639> looking<00:04:18.030> at<00:04:18.120> it

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
tell build quality just by looking at it

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.170 
tell build quality just by looking at it
a<00:04:18.450> lot<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.320> cases<00:04:19.560> anyways<00:04:20.010> there's<00:04:20.820> also<00:04:21.030> a
