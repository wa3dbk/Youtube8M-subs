think the whole concept of rent the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.509 
think the whole concept of rent the
runway<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.930> amazing<00:00:22.350> because<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.189> someone

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
runway is amazing because I have someone

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.950 
runway is amazing because I have someone
who<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> always<00:00:24.029> love<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> different
