00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.390
 His friends call him is ibrahim 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.730
 his mother was born in germany 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.340
 comes from france his father 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.230
 Morocco with his parents and his 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.440
 ibrahim lives in the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
 near the frankfurt main station of the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.090
 school life is not always easy for 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.590
 but him he handles because he has his 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.180
 great love always doing his football 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 he feels safe on the pitch 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 He still has German language 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:46.050
 so his difficulties go into the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.399
 fourth grade of the karmeliter school here 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.739
 meet students from many 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.110
 different cultures 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.850
 brings the multicultural environment 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:03.480
 challenge for teachers and students 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:04.799
 equally important to 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.869
 coping with the different 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.150
 difficulty plays the language 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.320
 who speaks good German has better 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.850
 opportunities for a successful one 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.070
 integration 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.950
 That's exactly where the project sets football 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 meets culture 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.670
 football training and language lessons 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.409
 are combined here 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.360
 Karin sudden from the song came to the initiator 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.090
 the project explains why this 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.470
 Connection makes sense The first goal was 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.950
 to motivate children to learn 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.630
 through football over time though 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.460
 Of course, it's not just that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 the motivation is that one 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.189
 by football of course through the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.020
 movement also the concentration of 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.759
 children increased so it got through 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.079
 that shifted a bit from the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.850
 motivation 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.340
 football as a motivation argument too 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.930
 we are now using soccer too 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.119
 integrate into the classroom 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.159
 Movements and teaching so that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.540
 Months is evolving in the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.969
 seven years we are doing it now 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.920
 When football meets culture, boys come 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.360
 and girls twice a week for 90 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.880
 minutes for afternoon classes 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.399
 together our time in two teams 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.710
 Play a half time football and 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.840
 learn in the second 45 minutes the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.400
 German culture and language 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.730
 know better that's a lot 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.980
 then a nice thing for the children 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.170
 sometime not only the fun on 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.170
 football but also the fun at the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.580
 discover language or mix 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.670
 So they realize that it's pretty much 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.920
 communication on the place it necessary 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.709
 but it is not excluded me 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.680
 to move in German teaching and 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.030
 if it often does not look like that though 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.080
 You can do it well together 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.090
 connect 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.170
 the children learn that relatively quickly 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.579
 and therefore it is a great motivation 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.560
 today is a whole for ibrahim 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.690
 special day for after lunch 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.380
 in the kinderhaus he is allowed to work together with 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.360
 a real soccer pro kick for 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.069
 stefan aigner von eintracht frankfurt 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.260
 is the participation in soccer meets 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.099
 culture is anything but one 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.349
 duty schedule 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:05.670
 where do you originally come from 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:11.040
 which country your father is from 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.810
 france or the project lives too 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.329
 from the close cooperation with the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.130
 profit clubs 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.200
 These are the role models from the Bundesliga 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.040
 the boys like ibrahim especially 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.380
 motivate 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.019
 Stefan Aigner takes this role very much 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.239
 like to know because from our own experience 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:33.660
 he is happy about the importance of the promotion 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.180
 and enjoy the sport then it is all the more 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.150
 easier as if I have to say 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.910
 today i have to go to germany 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.519
 Do you have sports or just something you like 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.230
 doing or having an activity and doing so 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.690
 it helps and it just gets easier 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.040
 made because he has fun and 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.620
 namely also one learns the 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.150
 Tension football meets culture is one 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.660
 success story because that 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.459
 afternoon training arrives 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.919
 both linguistically as well as on 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.019
 On the social level, Ibrahim always finds himself 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.549
 better cope 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.340
 Anton Schumacher supports the project 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.109
 for several years as a football coach 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.970
 he is happy about the little ones and 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.859
 great progress also with him 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.859
 meanwhile clearly visible 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.769
 yes, rather withdrawn but rather 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.510
 which of course also a little something can 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.550
 learning to play ball falls again 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.169
 easier because somehow joy to it 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.150
 have to be accepted within the 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.270
 group and is anyway a beamman 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.100
 the trainer is always fun too 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.870
 the project lives from enthusiasm 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.419
 the children and the conviction of 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.280
 trainer and teacher remaining power since 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.770
 two years with the project and wants 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.680
 also in the future necessarily remain 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:58.660
 For him today is an intense day 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:05:00.490
 ende and ibo is one of a total of 270 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.600
 children currently in Germany at the 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.220
 project football meets culture 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.050
 weary but happy he makes himself 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.140
 with his two buddies ilias and 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.970
