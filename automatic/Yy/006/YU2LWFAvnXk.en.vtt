00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.349
 impact 

00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:04.180
 the belt of three points invention of volvo 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.400
 remains the most important and together with the well-known technologies of zones 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.659
 of deformation 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.069
 the dax 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.069
 side impact protection system 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.220
 and the latest advances brings the collision warning with braking 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.470
 automatic 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.470
 and the clips previously prepared 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.329
 objections prepared previously serve to reinforce security 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.289
 protect and contribute to reducing the risk of injury by adapting 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.000
 objections to the severity of the collision 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.160
 in case of impact the subsidy control module controls the deployment 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.980
 of passive operations 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.570
 and with the additional information of the laser sensor the same used by 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.950
 citi six shots 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.930
 the control module of your decisions against the adaptive load limiter 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.559
 of seat belts 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.430
 according to the severity of the collision 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.080
 so you can make the most of the adaptive load imitator of the 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.080
 belts to minimize injuries 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.509
 volvo has many years of experience in research and monitoring 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.280
 real accidents with volvo cars 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 to extend the analysis to the chain of events that happen moments 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.930
 before the collision 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.960
 by cars 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.290
 complements its own statistics 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.290
 a detailed study of external studies and reconstructions of the chains of 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.290
 events 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.750
 in the event of an accident in which safety belt fenders are activated and 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.720
 the ages 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.690
 the function of the gulf san jorge 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.510
 Automatically alerts the operator of a 24-hour customer service center 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 the operator can immediately see the exact location of the vehicle 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.250
 send help place quickly and directly 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 and help the driver to handle the situation 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.069
 in these philosophy 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.340
 We base our research and all our efforts to create a 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.919
 safest vehicle yet 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:20.129
 for each new model that we put on the market in the case of xc60 could be 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.930
 say that we have gathered all our knowledge accumulated in a product 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.749
 new to create possibly the safest vehicle in the world and since 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.129
 then the darkest octopus in history teaches us
