00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hey guys this is the Carl's are again I

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.210 
hey guys this is the Carl's are again I
just<00:00:04.290> wanted<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.740> show<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.009> little

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
just wanted to show you a little

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.530 
just wanted to show you a little
something<00:00:05.430> on<00:00:05.790> my<00:00:06.230> itouch<00:00:08.000> not<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.150> iPhone

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
something on my itouch not the iPhone

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.419 
something on my itouch not the iPhone
but<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.990> ipod<00:00:10.349> version<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.130> touch

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
but the ipod version of it the I touch

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.930 
but the ipod version of it the I touch

however<00:00:18.449> they<00:00:18.570> were<00:00:18.690> supposed<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> printouts

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
however they were supposed to printouts

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.250 
however they were supposed to printouts
that<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.039> don't<00:00:20.189> even<00:00:20.279> know<00:00:20.720> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.869> aqua

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
that I don't even know this is aqua

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.420 
that I don't even know this is aqua
forest<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.939> their<00:00:24.720> program<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
forest and this is their program for the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.529 
forest and this is their program for the
iPhone<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.570> iTouch<00:00:28.429> you<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:29.849> most<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
iPhone and iTouch you can get most of

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.240 
iPhone and iTouch you can get most of
the<00:00:30.929> apps<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.410> either<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:32.239> anyway<00:00:33.950> going<00:00:34.950> into

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the apps on either one anyway going into

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.299 
the apps on either one anyway going into
the<00:00:35.370> free<00:00:35.610> mode<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.090> basically<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:37.440> like

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the free mode is basically just like

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.040 
the free mode is basically just like
playing<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:39.390> Oh<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> cake<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:42.050> where

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
playing with Oh a cake you have where

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.889 
playing with Oh a cake you have where
you<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.350> draw<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:43.890> your<00:00:43.920> finger<00:00:44.870> make<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you can draw with your finger make a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.240 
you can draw with your finger make a
decent<00:00:46.200> amount<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.620> water<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
decent amount of water here on the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
decent amount of water here on the
screen<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:51.199> physics<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.350> pretty

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
screen so you can see physics are pretty

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
screen so you can see physics are pretty
accurate<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.579> coolest<00:00:54.000> thing<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:54.719> is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
accurate the coolest thing I think is

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.310 
accurate the coolest thing I think is
that<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.760> use<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> tilt<00:00:57.329> sensor<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
that you can use the tilt sensor in the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.709 
that you can use the tilt sensor in the
device<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:59.820> tilt<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> make<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.010> water

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
device to tilt it and make the water

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.649 
device to tilt it and make the water
move<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> screen<00:01:05.090> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.150> tilt<00:01:06.510> it

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
move all over the screen you can tilt it

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.560 
move all over the screen you can tilt it
more<00:01:06.869> violently<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.180> some<00:01:09.420> momentum

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
more violently to get some momentum

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.780 
more violently to get some momentum
going

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.920 

of<00:01:14.790> course<00:01:15.439> elements<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.740> still<00:01:17.520> react<00:01:17.939> one

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
of course elements can still react one

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.359 
of course elements can still react one
downside<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.740> can't<00:01:20.070> seem<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
downside is that you can't seem to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.330 
downside is that you can't seem to
combine<00:01:20.820> elements<00:01:21.030> yet<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.170> tried<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.070> using

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
combine elements yet I tried like using

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.130 
combine elements yet I tried like using
the<00:01:23.520> multi-touch<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.360> touch<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.810> than<00:01:24.869> one

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the multi-touch to touch more than one

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.740 
the multi-touch to touch more than one
element<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> time<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:27.030> doesn't<00:01:27.330> work

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
element at a time but it doesn't work

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.499 
element at a time but it doesn't work
but<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.930> any<00:01:31.110> case<00:01:32.119> turning<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> water<00:01:33.360> into

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
but in any case turning the water into

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:41.330 
but in any case turning the water into
steam<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:39.470> yeah<00:01:40.470> there's<00:01:40.650> heater<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
steam here and yeah there's heater and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.969 
steam here and yeah there's heater and

oops<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:35.069> don't<00:03:36.069> know<00:03:36.160> what<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.550> clicked<00:03:36.760> on

oops I don't know what I just clicked on
but<00:03:37.210> I<00:03:37.510> think<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.230> goal<00:03:38.380> here<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.680> pretty

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
but I think the goal here is pretty

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.550 
but I think the goal here is pretty
obvious<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.209> need<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:41.069> up<00:03:42.069> that<00:03:43.230> cord<00:03:44.230> is

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
obvious you just need to up that cord is

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.280 
obvious you just need to up that cord is
just<00:03:45.240> because<00:03:46.240> this<00:03:46.420> thing<00:03:46.690> is<00:03:46.720> plugged<00:03:47.080> in

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
just because this thing is plugged in

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.010 
just because this thing is plugged in
right<00:03:47.500> now<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:51.360> that's<00:03:52.360> making<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:52.900> very

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
right now and that's making it very

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.690 
right now and that's making it very
difficult<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.680> solve<00:03:53.890> this<00:03:54.040> puzzle<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:54.640> I'm
