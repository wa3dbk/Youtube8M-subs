animation tutorial exciting times this
time<00:00:05.730> we're<00:00:05.940> going<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.089> show<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.359> the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
time we're going to show you the

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.720 
time we're going to show you the
difference<00:00:07.440> between<00:00:07.529> frame<00:00:08.460> by<00:00:08.700> frame

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
difference between frame by frame

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.799 
difference between frame by frame
animation<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.750> motion<00:00:10.290> tween<00:00:10.769> animation<00:00:11.809> so

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
animation and motion tween animation so

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.890 
animation and motion tween animation so
frame<00:00:13.410> by<00:00:13.559> frame<00:00:13.590> animation<00:00:14.030> just<00:00:15.030> means<00:00:15.719> that

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
frame by frame animation just means that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.840 
frame by frame animation just means that
you're<00:00:16.020> drawing<00:00:16.310> every<00:00:17.310> single<00:00:17.550> frame<00:00:17.699> by

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
you're drawing every single frame by

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.870 
you're drawing every single frame by
hand<00:00:18.410> every<00:00:19.410> single<00:00:19.800> picture<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.640> see

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
hand every single picture that you see

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.509 
hand every single picture that you see
in<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> animation<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.990> been<00:00:22.230> drawn<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:25.199> are

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
in the animation it's been drawn you are

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.700 
in the animation it's been drawn you are
most<00:00:26.519> likely<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.970> using<00:00:27.119> not<00:00:27.590> you<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
most likely be using not you know a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.790 
most likely be using not you know a
onion<00:00:29.160> skin<00:00:29.400> tool<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.970> because

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
onion skin tool for this because

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.010 
onion skin tool for this because
otherwise<00:00:31.800> you'll<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:33.270> really<00:00:33.540> lose<00:00:33.660> control

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
otherwise you'll you really lose control

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080 
otherwise you'll you really lose control
of<00:00:34.050> your<00:00:34.140> proportions<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.940> last

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
of your proportions you can see the last

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.639 
of your proportions you can see the last
picture<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.510> you've<00:00:36.630> drawn<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
picture that you've drawn and then you

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
picture that you've drawn and then you
just<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.489> keep<00:00:38.640> drawing<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.210> next<00:00:39.480> picture

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
just you keep drawing the next picture

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.450 
just you keep drawing the next picture
with<00:00:40.020> last<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.530> mind<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.309> get<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
with last one in mind so you can get a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.990 
with last one in mind so you can get a
sense<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.600> movement<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:46.190> know<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
sense of the movement you know just a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.069 
sense of the movement you know just a
simple<00:00:48.270> thing<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.390> there's<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> circle

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
simple thing like there's a circle

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.560 
simple thing like there's a circle
moving<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.340> an<00:00:50.430> example<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.059> frame<00:00:51.449> by

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
moving this is an example of a frame by

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.600 
moving this is an example of a frame by
frame<00:00:51.600> animation<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.920> drew<00:00:53.190> each

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
frame animation because you drew each

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.060 
frame animation because you drew each
frame<00:00:55.160> now<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> motion<00:00:56.610> tween<00:00:57.920> which<00:00:58.920> by

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
frame now for a motion tween which by

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.020 
frame now for a motion tween which by
the<00:00:59.129> way<00:00:59.190> you'll<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.670> we're<00:00:59.820> inserting

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the way you'll see that we're inserting

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.660 
the way you'll see that we're inserting
another<00:01:00.239> layer<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.739> many<00:01:02.280> programs

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
another layer just like many programs

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.350 
another layer just like many programs
have<00:01:02.730> layers<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:04.559> draw<00:01:04.769> something<00:01:05.360> you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
have layers you draw something you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.649 
have layers you draw something you
select<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.280> then<00:01:08.360> you're<00:01:09.360> gonna<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
select it and then you're gonna have to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.929 
select it and then you're gonna have to
add<00:01:09.810> modify<00:01:10.229> convert<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> symbol<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
add modify convert to symbol and the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.399 
add modify convert to symbol and the
reason<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:13.080> order<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
reason for this is that in order to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.010 
reason for this is that in order to
motion<00:01:14.070> tween<00:01:14.280> anything<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.450> object<00:01:15.930> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
motion tween anything the object that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.410 
motion tween anything the object that
you're<00:01:16.140> trying<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.619> tween<00:01:16.860> has<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.909> movie

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you're trying to tween has to be a movie

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.580 
you're trying to tween has to be a movie
clip<00:01:18.770> name<00:01:19.770> does<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.189> matter<00:01:20.400> gonna<00:01:21.090> hit<00:01:21.240> OK

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
clip name does not matter gonna hit OK

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.289 
clip name does not matter gonna hit OK
now<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.100> set<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.400> beginning<00:01:23.610> position<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
now you set the beginning position and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
now you set the beginning position and
you<00:01:24.600> open<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.930> timeline<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:26.100> where<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.400> want

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
you open the timeline to where you want

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.859 
you open the timeline to where you want
to<00:01:26.670> set<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> ending<00:01:27.119> position<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.659> make<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
to set the ending position you make a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.249 
to set the ending position you make a
new<00:01:28.049> keyframe<00:01:28.470> hitting<00:01:29.130> f6<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.170> move

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
new keyframe hitting f6 and you can move

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.230 
new keyframe hitting f6 and you can move
the<00:01:31.380> circle<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> ending<00:01:32.640> position<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the circle to the ending position and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.700 
the circle to the ending position and
then<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.600> right<00:01:33.780> click<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> middle<00:01:34.439> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
then if you right click in the middle of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
then if you right click in the middle of
those<00:01:34.979> two<00:01:35.040> frames<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.790> click<00:01:36.119> create<00:01:36.630> motion

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
those two frames you click create motion

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.399 
those two frames you click create motion
tween<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:38.060> it'll<00:01:39.060> automatically<00:01:39.509> go<00:01:39.630> from

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
tween and it'll automatically go from

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.020 
tween and it'll automatically go from
the<00:01:40.470> beginning<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> end<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.880> see

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the beginning to the end and you can see

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.719 
the beginning to the end and you can see
the<00:01:42.210> two<00:01:42.420> black<00:01:43.020> dots<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.549> layer

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the two black dots up there on the layer

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
the two black dots up there on the layer
you've<00:01:45.390> got<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.869> one<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> beginning<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you've got the one in the beginning and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.170 
you've got the one in the beginning and
the<00:01:46.649> one<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> end<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.520> position<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the one at the end you position the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.520 
the one at the end you position the
circle<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> beginning<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.350> then<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
circle at the beginning and then you

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.800 
circle at the beginning and then you
position<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.310> circle<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> end<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.270> then

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
position the circle at the end and then

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.120 
position the circle at the end and then
when<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.020> created<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> motion<00:01:52.740> tween<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
when you created the motion tween and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190 
when you created the motion tween and
automatically<00:01:53.880> fills<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.540> all<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> frames<00:01:55.020> in

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
automatically fills in all the frames in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.300 
automatically fills in all the frames in
between<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.649> moving<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> across<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.850> screen

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
between them moving it across the screen

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.789 
between them moving it across the screen
so<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.700> less<00:01:59.909> frames<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.570> between

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
so if you have less frames in between

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.550 
so if you have less frames in between
it'll<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.040> faster<00:02:02.689> or<00:02:03.689> alternatively

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it'll get there faster or alternatively

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.580 
it'll get there faster or alternatively
make<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.189> longer<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.810> it'll<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.899> much<00:02:07.079> much

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
make it longer and it'll be much much

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.900 
make it longer and it'll be much much
slower

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
slower

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.090 
slower
and<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.260> motion<00:02:10.650> cleaning<00:02:10.980> in<00:02:11.070> a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
and that is motion cleaning in a

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.240 
and that is motion cleaning in a
nutshell<00:02:11.280> now<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.600> actually<00:02:12.750> use<00:02:13.590> both<00:02:14.190> of

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
nutshell now we actually use both of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.160 
nutshell now we actually use both of
these<00:02:14.610> types<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.720> animation<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> channel

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
these types of animation on a channel

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.620 
these types of animation on a channel
for<00:02:19.170> motion<00:02:19.710> tween<00:02:20.180> maybe<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.270> remember<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
for motion tween maybe you remember the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.430 
for motion tween maybe you remember the
ante<00:02:21.900> video<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:23.190> was<00:02:23.660> made<00:02:24.660> with<00:02:24.900> many<00:02:25.080> motion

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
ante video it was made with many motion

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.340 
ante video it was made with many motion
tweens<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.100> see<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.370> all<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.880> purple

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
tweens you can see it all the purple

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.840 
tweens you can see it all the purple
parts<00:02:28.350> lower<00:02:28.560> frames<00:02:28.860> are<00:02:29.070> motion<00:02:29.430> tweens<00:02:29.640> and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
parts lower frames are motion tweens and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.540 
parts lower frames are motion tweens and
if<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.330> play<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> moment<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.520> see

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
if you play it for a moment you can see

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.770 
if you play it for a moment you can see
how<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:34.170> movements<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:35.100> very<00:02:35.610> clean<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.570> its

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
how the movements are very clean and its

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.040 
how the movements are very clean and its
objects<00:02:37.350> moving<00:02:37.680> around<00:02:38.690> like<00:02:39.690> right<00:02:39.900> there

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
objects moving around like right there

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.690 
objects moving around like right there
like<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.350> hand<00:02:40.590> raising<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.100> fire<00:02:41.280> motion

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
like the hand raising on the fire motion

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:52.220 
like the hand raising on the fire motion
tween<00:02:43.460> yes<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:50.420> alternatively<00:02:51.420> frame<00:02:52.140> by

tween yes and alternatively frame by

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.120 
tween yes and alternatively frame by
frame<00:02:52.730> did<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> lot<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.720> video

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.570 
frame did a lot of that in this video
for<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.400> oh<00:02:56.430> darn<00:02:57.000> animation<00:02:58.340> every<00:02:59.340> single

for the oh darn animation every single
picture<00:02:59.760> drawing<00:03:00.450> fresh<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.160> see<00:03:02.370> by

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
picture drawing fresh you can see by

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.890 
picture drawing fresh you can see by
looking<00:03:02.610> ton<00:03:03.000> ones<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.360> did<00:03:03.480> not<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> lot<00:03:03.840> of

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
looking ton ones it did not a lot of

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.860 
looking ton ones it did not a lot of
purple<00:03:04.140> going<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:08.060> now<00:03:09.060> frame<00:03:09.360> by<00:03:09.480> frame<00:03:09.510> is

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
purple going on now frame by frame is

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.470 
purple going on now frame by frame is
very<00:03:10.050> nice<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.770> looks<00:03:11.100> great<00:03:11.490> but<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:12.030> can

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
very nice and it looks great but it can

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.330 
very nice and it looks great but it can
be<00:03:12.600> very<00:03:12.780> time-consuming<00:03:13.050> so<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.920> lot<00:03:14.220> of

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
be very time-consuming so a lot of

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.700 
be very time-consuming so a lot of
people<00:03:14.550> use<00:03:14.790> motion<00:03:15.210> tween<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.990> cut<00:03:16.320> corners

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
people use motion tween to cut corners

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.740 
people use motion tween to cut corners
and<00:03:16.740> save<00:03:17.100> time<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.670> make<00:03:18.060> things<00:03:18.270> easier<00:03:18.600> on

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and save time and make things easier on

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.090 
and save time and make things easier on
themselves<00:03:20.150> also<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.530> one<00:03:22.530> additional<00:03:22.890> tip

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
themselves also in a one additional tip

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.640 
themselves also in a one additional tip
to<00:03:23.250> note<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.810> if<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:25.350> look<00:03:25.500> at<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
to note is that if you look at the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.950 
to note is that if you look at the
properties<00:03:26.070> window<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.520> motion<00:03:27.030> tween<00:03:27.210> you

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
properties window for motion tween you

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.370 
properties window for motion tween you
can<00:03:28.140> actually<00:03:28.410> change<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.860> ease<00:03:29.600> which<00:03:30.600> will

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
can actually change the ease which will

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.260 
can actually change the ease which will
make<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.620> slow<00:03:31.920> down<00:03:32.100> towards<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.820> ending<00:03:33.120> of

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
make it slow down towards the ending of

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.840 
make it slow down towards the ending of
the<00:03:33.510> frames<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.860> you<00:03:34.950> could<00:03:35.100> avoid<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.490> sudden

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
the frames so you could avoid the sudden

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.460 
the frames so you could avoid the sudden
stop<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.600> gets<00:03:36.750> when<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.020> hits<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.350> end

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
stop that it gets when it hits the end

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.940 
stop that it gets when it hits the end
or<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.220> opposite<00:03:38.580> doing<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:38.910> in<00:03:39.260> now<00:03:40.260> one<00:03:40.680> last

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
or the opposite doing it in now one last

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.220 
or the opposite doing it in now one last
thing<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.370> note<00:03:41.400> about<00:03:41.580> motion<00:03:42.540> tweens<00:03:42.930> or

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
thing to note about motion tweens or

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.740 
thing to note about motion tweens or
rather<00:03:43.520> movie<00:03:44.520> clips<00:03:44.790> which<00:03:45.240> is<00:03:45.360> what<00:03:45.510> we<00:03:45.600> had

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
rather movie clips which is what we had

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.930 
rather movie clips which is what we had
turn<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.709> motion<00:03:47.010> tween<00:03:47.130> circle<00:03:47.490> into<00:03:47.760> is

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
turn the motion tween circle into is

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.480 
turn the motion tween circle into is
that<00:03:48.420> by<00:03:49.230> making<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.740> movie<00:03:49.950> clip<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.340> can

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
that by making it a movie clip you can

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.910 
that by making it a movie clip you can
actually<00:03:50.700> go<00:03:51.060> inside<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:51.990> by<00:03:52.620> double

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
actually go inside of it by double

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.620 
actually go inside of it by double
clicking<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.459> see<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.030> we<00:03:54.240> clicked<00:03:54.480> it

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
clicking it you see that we clicked it

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.449 
clicking it you see that we clicked it
now<00:03:55.290> if<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.500> see<00:03:55.680> where<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:55.890> says<00:03:56.010> scene<00:03:56.250> one

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
now if you see where it says scene one

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.210 
now if you see where it says scene one
and<00:03:56.900> then<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.080> says<00:03:58.290> symbol<00:03:58.680> one<00:03:58.830> that's

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
and then it says symbol one that's

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.160 
and then it says symbol one that's
because<00:03:59.490> we<00:03:59.610> went<00:03:59.820> inside<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.540> circle<00:04:00.900> if<00:04:01.020> you

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
because we went inside the circle if you

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.960 
because we went inside the circle if you
want<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.470> go<00:04:01.530> back<00:04:01.770> outside<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.580> click<00:04:02.760> scene

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
want to go back outside and click scene

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.870 
want to go back outside and click scene
one<00:04:03.890> so<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:04.950> now<00:04:05.040> we're<00:04:05.190> back<00:04:05.340> on<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.610> stage

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
one so you now we're back on the stage

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.060 
one so you now we're back on the stage
but<00:04:06.300> go<00:04:06.840> into<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.140> circle<00:04:07.440> double<00:04:07.740> click<00:04:07.890> it

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
but go into the circle double click it

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.430 
but go into the circle double click it
now<00:04:08.220> you've<00:04:08.700> got<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> brand-new<00:04:09.480> timeline<00:04:10.110> that

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
now you've got a brand-new timeline that

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.010 
now you've got a brand-new timeline that
is<00:04:10.500> inside<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.250> circle<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.060> go<00:04:12.750> ahead<00:04:12.870> and

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
is inside the circle so go ahead and

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.380 
is inside the circle so go ahead and
draw<00:04:13.709> something<00:04:13.920> on<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.190> circle<00:04:14.459> there<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:15.300> we

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
draw something on the circle there so we

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.700 
draw something on the circle there so we
can<00:04:15.510> show<00:04:15.750> what<00:04:15.870> is<00:04:16.020> about<00:04:17.930> gonna<00:04:18.930> give<00:04:19.410> it

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
can show what is about gonna give it

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.439 
can show what is about gonna give it
face<00:04:20.479> obviously

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
face obviously

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.990 
face obviously
you<00:04:23.449> can<00:04:23.570> see<00:04:23.660> here<00:04:23.919> it's<00:04:24.919> got<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.190> couple

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
you can see here it's got a couple

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.390 
you can see here it's got a couple
frames<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.540> regular<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.740> then<00:04:27.980> with<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.160> face

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
frames and regular and then with a face

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.900 
frames and regular and then with a face
so<00:04:29.150> now<00:04:29.240> if<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.419> go<00:04:29.540> back<00:04:29.570> out<00:04:30.580> which<00:04:31.580> you

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
so now if you go back out which you

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.879 
so now if you go back out which you
can't<00:04:32.180> actually<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.990> won't<00:04:33.199> see<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.440> happen

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
can't actually you won't see that happen

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.040 
can't actually you won't see that happen
in<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.220> preview<00:04:34.610> but<00:04:35.060> if<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.449> export<00:04:35.900> with

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
in the preview but if you export with

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.719 
in the preview but if you export with
control-enter<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:37.010> will<00:04:37.160> see<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.430> happening

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
control-enter you will see it happening

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.510 
control-enter you will see it happening
so<00:04:38.449> while<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.199> main<00:04:39.440> timeline<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:40.070> happening

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
so while the main timeline is happening

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.930 
so while the main timeline is happening
the<00:04:41.180> internal<00:04:41.870> Clips<00:04:42.340> timeline<00:04:43.340> is<00:04:43.639> also

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
the internal Clips timeline is also

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.909 
the internal Clips timeline is also
happening<00:04:44.360> why<00:04:44.840> that's<00:04:45.139> why<00:04:45.320> it's<00:04:45.470> flashing<00:04:45.830> a

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
happening why that's why it's flashing a

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.870 
happening why that's why it's flashing a
face<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:46.370> it's<00:04:46.760> looping<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:48.550> that's<00:04:49.550> pretty

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
face and it's looping and that's pretty

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.340 
face and it's looping and that's pretty
much<00:04:50.000> everything<00:04:50.180> for<00:04:50.660> frame<00:04:51.199> by<00:04:51.320> frame

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
much everything for frame by frame

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.340 
much everything for frame by frame
versus<00:04:52.130> motion<00:04:52.550> tween<00:04:52.840> they're<00:04:53.840> both<00:04:54.050> good

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
versus motion tween they're both good

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.530 
versus motion tween they're both good
styles<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.070> using<00:04:55.729> both<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.300> them<00:04:56.389> together

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
styles and using both of them together

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:05.170 
styles and using both of them together
is<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.560> key<00:05:02.530> don't<00:05:03.550> don't<00:05:04.550> don't<00:05:04.910> look<00:05:05.060> at

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
is the key don't don't don't look at

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.280 
is the key don't don't don't look at
that<00:05:05.270> face<00:05:06.729> don't<00:05:07.729> look<00:05:07.880> at<00:05:07.970> that<00:05:08.060> face<00:05:08.300> okay

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
that face don't look at that face okay

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.160 
that face don't look at that face okay
