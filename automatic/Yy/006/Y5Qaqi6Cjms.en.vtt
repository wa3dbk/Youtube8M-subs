00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.910
 months ranked eighth 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.090
 although he may not be impacted mayer to 11 laps he scored 97 this is hugo 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.609
 oliveras the monster 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.929
 photo the same participated in what concerns me 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.909
 I see a little movement possibly the case but still the bay 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.579
 lap 97 98 and has proposed 97 this one hit the wall 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 per hundred and part of olivera climbed that is well 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.369
 let's hope that it is well blows and strong because we made quite strong 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.330
 hurt 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.370
 specifically the low tide there was liberation a monster 11 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.950
 and in serving him 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.830
 the winter ocs 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.830
 According to where I work 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.590
 already when we had the image of the act of hugo oliveras the eleven on the wall 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 we also learned that it had happened prior to that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.890
 The good thing is that the pilot at this moment in Bilbao has lowered the mesh and 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.830
 is conversed and that the officers 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.680
 it will surely descend 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.410
 to take it to the 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.170
 medical review of course 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 It's a good 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.730
 good indication that the same 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.730
 percent in the window mesh 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.030
 mou we do not want reiteration 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.080
 we go to the repetition by the contact presented here has been touched with 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.000
 if you come rolling down 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.520
 comes with Thursday 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.040
 in this repetition it seems to me that it has been touched olivera is taken with corner 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.180
 back right 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.440
 the car one is what I got to see I do not know if you saw something else 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.030
 percent like I had I kept the image when all of it is the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.480
 low and starting that I think vick to avoid contact 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.600
 lose control of the car with tondo and then it starts 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.550
 percent choose their problems he comes from a thirteenth place in 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.340
 querétaro 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.470
 there would be part will be seen 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.810
 the on the mold we see the abortion or not 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.029
 from pérez 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:12.699
 and then olive trees that ends up touching what is good my right side 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.619
 of the car one 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:19.479
 i and then saleh goes until May 11 hebe of correct rises ended 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.479
 impacting against the containment barrier 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.829
 you had a huge drop 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.989
 Bolivian Pavón 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.279
