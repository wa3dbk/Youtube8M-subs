you<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.440> next<00:03:30.590> step<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.730> got<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.090> head

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
you the next step and I got the head

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.420 
you the next step and I got the head
unit<00:03:32.480> out<00:03:32.750> right<00:03:33.200> now<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.440> whole<00:03:33.799> piece<00:03:34.010> again

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
unit out right now the whole piece again

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.850 
unit out right now the whole piece again
it<00:03:34.970> just<00:03:35.000> has<00:03:35.299> some<00:03:35.570> pressure<00:03:36.049> clips<00:03:36.440> on<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.769> so

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
it just has some pressure clips on it so

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.410 
it just has some pressure clips on it so
you<00:03:36.950> just<00:03:36.980> really<00:03:37.220> got<00:03:37.430> just<00:03:37.640> work<00:03:37.820> that<00:03:38.060> and

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
you just really got just work that and

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.810 
you just really got just work that and
then<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.019> connector<00:03:39.470> is<00:03:39.650> gonna<00:03:39.830> be<00:03:39.980> back

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
then the connector is gonna be back

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.970 
then the connector is gonna be back
there<00:03:41.120> down<00:03:41.600> below<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.440> connection<00:03:42.799> so

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
there down below that connection so

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.800 
there down below that connection so
that's<00:03:43.370> what<00:03:43.519> I'm<00:03:43.610> gonna<00:03:43.700> get<00:03:43.910> right<00:03:44.120> now<00:03:44.390> and

that's what I'm gonna get right now and
I'm<00:03:45.260> gonna<00:03:45.350> go<00:03:45.440> ahead<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:45.860> connect<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.190> unit

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
I'm gonna go ahead and connect the unit

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.360 
I'm gonna go ahead and connect the unit
and<00:03:46.730> pass<00:03:47.060> an<00:03:47.239> account<00:03:47.540> if<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.170> can<00:03:48.290> see<00:03:48.560> that

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
gonna put this piece back and then I'll

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.640 
gonna put this piece back and then I'll
connect<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.269> unit<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:00.720> fasten<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.079> down<00:04:01.140> at

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
connect the unit and fasten it down at

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.380 
connect the unit and fasten it down at
units<00:04:02.010> back<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.459> for<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.790> most<00:04:02.970> part<00:04:03.209> right

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
units back in for the most part right

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.479 
units back in for the most part right
there<00:04:03.659> so<00:04:03.930> there<00:04:04.530> are<00:04:04.709> some<00:04:04.920> screws<00:04:05.159> that<00:04:05.430> are

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489

there so there are some screws that are
right<00:04:05.760> behind<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.360> thermostat<00:04:06.870> adjusters

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
right behind the thermostat adjusters

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.360 
right behind the thermostat adjusters
and<00:04:07.409> everything<00:04:07.829> so<00:04:07.950> I'm<00:04:08.010> gonna<00:04:08.099> put<00:04:08.280> those

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
two screws back in and then also

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.890 
two screws back in and then also
obviously<00:04:11.370> put<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:11.909> back<00:04:12.209> because<00:04:12.510> now<00:04:12.870> I

obviously put this back because now I

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.110 
obviously put this back because now I
can<00:04:13.170> just<00:04:13.200> get<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.530> where<00:04:14.099> I<00:04:14.129> got<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.430> behind

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
can just get to where I got to behind

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.289 
can just get to where I got to behind
the<00:04:15.569> glove<00:04:16.500> compartment<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.160> that's<00:04:18.120> pretty

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
the glove compartment and that's pretty

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.289 
the glove compartment and that's pretty
much<00:04:18.389> it<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:18.720> we'll<00:04:19.049> go<00:04:19.169> ahead<00:04:19.260> I'll<00:04:20.299> tighten

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
much it so we'll go ahead I'll tighten

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.540 
much it so we'll go ahead I'll tighten
those<00:04:21.449> back<00:04:21.690> up<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.139> then<00:04:22.919> connect<00:04:23.280> up<00:04:23.430> the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
those back up and then connect up the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.550 
those back up and then connect up the
unit<00:04:23.820> make<00:04:24.630> sure<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:24.960> put<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.260> bolt

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
unit make sure that you put the bolt

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.350 
unit make sure that you put the bolt
back<00:04:25.860> in<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.490> head<00:04:26.729> unit<00:04:26.910> doesn't<00:04:27.240> really

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
back in so the head unit doesn't really

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.540 
back in so the head unit doesn't really
go<00:04:27.510> anywhere<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.840> bolt<00:04:28.199> right<00:04:28.380> there<00:04:28.590> if<00:04:28.979> you

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
go anywhere that bolt right there if you

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.610 
go anywhere that bolt right there if you
see<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.910> right<00:04:30.210> there<00:04:30.449> just<00:04:31.139> tighten<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.560> down

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
see it right there just tighten it down

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.650 
see it right there just tighten it down
and<00:04:32.100> then<00:04:32.310> head<00:04:32.490> won't<00:04:33.000> go<00:04:33.180> make<00:04:33.449> sure<00:04:33.570> the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
and then head won't go make sure the

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.270 
and then head won't go make sure the
wires<00:04:33.870> are<00:04:34.050> all<00:04:34.229> okay<00:04:34.440> nothing's<00:04:34.800> jammed<00:04:35.100> in

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
wires are all okay nothing's jammed in

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.100 
wires are all okay nothing's jammed in
there<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:36.120> again<00:04:36.210> we<00:04:36.449> have<00:04:36.600> this<00:04:36.750> coming<00:04:36.990> out

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
there and again we have this coming out

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.990 
there and again we have this coming out
right<00:04:37.350> here<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.889> that's<00:04:38.190> what<00:04:38.820> we're<00:04:38.910> gonna

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
right here and that's what we're gonna

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.600 
right here and that's what we're gonna
hook<00:04:39.150> up<00:04:39.270> next<00:04:39.800> again<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.919> unit's<00:04:41.280> gonna<00:04:41.460> hug

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
hook up next again the unit's gonna hug

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.589 
hook up next again the unit's gonna hug
them

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
them

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:49.129 
them
there's<00:04:44.020> an<00:04:44.080> easy<00:04:44.259> connection<00:04:44.559> right<00:04:44.860> there<00:04:45.099> I

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.540 

just<00:04:50.139> have<00:04:50.439> a<00:04:50.469> fashion<00:04:50.919> down<00:04:51.069> with<00:04:51.249> a<00:04:51.279> wire

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
just have a fashion down with a wire

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.609 
just have a fashion down with a wire
time<00:04:51.909> I<00:04:52.300> might<00:04:52.539> you<00:04:52.749> know<00:04:52.779> end<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.139> moving<00:04:53.319> it

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:53.619 
time I might you know end up moving it

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:55.679 
time I might you know end up moving it
if<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.949> doesn't<00:04:54.219> work<00:04:54.339> out<00:04:54.520> there<00:04:54.849> but<00:04:55.449> it's

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689 
if it doesn't work out there but it's

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:56.999 
if it doesn't work out there but it's
easy<00:04:55.990> enough<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.349> biggest<00:04:56.619> thing<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.860> getting

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
easy enough the biggest thing is getting

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.040 
easy enough the biggest thing is getting
to<00:04:57.219> the<00:04:57.610> wire<00:04:57.819> that's<00:04:58.059> behind<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.479> radio<00:04:58.749> so

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
to the wire that's behind the radio so

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.089 
to the wire that's behind the radio so
now<00:04:59.229> I'm<00:04:59.319> not<00:04:59.439> to<00:04:59.589> worry

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
now I'm not to worry

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.269 
now I'm not to worry
both<00:05:00.879> are<00:05:01.089> plugged<00:05:01.330> in<00:05:01.539> right<00:05:01.899> there<00:05:02.199> you<00:05:03.069> can

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 
both are plugged in right there you can

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.369 
both are plugged in right there you can
see<00:05:03.309> it<00:05:03.580> on<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:03.849> ground<00:05:03.999> unit<00:05:04.449> goes<00:05:05.110> into<00:05:05.319> the

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:05.379 
see it on the ground unit goes into the

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:07.379 
see it on the ground unit goes into the
