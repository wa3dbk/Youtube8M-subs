tutorial<00:00:02.520> for<00:00:02.790> giant<00:00:03.330> snail<00:00:04.160> this<00:00:05.160> is

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
tutorial for giant snail this is

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.440 
tutorial for giant snail this is
stitched<00:00:05.640> by<00:00:06.120> first<00:00:06.509> starting<00:00:07.049> with<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> large

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
stitched by first starting with a large

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.570 
stitched by first starting with a large
spiral<00:00:09.450> shape<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:11.040> can<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> little

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
spiral shape and it can be a little

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.480 
spiral shape and it can be a little
tricky<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.360> stitch<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.870> really<00:00:13.559> big<00:00:13.769> spiral<00:00:14.099> in

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
tricky to stitch a really big spiral in

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.420 
tricky to stitch a really big spiral in
a<00:00:14.759> square<00:00:15.210> shape<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.990> if<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.980> trouble

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
a square shape so if you have trouble

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.279 
a square shape so if you have trouble
with<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.699> initial<00:00:18.210> part<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.869> always

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
with this initial part you can always

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.689 
with this initial part you can always
mark<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.939> makes<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.449> lot<00:00:21.630> easier

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
mark it and that makes it a lot easier

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.099 
mark it and that makes it a lot easier
but<00:00:23.699> that's<00:00:23.939> what<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.210> first<00:00:24.449> start<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:24.840> and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
but that's what you first start with and

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.650 
but that's what you first start with and
the<00:00:25.470> spiral<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.279> really<00:00:26.670> your<00:00:26.880> foundation

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the spiral is really your foundation

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900 
the spiral is really your foundation
exactly<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> design<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.730> did

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
exactly like in the design that we did

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
exactly like in the design that we did
earlier<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.740> spiral<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.769> spirals<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.390> spiral

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
earlier a spiral of spirals the spiral

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.709 
earlier a spiral of spirals the spiral
is<00:00:34.079> simply<00:00:34.640> kind<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.850> foundation<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> base

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
is simply kind of a foundation a base

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.110 
is simply kind of a foundation a base
for<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.649> stitches<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> rest<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> design

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
for your stitches the rest of the design

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.280 
for your stitches the rest of the design
to<00:00:39.420> build<00:00:39.690> off<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:41.000> if<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.600> lay<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> good

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to build off of and if you lay a good

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.440 
to build off of and if you lay a good
foundation<00:00:43.520> then<00:00:44.520> your<00:00:44.940> design<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.420> look

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
foundation then your design will look

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.420 
foundation then your design will look
really<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:46.020> good<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.219> something

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
really really good so it's something

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.680 
really really good so it's something
that<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> definitely<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> take<00:00:48.510> your

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that you definitely want to take your

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.350 
that you definitely want to take your
time<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.610> once<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.120> foundation

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
time on once you get your foundation

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.139 
time on once you get your foundation
laid<00:00:51.980> now<00:00:52.980> you're<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.879> stitch

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
laid now you're just going to stitch

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.709 
laid now you're just going to stitch
from<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.289> edge<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> spiral<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
from the edge of the spiral back to the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.650 
from the edge of the spiral back to the
point<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.590> tip<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> spiral<00:00:59.820> back<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
point the tip of the spiral back and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.490 
point the tip of the spiral back and
forth<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.469> nice<00:01:01.739> curvy<00:01:02.489> line<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:04.320> is

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
forth with a nice curvy line and this is

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
forth with a nice curvy line and this is
kind<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.040> variation<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.909> another<00:01:06.330> design

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
kind of a variation of another design

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.300 
kind of a variation of another design
that<00:01:06.750> we've<00:01:07.049> done<00:01:07.260> already<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.130> was

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that we've done already and that was

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.179 
that we've done already and that was
fossil<00:01:08.850> snail<00:01:09.200> but<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> wanted<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> try<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
fossil snail but I wanted to try it on a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.240 
fossil snail but I wanted to try it on a
larger<00:01:11.760> scale<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.710> see<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.070> any

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
larger scale and see if it was any

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.700 
larger scale and see if it was any
easier<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.000> stitch<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.110> stitch<00:01:16.350> big

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
easier to stitch if it was stitch big

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.170 
easier to stitch if it was stitch big
and<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.090> always<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.930> initial

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
and there is always the initial

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.580 
and there is always the initial
problematic<00:01:21.180> area<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:22.049> right<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
problematic area and that's right at the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.940 
problematic area and that's right at the
very<00:01:22.710> tip<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.570> in<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> central

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
very tip of in you know the central

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.940 
very tip of in you know the central
inside<00:01:26.490> portion<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.869> giant<00:01:28.290> snail<00:01:28.530> shape

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
inside portion of the giant snail shape

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.120 
inside portion of the giant snail shape
but<00:01:29.759> after<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.360> out<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.799> really

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
but after you get out of there it really

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160 
but after you get out of there it really
starts<00:01:32.729> coming<00:01:32.970> together<00:01:33.060> very<00:01:33.360> very<00:01:33.840> quickly

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
starts coming together very very quickly

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.880 
starts coming together very very quickly
because<00:01:35.159> all<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.570> curvy<00:01:37.170> line<00:01:37.200> going

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
because all it is is a curvy line going

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.640 
because all it is is a curvy line going
back<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.369> forth<00:01:38.640> from<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.659> edge<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
back and forth from one edge of the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.679 
back and forth from one edge of the
spiral<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.369> other<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.450> actually

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
spiral to the other so it's actually

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.200 
spiral to the other so it's actually
quite<00:01:43.049> easy<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.340> don't<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.970> stitch

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
quite easy and you don't have to stitch

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.749 
quite easy and you don't have to stitch
it<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.479> densely<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.229> doing<00:01:46.470> right<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:47.369> I'm

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
it as densely as I'm doing right now I'm

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.670 
it as densely as I'm doing right now I'm
stitching<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.630> my<00:01:48.750> lines<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.229> roughly

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
stitching so that my lines are roughly

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.340 
stitching so that my lines are roughly
about<00:01:49.860> an<00:01:50.100> eighth<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.490> an<00:01:50.579> inch<00:01:50.670> apart<00:01:51.110> but<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
about an eighth of an inch apart but the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.200 
about an eighth of an inch apart but the
wider<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.549> stitch<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
wider that you go with this stitch I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.520 
wider that you go with this stitch I
think<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.649> still<00:01:55.920> look<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.549> very<00:01:56.820> good

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
think it can still look very very good

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.020 
think it can still look very very good
so<00:01:58.530> don't<00:01:58.680> feel<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.549> stitch<00:02:00.000> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so don't feel like you have to stitch it
