 to use this 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.560
 says the 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.600
 a paint brush a drain grid in 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.610
 plastic scotch of paper after having 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.710
 covered surfaces to be protected with 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.410
 plastic sheeting and scotch tape started the

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.090
 first of all create a frame 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.680
 around the area you need to paint 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.630
 using the brush since with the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.140
 roller it is difficult to cover well the 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:02:09.060
 corners of the room 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:02:11.680

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.330
 then take the role poured 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.800
 in the appropriate paint tray 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.480
 do enough to wet it then do it 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.860
 scroll on the grid until 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.690
 the excess of paint will have been 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.280
 deleted then you can start 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.500
 pass the directions on the walls 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.810
 general are to start from the top 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.020
 then paint the ceiling first 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.580
 the walls starting from the top 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.650
 remember to overlap slightly 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.950
 the passes in order to uniform 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.700
 the effect and treat areas of about one 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.280
 square meter at a time as far as 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.990
 regards the ceiling crossed the sense 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.920
 of the two hands of painting so as to 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.920
 have better coverage 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.050
 every time the paint on the roller 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.500
 ends up reloading the cloth with the procedure 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.570
 first illustrated resume painting 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.760
 always without excessive pressure e 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:12.250
 without going too quickly because 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.830
 you could create drips for 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.280
 the higher walls you can use 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:05:02.690
 a convenient extension for your roller
