woofer apart magically show you the back

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.819 
woofer apart magically show you the back
if<00:00:39.559> you<00:00:39.770> notice<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:41.180> cone<00:00:41.450> it<00:00:41.660> has<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.829> flat

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
if you notice the cone it has a flat

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.709 
if you notice the cone it has a flat
surface<00:00:43.100> but<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.940> back<00:00:44.120> of<00:00:44.300> it<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:44.510> in<00:00:44.629> the

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
surface but the back of it is in the

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.709 
surface but the back of it is in the
shape<00:00:44.960> though<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.039> regular<00:00:46.339> cone<00:00:46.609> it's<00:00:47.600> a

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
shape though the regular cone it's a

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.569 
shape though the regular cone it's a
molded<00:00:48.050> material<00:00:48.589> and<00:00:48.739> it's<00:00:48.859> actually<00:00:49.219> molded

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
molded material and it's actually molded

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.270 
molded material and it's actually molded
as<00:00:49.699> a<00:00:49.730> solid<00:00:50.210> piece<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:50.719> material<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.379> you

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
as a solid piece of material and you

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.099 
as a solid piece of material and you
might<00:00:52.429> look<00:00:52.579> at<00:00:52.760> it<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.030> say<00:00:53.210> well<00:00:53.449> that<00:00:53.899> looks

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
might look at it and say well that looks

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.340 
might look at it and say well that looks
pretty<00:00:54.170> heavy<00:00:55.120> well<00:00:56.120> in<00:00:56.239> fact<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.690> cone

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
pretty heavy well in fact the cone

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.639 
pretty heavy well in fact the cone
itself<00:00:57.649> weighs<00:00:57.890> only<00:00:58.070> 3.1<00:00:58.789> grams

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
itself weighs only 3.1 grams

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.439 
itself weighs only 3.1 grams
conventional<00:01:00.649> polypropylene<00:01:01.309> cone<00:01:01.699> probably

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
conventional polypropylene cone probably

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.420 
conventional polypropylene cone probably
weighs<00:01:02.569> about<00:01:02.749> 7<00:01:03.199> grams<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:03.739> this<00:01:03.890> thing<00:01:04.100> this

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
weighs about 7 grams so this thing this

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.340 
weighs about 7 grams so this thing this
is<00:01:04.489> about<00:01:04.610> half<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.180> weight<00:01:05.330> which<00:01:06.050> means

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
is about half the weight which means

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.810 
is about half the weight which means
that<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.680> can<00:01:06.830> move<00:01:06.980> very<00:01:07.010> quickly<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.700> very

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
that it can move very quickly and very

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.840 
that it can move very quickly and very
accurately<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:10.040> other<00:01:10.159> thing<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:10.729> do

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
accurately the other thing that we do

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.270 
accurately the other thing that we do
with<00:01:11.000> them<00:01:11.120> is<00:01:11.300> we<00:01:11.870> have<00:01:12.020> Kevlar<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:12.950> we<00:01:13.040> use

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
with them is we have Kevlar that we use

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.390 
with them is we have Kevlar that we use
as<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.580> coating<00:01:13.910> on<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.210> back<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.750> cone<00:01:15.080> and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
as a coating on the back of the cone and

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.530 
as a coating on the back of the cone and
glass<00:01:16.400> fiber<00:01:16.700> as<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:16.970> coating<00:01:17.270> on<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.510> front

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
glass fiber as a coating on the front

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.780 
glass fiber as a coating on the front
and<00:01:18.110> what<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.530> does<00:01:18.800> is<00:01:19.010> it<00:01:19.130> gives<00:01:19.280> us<00:01:19.550> a

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
and what this does is it gives us a

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.620 
and what this does is it gives us a
really<00:01:20.420> nice<00:01:20.630> surface<00:01:21.050> for<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:23.300> solid

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
really nice surface for the the solid

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.230 
really nice surface for the the solid
piston<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.140> move<00:01:24.350> from<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.730> gives<00:01:25.910> us<00:01:26.060> a

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
piston to move from and it gives us a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.410 
piston to move from and it gives us a
very<00:01:26.540> smooth<00:01:26.900> mid<00:01:27.140> range<00:01:28.180> conventional<00:01:29.180> cones

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
very smooth mid range conventional cones

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.420 
very smooth mid range conventional cones
because<00:01:30.200> they're<00:01:30.620> made<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.950> very<00:01:31.160> thin

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
because they're made of a very thin

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.660 
because they're made of a very thin
material<00:01:32.000> have<00:01:32.660> a<00:01:32.720> couple<00:01:33.020> disadvantages<00:01:33.770> one

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
material have a couple disadvantages one

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.090 
material have a couple disadvantages one
of<00:01:34.760> them<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.260> way<00:01:36.650> that<00:01:36.860> they<00:01:37.040> were

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
of them is that the way that they were

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.580 
of them is that the way that they were
produced<00:01:37.490> mid<00:01:37.730> band<00:01:37.910> frequencies<00:01:38.510> is<00:01:38.780> they<00:01:39.440> go

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
produced mid band frequencies is they go

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.930 
produced mid band frequencies is they go
into<00:01:39.800> what's<00:01:39.950> called<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.220> break<00:01:40.400> up<00:01:40.580> mode<00:01:40.730> where

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
into what's called a break up mode where

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.570 
into what's called a break up mode where
the<00:01:41.090> actual<00:01:41.360> cone<00:01:41.630> itself<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.370> moving<00:01:43.370> the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
the actual cone itself is moving the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.710 
the actual cone itself is moving the
center<00:01:43.760> of<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.120> moving<00:01:44.300> at<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.630> different

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
center of it is moving at a different

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.380 
center of it is moving at a different
frequency<00:01:45.140> than<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.680> rest<00:01:45.920> of<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.130> cone<00:01:46.390> the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
frequency than the rest of the cone the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.750 
frequency than the rest of the cone the
solid<00:01:47.960> piston<00:01:48.350> can't<00:01:48.710> do<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.010> they<00:01:49.520> can't

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
solid piston can't do that they can't

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.030 
solid piston can't do that they can't
break<00:01:49.970> up<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.930> whole<00:01:51.080> thing<00:01:51.290> always<00:01:51.710> moves

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
break up so the whole thing always moves

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.430 
break up so the whole thing always moves
as<00:01:52.340> one<00:01:52.670> unit<00:01:53.360> which<00:01:53.840> gives<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.170> much

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
as one unit which gives you a much

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.789 
as one unit which gives you a much
clearer<00:01:54.860> cleaner<00:01:55.220> signal<00:01:55.700> or<00:01:55.820> sound

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.340 

the<00:02:00.729> other<00:02:00.880> advantage<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.479> solid<00:02:01.810> piston<00:02:02.170> is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
the other advantage of a solid piston is

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.620 
the other advantage of a solid piston is
that<00:02:03.040> all<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.399> sounds<00:02:03.880> emanate<00:02:04.270> from<00:02:04.299> this

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
that all the sounds emanate from this

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.010 
that all the sounds emanate from this
front<00:02:04.840> surface<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.579> they're<00:02:07.450> naturally

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
front surface so they're naturally

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.990 
front surface so they're naturally
aligned<00:02:08.440> in<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.009> time<00:02:09.250> domain<00:02:09.399> with<00:02:09.970> the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
aligned in the time domain with the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.210

tweeter<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.840> mid-range<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.860> can<00:02:12.040> see

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
tweeter and the mid-range you can see

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.490 
tweeter and the mid-range you can see
that<00:02:12.430> all<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.640> them<00:02:12.849> are<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.239> same<00:02:13.500> surface

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
that all of them are in the same surface

a very very rigid cabinet and the reason

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.789 
a very very rigid cabinet and the reason
why<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.780> want<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.019> bridge<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.200> cabinet<00:03:11.709> is

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
why you want to bridge a cabinet is

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.650 
why you want to bridge a cabinet is
because<00:03:12.040> when<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.340> thing<00:03:12.579> is<00:03:12.660> reproducing

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
because when this thing is reproducing

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.380 
because when this thing is reproducing
sound<00:03:13.959> its<00:03:14.640> reproducing<00:03:15.640> as<00:03:15.760> much<00:03:15.940> down<00:03:16.150> in

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
sound its reproducing as much down in

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.330 
sound its reproducing as much down in
this<00:03:16.810> direction<00:03:16.989> as<00:03:17.470> it's<00:03:17.680> reproducing

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
this direction as it's reproducing

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.880 
this direction as it's reproducing
inside<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.359> cabinet<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.230> all<00:03:20.320> those<00:03:20.470> sounds

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
inside the cabinet and all those sounds

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.310 
inside the cabinet and all those sounds
inside<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.310> cabinet<00:03:21.730> tend<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.290> vibrate<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
inside the cabinet tend to vibrate the

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.979 
inside the cabinet tend to vibrate the
cabinet<00:03:23.799> surface<00:03:24.160> itself<00:03:24.459> so<00:03:25.299> by<00:03:25.450> having<00:03:25.630> this

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
cabinet surface itself so by having this

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.930 
cabinet surface itself so by having this
radius<00:03:26.560> here<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.160> makes<00:03:27.340> for<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.549> very<00:03:27.579> rigid

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
radius here it makes for a very rigid

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.280 
radius here it makes for a very rigid
structure<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.780> then<00:03:29.410> using<00:03:29.859> 3/4<00:03:30.850> inch<00:03:31.060> MDF<00:03:31.299> it

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
structure and then using 3/4 inch MDF it

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.800 
structure and then using 3/4 inch MDF it
makes<00:03:32.530> her<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.680> very<00:03:32.920> non-resident<00:03:33.850> cabinet<00:03:34.299> so

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
makes her a very non-resident cabinet so

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.599 
makes her a very non-resident cabinet so
the<00:03:34.930> cabinet's<00:03:35.380> not<00:03:35.560> adding<00:03:35.980> anything<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.430> the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
the cabinet's not adding anything to the

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.610 
the cabinet's not adding anything to the

driver<00:04:01.870> like<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.200> polypropylene<00:04:02.770> or<00:04:03.040> paper<00:04:03.370> or

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
driver like a polypropylene or paper or

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.449 
driver like a polypropylene or paper or
even<00:04:04.390> aluminum<00:04:04.810> woofer<00:04:05.739> they're<00:04:06.010> very<00:04:06.220> thin

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
even aluminum woofer they're very thin

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.820 
even aluminum woofer they're very thin
materials<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.780> those<00:04:07.959> sound<00:04:08.260> waves<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:08.680> are

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
materials so those sound waves that are

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.160 
materials so those sound waves that are
inside<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.340> cabin<00:04:09.640> all<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:09.940> energy<00:04:10.170> tends

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
inside the cabin all that energy tends

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.540 
inside the cabin all that energy tends
to<00:04:11.350> come<00:04:11.530> out<00:04:11.650> right<00:04:11.920> through<00:04:12.160> that<00:04:12.310> thin

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
to come out right through that thin

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.750 
to come out right through that thin
material<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.330> mix<00:04:14.050> with<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.260> front<00:04:14.530> wave<00:04:14.760> not

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
material and mix with the front wave not

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.460 
material and mix with the front wave not
a<00:04:15.790> good<00:04:16.060> thing<00:04:16.239> what<00:04:16.780> happens<00:04:17.169> with<00:04:17.290> those

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
a good thing what happens with those

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.840 
a good thing what happens with those
back<00:04:17.680> waves<00:04:17.950> is<00:04:18.190> they're<00:04:18.400> out<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.549> phase<00:04:18.820> with

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
back waves is they're out of phase with

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.659 
back waves is they're out of phase with
the<00:04:19.150> front<00:04:19.359> waves<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:20.440> causes<00:04:20.680> sound<00:04:21.489> to

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
the front waves and it causes sound to

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.690 
the front waves and it causes sound to
be<00:04:21.820> very<00:04:22.030> muddied<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.540> unclear<00:04:23.550> with<00:04:24.550> the

them from to make them a fuzzy opaque so

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.610 
them from to make them a fuzzy opaque so
the<00:04:33.490> sound<00:04:33.760> can't<00:04:34.150> travel<00:04:34.210> through<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.960> cone
