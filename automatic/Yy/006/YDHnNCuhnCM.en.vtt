once you get practice of it the combo

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.410 
once you get practice of it the combo
will<00:02:12.340> look<00:02:12.459> like<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.730> just<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.239> regular

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
will look like this just like a regular

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.230 
will look like this just like a regular
snap<00:02:13.750> browse<00:02:13.989> around<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.410> fan

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.500 

see<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.470> does<00:02:22.620> incredibly<00:02:23.070> much<00:02:23.220> damage

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.120 

now<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:28.050> good<00:02:28.200> points<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.530> bad<00:02:28.620> points<00:02:28.740> to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
now the good points and bad points to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.280 
now the good points and bad points to
this<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.580> good<00:02:29.760> points<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.960> same<00:02:31.170> as

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
this the good points is it's the same as

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.970 
this the good points is it's the same as
the<00:02:31.380> regular<00:02:31.530> Ram<00:02:32.130> snap<00:02:32.370> fan<00:02:33.170> quick<00:02:34.170> safe

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the regular Ram snap fan quick safe

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.210 
the regular Ram snap fan quick safe
range<00:02:35.490> does<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> lot<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.600> damage<00:02:36.980> but<00:02:37.980> since

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
range does a lot of damage but since

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.270 
range does a lot of damage but since
you're<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.490> clipping<00:02:39.000> two<00:02:39.660> skills<00:02:40.280> you'll

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
you're like clipping two skills you'll

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.840 
you're like clipping two skills you'll
be<00:02:41.430> using<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.700> twice<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.240> amount<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.510> power

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
be using that twice the amount of power

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.490 
be using that twice the amount of power
so<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:45.210> will<00:02:45.360> really<00:02:45.600> need<00:02:45.720> good<00:02:46.080> controllers

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
so you will really need good controllers

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.110 
so you will really need good controllers
to<00:02:46.620> power<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.010> combo<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> moving<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.090> our

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
to power this combo so moving on to our

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.010 
to power this combo so moving on to our
next<00:02:51.240> one<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.810> my<00:02:52.110> personal<00:02:52.470> favorite<00:02:54.020> this

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
next one and my personal favorite this

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.760 
next one and my personal favorite this
one<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.530> where<00:02:56.100> we<00:02:56.310> combine<00:02:56.730> wit<00:02:57.360> fresh<00:02:57.770> as

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
one is where we combine wit fresh as

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.520 
one is where we combine wit fresh as
part<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.250> RAM<00:02:59.490> snap<00:02:59.790> fan<00:03:00.080> but<00:03:01.080> we<00:03:01.170> won't<00:03:01.350> see

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
part of RAM snap fan but we won't see

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.390 
part of RAM snap fan but we won't see
any<00:03:01.710> of<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.920> animation<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:04.890> well<00:03:05.040> first<00:03:05.280> of

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
any of the animation so well first of

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.470 
any of the animation so well first of
all<00:03:05.490> what<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.790> mean<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.440> we're<00:03:07.440> going<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.620> go<00:03:07.710> RAM

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
all what I mean is we're going to go RAM

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.050 
all what I mean is we're going to go RAM
and<00:03:09.480> I'm<00:03:09.870> going<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.110> tap<00:03:10.290> left<00:03:10.710> Mellie<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.940> get

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
and I'm going to tap left Mellie to get

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.210 
and I'm going to tap left Mellie to get
the<00:03:12.150> wait<00:03:12.270> for<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.560> that's<00:03:13.710> what<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.070> looks

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
the wait for it and that's what it looks

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.940 
the wait for it and that's what it looks
like<00:03:14.370> with<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.640> animation<00:03:15.590> but<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.680> combine

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
like with the animation but to combine

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.820 
like with the animation but to combine
it<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.520> park<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> RAM<00:03:18.060> snap<00:03:18.330> fan<00:03:18.540> combo<00:03:18.960> by

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
it to park the RAM snap fan combo by

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.490 
it to park the RAM snap fan combo by
clipping<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.310> all<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.210> do<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.290> go<00:03:22.470> around

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
clipping it all we do if you go around

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.880 
clipping it all we do if you go around
with<00:03:24.620> fresh

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.300 

so<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> whole<00:03:29.129> thing<00:03:29.310> would<00:03:29.879> be<00:03:30.000> Ram<00:03:31.310> tap

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
so the whole thing would be Ram tap

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.789 
so the whole thing would be Ram tap
Mellie<00:03:32.580> get<00:03:33.360> wit<00:03:33.540> fresh<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.260> then<00:03:34.530> on<00:03:34.650> your

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
Mellie get wit fresh and then on your

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.660 
Mellie get wit fresh and then on your
loadout<00:03:35.150> press<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.390> snap<00:03:36.629> trap<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.950> then

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
loadout press the snap trap and then

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.410 
loadout press the snap trap and then
right<00:03:39.269> click<00:03:39.510> into<00:03:39.810> fan<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.349> jump<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.099> clip

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
right click into fan and jump to clip

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.720 
right click into fan and jump to clip
and<00:03:42.420> then<00:03:42.599> repeat<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> combo<00:03:43.290> all<00:03:43.440> over<00:03:43.650> me<00:03:43.830> so

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
and then repeat the combo all over me so

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.070 
and then repeat the combo all over me so
the<00:03:45.269> combo<00:03:45.629> will<00:03:46.260> look<00:03:46.349> like<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:48.080> we're

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
the combo will look like this we're

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.380 
the combo will look like this we're
clipping

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.020 

you

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.440 

as<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.110> can<00:03:59.230> see<00:03:59.640> the<00:04:00.640> training<00:04:00.940> dummy<00:04:01.090> just

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
as you can see the training dummy just

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.920 
as you can see the training dummy just
melted<00:04:02.230> under<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.560> damage<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:04.480> this<00:04:04.660> one<00:04:04.810> is

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
melted under the damage but this one is

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.800 
melted under the damage but this one is
the<00:04:05.020> same<00:04:05.230> as<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.980> double<00:04:06.250> snap<00:04:06.660> since<00:04:07.660> you're

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
the same as the double snap since you're

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.470 
the same as the double snap since you're
using<00:04:07.950> twice<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.130> powers<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.730> cut<00:04:10.360> through

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
using twice the powers to cut through

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.110 
using twice the powers to cut through
the<00:04:10.569> animation<00:04:11.140> if<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.709> use<00:04:11.770> enough<00:04:12.160> twice

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
the animation if you use enough twice

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.850 
the animation if you use enough twice
the<00:04:13.240> amount<00:04:13.300> of<00:04:13.480> power<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:14.380> you'll<00:04:14.560> really

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
the amount of power so you'll really

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.300 
the amount of power so you'll really
need<00:04:15.130> high<00:04:15.430> virtual<00:04:15.819> as<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.180> pelvis<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:18.010> the

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
need high virtual as the pelvis but the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.290 
need high virtual as the pelvis but the
main<00:04:18.850> good<00:04:18.970> thing<00:04:19.180> about<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:20.970> round<00:04:21.970> wit

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.230 

okay<00:04:43.000> look<00:04:43.600> at<00:04:43.720> that<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.920> TransAm<00:04:45.310> HS<00:04:45.670> mouse

this and the double snap will take time

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.950 
this and the double snap will take time
and<00:04:54.130> practice<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.639> get<00:04:54.759> used<00:04:54.819> to<00:04:55.060> though<00:04:55.180> but

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
and practice to get used to though but

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.089 
and practice to get used to though but
at<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.229> end<00:04:56.259> of<00:04:56.440> it<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:57.370> damage<00:04:57.759> will<00:04:58.750> be

at the end of it the damage will be

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.499 
at the end of it the damage will be
topping<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:00.190> charts<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:03.330> people<00:05:04.330> will<00:05:04.419> be

saying that you've improved a lot so

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.520 
saying that you've improved a lot so
pretty<00:05:09.880> much<00:05:10.000> what<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:10.960> first<00:05:11.139> combo<00:05:11.440> is

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
pretty much what the first combo is

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.500 
pretty much what the first combo is

is that it is smelling so you have to be
