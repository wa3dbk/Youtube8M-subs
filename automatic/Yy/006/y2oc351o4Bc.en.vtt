but to me it's well worth it like I said
the<00:06:28.540> only<00:06:28.690> cons<00:06:28.930> about<00:06:29.139> the<00:06:29.380> case<00:06:29.590> that<00:06:29.620> I<00:06:29.979> have

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
the only cons about the case that I have

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.290 
the only cons about the case that I have
found<00:06:30.880> so<00:06:31.150> far<00:06:31.360> that<00:06:31.570> I<00:06:31.600> don't<00:06:31.870> like<00:06:32.340> are<00:06:33.340> the

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
found so far that I don't like are the

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.390 
found so far that I don't like are the
charging<00:06:34.720> ports<00:06:35.080> they<00:06:35.410> are<00:06:35.590> rather<00:06:35.889> hard<00:06:36.220> to

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
charging ports they are rather hard to

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.580 
charging ports they are rather hard to
get<00:06:36.520> undone<00:06:37.060> over<00:06:37.900> time<00:06:38.080> they<00:06:38.229> will<00:06:38.410> get

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
get undone over time they will get

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.939 
get undone over time they will get
easier<00:06:39.180> so<00:06:40.180> guys<00:06:40.419> that's<00:06:40.720> about<00:06:41.199> it<00:06:41.500> for<00:06:41.860> this

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
easier so guys that's about it for this
