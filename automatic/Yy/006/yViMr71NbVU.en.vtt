outside school you can see it from the eyes if he has the smoke inside the backpack

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.720
there is no mother who comes to get you in the car but the road you know her

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.520
names and faces in this seats

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.600
holes in the walls with hidden money

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.060
you grow up thinking it's right but it's too late when you realize

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.300
and the years pass but

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.980
not the head changes, doesn't change the desire to escape from this buildings

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.900
half shall be a tumor, half go crazy

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.760
screaming, shouting

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.540
packets of ganja brought in taxis, dirty cash

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.240
because isn't said that one day we will be the singers

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.840
and then fuck!

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.180
rest with those who live still selling the smoke

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.000
but never give in to anyone

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.860
without ever licked some ass

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.820
Bro I believe in a different future but the sky in the block is always dark

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.780
don't filter out the rays from these buildings

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.960
and don't see the Sun

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.420

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.200
serving years after arrest

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.380

bad dreams like me (eeeh eeeeeh eh, like me, like me!)

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.220
I wonder how are you

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.320
accustomed to your father that you buy what you don't have

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.160
then walk under the wrong house and they rob you the iPhone and rob you the Nike

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.180
my Brother have ugly faces

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.140
because they pass the bad days

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.680

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.580
