one I really liked it and i got really

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.150 
one I really liked it and i got really
far<00:00:43.640> in<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.850> game<00:00:44.260> but<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:45.620> starts<00:00:46.040> getting

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
far in the game but it starts getting

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.450 
far in the game but it starts getting
ridiculously<00:00:47.089> hard<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:48.710> bad<00:00:48.920> thing<00:00:48.949> was<00:00:49.280> that

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
ridiculously hard the bad thing was that

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.310 
ridiculously hard the bad thing was that
it<00:00:49.519> was<00:00:49.699> my<00:00:49.820> dreamcast<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:50.989> not<00:00:51.170> many

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
it was my dreamcast and so not many

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.560 
it was my dreamcast and so not many
people<00:00:51.739> played<00:00:52.100> it<00:00:52.309> but<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:52.969> think<00:00:53.059> Malala

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
people played it but I think Malala

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.590 
people played it but I think Malala
became<00:00:54.350> kind<00:00:54.949> of<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.219> character<00:00:56.149> than<00:00:56.420> most

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
became kind of a character than most

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.959 
became kind of a character than most
people<00:00:56.870> would<00:00:56.960> recognize<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:58.370> I<00:00:58.670> guess<00:00:58.789> she's

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
people would recognize and I guess she's

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.970 
people would recognize and I guess she's
pretty<00:00:59.180> cool<00:00:59.420> her<00:01:00.230> voice<00:01:00.379> is<00:01:00.440> done<00:01:00.770> by<00:01:00.949> a
