boosted<00:01:01.800> my<00:01:01.920> chances<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.460> doing<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.149> I

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
boosted my chances on doing it because I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.080 
boosted my chances on doing it because I
generally<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:03.930> quite<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> few<00:01:04.920> ideas<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
generally have quite a few ideas and I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
generally have quite a few ideas and I
kind<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.840> narrow<00:01:07.020> them<00:01:07.260> down<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.340> maybe

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
kind of narrow them down then I maybe

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.350 
kind of narrow them down then I maybe
come<00:01:08.729> back<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> few<00:01:09.360> weeks<00:01:09.600> later<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:12.060> don't

I'm going to lower the opacity so it's

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.059
