00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
what does that mean it means that we can

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.650 
what does that mean it means that we can
use<00:00:45.610> this<00:00:45.850> monitor<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.989> set<00:00:47.649> looks<00:00:48.010> on<00:00:48.340> set<00:00:49.149> and

use this monitor to set looks on set and

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.900 
use this monitor to set looks on set and
this<00:00:49.899> is<00:00:50.110> increasingly<00:00:50.980> more<00:00:51.219> important<00:00:51.730> as

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
this is increasingly more important as

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.729 
this is increasingly more important as
we<00:00:51.940> get<00:00:52.329> more<00:00:52.719> and<00:00:52.809> more<00:00:52.870> large<00:00:53.230> sensor

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
we get more and more large sensor

post-production environment and to that
end<00:01:09.550> this<00:01:10.110> monitor<00:01:11.110> has<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> couple<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.800> ways<00:01:11.950> of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
end this monitor has a couple of ways of

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.359 
end this monitor has a couple of ways of
working<00:01:12.670> with<00:01:12.789> Lud's<00:01:13.119> you<00:01:13.899> can<00:01:14.289> with<00:01:15.070> a

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
working with Lud's you can with a

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.380 
working with Lud's you can with a
software<00:01:16.060> program<00:01:16.450> from<00:01:16.810> teaching<00:01:17.080> TV<00:01:17.830> logic

move nuts directly and apply them

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.230 
move nuts directly and apply them
essentially<00:01:21.849> what<00:01:21.970> happens<00:01:22.300> is<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:23.880> saves<00:01:24.880> the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
essentially what happens is it saves the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.380 
essentially what happens is it saves the
saving<00:01:26.140> saves<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:27.039> settings<00:01:27.399> of<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.729> monitor

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
saving saves the settings of the monitor

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.260 
saving saves the settings of the monitor
as<00:01:28.599> it<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:28.929> it<00:01:29.319> then<00:01:29.979> imports<00:01:30.550> your<00:01:30.759> LUT<00:01:31.060> and

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
as it is it then imports your LUT and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.410 
as it is it then imports your LUT and
then<00:01:31.420> rewrites<00:01:31.989> the<00:01:32.590> original<00:01:33.130> settings<00:01:34.060> back

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
then rewrites the original settings back

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.690 
then rewrites the original settings back
into<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.959> monitor<00:01:35.910> there<00:01:36.910> is<00:01:37.209> a<00:01:38.700> accessory

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
into the monitor there is a accessory

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.400 
into the monitor there is a accessory
probe<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.450> can<00:01:40.599> purchase<00:01:40.810> for<00:01:41.229> this

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
probe that you can purchase for this

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.609 
probe that you can purchase for this
with<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.550> program<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.660> will<00:01:43.869> calibrate<00:01:44.470> the

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
with a program that will calibrate the

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.589 
with a program that will calibrate the
monitor<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.250> calibration<00:01:45.910> is<00:01:46.060> really<00:01:46.390> the

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
monitor and calibration is really the

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.139 
monitor and calibration is really the
critical<00:01:47.020> key<00:01:47.920> here<00:01:48.280> because<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.849> is

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
critical key here because that is

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.419 
critical key here because that is
setting<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:50.200> proper<00:01:50.709> levels<00:01:51.130> on<00:01:51.280> this

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
setting the proper levels on this

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.850 
setting the proper levels on this
monitor<00:01:51.759> so<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.660> when<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.050> set<00:01:53.319> your<00:01:53.349> look

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
monitor so that when you set your look

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.400 
monitor so that when you set your look
on<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.160> monitor<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.869> information<00:01:55.869> can<00:01:56.289> be

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
on the monitor that information can be

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.859 
on the monitor that information can be
accurately<00:01:57.039> sent<00:01:57.459> on<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.940> the

also have inputs for analog as well the
monitor<00:02:29.990> will<00:02:30.230> also<00:02:30.820> input<00:02:32.110> RGB<00:02:33.110> 444<00:02:34.100> so

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
monitor will also input RGB 444 so

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.550 
monitor will also input RGB 444 so

preferences but really the way that

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.630 
preferences but really the way that
you're<00:03:15.590> going<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.770> work<00:03:15.890> with<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.160> monitor

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
you're going to work with this monitor

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.090 
you're going to work with this monitor
is<00:03:16.760> through<00:03:17.630> here<00:03:17.959> there<00:03:18.140> are<00:03:18.260> five<00:03:18.560> function

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
is through here there are five function

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.360 
is through here there are five function
buttons<00:03:19.459> on<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.790> monitor<00:03:20.180> there<00:03:21.080> are<00:03:21.410> 16

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
buttons on the monitor there are 16

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.000 
buttons on the monitor there are 16
different<00:03:22.420> functions<00:03:23.420> per<00:03:23.990> program<00:03:24.350> button

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
different functions per program button

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.400 
different functions per program button
on<00:03:25.190> here<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:25.700> again<00:03:25.940> very<00:03:26.150> feature-rich<00:03:26.930> and

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
on here so again very feature-rich and

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.080 
on here so again very feature-rich and
allows<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:27.890> navigate<00:03:28.130> quickly<00:03:28.670> and

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
allows you to navigate quickly and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.150 
allows you to navigate quickly and
easily<00:03:29.300> through<00:03:30.170> all<00:03:30.350> your<00:03:30.530> different<00:03:30.920> ones

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
easily through all your different ones

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.759 
easily through all your different ones
so<00:03:31.310> for<00:03:31.670> instance<00:03:31.970> on<00:03:32.150> function<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.110> I've<00:03:33.410> set

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
so for instance on function one I've set

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.160 
so for instance on function one I've set
up<00:03:33.800> my<00:03:34.130> waveform<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:35.060> as<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:35.480> toggle<00:03:35.750> through<00:03:36.050> I

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
up my waveform and as I toggle through I

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.970 
up my waveform and as I toggle through I
have<00:03:36.470> waveform<00:03:37.010> vector<00:03:37.630> my<00:03:38.630> various<00:03:39.170> parades

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
have waveform vector my various parades

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.430 
have waveform vector my various parades
of<00:03:41.739> waveform<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.070> then<00:03:43.130> waveform<00:03:43.670> vector<00:03:44.440> and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
of waveform and then waveform vector and

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.340 
of waveform and then waveform vector and
then<00:03:45.680> more<00:03:46.130> choices<00:03:46.670> so<00:03:47.150> very<00:03:47.570> feature-rich<00:03:47.959> I

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
then more choices so very feature-rich I

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.140 
then more choices so very feature-rich I
can<00:03:48.530> get<00:03:48.680> just<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.100> luminance<00:03:49.550> value<00:03:49.910> on<00:03:50.030> the

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
can get just the luminance value on the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.979 
can get just the luminance value on the
bottom<00:03:50.480> here<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.560> then<00:03:52.489> I<00:03:52.880> can<00:03:53.390> go<00:03:53.720> through

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
bottom here and then I can go through

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.310 
bottom here and then I can go through
and<00:03:54.350> choose<00:03:54.830> my<00:03:55.070> different<00:03:55.459> aspect<00:03:55.940> ratios

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
and choose my different aspect ratios

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.790 
and choose my different aspect ratios
and<00:03:57.880> at<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.030> top<00:03:59.239> here<00:03:59.269> very<00:03:59.989> interesting<00:04:00.560> as

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
and at the top here very interesting as

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.460 
and at the top here very interesting as
I<00:04:00.920> mentioned<00:04:01.310> earlier<00:04:01.610> we<00:04:01.910> can<00:04:02.090> do<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.269> RGB<00:04:03.080> 4

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
I mentioned earlier we can do a RGB 4

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.250 
I mentioned earlier we can do a RGB 4
for<00:04:03.650> 4<00:04:03.860> signal<00:04:04.310> into<00:04:04.580> here<00:04:04.760> or<00:04:04.940> we<00:04:05.750> could<00:04:05.959> feed

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
for 4 signal into here or we could feed

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.220 
for 4 signal into here or we could feed
two<00:04:06.650> discrete<00:04:07.450> HGSE<00:04:08.450> eyes<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:08.930> that's<00:04:09.050> what

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
two discrete HGSE eyes and that's what

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.990 
two discrete HGSE eyes and that's what
I've<00:04:09.350> done<00:04:09.590> on<00:04:09.920> this<00:04:10.310> monitor<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:10.790> actually

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
I've done on this monitor I actually

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.140 
I've done on this monitor I actually
have<00:04:11.330> two<00:04:11.959> cameras<00:04:12.470> feeding<00:04:12.950> HD<00:04:13.370> SDI<00:04:13.640> into<00:04:14.030> the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
have two cameras feeding HD SDI into the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.780 
have two cameras feeding HD SDI into the
a<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.480> B<00:04:14.660> port<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.530> when<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.800> do<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.220> we

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
a and B port and when you do that we

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.310 
a and B port and when you do that we
have<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:16.970> picture<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.510> picture<00:04:17.660> button<00:04:18.109> right

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
have a picture and picture button right

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.099 
have a picture and picture button right
here<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.709> very<00:04:19.669> quickly<00:04:20.000> brings<00:04:20.750> us<00:04:20.900> up

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
here and very quickly brings us up

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.490 
here and very quickly brings us up
picture<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:23.330> B<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:23.930> I'm<00:04:24.110> actually<00:04:24.260> looking

picture a and B so I'm actually looking

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.380 
picture a and B so I'm actually looking
at<00:04:24.890> two<00:04:25.250> different<00:04:25.430> cameras<00:04:25.940> at<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.210> same

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
at two different cameras at the same

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.159 
at two different cameras at the same
time<00:04:26.690> here<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.560> very<00:04:28.190> handy<00:04:28.669> especially<00:04:29.169> for

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
time here so very handy especially for

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.350
